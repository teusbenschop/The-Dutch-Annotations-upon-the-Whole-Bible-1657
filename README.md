The Dutch Annotations upon the Whole Bible 1657. Also called the "Haak Bible".

The Dutch Annotations upon the Whole Bible have been typed for the benefit of the public.

Each book is available as one USFM file. 
It contains the electronic source text in USFM format, a format commonly used by Bible translators. 

Scans of the original pages, in PDF format, are available also. 

The documents are free. These are copyrighted (Â©) 2009-2021 by Teus Benschop. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify the documents under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.

Though "Dutch" is mentioned in the title, the texts really are in English, translated from Dutch.

The "Online Bible" now contains the files, and keeps improving them. For the best versions of the text, the Online Bible looks the better source.
