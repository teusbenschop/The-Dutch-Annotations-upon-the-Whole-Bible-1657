\mt1 CANTICLES
\mt3 OR
\mt2 The High Song of SALOMON
\c 1
\s In the Chapter is first described unto us the great, and earnest longing of the church after the grace and favour of Christ, vers.1, &c. Her outward contemptible countenance, but inward beauty, 5. Together with her danger among false brethren, 6. And her longing after Christ, 7. A consolation and instruction of Christ unto his church, 8. The great joy of the spouse because of the love of Christ unto her, 12. Christs delight in his church, 15. And the churchs love unto her bridegroom, 16.
\p
\v 1 . The High song, [Heb. The song of songs: that is, a very fair, and exceeding excellent song. See the annotate. Genesis 9.25.] which is Salomons. [Oth. Which concerneth Salomon. Understanding by Salomon Jesus Christ, of whom Salomon was a type, in his Royal dignity and glory, as also in his wisdom, and in his teaching and instruction of the people.]
\p
\v 2 . Let him [To wit, my bridegroom Jesus Christ. They are the words of the Spouse; that is, of the church of Jesus Christ] kiss me [That is, let him shew or manifest his love unto me. Oth. Oh that my bridegroom would kiss me! To kiss me one another was at all times held to be a token of love, friendship, and courtesy: in token whereof, men were also used to kiss one another, Exod.4.27. and 18.7. Rom.16.16. & Thes.5.16. Christ kisseth his spouse, that is, his Church, or chosen ones, when he manifesteth unto them, and causeth them to feel that great and wonderful love which he beareth unto them: We kiss Christ, when with an upright faith, hearty love, and child-like fear and reverence, we acknowledge him to be our Lord and Saviour, and do wholly submit our selves unto him, and obey him, Psal.2.12.] with the kisses [In the plural number, whereby is exprest the riches of the manifold graces and mercies, which Christ sheweth to his elect, Ephes.1.7,8,9, etc.] of his mouth, [Our Lord Jesus Christ revealeth unto believers the love with the beareth unto them, by his word. Therefore it is said, Psal.45.3. that his lips are very pleasant, or gracious. See below 5.15. and Isa.50.4. Peter saith likewise, Lord, thou hast the words of eternal life, Joh.6.68.] for thy excelling love [That is, kindness, loveliness. Heb. Loves. Now the spouse (that is, the church of God) speaketh here unto Christ her bridegroom. Understand here by the word loves, the transcedant love and affection, as also the benefits and favours which Christ sheweth unto his elect] is better then wine. [By the word wine, here is to be understood all earthly comforts and delights, Compare Jud.9.13. Psal.104.15. So below chap 4.10.]
\p
\v 3 . Thine oils are good for smell, [Understand by oils here, sweet-smelling oils, precious oitments, or balmes. Hereunto spiritual gifts or gives are often resembled, as Psal.45.8. Isai.61.1. and 1 Job 2.27.] thy Name [Understand the name, person, and the soul-saving office of Christ, as the same are revealed unto us in the Gospel] is an oil, that is poured forth: [Salomon seemeth here to have looked at the name Messias; that is, Christ, Anointed, who was anointed with the Holy Ghost, not onely for himself; but that holy Balsam flowed down from him, who is our head, upon us his members. See Psal.133.2. and Joh.1.16. This name after Christs ascension into heaven, is spread far abroad; for all Christians have their name from Christ] therefore do the virgins love thee. [That is, (as it is said, vers.4.) The upright love thee. The elect are more then once in Scripture compared unto Virgins, Matth.25.1. 2 Cor.11.2. Revel.14.1,4,5. And that in this respect, because the children of God must so narrowly heed and watch their consciences, left they be defiled with the sins of the world, as an honest maiden or virgin ought to look to her own honesty and chastity.]
\p
\v 4 . Draw me, we will run after thee: [Draw me; That is, incline mine heart and mind, that it may adhere-unto thee by faith and love. For this drawing is not done with outward strength and violence. But by the word of preaching outwardly, and inwardly by the powerful working of the Spirit of Christ, whereby the understanding of the children of God is so enlightened, and our will so reformed and amended, as that we willingly and joyfully follow; yea run after our blessed Lord and Bridegroom Jesus Chirst. See Isai.40.31. Jer.31.3. John 6.44,45. And 12.32. Phil.2.13. Heb.12.1,2.] the King [Understand by the King, Christ the King of righteousness, and of peace, Heb.7.2. of whom Melchizedek and Salomon were types] brought me into his inner chambers, [By these inner chambers are meant the mysteries of the Kingdom of Christ, which in the Old Testament were vailed and covered under the shadows of the Ceremonial Law: but now in the New Testament we behold the glory of the Lord as in a mirror, 2 Cor.3.18. See also Rom.16.25. and 1 Cor.2. vers.9.19,16. And 2 Cor.1.20. Heb.8.10,11. Or, understand by the inner chambers the Kingdom of Heaven, wherein are many mansions, Joh.14.2. which we already possess and enjoy by faith, Eph.2.6.] we [To wit, I and my maidens, or, companions, that is, all the faithful, or all believers] will rejoice, and he glad in thee; [O King: and in thee; that is, because of thee. As if she should say, the more we increase in the knowledge of thee, and in the taste of thy grace and mercy, the more we shall be confirmed and strengthened in spiritual joy. Compare 1 Pet.1.8.] we will mention thy excelling love, [that is, we will extoll and publish the grace of Christ, who hath called us out of darkness unto his marvelous light, 1 Pet.1.9. See also Psal.25.18. and 71.16. Jsa.12.3,4. And 63.7.] more then wine: [s if she should say, Lord, we will magnify and praise thy grace and favour with more joy and delight, then wordlings take in earthly things. For the peace of God passeth all understanding. See Psal.4.8.] the upright [Heb. The rightnesses, or, uprightnesse; that is, those that are endued with uprightness, who v.3. are called Virgins, namely those, in whom there is found no guile, Psal.32.2. Joh.1.47.] love thee.
\p
\v 5 . I am black, [Understand here by blackness, the outward deformity of the state and condition of the church, occasioned both by tyrannies and persecutions, also by reason of the heresies, schisms, and offences that do befall the same. See Psal.119.83. Lament.4.8. and 5.10.] but lovely, [the church of Christ is lovely, because she is cleansed and purified by the blood and spirit of Christ, 1 Cor.6.12. So that in that respect she shineth and is fair, as the doves, Psal.68.14. see likewise Psal.45.14,15, &c.] (the Daughters of Jerusalem) [That is, the faithful children of God. Jerusalem that is above, is the mother of us all, Gal.4.26. Thus are also particular Churchs, and Christians called here daughters of Jerusalem, and virgins, 2 Cor.11.2. Revel.14.4. and Psal.45.vers.13.14. the church is called the Kings Daughter. Such are here comforted and strengthened against the scandals of the cross, and the infirmities that do accompany the cross in this world] as the tents of Kedar, [Understand here by the tents of Kedar, the posterity of Kedar, the second son of Ismael, Genes.25.13. who dwelt in tents, having no settled habitation or dwelling-place; but they swerved to and fro throw-out Arabia, from one place to another. See the annotate. Psal.120. vers.5,6. The children of God are likewise according to the world and outward appearance, not beautiful, not comely, they likewise have here no abiding City, but look for the heavenly Jerusalem] as the curtains of Salomon. [As if she had said, I am (it is true) as the tents of Kedar, but likewise as beautiful as the curtains of Salomon: (of the beauty whereof see Josephus in antiq.lib.8.cap 2.) for the children of God are inwardly beautified and adorned with the gifts of the Holy Ghost, as are Godliness, the love of God, and of our neighbor. Oth. As the pavilions of Salomon, which outwardly (by reason of rain, wind, and the scorching of the Sun) were not very beautiful, but inwardly were exceeding fair and beautiful.]
\p
\v 6 . Look not upon me, that I am blackish, [The meaning is, look not upon mine outward baseness and deformity, despise me not for it, but look upon mine inward beauty] because the Sun hath shined upon me. [Heb. The Sun hath looked upon me. Understand here by the Sun, (which maketh them black, upon whom it shineth) persecutions and afflictions, as Matth.13.6,21.] My mothers children Isa.48.1,2. Acts 20.30. who indeed boast that the Church is their mother, but in vain, seeing they have not God for their Father. See Deut.32.5. Joh.8.44.] were incensed, [To wit, with anger] against me: [That is, they grieved and vexed me. The enmity and persecution of false brethren is (2 Cor. Chap.11.26.) counted among the most grievious afflictions and crosses, that do befall Christians. See Galat.2.4.] they have set me to be a keeper of the Vineyards: [By Vineyards in Scripture are oftentimes meant, the assemblies of men, both good and evil. Of the first, to wit, of the assembly of good men, see Psal.80. Isai.5.2,7. Matth.chap.20. Of the second, to wit, of the assembly of evil or wicked men, see examples, Deut.32.32. Revel.14.18. Some do understand here by the Vineyards, false Churchs in general, and hypocritical members in particular, whereunto her Mothers sons or children sought to bring her, willing that she should give heed to the traditions and commandments of men. See Mark 7.13. Acts 15.1,10. Galat.6.12,13. Coloss.2. vers.20,21,22,23. However the Church complaineth there, that she is oftentimes so far overpowered by false brethren, as that her own Rulers and Overseers do rather defend and protect the goats, then the true sheep: the heretics and schismatic rather then the Orthodox. Whence nothing, but great calamity and destruction of the Church can arise] my Vineyard which I have, have I not kept. [That is, I have not minded it, as I ought to have done, being hindered and kept back, either by reason of mine own infirmity, or by reason of tyranny, and persecution. Others take those words thus, as if the spouse, or (the Teachers of the primitive church) should say, I was appointed to have the oversight of other churches, I have left the primitive church which I had planted; and other churchs have been planted by me throughout all the World: The primitive Church that was planted at Jerusalem, I could not keep there, nor tarry with it, by reason of the persecution of Jews and other tyrants.]
\p
\v 7 . Tell me [Or, make me acquainted] (thou) whom my soul loveth, [So below, chap.3.1,2,3.] where thou feedest , where thou lodgest (thy flock) at noon: [Here the spouse speaketh again unto her Bridgegroom, and she requireth of him the Spirit of discerning, that she may not be deceaved or seduced by false Teachers, as followeth in the text. For there shall come false Prophets, who shall say, here is Christ, (or) there is Christ, Mark chap.13.vers.21. and sometimes God hideth his face, Deut.32.20. and saith, I will not feed thee, Zach.11.9. Christ is the supreme or chief shepherd of the sheep, Psal.23.1. that is promised, Ezech.34.vers.23,24. The Prophets, and Apostles; and all true Teachers or Ministers of the Word, are his Ambassadors and Messengers, whom he sendeth forth, to feed in his Name his sheep in the pastures of life, Joh.21.vers.15,16,17. The Church enquireth here most earnestly, where she may find rest and pasture at noon, that is, in the hottest time of persecution, of heresies, and schisms, when the sheep are ready to faint by reason of the heat of the cross. Compare Isa.49.10. Joh.16.33.] for why should I be as one that covereth herself among the flocks of thy companions? [That is, why shouldest thou suffer me to be as a woman, that is covered by reason of grief and heaviness, when I wander up and down in a sad and sorrowful way, for not being able to find thee? The covering of the face is a token, either of grief, or of shame. Therefore the spouse here desireth to know, where her bridegroom feedeth his sheep, that she might forthwith join herself unto them, or unto him, left wandering up and down, she might either be despised, or go astray. Oth. As one that turneth aside to the flocks of thy companions? As if she had said, If I should do this, (through want of thy gracious presence) I might come to be deceived, because there are many that bear the name of thy companions, ministers, or friends (Matth.24.5,24. And 2 Pet.21.2.) whereas indeed they are thine enemies, and seducers from thee, 2 Cor.11.3. This happened to the Galatians, Galat.1.6,7. All those that have not their abode in the inheritance of the Lord, they are in danger of falling to the worship and service of other Gods, 1 Sam.26.19.]
\p
\v 8 . If thou know it not, [Oth. Seeing thou knewest it not; to wit, where I do feed my sheep. This is an answer of our Saviour Christ, unto the fore-going question of his spouse, vers.7. reproving in a friendly and loving way her ignorance in this needful and weighty matter. Oth. If thou knowest it not for thee, or for thy self; as if he should say, Seeing thou art ignorant of thy self, therefore I will instruct thee] O thou fairest among women: [Heb. Thou fair among women; that is, thou that art the fairest. Thus the Angels speaketh unto the blessed Virgin Mary. Thou art blessed among women; that is, the most blessed of women, or, more blessed then other women, Luke chap.1.28,42. Thus the Lion is said to be strong among the beasts; that is, the strongest, Prov.30.38. See the annotat. There. The Church of God is called the fairest, because by the blood and spirit of Christ, she is washed and cleansed from all her sins, Eph.5.26,27. And endued with all manner of excellent spiritual virtues, although she be in her own self by nature deformed and contemptible, Ezech.16.3,4. See in this chapter vers.5,15,16. So also below chap.5.9. and 6.1. the same title is given to the Church] then go forth in the footsteps of the sheep, and feed thy kids by the shepherds dwellings. [As if he said, Give heed to the examples of the Holy Patriarchs, and others of mine elect, that are graced with honourable testimonies in Holy Scripture, Heb. Chap.11. Imitate their faith and their works. Follow them who from the beginning of the world have known and followed me, considering the issue of their walking and conversation, Heb.13.7. and 11.1,2, etc. and 12.2. See also Jerem.6.16. and 1 Cor.11.1. Understand by sheep, and kids, those Christians, that join themselves to the church of God, Jos.21.15,16. 1 Pet.2.2. These the Bridegroom will have the spouse (that is, the Church) to receive, and to take care, that they be fed and nourished with spiritual food. Feed thy kids by the shepherds dwellings. That is, bring thy flocks into the pasture and fold, which the Prophets and Apostles followed and shewed, and which they left unto the Church in their writings. See Psal.77.21. and Psal.78.vers.70 71,72. And 1 Pet.1.19. and 3.2.]
\p
\v 9 . My love, [See below chap.2. vers.2,10,13. And 4.1,7. And 5.2. and 6.4. Joh.15.vers.14.15.] I compare thee to the Horses in Pharaohs charets. [In divers places of Holy Scripture there is mention made of the goodly Horses, and the strength of the charets of Egypt, as Exod.14.17. 2 Chron.9.28. Isai.31. Ezech.17.15. The Church of Christ is compared unto these, both in respect of her beauty, and also in respect of her strength and power, which she hath received from Christ, to vanquish and subdue her enemies, 1 Cor.10.4. Among this Calvary, do shine forth by name the Holy Prophets and Apostles: Whence Elias is called the charets and Horsemen of Israel, 2 Kings 2.12. and likewise Elisa, 2 Kings 13.14. Because they were able to effect more by their prayers, then a great strength or power of charets and Horsemen. See Revel.19.vers.14,15.]
\p
\v 10 . Thy cheeks are lovely in the spangles, [The Hebrew word, which is found here, and vers.11. and by us rendered spangles, signifieth properly Turtle-doves, as Lev.chap.12. and elsewhere. But here it signifiethy a certain ornament belonging to women, being like unto Turtledoves, that are adorned about the neck with a kind of collar. So fair are the cheeks of the spouse of Christ, in as much as he hath washed and cleansed them with his blood, and adorned them with precious Pearls of spiritual gifts, especially with humility and meekness, which are precious in the sight of God, 1 Pet.3.4.] thy neck in here unto strings or chains of Pearl, because all the fruits of regeneration are fastened and linked together as with a string or chain: Prov.1.9. and 20.15.]
\p
\v 11 . We will make thee golden spangles, [This is spoken in the Name of the Holy Trinity; for they that keep the commandments of Christ, they are beloved of the Father and of the Son, Joh.14.21,23. And the Holy Ghost shall likewise abide with them for-ever, John 14.on vers.16.] with silver studs, [Or, knobs, or pimples, or small buttons. Understand hereby all manner of Christian vertues, whereof many are recited, Galat.5.22,23. And Coloss.3.12.]
\p
\v 12 . While the King is at his round table, [Or, as long as, &c. Here the spouse speaketh again to her maidens or virgins, commending her Bridegroom before them. By the King here is meant the LORD Christ, the King of all Kings, as above, vers.4. Round table. See 1 Sam.16.on vers.11. By the table here is meant the Heavenly glory, where into Christ entered by his suffering. See Matth.8.11. and 26.29. Luke 24.26. Rev.3.20.] my spikenard giveth its smell. [As if the spouse should say, while Jesus Christ is in Heavenly glory, compassed about by those that sit round about with him at his table, in his Kingdom: my spikenard is a very precious herb, the oil whereof they were wont to pour upon Princes and Great men, or excellent persons, as they sat at table. See Mark 14.3,8. Joh.12.3,7. Hereunto the Holy Ghost is compared, by reason of his sweet-smelling gifts, which were more abundantly poured 7.39. giveth its smell. That is, the Holy Ghost, whom he sendeth unto me from the father, comforteth me in all tribulation. Others take those words in this sense, as if the spouse said, I diligently apply my self to the doing of good works, which may be pleasing and acceptable unto the King: I employ the gifts, which I received of him, well; I hide them not, but let them give their smell, that is, bring forth goods works, that are acceptable unto God, and wherein the King taketh pleasure and delight.]
\p
\v 13 . My most-beloved is a bundle of myrrhe unto me, [That is, the memorial of Christs love, which he manifesteth unto me, in and by his bitter suffering, is unto me as a sweet and pleasant nosegay or posy of myrrhe, to cheer and comfort mine heart. Myrrhe is a very good and pleasant spice, drug, or gum, which was heretofore used to perfume the garments, or apparel of Princes, and other ways. See the annotate. Exod.30.on vers.23. and Psal.45.9. Being mingled with wine, it maketh a very pleasant drink, to comfort and strengthen the heart, and to purge the blood, as Pliny testifieth. It was also used in a mixture with other spices for the enblaming of dead bodies, Joh.19.39. In brief, it is a precious herbs, which deserveth to be presented unto Kings as a special gift, or present. See Genesis 37.25. and 43.11. and Matth.2.vers.11. Therefore no wonder, that the love of Christ is compared unto it] (which) overnighteth betwixt my breasts. [Hereby is intimated, that the church of God will continually keep and preserve the memorial or remembrance of her Bridegroom, especially as long as the dark night of persecutions & tribulations lasteth, comforting & strengthen strengthening her self therewith, Ephes.3.17.]
\p
\v 14 . My most beloved is unto me a cluster of Cyprus, [Cyprus is a certain plant which bringeth forth a sweet smelling fruit or gum, like unto a flourishing Vine-branch, as Hierome witnesseth. Some conceive that hereby is meant a natural cluster of grapes, called by the name of Cyprus, which herb grew in great abundance thereabouts, see the Herbals. However it be, thereby is understood an exceeding pleasant fruit, whereunto our Saviour Christ is compared, by reason of his sweet-smelling merits and soul-saving gifts. The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sins, 1 Joh.1.7. He is the propitiation for our sins, 1 Joh.2.2.] in the vineyards of Engedi. [see of this city the Annot.1 Sam.chap.24.on v.1.]
\p
\v 15 . Behold, thou art fair, my love, [The beauty, which the church of God hath, is of free grace, being obtained and purchased by the blood of Christ, and by his righteousness. See below, ch.4.1.] behold, thou art fair, [the iterating or doubling of the words serveth to strengthen and incourage the church of God the more against the persecutions of her enemies] thine eyes are doves (eyes.) [that is, single and chaste. See below, ch.4.1. hereby is signified, the spiritual purity, simplicity, and chastity of the church of Christ, whose eyes are onely fixed on him, and in him alone look for salvation and eternal life. See Psal.123.v.1,2. Matth.10.16. But some do understand here by eyes, the ministers and Elders, or Over-seers of the Church, and the instructors of those that are ignorant, who ought to have the most quick-sighted eyes in the Congregation. See also Job 29.15. Psal.32.8. Numb.10.on vers.31. below, Cant.4.1.]
\p
\v 16 . Behold, thou art fair, my most beloved, [Christ is fair or beautiful by nature, for he is the Lamb without spot or blemish, Exod.12. But the spouse is fair or beautiful by grace, by means of the merits and satisfaction of Christ, Joh.1.16.] yea, lovely, [that is, not surely, nor proud. He inviteth us in a most friendly and loving way, saying. Come unto me ye that are burthened and heavy laden, I will refresh you, Matth.11.28.] also our bed-stead is green. [that is, there are daily many spiritual children born in thy church, of the immortal or incorruptible seed of thy word, 1 Pet.1.23. Therefore the Church is called, the Mother of all believers, Galat.4.v.25.]
\p
\v 17 . The beams of our houses are Cedars, [The Church commendeth her habitation or dwelling, to invite and bring others to it. She calleth the assembly of Believers houses, in the plural number, because there are many particular Churches. By the beams is understood, the doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles, for thereby the Church is tied together, in Christ, as the foundation, Eph.2.20. These beams are of Cedars; that is, strong and incorruptible, for the word of God abideth forever, Isa.40.8. 1 Pet.1.25. Of the durableness or lastingness of Cedar-wood, see Judg.9.on v.15. Christ speaking of the durableness and continuance of his church, saith. The gates of hell shall not prevail against it, Matth.16.18.] our gallaries [or walking places, or tilings, as Gen.30.38,41.] are Cypresses. [This word is very pleasant, therefore Christ is rightly compared thereunto. Oth. Of Boritan, called in Latine, Bruta, which is a tree like unto the Cypress-tree, of a very pleasant smell, Plin.nat.Hist.lib.12.cap.17. The Hebrew word used here in the text, is found no where in Scripture, save onely here.]
\c 2
\s The excellency and dignity of Christ, vers.1. and of his church, 2. Christs care of his spouse, and the comfort which she receiveth from him, 3. An excitation unto public profession of Christ, in regard the winter of persecution is past, 11. An admonition to beware of the close and secret enemies of the Church, 15. Mutual love between the Bridegroom and the spouse, 16.]
\p
\v 1 . I am a Rose of Saron, a Lily of the Valleys. [Here the bridegroom speaketh again, as some conceive: But others are of opinion, that they are the words of the Spouse. The Rose is the choicest and cheereth the brain. By the Roses of Saron (that is, the Roses that grow at Saron) are meant, exceeding fair Roses; as by the Lilies of the valleys (that is, the Lilies that grow in the valleys) are meant, fair sweet-smelling Lilies. Salomon in all his Royalty was not so beautifully arrayed as one of these, Matth.6,29. But forasmuch as here is spoken of the Rose growing in the fields of Saron, and of the Lilies in the valleys, but not of such as grow in fenced or inclosed gardens: it semmeth that hereby is intimated, that the church of Christ is subject and liable to persecution, as the flowers off the field are subject to be plucked off by every one that passeth by, or to be trodden down and bitten off by the beasts and brute creatures. This seemeth to be the true and right meaning of the words, as appeareth by v.2. Saron was a fair, pleasant Country, reaching from Caesarea unto Joppa, not far distant from the Midland-sea. Thus is a certain City likewise called, that lieth there. See further of Saron, 1 Chron.5.16. and Isaiah 33.9. and 35.2. and 65.10. Acts 9.35.]
\p
\v 2 . As a lilie among thorns, [Wicked and ungodly men are in Scripture (and likewise, according to the opinion of many, in this place) called thorns, partly in respect of their barrenness in bringing forth good fruit, partly in respect of their pricking malice against the children of God, see Numb.33.55. Prov.22.5. Ezek.ch.28.v.24.] so is my love among the daughters. [By daughters are oftentimes meant in Scripture the assemblies of men; and that sometimes of good men, as the daughter of Zion; that is, the Church of God, Isa.36.22. Sometimes of evil and wicked men, as thedaughter of Babel, Psal.137.8. the daughter of Edom, Lament.4.21. The meaning of the verse is this; As far as the lily (being compared with the thorns) excelleth them kin beauty and glory: So far doth also my Love, or most beloved, exceed and surmount all other women, being compared with them. That is, the true church being compared with other meetings and assemblies, goeth far beyond them all in dignity and excellency.]
\p
\v 3 . As an apple-tree among the trees of the forest, [That is, the trees that grow in the wood, or in the wild forest. All men without Christ are wild unpruned trees, Rom.11.17,24. Which in that respect bear, either no fruit at all, or else evil, or harsh bitter fruit, or fruit of an unpleasant and unsavoury taste. Unless they be ingrassed into Christ by faith, they cannot bring forth good fruits, Mat. Chap.7.v.18. Job.15.4.] so is my best beloved among the sons: [to wit, the sons of Adam, or the sons of men. Or, among the sons; that is, among young men: All these Christ doth far exceed, Psal.45.3. The words of this verse are now again the words of the Spouse, Our Lord Jesus Christ is often in scripture compared to a tree, as Revel.2.7. and 22.v.2. Here he is compared to an apple-tree, As that (to wit, the apple-tree) doth far exceed all wild trees: so (saith the spouse here,) doth Christ, my best beloved, far exceed all other men, who are by nature like unto wild trees. And as the apple-tree with his broad and low branches giveth a goodly shadow and shelter against the scorching heat of the Sun, and beareth sweet and pleasant fruit, for the cheering and refreshing of man: so (saith the spouse) do I also find shadow, shelter, and refreshing under the do I also find shadow, shelter, and refreshing under the wings of his grace and mercy, both against the wrath of God, and also in the scorching heat of persecution; so that I always desire and indeavour to hide and shelter my self under them, as followeth, in the text] I have great delight in his shadow, and sit (down under) it; [to wit, under the shadow of the apple-tree, that is, under the defence and shelter thereof. As the trees by casting a shadow upon us, do free and protect us from the burning and scorching heat of the Sun: So doth Christ free and deliver us from the scorching heat of Gods wrath, and from the persecution of the wicked world, see Psal.121.v.5,6,7. Isa.25.4. See also Psal.91. the annotate. On v.1.] and his fruit is sweet to my palate. [this is yet another benefit, which the spouse enjoyeth by Christ: to wit, that she is not onely freed and delivered from evil, but also is made partaker of his pleasant fruits, as of his death, resurrection, ascension, and other benefits of his. Others understand here by fruits, the comforts and other understand here by fruits, the comforts and consolations of Christ, which are most sweet and pleasant unto the hearts of true believers.]
\p
\v 4 . He bringeth [Or, he brought] me into the wine house, [Heb. Into the house of wine; that is, into the house of joy and gladness, which we receive by the power and working of the Holy Ghost in our hearts, 2 Cor.1.5. Besides, that wine quencheth thirst, it maketh also the hearts mercy, Psal.104.15. and causeth it to forget its sorrow, see Prov.31.6,7. To this house of joy are all Gods children invited, Prov.1.3. see likewise, Prov.1.3. see likewise, Prov.9.1. &c.] and the love [understand here by love, the love wherewith Christ loveth us, Eph.5.2. Therefore some do read the last words of this verse thus, his banner is love over me, or towards me, see 2 Thess.2.16. and Rom.5.5.] is his banner over me. [as soldiers are distinguished one from another by banners or colours: so the true members of the church of Christ are discerned and distinguished from hypocrites and formal professors, by the spirit of adoption, and his fruits, Rom.8.14. 1 John 3.24. The banner signifieth also defence and protection against all spiritual enemies, the devil, death, and damnation.]
\p
\v 5 . Support ye me with flagons, [That is, with the wine that is in the flaggons, as Luke 22.10. and Hos.3.1. that is, with the holy Scriptures, wherein Christ hath shut up his wine and milk, that is, all his promises and spiritual comforts, see Psal.94.19. and 119.92.] strengthen me with apples: [or, strew apples under me; to wit, that by the smell thereof I may be comforted and refreshed; for which end purpose Oranges and Limons especially are very useful and requisite. By these are unconcerning the grace and merits of Christ. The church here speaketh unto the friends of the Bridegroom, which are the true Teachers or Ministers of the Gospel, John 3.29. intreating them to strengthen her with the comforts of the Gospel, before she languish and fail for longing after Christ] for I am sick of love. [That is, I am faint, and do languish through continual longing after the comforts and consolations of my Bridegroom, and the tokens of his grace and favour, see Psal.42.2. and 63.vers.2. and below, ch.3.1,2. And 5.v.6,8. It is God that healeth all our diseases, Ps.103.3.]
\p
\v 6 . Let his left hand be under mine head, [To wit, as a pillow to rest upon. By reason of sin the whole head is sick, and the heart is faint, Isa.1.5. But by the consolations of the Holy Ghost our consciences are strengthened, and our sins (the causes of our sorrows) pardoned see Rom.14.v.17. and 1 John 2.12. and 3.24.] and let his right hand imbrace me. [this is an outward token of love, see Gen.29.13. and 48.10. The church desireth and expecteth the gracious and favourable help and assistance, which the bridegroom was to afford her in time of trouble, comforting her by the Holy Ghost, and by his word, see below, ch.8.3. Eph.5.29.]
\p
\v 7 . I adjure you, ye daughters of Jerusalem, [Some take these to be the words of the Bridegroom, others to be the words of the spouse. The meaning is, I exhort and charge you in the highest manner or degree, ye daughters of Jerusalem; that is, O ye my companions or friends, see chap.3.5. and 8.4.] (which are by the Roes or by the Hinds of the field) [Hinds are the females of the hearts] that ye star not up that love, nor waken (it,) until it please the same. [that is, that ye never disturb the rest and peace thereof. Others, I adjure you, by the Roes, etc. that is, as dear as the Roes and the Hinds are unto you, that ye stir not up that love; that is, that ye disturb not the rest of the Bridegroom, or of the Spouse, that is, the peace of the Church: to wit, by heresy, schism, or by giving offence.]
\p
\v 8 . (That) [To wit, the voice which I hear] is the voice of my best beloved, [the spouse speaketh thus. As if she should say, that is instruction which I hear, see John 18.37. and 10.v.3,4. Acts 13.46,47. Heb.3.7.] behold him, he cometh, [to wit, to mine help and assistance, as Isa.35.4. John 14.23. Rev.22.20.] leaping upon the Mountains, skipping upon the hills. [A similitude borrowed from swift Roes and Hinds, whereunto the Bridegroom is compared, verse 9. To shew the willingness and readiness of Christ to help and deliver his spouse.]
\p
\v 9 . My best beloved is like a Roe or a whelp of the Harts: behold, he standeth behind our wall, [Understand here the fiery wall of the Church, or the wall of fire round about the church: that is, the preservation and protection, which God affordeth unto his Church by his holy Angels, see 2 Kings 6.17. Psal.34.8. Zach.2.5. When it is said here, our wall, thereby is intimated, that this wall is a Bulwark, which is proper to the Church, and belongeth to her alone. Others understand these words, he standeth behind our wall, thus; that they signify a nearer union and fellowship with Christ, then when he was yet afar off, coming skipping and leaping upon the mountains and upon the hills, v.9. but yet not so neer, but there was yet a wall between both. So that here is shewed the steps or degrees, whereby Christ manifesteth his love unto his Church, not equally all at once, but according as he knows it to be good for us] looking out of the windows, [this is a similitude borrowed from a watch man or centinel, that keepeth watch or guard upon a tower, see 2 Kings 9.17. Ezek.chap.33.v.2. The Lord Christ is the true watchman and keeper of Israel, who never sleepeth nor slumbereth, Psal.121.v.4. he seeth and derideth all the counsels and devices of the wicked against his church, Psal.2.4.] shining [or shining like a flower; that is, shewing himself like a flower, to wit, pleasant and gracious. It is the very same that is straightway said, the repetition serveth to strengthen and confirm the thing before-mentioned] through the lattess. [Oftentimes lattesses and windows are joined together, as Judges 5.27. Proverbs 7.6. and elsewhere.]
\p
\v 10 . My best beloved answered and said unto me, rise up, my Love, my fait one, and come away [Heb. And come to thee, or for thee, or for thy self, so likewise verse 13. See Genes.12. the annotate. On vers.1. And, come hither, to wit, to minister unto me. By these words the spouse doth intimate the cause of the speedy or swift coming of her Bridegroom; to wit, to call her by his word and spirit out of her and miserable condition unto a better.]
\p
\v 11 . For lo, the winter is past: [That is, the time of the churches oppression, Zach.14.8.] the great shower of rain is over, [that is, the time of trial in adversity, is lightened or eased by Christ, see Isa.4.6. & 32.2. Matth.7.27.] it is gone over. [or, it is gone away.]
\p
\v 12 . The flowers are seen [Or, do appear, shew themselves] in the earth, [In these, and the following words is contained a description of the Spring: being spiritually understood, it signifieth the restauration of the Church, after the troubles were past and gone. See Psal.72.16. Isa.27.6. Hos.14. vers.4.5,6.] the singing-time [Or, the time of singing, or, the time of chirping, or, chattering] approacheth, [That is, the spring, or, May-time is come, when the birds use to sing, and to make a sweet and pleasant harmony. That is, the faithful begin to cheer up, and to sing for joy. Oth. The pruning-time] and the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our Land.
\p
\v 13 . The fig-tree bringeth forth her young figs, [Or, unripe figs. The Hebrew word that is used here, is found onely in this place, no where else] and the vines [By the vines, are meant here the particular churches, as Isai.5.1. Hos.9.10.] (with their) young grapes [Or, tender, small, green, unripe grapes. The Hebrew word is used onely here, and below vers.15. and chap.7.v.12.] give a smell: [To wit, an excellent smell, as below 7.13. The meaning is, that men that were before like dry and withered trees, begin now in a spiritual manner to budded and flourish through my grape: The Churches which formerly lay waste and desolate, begin in now to bring forth fair and goodly fruits by the powerful working of my Word and Spirit, and cast forth a sweet and pleasant savour, 2 Cor.2.15. See the parable of the fig-tree, Matth.24.v.32. Luke 13.6.] Arise, my Love, my fair one, and come (away). [As above v.10.]
\p
\v 14 . My Dove [So the Church of Christ is called by reason of her chastity, and simplicity, or innocency. See Matth.10.16. and above chap.1.15.] being in the clefts of the rocks, [Hiding thy self there, for fear of the enemies. See Jerem.48.vers.28. Oth. That abides in the clefts, or, rents of the rocks, being ashamed because of the deformity of thy sins] in the secret (holes) of a steep place [That is, that hidest thy self in places unhabited, in dens and caves, by reason of persecution; as 1 Kings 18.4. Psal.55.7,8. And 68.14. Revel.12.6. Some render the words secret stairs, applying it to our Saviour Christ, who is the stairs and the ladders that reacheth up unto heaven, Genes.28. Joh.1.52.] shew me thy shape [That is, come unto me, walk uprightly before me: as Genes.17.1. Rom.12.1. Ephes.5.27. to wit, after thou shalt be washed and cleansed by my Spirit and blood] cause me to hear thy voice: [That is, thy prayers, and songs of praise. See Psal.5.4. and 28.2. and 42.5. and 50.15. and elsewhere.] for thy voice is sweet, [That is, it is acceptable unto me; to wit, when it springeth from a true and lively faith.] and thy shape is pleasant.
\p
\v 15 . Take ye us Foxs, and the little Foxs, which destroy the vineyards: for our vineyards (have) young [Or, small, tender] grapes. [These are the Bridegrooms words unto his companions; that is, the words of Christ unto Teachers and Pastors, or Shepherds of the Church: and to the Christian Magistrates. And taking, or catching signifieth here, that the Teachers or Ministers of the Word, ought to withstand, and confute the subtil and wicked Doctrine of the Foxs: and that Magistrates ought to restrain it, and not suffer it to be broached or published within their Juridictions and Domonions. The Foxes spoil or destroy the vineyards by eatings off the grapes from the vines: So false Teachers, Hereticks, and deceitful Rulers spoil and ruine the true Religion and Church of God. They are compared unto Foxes here, and Ezech.13.4. Luke 13.32. partly in regard of their deceitfulness, 2 Cor.11.13. and partly in regard of their mischievousness; for their word fretteth (or consumeth) like a canker, 2 Tim.2.17. See the like descriptions, and warnings, Jerem.12.10. Eph.4.14. Tit.1.v.10,11. Heb.13.9. 2 Pet.2.1,12.]
\p
\v 16 . My best beloved is mine, and I am his, he feedeth among the lilies: [These are the words of the spouse, as Cant.6.2. and 7.10. The meaning is, he is my shepherd, and I am the flock of his sheep, therefore I cannot want, Psal.23.1. 1 Joh.4.13.] he feedeth among the lilies: [The meaning is, he feedeth his flock not only in a wholesome, but also in a delight some pasture; yea so pasture; yea so pleasant, and delightsome, as if it were full of lilies. Understanding hereby, the pasture of the word of God, which is sweet, like honey and the honey-comb: And in the company of the Godly, which are like lilies among the thorns.]
\p
\v 17 . Until that day [That is, the time of knowledge, holiness, comfort, peace, and spiritual joy. See Rom.13.vers.12.13. and 1 Thes.5.5. 2 Pet.1.19.] dawn, [Heb. Blow on. Thus do the Hebrews speak, because the day commonly riseth with some cold, or cool gale] and the shadows [That is, all that is yet imperfect] flee (away): turn about, my best beloved, [To wit, unto me. These, and the rest that follow, are the words of the Spouse unto her bridegroom, beseeching and intreating him, that he would assist her in her trouble and afflictions] be thou like a roe. [To wit, in swiftness, to help and assist me. See vers.8.] or a whelp of the harts upon the Mountains of Bether. [Or, of Bitron, or, of separation. These are the Mountains of Gilead, which by the Jordan are divided or separated from Judea. These mountains were full of wild beasts, and very commodities for hunting. See the annotate. 2 Sam.2.29.]
\c 3
\s The spouse relateth, how diligently she had sought her bridegroom, but in vain, vers.1.2,3, &c. At length she findeth him, and taketh fast hold on him, 4. He will not suffer his spouse to be awaked, 5. The spouses ornaments, after she was come out of affliction, 6. The Bridegrooms bed or bed-stead, under the figure of Salomons bed and bed-stead, 7. The faithful are invited, under Rhetorical and flourishing terms or words of Salomons marriage with his spouse, to the Kingdom of Glory, 11.
\p
\v 1 By night on my bed I sought him, whom my soul loveth: [Heb. In the nights. Hereby is intimated the great temptations and trials of the church, as Isa.21.12. and 26.9. Amos 5.18. And likewise here is shewed, that the church in time of temptation and persecution, when she seemeth to be left and forsaken, seeketh Christ by prayer. See Deut.4.29. Jerem.50.4. Hos.3.5. and 5.15. Zeph.2.3. Matth.7.7. Him, whom my soul loveth; To wit, my Bridegroom Jesus Christ, his grace, and mercy; who is found of us, when we feel and apprehend his grace and favour in our hearts to our comfort] I sought him, but I found him not, [This is no ways repugnant to the promise of Christ, Matth.7.7. For that sieth no precise punctual time of finding; for that is onely in the hand of God, he alone knoweth the fit and seasonable time of help, Heb.4.16. Below vers.4. it is said of the spouse, that after a little while, she found her beloved] (I said)
\p
\v 2 . I will arise now, and go about in the city, [That is, in the church of God, Psal.87.vers.3. or in the spiritual Jerusalem, See Heb.12.22.] in the passages, [Or, markets, broad places. See Luke 14.21,22,23.] and in the streets, I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.
\p
\v 3 . The watchmen [Understand here under the name of watchmen, such kind of Teachers or Ministers, as were those, of whom the Prophet Isaiah speaketh chap.56.vers.10. They are (saith he) dumb Dogs, they cannot bark. Orby watchman may here be understood the great and wise men of the World, who if they should be asked where Christ is to be asked where Christ is to be found, are not able to tell where. See Matth.2.vers.3,4. Compare below vers.5.v.7.] that went about in the City, found me; (I said,) Saw ye him, whom my soul loveth? [The meaning is, cannot ye direct me to my friend, or Bridegroom?]
\p
\v 4 . When I had passed a little from them, [To wit, a little while, or a little way] I found him without my soul loveth while, or a little way] I found him whom my soul loveth: [Heb. A little that I had passed from them, till I found him whom my soul loveth. Here is fulfilled the promise of our Saviour Christ, Matth.7.7. Seek, and thou shalt find, etc.] I held him fast, and did not let him go: [To wit, I held him fast, etc. with the hand of faith. See Prov.4.13. Eph.3.18. Colos.1.23. See also Genes.32.26.] until I had brought him into my mothers house, and into the innermost chamber of her, that bare me. [Or, that conceived me. The church here intimateth, that she having recovered and gotten again a sense and feeling of the grace and mercy of Christ, will constantly persist or persevere in fellowship and communion with him.]
\p
\v 5 . I adjure you, ye Daughters of Jerusalem, which are by the roes, or by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up that love, nor waken (it) until it please (her.) [This whole verse is expounded above chap.2.vers.7. See also below chap.8.4.]
\p
\v 6 . Who is she, that cometh up out of the wilderness, like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrhe, and frankincense, (and) all manner of powder of the Grocer! [This is an admiration or wondering of weak believers, speaking of the church, as of the people of Israel, that went up out of the boldness or courage, and glory of the church, after she had by struggling and wrestling got away from under sore troubles and persecutions, whereof mention is made above chap.2. and also in the beginning of this Chapter. By the wilderness is here meant, the desolation or wasting of the outward form and beauty of the Church, as well by tyranny, as by heresy, schism, and great and grievous scandals. As the word wilderness, is likewise taken, Isa. Chap.32.vers.15. and Revel.12.6. like pillars of smoak: That is, like a mighty smoak, that goeth straight, like a pillar, or Palm-tree, which signification the Hebrew word also hath. This signifieth the courage and boldness of the Church in the exercise of true Religion, without intermitting or omitting the same through fear of wicked men, or for other respects, Heb.12.1. By Myrrhe, and Frankincense are to be understood the merits of Christ, which are a sweet-smelling savour unto God the Father, Eph.5.2. Revel.8.v.3,4,5. By the powder here mentioned, may be understood the fruits of regeneration, as also, and especially, the prayers and thanks givings of believers, Malach.1.11. Of the Grocer: Or, of the Drugster. Oth. Of the Apothecary, of the persumer.]
\p
\v 7 . Behold, the bed which Salomon hath, [Oth. His bed is as the bed of Salomon] therefore champions are about it, of the champions of Israel; [What courageous valiant champions there were in Israel, see 1 Chron.11.vers.1,2,3. To vers.38. The words contained in this verse, seem to be the words of the spouse. By Salomons bed, and the strong guard that was about it, is typified, that the church of God is kept and preserved by Christ; but yet far better, and in a more transcendent way, then King Salomon was kept and guarded by guard: For the Angels of God, those ministering spirits, are sent forth by Christ, to guard and protect them. See Heb.1.14. The faithful children of God being thus guarded and protected, are not afraid of the terrors of the night, nor of the arrow that flieth by day, Psal.91.5. Hereby may also be understood the Pastors and Teachers, who must watch over, and keep the church of God]
\p
\v 8 . They all hold swords, [So likewise are the Holy Angels armed, with Gods righteous vengeance, as with swords to defend the good, and to punish the wicked, 1 Chron.chap.21.vers.16. All faithful shepherds and Ministers of the Church, are armed with word of God, and with Christian Discipline, having vengeance in readiness against all disobedience, 2 Corinth.ch.10.6. Psal.149.7. Albeit otherwise also, all Christians are (or at least ought to be) armed with the sword of the spirit, Ephes.6.17.] taught to war, [to wit, by God, who teacheth the hands of his people to fight, 2 Sam.22.35. and given his angels and ministers power to watch over the church, and to keep and defend it. Oth. Expert, trained, exercised in war] each having his sword at his thigh, [To wit, standing ready and prepared to fight, as Ex.32.27.] because of the terror of the night. [In the night time a man is subject to more danger, then in the day time, whether it be danger of robbery, or of murder, or of treachery, or of the like mischief; which are usually practiced in the night-time, so that a man ought at that time and season, to keep a strong watch and guard Matth.24.43,44. So every Christian Soldier ought to stand ready-armed, as the Apostle reacheth us, Ephes.6.vers.12,13,14. Especially in the time of persecution.]
\p
\v 9 . King Salomon made himself a chariot [The Hebrew word signifieth properly a bride-bed, or, bed-stead. But it signifieth also a coach, or, Chariot. It seemeth that here is spoken of that triumph-chariot, of which we read, Ps.45.5. where by the chariots is meant the word of truth, or the preaching of the Gospel. Others understand by the Hebrew word here used, a sumptuous or glorious building, as a palace, or the like] of the wood of Libanon. [That is, of Cedar-wood, which was wont to grow in great abundance on mount Libanon. See the annotate. Judg.9.on vers.15. This word putrifieth not: so that the Doctrine of the Gospel may be fitly compared unto it: For it is an everlasting Gospel, Revel.14.6. See above chap.1,27.]
\p
\v 10 . He made the pillars therefore (of) silver, [By pillars is signified in Scripture, constancy, or perseverance, as Revel.3.12. and by pillars of silver, may here be understood, the faithful Pastors or Ministers of the Church, but especially the Prophets and Apostles. See Gal.2.9.] the pavement [Or, bottom, ground, stay. Oth. Seat; to wit, whereon Salomon fat in his charet] of gold. [Christ, who is the ground-work, or foundation of his church, is rightly compared unto gold, but the pillars unto silver. See 1 Cor.3.9. Revel.21.21.] the roof (or top) of it (of) purple: [Understand by this roof, Gods royal defence or protection of his church] the inmost (part thereof) as be spread with the love of the Daughters of Jerusalem. [Or, paved, floored, beset with pleasantness, or, paved with love; that is, pleasantly wrought; to wit, embroidered with pleasant images, or fair pictures, or curiously wrought with the needle by the Daughters of Jerusalem. Oth. Kindled. According to the spiritual application, here by love may be understood, that inward or intimate love that God beareth unto his children, giving his sons for the life of them, as likewise that love, which we bear unto God, and to our neighbor: for we cannot love God, unless he do first manifest his love unto us, 1 John 4.10. Some understand the 9th.& 10.verses to be a description of the heavenly glory]
\p
\v 11 . Go forth, ye Daughters of Zion, and behold King Salomon with the Crown, wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his marriage, and in the day of the gladness of his heart. [The Daughters of Zion signify here Christians, or the Church of Christ, as Isa.49.14,22. These are here exhorted to behold and receive Christ (the true Salomon) with his Crown; that is, in glory, and honour. See Psal.149.2. Matth.21.5. Revel.6.1,3,5,7. (wherewith his mother crowned him, &c.) It seemeth by those words that Bathseba honoured her son with a very fair and beautiful crown upon his wedding-day: and by this Crown is typified and represented the glory and dignity, whereunto Christ was advanced by his ascension, and which he shall cause his church to behold in Heaven. See Luke 24.26. John 17.24. Phil.2.9. (In the day of his marriage) Oth. In the day of his espousals: to wit, when Salomon married with his spouse. In a spiritual sense may here be understood Christs marriage with his Church, with is done when she receiveth and embraceth the preaching of the Gospel with a true and lively faith, then, or that time, she is said to be espoused or married to Christ, 2 Cor.11.2. (In the day of the joy, or, gladness of his heart.) As a Bridegroom rejoyeth in his Bride, so doth God rejoice in his people. See Isai.62.1,5. In this verse under the name and glory of Salomon, that was a Type of Christ; there is described the glory, which all the children of God are to behold at the wedding of the Lamb, prepared for all the children of God. When we are exhorted to go forth; thereby is made known, that it is well worth the pain to be at some labour for it, as we see people do, to come forth and behold a King riding in triumph.]
\c 4
\s The Bridegroom commendeth the spouse for her beauty, v.1, &c. He telleth her, that he will be absent from her for a while, 6. He calleth her, to come down unto him, 8. Testifying his love unto her, 9. And commending her yet further, 10. The spouse beseecheth her bridegroom to come speedily unto her, and to work powerfully and effectually in her by his Holy Spirit, to the end that she may bring forth fruits that may be pleasing and acceptable unto him, 15.
\p
\v 1 . Behold, thou art fair, my Love, [The Spouse of Christ is called fair, or beautiful, not onely as she is behold and considered in Christ, but also as she is transformed and changed into the image of Christ, from glory to glory, as by the spirit of the Lord, 2 Cor.3.18. See above chap.1.on vers.15.] behold, thou art fair, [see above chap.1.on vers.15.] thine eyes are doves (eyes,) [see the annotate.chap.1.15.] between thy locks: [Or, between thy hair-dressing, as below vers.3. Oth. Thine hair-bindings] thine hair is as a flock of goats, that shear off (the grass) of mount Gilead. [That is, it is fair, smooth, and like unto the hair of the goats, that feed upon mount Gilead, or go somewhere in a goodly fat ground or meadow, and thereby grow fat, and get thin soft hair. That is, thou art adorned with good works. (that shear off, &c.) The Hebrew word is onely found here, and below chap.6.5. It signifieth to shear off, or to make bald; that is, to eat off. Oth. That shine from mount Gilead. This Country of Gilead was very commodious to feed cattle in, by reason of its fatness, as appeareth by Genes.31.21. Numb.32.1. Jerem.22.vers.6.]
\p
\v 2 . Thy teeth are like a flock of (sheep,) [To wit, thy spiritual teeth; whereby thou art to chew the cud, or to ruminate the spiritual food of the soul, have all the beauty and ornament, that may be required in teeth, and consequently are fit and apt to chew and ruminate the spiritual food] that are shorn, [Or, are cut off, or which are make alike or equal to one another, so that the one is not greater then the other; otherwise it would be unseenily, and be an impediment in the chewing of the spiritual food] which come up from the washing-place; [Or, which come up from the washing, and consequently are clean, and white] they all bring forth twins, and none is without young [Or, barren] among them.
\p
\v 3 . They lips are like a thread of scarlet, [The lips are the instruments of uttering or producing words: And here they signify the Ministers of the word, and their sweet and pleasant Doctrines, which is further intimated by the words following (and thy speech is pleasant, or, comely.) (like a scarlet-lace) That is, red, which is a commendable thing in the lips. It signifieth that their Doctrine is pleasant and delightful to the hearers, or members of the Congregation] and thy speech is pleasant: [compare Psal.147.1. Col.4.5.] thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate [Wherein little red kernels or gains are seen & discerned. Under the word temples may be likewise understood and comprehended the red blushing cheeks being a part of the beauty of the face. But here it signifieth bashfulness and modesty in the members of the church, taking narrow heed of doing, or speaking anything, whereat they may have cause to blush] between thy locks. [as above v.1.]
\p
\v 4 . Thy neck is like the tower of David, which is built for the hanging up of armor, [That is, thy neck is bolt up right, high and strong, and hung about with ornaments, as that fair tower, which David built. See Neh.3. vers.19. and 25. And Mich.4.8. But others understand this of Davids strong-hold, 2 Sam.5.7,9. This signifieth the courage, boldness, and sure hope or confidence of the Church of Christ, who being united unto Christ her head, boweth her neck no more, to serve the Devil, or sin, Rom.6.17,18. Or men, 1 Cor.7.23. But by the weapons of her warfare (which are not carnal, but mighty through God, to cast down strong holds, 2 Cor.10.4.) she standeth fast in the evil day, being armed, as it is written, Ephes.6.11, etc. (Built for the hanging up of armory, or arms:) Or, for an armors, or, magazine for all manner of armor, or, arms. The Hebrew word is onely found in this place. And it seemeth, that here such weapons are meant or understood, which serve to hurt or wound the enemy with, as by the bucklers and shields (mentioned in the following words) are meant such kind of weapons or arms, whereby a man defendeth himself, and keepeth off the blows,] whereon (there) hang a thousand bucklers, [The number of thousand is used here and elsewhere for a great number] all being the shields of Champions. [Of Davids Champions, and their valiant acts, see 2 Sam.23.8. to the end, and 1 Chron.11.10. to vers.47. whose shields being hung up in the tower of David for perpetual memory, signify here all those, who by the shield of faith have done many great and valiant acts, whereof the Apostle relateth some, Heb.11.]
\p
\v 5 . Thy two breasts, [Understand here by the two breasts, the Doctrines and comforts, which are to be found in the Old and New Testament, wherewith the faithful are fed and nourished. See Isai.66.11. and 1 Pet.2.2. Others understand by the spouses two breasts, the administration of the word of God, and of the Holy Sacraments, wherewith the sheep and lambs of Christ, are fed and nourished as upon a good and fast pasture] are like two whelps, twins of a roe, [That is, both of them are fair, full, firm, and uniform; So are the old and New Testament every way like each other, the one according and agreeing with the other in all things] which feed among the lilies. [To wit, in fat and wholesome doctrine of the church. See below 5.13.]
\p
\v 6 . Until that day break, and the shadows fly (away,) I will go to the mountain of myrrhe, and to the hill of frankincense. [The Bridegroom answereth here the scruple which his spouse might object, saying, Lord Jesus Christ, am I so fair and beautiful in thine eye? Why then stayest thou so long from consummating and solemnizingthe marriage betwixt us? Hereunto the Bridegroom maketh answers, Thou must wait the time that is appointed and decreed for it; to wit, the time of the restauration or restitution of all things, Acts 3.21. That is, until the evening or end of the world come: then will I take up unto me; in the mean while I will go to mountain of myrrhe, and to the hill of frankincense; that is, I will ascend into heaven, whither the faithful do daily offer up and send up their prayers, which are like unto sweet-smelling myrrhe and frankincense, below, chap.5.13. I being and remaining there thine advocate with mine heavenly father.]
\p
\v 7 . Thou art all fair, my Love, [Above, v.1. and chap.1.15. the spouse is called fair; here she is called fair; here she is called all fair: in regard she is all fair and perfect in Christ, Eph.5.v.25,26,27. Col.1.22. and 2.10. Rev.14.5.] and there is no blemish in thee. [see of the word, blemish, Proverbs 9.on v.7.]
\p
\v 8 . With me from Libanon, O Spouse, come with me from Libanon: look from the top [Or, point. Hebr. The head] of Amana, from the top of Senir and Hermon, from the dwellings of the Lionesses, [Or, of the Lions] from the mountains of the Leopards. [Christ speaketh this unto his Spouse, of whom he said immediately before, that she was all fair, or altogether fair. The meaning is, Come to me into heaven, which thou now seest and beholdest by faith, as if thou sweat and beheldest the land of Canaan, from the top of the mountains round about that are here named, which are yet under the possession and dominion of tyrants, who are here to be understood by the Lions and the Leopards, see Psal.57.4. Some understand here by these mountains lying at or nigh divers corners of the land of Juda, not onely the calling and conversion of the Jews, but also of the Gentiles scattered in the four corners of the world. (O spouse!) Thus the church is called here, and in the sequel, in respect of her spiritual marriage with Christ, her Bridegroom, which shall be consummated and solemnized on the Marriage-day in Heaven, see Rev.21.2. and 19.7. John 3.29. 2 Cor.11.2. Eph.2.25. Libanon or Libanus was indeed a pleasant place, Deut.3.25. But being compared with other fruitful places, it was a kind of wilderness, Jerem.29.17. and like a haunt of wild beasts or hunting-place, 2 Kings 14.9. Whereunto respect is had in this place. Yet in other places of Scripture Libanus signifieth excellent and delightful things, in respect of the abundance of the fair trees that grew on it, as below, chap.5.9. and 5.15. Amana is a mountain in Syria, where there was a valley and also a River, that bare the same name, otherwise called Abana, 2 Kings 5.12. Strabo, lib.14. saith, that this mountain was possessed by divers tyrants. Of the mountains Senir and Hermon, see Deut.3.v.9. Senir is to be taken here for apart of mount Hermon. Hermon is a famous mountain, of which we may read, Psal.42.7. and 89.13. It is otherwise called Sion, with an S, Deut.4.48. (From the dwellings of the Lionesses, from the mountains of the Leopards.) Some understand withal, being delivered and freed, thou shalt see the danger wherein thou wast: And on the other side, thou shalt see the blessed state and condition where into thou art brought. Or some such like thing, see 1 Cor.6.v.9,10,11.]
\p
\v 9 . Thou hast taken the heart from me, [Or, thou hast taken mine heart: or, hast ravished, or wounded mine heart; to wit, by love, see Isa.62.5. The Hebrew word signifieth, Thou hast hearted, or unhearted me. The meaning is, thou hast gained my love and favour, notwithstanding thy manifold sins and infirmities] my Sister, [thus the church is called, in regard that Christ is the brother of us all, having taken our nature (that is, our flesh and blood) upon him, and by faith made us children of God, and joint-heirs with him. See Matth.12.50. John 1.13. Rom.8.16,17. Heb.2.11.] O spouse; thou hast taken the heart from me, [and therefore thou mayest rest satisfied and contented, being fully assured, that I will never leave nor forsaken thee] with one of thine eyes, [that is, thou gainest the heart from me, by true faith, whereby thou beholdest and imbracest me, as thy loving Bridegroom. Without faith we cannot any wise please God, Heb.11.6.] with one chain of thy neck. [to wit, hanging about thy neck; that is, with the ornament of thy works proceeding from true faith, see Prov.1.9. This chain we have not of our selves, but by the grace of God, as appeareth above, chap.1.11. God crowneth his own gifts in us.]
\p
\v 10 . How fair is thy surpassing love, [That is, how delightful and acceptable is it unto me, to discern thy love towards me? See above, chap.1.vers.2. This love consisteth in the keeping of Christs commandments, 1 John 2.v.3 4,5.] my sister, O Spouse! How much better is thy surpassing love then wine? See the annotate. Above, chap.1.on v.2. and 4.] and the smell of thine oils, [understand by oils or ointments the gifts and grapes of the spirit, which the church received, see Psal.45.8. and 133.2. 1 Joh.2.20. and 27. Above, ch.1.3. The spouse commendeth the savour of the oils or ointments of the Bridegroom, see the annotate. There: so the Bridegroom here commendeth the oils or ointments of the Spouse, see Isa.62.4,5.] then all spices? [that is, sweet-smelling made, Exod.30.23. see likewise, 2 Chron.ch.9.v.1.9. and 16.14. Esth.2.12.]
\p
\v 11 . Thy lips, [Wherewith thou callest upon God, preaches his Word, praisest and glorifies his Name, and edifies thy neighbor] O Spouse, drop of the honey-comb; [that is, thy words and sayings are as pleasant and acceptable unto me, as the honey-comb is unto men, see likewise this similitude, Psal.119.10.103.] honey and milk are under thy tongue, [this signifieth the same that was said immediately before, see 1 Pet.2.2.] and the smell of thy garments [that is, thy good works] is like the smell of Libanon. [Upon Mount Libanon grew many sweet-smelling trees and herbs, especially frankincense trees, from which Mount Libanon hath its name; for Lebona signifieth frankincense. In Hos.14.5,6,7. God promiseth unto Israel that his smell or savour should be like unto Libanon, by the dew of his grace, see 2 Cor.2.14,15.]
\p
\v 12 . My sister, O spouse, thou art a garden inclosed, [Or a garden bolted, shut close, looked with a look. Hereby is signified, the immaculate or undefiled spiritual purity and chastity of the church, who giveth no admission or access unto strange wooers or seducers. But others understand this of Gods defence and protection, who keepeth and preserveth his church from wild beasts; that is, from, cruel tyrants. In Isa.chap.5. God compareth his church to a vine inclosed or fenced in. And Zach.2.5. he promiseth that he will be a wall of fire round about Jerusalem] a well shut up, [out of which springeth the clear and pure water of the Gospel, whereby the sad hearts and minds of believers are refreshed and comforted, Psal.23.2. according to the promise which God maketh to his church, Isa.58.v.11. And therefore this well or spring is said to be shut up, because this water of grace pertaineth only to those that are members of the church. No man cometh unto it, but by Christ] a fountain sealed. [understand hereby the assurance or confirmation of grace, which Christ affordeth unto his church, see 2 Cor.1.22. Eph.1.13. yea, unto his church onely; for a thing that is sealed, is not made common, or imparted unto others, see Isa.8.16.]
\p
\v 13 . Thy shoots, [Or, thy plants, branches, sprigs] are a Paradise [or, garden of pleasure, fair orchard. It signifieth properly a place beset, or planted with trees, as appeareth by Eccles.2.5. It is likewise sometimes taken for a wood or forest, Nehem.2.8.] of pomegranates, [that is, the faithful members of the church are abundantly adorned and filled with good works, as a pomegranate is full of kernels: they are like fruitful trees planted by the fresh waters, Psal.1.3. and 92.13.] with precious fruits, [or excellent transcendent fruits. Understand hereby the good works of believers, which are pleasing and acceptable unto God, as pomegranates and other pleasant fruits are unto men] Cyprus with Spikenard. [Of Cyprus, see above, chap.1.14. Hebr. Cyprusses with Spikenards, or, much Cyprus with much spikenard. Therefore the word Spikenard is here put in the plural number, and vers.14. in the singular number, because there be divers sorts or kinds of Spikenard; or understand here the leaves of Cyprus and Spikenard, which likewise have a pleasant smell.]
\p
\v 14 . Spikenard and Saffron, Calamus, [Oth. Sweet-reed] and Cynamon, [Calamus and Cynamon, as also Myrrhe, were used in the holy oil, Exod.30.23 to 34.] with all manner of trees of frankincense, [that is, of such trees as Produce frankincense] Myrrhe and Aloes, [or tree of lign-aloes, see Numb.24.6. Pro.7.17. and Psal.45.9.] together with all the chief spices. [Hebr. All head-spices; that is, all kind of chief spices, see Exod.30.on v.23. Understand withal from verse 13. Are thy shoots or branches. And by these pleasant sweet-smelling herbs or spices, are signified the manifold gifts and graces of the Holy ghost, wherewith the godly are indued, see 1 Cor.chap.12.vers5,6. &c. Galat.5.v.22,23. 1 Pet.4.10.]
\p
\v 15 . O fountain of gardens, well of living waters, which flow from Libanon! [With these words the Spouse commendeth her Bridegroom, who indueth her with abundance of waters, that is, with many excellent spiritual gifts or grapes, wherewith all the gardens, that is, all the churches or Congregations are watered and moistened, to bear and bring forth fruits in abundance, see Isa.ch.58.v.11. (Well of living waters;) that is, of perpetual waters, continually running, never drying up or putrifying, but always refreshing and comforting men with their pleasantness, see Gen.26.on v.19. Such kind of water Christ giveth to those that are his, John 4.v.10,14. And 7.38,39. And Isa.12.3. (which flow from Libanon.) It seemeth that here respect is had to the River of Jordan, which taketh its rise at the foot of Libanon, and runneth along through the land of promise, watering it. It is said, Rev.22.1. that there proceeded out of the Throne of God, and of the Lamb (which is Christ) a pure stream of living water.]
\p
\v 16 . Awake, [Or arise, rise up] (O) North-wind, and come thou South-wind, and blow through [It is God that bringeth forth the winds out of his treasures, Psal.135.7.] my garden, [observe, that the church calleth this garden, her garden, likewise, his garden, in the words following; to wit, the garden of Christ, and that in divers respect. Christ is the owner and heir of this garden, but the pastors and Over-seers of this garden; that is, the church, wherein also every member hath spiritual fellowship and communion, 1 Cor.3.9.] that the spices thereof may flow out: [that is, the savour and smell may be spread abroad] O that my best-beloved would come into his garden, and eat his precious fruits. [that is, O that he would enjoy the fruits which by the power and working of his Spirit, we bring forth unto him, and whereby we are bound to honour him, Rom.6.22. Of precious fruits, see above, v.13. In the words of this verse is expressed a further blessing, which God bestoweth upon his garden; that is, upon his church; to wit, that the winds do blow upon it, to refresh and revive it, and to purge and cleanse the air, and so to make the garden thereby the more fruitful. Understand here by the wind, the Holy Ghost, as John 3.8. and Acts 2.2. And although the South and North-wind be of divers qualities and operations, the one being cold, the other warm; the one moist, the other dry; yet they are both beneficial and profitable to this Garden, or to the Church of God, which hath sometimes need of sharp reproofs, and sometimes of calmes, and sweet comforts and consolations.]
\c 5
\s Here the Bridegroom maketh answer to the spouses invitation, ch.4.16. and sheweth, that he hath a singular delight in the fruits of the spouse, vers.1. she acknowledgeth, that she once neglected to let her bridegroom in, 2. But that afterward she rising to let him in, 5. He was gone away, which troubled her much, 6. To what inconvenience she came, when she sought him, 7. She acquainteth her companions with her exceeding great love toward him, 8. With a description of his beautifulness, 10.
\p
\v 1 . I am come into my garden; that is, into my church. Here the bridegroom answereth to the request & petition of the Spouse, chap.4.16. he is ready to fulfill the desire of those that fear him, Psal.145.19. see likewise , Exod.20.24.] O my sister, O spouse, [see above, chap.4.v.8,9.] I have pluckt my myrrhe with my spice, [that is, I have enjoyed the prayers and thanksgivings of believers, as also the good and pleasant fruits of good works, which I wrought in thee by the powerful working of the Holy Ghost. Of the preciousness of Myrrhe, see above ch.1.on v.13. Observe here, that Christ calleth all these portions here mentioned, his portions; he saith, My myrrhe, my spice, my honey-comb, etc. for without him we can do nothing, Joh.15.5. and ch.1.v.16. and 1 Cor.4,7. Rev.3.18.] I have eat my honey-comb with my honey, I have drunk my wine together with my milk. [That is, I take delight in thy good fruits and good works. On the contrary, the evil fruits of sinners are called poisonous or venomous grapes, which have bitter berries, Deut.ch.32.v.32,33. The word of God, and the doctrine of the Gospel, together with the obedience unto the same, the use of the holy Sacraments, are compared to meat, honey and honey-comb, wine and milk, Psal.19.11. and 119.103. Isa.55.1. John 4 34. And 1 Pet.2.2. Because, as honey, wine, and milk are pleasant and convenient to cheer and nourish the body: so are also the aforesaid things pleasant and convenient to refresh and comfort the soul] Eat (O) friends, [here, and in the following words of the verse, Christ, the Bridegroom of his church inviteth the holy Angels and all the faithful to rejoice with him, because of the fair and pleasant fruits (that is, the obedience) of his church upon the earth, see Luke 2.v.13,14. And ch.15.v.7,10. (friends) They are the friends of Christ, that do the will of his heavenly Father, Joh.15.14. compare Isa.41.8. Jam.2.23.] drink and be drunken, O best-beloved. [see the annotate. Gen.43.34. Be drunken, is to say here, be ye filled with love towards me, and toward one another; or be abundantly satisfied with spiritual joy, which abideth unto life everlasting, see Prov.9.v.5. Isa.25.6. and ch.55.v.1.2.]
\p
\v 2 . I slept, [Here is shewed, that the Spouse, or some members of the church, after they have eaten and drunk well, that is, have abundantly injoyned the mercies of Christ, do sometimes fall into sleep or slumbering; that is, wax flow and slack in zeal & good works, and fall into carnal ease and security, see Matth.25.4. Rom.13.11. 1 Thes.5.v.6,7.] but mine heart waked; [that is, notwithstanding I forgot not my Bridegroom, but kept him still in mine heart. Understand here by the heart, the inward man, or the regenerate man, who is opposed to the flesh, or the outward man, Rom.2.v.28.29. see likewise, Matth.26.41. Gal.5.17.] (it) was the voice of my most beloved that knocked, [the spouse relateth here the love and care of the bridegroom, that would not suffer her to rest quietly in the bed of worldly ease. Christ knocketh at the door of our heart by his word by his Spirit, and by cross, or chastisement, Rev. 3. Vers. 20] (saying) Open to me, [To wit, the door of thine heart: Rise up out of the sleep of sin, let me dwell in thine heartby faith, awakening it] my Sister; my Love, my Dove, my Perfect (one). [These loving or pleasant names and titles, which Christ here giveth to his spouse (she being yet in her infirmity) signify his transcendent love and affection unto her, loving her, and delighting in her, not withstanding that she yet liveth and converseth in this sinful flesh, not imputing unto her sins and imperfections] for mine head is filled with dew, and locks of mine hair with the drops of the night. [That is, I have endured much hardship and trouble. Hereby is intimidated, that Christ was to suffer much, and to undergo sore and heavy crosses and afflictions, to deliver his Spouse, and to cleanse and purify her from her sins. For to be wet, with the dew of heaven, is a great inconvenience, or discommodity, Gen. 31.40. and it signifieth here to suffer misery or affliction, as Dan. 4. 25. As also rain, when a man is not covered or sheltered. So likewise drops, signify leaking or soaking in of rain, that is, great troubles, or adversities, Amos 6. 11. Others take these words thus. As the dew and rain do make the ground or earth fruitful. So the Doctrine of Christ causeth his Church to bring forth abundance of fruit. See Deut. 32. 2. Psal. 72. 6. Hos. 14. 5.]
\p
\v 3 . I have put off my coat, how shall I put it on again? [As if she had said, I cannot put it on without trouble. The spouse maketh this answer to her Bridegroom, refusing to rise for to let him in when he knocked at the door. By the putting off of the coat, and the lying down in the bed, may be here understood the ease and security of this world, which do sometimes hinder and obstruct the true believing children of God themselves, that they do not readily and openly, freely profess Christ and his word, as soon as he knocketh, and offereth his grace unto them, fearing the trouble & persecution that doth usually a tend it] I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them again? [This is yet another argument, proving, that the spouse had given up herself to rest ad ease: for in those hot countries, where they commonly went bare-foot, they were wont in the evening, when they went to take rest, she was loath (as she here affirmeth) to rise from off her bed, to let her Bridegroom in, fearing to soil her feet. Of such frivolous ad idle excuses, see Luke 14. 18, etc.]
\p
\v 4 . My best beloved drew (away0 his hand from the hole (of the door, ) [His hand, that had been at the hole of the door, he drew away, to depart, as followeth, vers. 6. Oth. Put his hand through the hole of the door; to wit, for to open the door; and so here should be spoken of the door of the heart, and be intimated, that Christ still continueth preaching unto, and exhorting his elect, when they do not forthwith obey and follow him, so moving and touching their hearts by the power, and up to a servent love ad longing after him, as followeth in the next words] and my bowels are moved for his sake. [Or, because of him: to wit, because of the Bridegroom. Hebr. Over him, or, for him. By these words the Spouse testifieth her disquietness, hearty sorrow, and grief, for putting of her beloved so uncivilly and discourteously, when he knocked at the door, vers. 3. See the like phrase, Jerem. 4. 19. And 31. 20.]
\p
\v 5 . I rose up, to open to my best-beloved: and my hands dropped (of) myrrhe, and my fingers (of) flowing myrrhe, upon the handles of the lock. [Here and in the verse following, the Spouse manifesteth her grief by outward tokens of sorrow and amendment, (fruits that are worthy of repentance) in rising up out her bed, opening the door, seeking, and calling after her Bridegroom, that was gone away from her. Understand here by myrrhe, the oil of myrrhe, whereby is signified, that the call and operation of Christ by his Holy-Spirit in the hearts of believers hath exceeding great power; and that they being sensible thereof in their hearts by true faith ad repentance (as sweet-smelling spices) do prepare themselves to receive and entertain their Bridegroom. (with flowing myrrhe;) Or, running myrrhe. Hebr. Passing-by, or, proceeding myrrhe, or, excelling myrrhe: that is, which passeth all other in worth and value. (Upon the handles of the lock:) That is, which were at the handles of the lock. Hebr. Hands, or, palms; that is, handles, whereon a man layeth his hand. Oth. Bars, or, bolts; and understand here the Christ without doors, and hindering him from coming in; which now being oiled with the oil of grace, and so all locks and bolts, that is, all impediments and hinderances being removed, the Bridegroom might come in unto her without molestation, to enjoy the fruits of his grace, which she had received of him]
\p
\v 6 . I opened to my Most beloved, [This goeth yet one step degree further, to wit, that she being risen, openeth the door her own self, that the King of glory might come in unto her, laying aside all evasions and excuses, that might hinder her from enjoying his gracious presence] but my best-beloved was departed , he was gone away: [By the iteration or doubling of this sentence, wherein the Spouse complaineth of the departure of her Bridegroom, is signified her hearty sorrow, because she could not enjoy his presence, as she had done in times past] my soul went out [That is, I was like a dead body; to wit, through fear and terror. See Genes. 35. 18. And 42. 28. And the annotate. There. As likewise 1 Kings 10. 5. Or, my soul went out; to wit, by reason of the great love and hearty longing, which I had after him] because of his speaking: [That is, because he had spoken so comfortably unto me, vers. 2. Which before I did not much heed or regard; but now I am heartily moved and sorry for it] I sought him, but now I am heartily moved and sorry for it] I sought him, but I found him not ; I called him, but he answered me not. [This is one of the sorest and greatest troubles that do befall the children of God, when God seemeth not to hear their prayers, though they cry and call night and day unto him, Psal. 22. 3. Isai. 59. Vers. 1,2, 3. So above chapter 3. 1.]
\p
\v 7 . The watchmen that went about in the City, found me, [See above chapter 3. Vers. 3. Hence we may gather, that the Spouse went not onely to the door to seek her Bridegroom, but also further, seeking him in everycorner of the City,] they smote me, they wounded me: [hereby is intimated, that God sometimes suffereth his Church to be persecuted and oppressed by Tyrants, and wicked Governours; yea also by false Teachers and Hereticks, to chastise her for her drowsiness and negligence, and to make her the more watchful ad zealous in time to come. Smiting is not onely down with the hand, or with sticks and swords, etc. But also with the tongue, as appeareth, Jerem. 18. 18. Yea smiting signifieth to vex and torment a man be it by what means soever, Psal. 69. 27. Isai. 53. 4.] the watchmen on the walls took (away) my scarf from me [or, my Tiffany, & c, The Hebrew word hath its original from spreading abroad, because women-kind are wont to spread abroad their scarfs or vails over their heads, partly for ornament, Isai 3. 23. And partly for modesties sake, Genes. 20. 16. And 24. 65. Jerem. 2. 32. Likewise for a token of subjection, 1 Cor. 11. Vers. 6 7, 10. Now to take such a covering from off a Woman’s head, tendeth to her great shame and disgrace . So that the Spouse hath cause here to complain of it, as if she had been counted a dishonest, light, unchaste Woman. See Ezech. 23. 26. Some understand herely the scarf or vail, the bold profession of faith, and of true Religion. Of this vail or scarf the unfaithful Shepherds, or false Teachers, and Tyrants seek to rob the Church and members thereof.]
\p
\v 8 . I adjure you, ye Daughter of Jerusalem, [That is, I charge you upon your oath. The spouse speaketh this, after she had escaped the watchmens hands, seeking for help and comfort among the true members of the Church of Christ. Of the phrase Daughters of Jerusalem, see the annotate. Above chapter 1. 5. And 2. 7.] if ye find my best beloved, what will ye tell him? [Oth. Ye shall tell him this] That I am sick of love. [As if she had said, when ye come before him in prayer, tell him (I pray) of the sad condition that his Spouse is in; to wit, that I do so heartily long after his mercy and compassion, that he would be pleased to heal the wounds of my sins, that I may not faint through longing, if I must needs want yet a long while the tokens of his love and favour.]
\p
\v 9 . What is thy best beloved more than (another) best beloved, [That is, then the other friends which are also loved and are accounted dear. See above vers. 1. as the Patriachs Prophets, and Godly Teachers or Ministers, who have not the Bride, but are friends of the Bridegroom, who rejoice in his voice, John 3. 29.] O thou fairest among women. See Heb. 11. 26.] what is thy best beloved more than (another) best beloved, that thou hast so adjured us? [The words of this verse, they are the words of such members of the Church, that as yet were not fully acquainted with Christ. In that they put forth this question the second time, it intimateth the great affection and desire which they had, for to know Christ alright.]
\p
\v 10 . My best beloved is white and red, [these and the following words to the end of the Chapter, are the words of the spouse to those that had asked her concerning her Bridegroom, vers. 9. These two colours (to wit, white and red) being found alike proportion in one man, do much adorn and beautify him. The white colour signifieth pureness and triumphant glory. Wherefore it is said, that the Angels appeared in white raiment, Matth. 28. 3. Acts 1. 10. Yea also Christ himself, Matth. 17. See also Rev. C. 6. 2. And 19. 14. By the Red or Ruddy colour is meant Christs Priest-hood, or Priestly office: because he washed us in the his blood, Re. 1. 5. See likewise Re. 19. V. 13, etc and Isa. 63. 1, 2, 3, & c.] he beareth the banner above ten thousand. [Heb. He is bannered, or, he bannereth, 7 c. It is a similitude borrowed from an ensigne-bearer, and his ensigne or standard, which may be seen above all others. The meaning is, that Christ excellent far above all the Angels, and all other creatures, because he beareth in his hand, and upholdeth alone, by his Divine power, and banner in his Holy Gospel, Isai. 11. 12. And 49. 22. Oth. He is adorned with a banner of ten thousand. (Above ten thousand) That is, over or above many thousand: a certain number for an uncertain. The meaning is, that although Christ hath an innumerable number of elect under him, (Revel. 7. 9. And 19. 14.) yet he exceedeth and surmounteth them all as their Head, Prince, Standard-bearer]
\p
\v 11 .His head is of the finest gold, and of the massiest gold: [Here two words stand together, whereby the Hebrew express two sorts of the best and choicest gold, Cbe-them, and Phaz. And hereby intimidated, that the head; that is, the Divine Kingdom of the Bridegroom is exceeding fair and excellent, yea also perpetual and everlasting, Dan. 7. 14.] his hair-locks are curled, [Or, crisped, frizzled] black, as a Raven. [Hereby is signified the beauty of youth; for in these times black hair was held to be an excellent grace and ornament in youth: it being a token of a hot and strong constitution.]
\p
\v 12 . His eyes are as the (eyes) of doves [Above c. 1. 15. And 4. 1. It is said, that the Spouse hath doves eyes, and here it is said that the Bridegroom hath doves eyes. In Dan. 10. 6. There are attributed or ascribed unto Christ eyes like lamps of fire: and Revel. 1. 14. Like flames of fire: all of them signifying that he seeth and beholdeth the ways of all men, and bringeth the secret actions of men, yea even their very secret thought to light, 2 Chron. 16. 9. Psal 11. 5. Ad 90. 8. And 94. 9. Jerem. 16. 17. Heb. 4. 13. ] by the water-streams: [that is, that have their abiding place by the water-brooks,] washed with milk, [that is, looking as white, as if they were washed with milk] standing (as) in small ouches of rings. [Hebr. Sitting in the filling; that is, as precious stones stand or sit in the small ouches of gold-rings; that is, they are neatly sitted and joined in, and stand like precious stone sitted and joined in, and stand like precious stone sitted and fastened I a fair gold-ring: Such are the pure and comely eyes of Christ the Bridegroom of his Church]
\p
\v 13 . His cheeks are as a bed of spice, [The Bridegrooms cheeks are likened to a garden-bed of spices, not of spices, not of such as are dry and withered, but of such as have flowers and leaves, giving a sweet and pleasant smell: whereby is signified the pleasant and acceptable graces of the Lord Christ, whereof all those that receive him by a true and lively faith, are made partakers. See below chapter 6.2.] (as) fragrant turrets, [Or, little Spice-turrets; meaning such kind of Apothecaries boxes, as are spiring like little turrets or towers, wherein spices, drugs, or powders or perfumes are kept] his lips are (like) lilies, dropping of flowing myrrhe. [that is, his lips send forth sweet ad comfortable Doctrines. (Dropping of flowing myrrhe:) That is, of oil made of sweet-smelling lilies and myrrhe, mixt among one another, asa above v. 5. This signifieth the gifts and graces (or, words of grace, Luke 4. 22.) poured out into the lips of Christ, Psal.45. 3.]
\p
\v 14 . His hands are (as) gold rings, filled (or set0 with the turquoise, [In Hebrew Tarsis, as Exod. 28. 20. Oth. On his hands are gold rings, & c. Understand here by the hands, adorned by gold rings, wherein precious stones are set; the precious, pure, and glorious works of the Bridegroom. Thus the word hands is taken for working or power, 1 Chronicles 29. 12. And 2 Chron. 20. 6.] his belly [ Hebr. His bowels. But here by bowels must be understood the belly and the brest; wherein the bowels must be understood the belly and the brest; wherein the bowels lie shut up. Hereby is intimated the inward or hearty affections, and inclinations of the bridegroom; to wit, his love, grace, and compassion. See Luke 1. 78. 2 Cor. 7. 15. Phil. 2. 1.] is (as) standing Ivory; [Heb. The splendour of the tooth: to wit, of the tooth of an elephant. Understand this of the fairest, most polished, brightest and cleerest ivory that is] overlaid with Sphirs. [That is, beautified, or adorned with Saphirs. Some Saphirs are white, and glitter like a Diamond: Others are blew. Understand here white Saphirs, whereby the cleanness and pureness of the Bridegroom is set forth. Of the Saphir, see likewise Job 28. 6.]
\p
\v 15 . His shanks are as marble-pillars, grounded upon feet of the thickest gold: [Under the name of shanks, or legs, are the thighs also understood, yea the whole inferior part of the body unto the feet, they being the instruments or parts, that carry, support, and move the body from one place to another. This similitude is likewise used, Revel. 1. 15. See Psal. 147. Vers. 10. The strength and power of Christ, or the mighty and constant help which he affordeth unto his Church, are compared unto pillars of marble, which stand beautiful & firm, being set or grounded upon pure, or thick solid gold, signifying, that the promises, and works of god, are pure, firm and constant, yea even prevailing against the gates of Hell. In this respect Christ is called the 1 pet. 2. 6.] his countenance is as the Libanon, [That is, glorious, strong, and pleasant, like the fair, great, and high trees, which grew in great abundance upon mount Libanon, whereof see the annotate. Above chapter 4. Vers. 8.] choice as the Cedars. Things that do exceed others in beauty and greatness, are commonly chosen and picked out by men]
\p
\v 16 . The roof of his mouth [That is, his words, speech, sayings, (as Prov. 5. 3. And 8.7.) likewise his Doctrines, comforts, promises] is meer sweetness, [See Rom. 15. 4. And Col. 3. 16.] and whatsoever is in him, is altogether desirable: [Heb. He is altogether desires; that is, all that is in him, is exceeding lovely, and worthy that we should desire and covet to enjoy it. Such a one is Christ unto his Church, and to all his Elect, but to the wicked and reprobate he is a stumbling-block, and foolishness, 1 Cor. 1. 23. See also Psal. 22. 7. Isai. 52. 14. And 53. 2.] Such a one is my best beloved, such a one is my Friend, ye Daughters of Jerusalem. [With these words the spouse intendeth to conclude the excellency and dignity of the Lord Christ, above all others]
\c 6
\s The companions ask the spouse for her beloved, vers. 1. She telleth them wither he is gone, 2. The Bridegroom describeth the form and beauty of his Spouse, 4. He telleth likewise, how that he visiteth his garden, 11. The Bridegroom inviteth his Spouse to come to him, 13.
\p
\v 1 . Whither is thy best beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? [These, and the following words of the verse, are the words of the Daughters of Jesuralem, of whom mention is made, chapter 5. Vers. 16.] whither hath thy best beloved turned (his) face, [To wit, from thee to others, or to another place] that we may seek him with thee? [Or, and we will seek him with thee. The daughters of Jerusalem having heard how the Spouse had praised and commended her Bridegroom, are thereby moved to enquire earnestly, the second time after him, (expressing thereby their great and fervent zeal) and they promise and engage that they will seek him with her, to the end that they also my be made partakers of his grace and blessings. Such is the power of the preaching of the Gospel in the hearts of the Elect: See Acts 2. 27. And 4. 4. And chapter 11. Vers. 20. 21.]
\p
\v 2 . My best beloved is gone down into his garden, [The Spouse that at the first sought Christ her Bridegroom, but could not find him, knoweth now where he is, and she instructeth others of it. So that we do here see fulfilled that which Christ promiseth, Matth. 7. 7. Seek, and ye shall find. See Deut.4. 29. The garden of Christ is his Church, as above chapter 4. 16. And 5. 1. There is Christ to be sought, and likewise to be found] to the bed of spices, [It seemeth that hereby is intimated the flocks or companies of Believers, in whose hearts, as in good ground the good sweet-smelling seed of the Word of God is sowen, Matth. 13. 8, 23. This is the Bridegrooms garden of pleasure, where he is continually present with his grace and Spirit, and he taketh his delight in the good works of believers, as men do in pleasant garden plots, which are set and sowen with all manner of precious spices and flowers] to feed in the gardens, [That is, to have fellowship ad communion with his Elect, eating and enjoying his pleasant fruits. See above chapter 4. 16. As also to feed and nourish those that are his, and make them partakers of the gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost. (In the gardens:) That is, in the particular Churches and Congregations of Believers, as above chapter 1.] and for to gather the Lilies. [That is, to gather unto himself his elect and chosen people who are compared unto lilies among thorns; above, chapter 2. 2.]
\p
\v 3 . I am my best beloveds, and my best beloved is mine: [The Spouse rejoiceth here because of the love and peace that was renewed betwixt her Bridegroom and herself, notwithstanding her former weaknesses and adversities. Those very words the Spouse likewise uttereth, of, or concerning her Bridegroom, above chapter 2. 16. And below chapter 7. 10. But somewhat in another sense] that feedeth among the Lilies. [That is, not onely in wholesome pasture, but also in an abounding pleasant pasture, to the refreshing, and to the everlasting comfort of his sheep.]
\p
\v 4 . Thou art beautiful, my Love, like Thirza, comely as Jerusalem: [The Bridegroom having found his Spouse, commendeth her for the manifold gifts and graces of the Spirit, wherewith she is beautified and adorned. See above chapter 4. 1. Thirza was a City in the Land of Canaan , lying not far from Samaria, wherein one of the Kings which Joshua subdued kept his Court, Jos. 12. 24. Afterwards the Kings of Israel kept their Court there, until Samaria was built by Omri; See 1 Kings 24. 17. And 15. 21, 23. And 16. 6, 8, 23. The Greek interprets leave out the word Thirsta, and put into the text Good refreshing; or, favourable acceptance. Whence may be gathered, that it was a fair pleasant City, in which kind of places Kings and Princes were wont to dwell. Such kind of beauty, or comeliness is here ascribed unto the Spouse, being made fair and acceptable in and by Christ her Bridegroom, Ephes. 1. 6. And 5. 27. The City of Jerusalem is famous for her beauty and glory. It was in times past the famousest City of all the East. Plin. Lib. 5. Cap. 14. It was the seat of pure Religion, or, of the pure worship of God, and the dwelling-place of the Kings of Juda, Psal. 122. It is called the joy of the whole earth, Psal. 48. 3.] terrible [that is, full of majesty and courage,terrible in the eyes of her enemies, as below verse 10] as battalias, that is, as camps standing under their banners, or ensigns in battle-aray, ready to give battel. Therefore the Church is terrible in the eyes of her enemies, because she is environed and compassed about with many powerful Angels, 2 Kings 6. 17. And 19. 35. Likewise because she is armed with spiritual armour or weapons. See Acts 5. 11. Eph. 6. 13. And 2 Cor. 10. 4. See also below v. 10.]
\p
\v 5 . Turn away thine eyes from me, [Or, over against me, as Numb. 2. 2. A phrase expressing the greatness of Christs love. Oth. Turn thine eyes towards me. The Hebrew word signifieth sometimes to turn one’s self toward another, as 1 Chronicles 12. 23. Sometimes to turn away one’s self from another, as Ezech. 7. 22.] for they offer violence unto me: [Oth. They have lifted me up, or, exalted me] thine hair is as a flock of goats, [See the annotate. Above 4. 1.] that shear off (the grass) of Gilead. [Here is mentioned onely Gilead, but chapter 4. 1. Is mentioned, the Mountain of Gilead. Both in the one place, and in the other the whole country of Gilead is meant and understood.]
\p
\v 6 . Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep, that come up from the washing place, which do all together bring forth twins, and (there) is none without young among them. [See above chapter 4. On verse 3.]
\p
\v 7 . The teeth are as a peace of pomegranate between thy locks. [See above chapter 4. On verse 3.]
\p
\v 8 . There are threescore Queens, and fourscore Concubines, and Virgins without number. [These words may be likewise taken as spoken conditionally, thus, let there be threescore Queens, & c. That is, although there were threescore Queens, etc. Yet (but) one is my dove, etc. Christ the Bridegroom of his church speaketh this under the name of Solomon, who was a type and a figure of him. Some conclude from hence, that Salomon made this song in the first years of his Reign, when he had not so many wives and Concubines, as he had afterward, 1 Kings 11. 3. But some conceive that here a certain number is put for an uncertain, as is further exprest, vers. 9. Of the word Concubines, see further Genes. 22. On vers. 24. It seemeth that by these Queens and Concubines are meant those Churches, which pretend to be true Churches, but have no inward spiritual fellowship and communion with Bridegroom, the Lord Jesus Christ, although by the grace and mercy of God they may be brought unto it. Understand here by virgins, hand-maids or Ladies of honour that waited and attended upon the Queens, as Esth. 2. 9. Psal. 45. 15. And by these hand-maids is meant the people, that depend upon the great ones, and suffer themselves to be led by them: which is by far the greatest number in the world.]
\p
\v 9 . One onely is my dove, [Or, (but) she alone is my dove. This is opposed to the great number of Queens, etc. Vers. 8. And here the spouse of Christ, which is but one (as there is but one body, one Spirit, one Hope, one Lord, one faith, Eph. 2. Vers. 4, 5.) is counted and esteemed more then the great and infinite number of others, Queens, and Princesses. See what God saith unto Israel, Exod. 19. 5. 2 Sam. 7. 23.] my perfect one, the onely one of her mother, [All the particular Churches on earth, that are orthodox, being put all together, make-up no more but one body, Ephes. 5. 16. The onely Church being as the onely and legitmate Daughter of the heavenly Jerusalem, which is the universal Church, which is the mother of us all, Galat. 4. Vers. 26.] she is the pure one [Or, purified one, or choice one, or, the clear one: and so below vers. 10. And 1 Chronicles 7. 40. There are many bastard-Churches, but there is no more but one pure, legitimate, chosen Church, of which see 1 Pet. chapter 1. Vers. 2.] of her, that bare her: [Hebr. Of her bearer] when the Daughters [To wit, the Daughters, or Virgins, whereof is spoken, vers. 8.] see her, [That is, fully know her state and condition] they shall proclaim her blessed, (yea) the Queens, and the Concubines; and shall praiseher. [To wit, this Spouse. See Deut. 4. 6. And 20. 19. Acts 5. 13. (They shall praise her:) That is, they shall count her blessed, or happy. The meaning is, although the Churches that in this World are so highly esteemed both by others, and by themselves, seem to be true Church, yet they shall be convinced at last, (at least (unless they do repent) at the day of judgement, when they shall see the sheep stand at the right hand of the supreme Judge) that there is but one true Church, and that they are blessed and happy that belong unto it, Malach. 3. 18.]
\p
\v 10 . Who is she [That is, what manner of person is this?] that looketh forth, [Or, peepeth out, appeareth] as the day break [That is, as the clear and bright morning appeareth after the dark night, so doth the Spouse rise up, and come forth after the darkness of affliction, ignorance, and error. To wit, when the morning star of the knowledge of Christ ariseth in her heart. See Isai. 30. 26. And 60. 20. Ezech. 16. 14. And 32. 7, 8. Joel. 3. 15.] pure [Or, clear, or, clean] as the Sun, [Christ is the Sun of righteousness, Malach. 4. 2. The woman, to wit, his Spouse, is clothed with the Sun, Revel. 12. 1. For she hath put on Christ by faith, Gal. 3. 27. By whose righteousness she is cleansed from her sins, and so is become glorious, and shining bright] terrible [To wit, unto her enemies, with whom she is to combat under the banner of her Bridegroom, being armed not with carnal weapons, but such as are mighty through God, to cast down strong holds, 2 Cor. 10. 4. See likewise Exod. chapter 15. Vers. 14, 15, 16. Deut. 2. 25. And 33. 29. Psal. 48. 5, 6. See also above the annotate. On vers. 4.] as (batalias) with banners? [This question made in this verse is propounded by those that are mentioned in the former verse. They admire or wonder at the beauty, and glory of the Church of God; as if they had said, Is this that Church which we have despised, reproached? Behold, how glorious and excellent is it now?]
\p
\v 11 . I went down to the garden of nuts, to see the green fruits of the valley: [These, and the following words, are the words of the Bridegroom, shewing how he visiteth the garden, his Church. The Hebrew word Egoz, rendered here nuts, is onely found in this place. Most interpreters take it for nuts, and conceive that here must be meant not mean or ordinary nuts, bur nutmegs, such kind of pleasant and precious fruits, as grew in great abundance in the Bridegroom garden. See above cha. 4. Vers. 12, 13, 14. Oth. Cleansed, or, pruned garden. (To seen the green fruits:) Oth. New, or, first fruits; to wit, that ripen in the beginning of the year. The meaning is, that after the winter of adversity, appeareth the pleasant Spring of grace in the garden of the Church. (of the valley;) Or, in the low ground, where the Church of Christ is watered ad moistened with the Word and Spirit of God, that it may bear fruit in great abundance] to see whether the Vine flourished, (and) the pomegranates budded forth. [Or, blossomed, or, spouted out. Understand here by God, and planted in the garden of the Church, which budding ad blossoming in true and sincere knowledge, do afterward bring forth fruits of good works, to the glory of God, and to the edification of their neighbour. See above chapter 2. 13, 14.]
\p
\v 12 . Before I knew it, my Soul set me (upon) the charets [That is, I set myself, etc. This phrase is very common in Holy Scripture: see examples thereof, Psal. 6. 4. Eccles. 7. 28. Above chapter 1. 7. Isai. 1. 14. And 61. 10. And elsewhere besides. The meaning is, I was moved by my fervent compassion, and not by the merits. Oth. Mysoul; that is, my desire. See Psal. 27. On vers. 12.] of my willing people. [Or, of my Noble, or, Princeley people. The Hebrew word Nadib, which is used here, signifieth free-willing, or good-willing, or, free, or Noble, or, Princely. Some render it, upon the charets of Amminadib, making of two words one: But we find not in Scripture who this Amminadib was: Therefore it is better to render it, my willing, or, my free-willing people; to wit, true Christians, or believers; who are said to be willing, or, free-willing in the day of power, or host, Psal. 110. 3. Receiving the word preached with all willingness, or readiness of mind, Acts 2. 41. And 7. 11. The words of this verse seem yet to be the words of the Bridegroom. As if he had said, Before I knew it; that is to say, suddenly, unsuspectedly, unawares, in regard of my great longing after my garden: Where I, seeing and people forward (as it were) with charets: defending them likewise against their enemies. This may be also understood by the word charets: because they used charets heretofore in war. See Jos. 11. 4. And 1 Samuel 13. 5. And elsewhere besides. Some understand here the Holy Angels.]
\p
\v 13 . Return, return, O Sulammith, return, return, [This signifieth the earnest longing and desire after the conversion of those that wandered out of the way, and went astray: and it is therefore four times repeated, because we are by nature slow of heart and of ears, Luke 24. 25. Heb. 5. 11. Some apply this to the calling back, and conversion of the Jews unto Christ. See Rom. 11. 25. Others conceive that these are the words of the spouses companions. (O sulammith) Salomon hath his name from peace, 1 Chronicles chapter 22. 9. Jerusalem is called Salem, Psal. 76. 3. That is, peace, Heb. 7. 2. So the Church, or, the people, that is called, or invited to return, is called Sulammith, which is as much to say, as peaceable, or, peaceful, or, living in peace; In respect of the peace which they with God through Jesus Christ, Rom. 5. 1. It is then as much as if the Bridegroom here had said, Come hither my loving Spouse, that (after my name Salomon, Prince of Peace, or peaceable) are called Sulammith, that is, peaceable: return, come unto me, I will receive thee into grace and favour, although thou didst provoke me unto anger] that we may look upon thee. [Or, behold thee; to wit, with joy and gladness. These words seem to be uttered by the Sulammiths friends, wishing to see, that the former gifts and graces, might be again seen, and discerned in her: for the Angels themselves desire to see those things, which are communicated to the Church by the Gospel, 1 Pet. 1. 12. See also Psal. 27. 4. Isai. 52. 8.]
\p
\v 14 . What look ye upon the Sulammith? [Some conceive that these are the words of the Spouse: Others take them to be the words of the Bridegroom. Oth. What do ye (I pray) See in the Salammite? Or, in the Salammitess] she is as a dance [ Or, as a company; that is, as a company of the those that make up a dance, that are merry together. The Israelites, yea even the godly themselves were wont sometimes to rejoice with dances, and to praise God in them for victories obtained, or for other causes, Exod. 15. 20. Jerem. 31. 13. Luke 15. 25. In this place is signified by the dance, the joy and gladness of believers, when they shall come unto Christ] of two armies, [By these two armies is signified the multitude of those that should be converted unto Christ. But others understand by the two armies, the Church of Christ consisting of Jews and Gentiles. Others retain here in the text the Hebrew word Machanaim, which signifieth two armies, or two camps. See Genes. 32. Vers. 1, 2.]
\c 7
\s The Spouse is commended because of her beauty and comeliness, vers. 1, & c. She rejoiceth because of her communion and fellowship with her Bridegroom, 10. She inviteth him, and requesteth to go along with him to visit the Churches, 11, & c.
\p
\v 1 . How beautiful are thy goings in the shoes, [Understand hereby, her conversation in the faith in Jesus Christ, to wit so, as that her feet are shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace, manifesting thereby, that she is born of God, Ephes. 6. 15. See also Isai. 2. 7.] thou Princes Daughter; [Compare herewith John 1. 13. And Jam. 1. 18. This Spouse, or the Church, is also called a Kings Daughter, Psal. 45. 14. For god is a great King] the joints of thy thighs, are like precious chains, [Or, like neck-chains, or, bracelets, or such like ornaments. See Prov. 25. On vers. 12. The Hebrew word rendered here joints (which is onely found in this place) cometh from a word that signifieth turning, or turning about, and it signifieth the hollowness wherein the hip or thigh bone is moved or turned about. These joints (or turning about) are compared to precious chains, or jewels, signifying the sure, upright, and fair feature, dealing, and conversation of his Princely, or Noble Daughter, well becoming the Gospel, whereof she maketh profession. Others render the Hebrew here girdles, and understand thereby the girdle of truth, which the chiefest workman of all good and perfect gifts, as is intimidated in the words following. This girdle is compared to chains of gold, that are fastened and joined together with many links; for truth hath many parts, but they all suit with one another, like the links of a chain] being the work of the hands of an Artificer, [Understand by this skilful workman, the Holy Ghost. See 1 Cor. 12. 4. It is said, Jam. 1. 17. That every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights. It seemeth that the friends of the vers. 5. And vers. 9. Is spoken of Salomon or Christ, as of a third person: Notwithstanding some hold them to be the words of the Bridegroom]
\p
\v 2 . Thy navel is (like) a round goblet, [The navel is the instrument, whereby the child is fed and nourished, while it is shut up in its mother’s womb. Understand here by navel, the navel of regeneration, whereby we are made partakers of spiritual life, when we are conceived in the womb of the Church, by the seed of the word of God. This gift is compared to a round goblet or bowl; which wanteth no drink or liquor, as followeth in the next words of the text; that is, which is never emptied or dried up, because by regeneration we receive the Spirit of adoption, which never departeth from the elect, Joh. 14. 16. But he becometh in them a well of water, springing up into everlasting life, Joh. 4. Vers. 14.] which wanteth no drink (or liquor:) [Heb. Which wanteth no mixture. Drink or liquor is often by the Hebrews called mixture, because they did not always drink the wine as pure as it came from the grape or wine-press, but they mingled it with water; or also with spices. See above chapter 5. 1. And Prov. 9. 2. And below chapter 8. 2. Mention is made of wine mingled with spices] thy belly is like an heap of wheat, [The spiritual gifts of the Spouse or Church of Christ are also fruitful, converting others, in such abundance and plenty, as wheat that beareth and bringeth forth much fruit, Psal. 72. 16.] set round about with lilies. [Heb. Fenced, etc. Hereby is shewed, that the fruitfulness of the Church is crowned with the blessing of God and Spiritual Joy. It seemeth to have respect to the new fruits, which they were used to crown or adorn with flowers, or green garlands. See Hos. 14. 6.]
\p
\v 3 . Thy two breasts, are like two whelps, twins of a roe. [See the interpretation of this verse, above chapter 4. 5.]
\p
\v 4 . Thy neck [By the neck is meant the power and glory of the Church of Christ. Others understand by the neck, hope and patience] is a tower of Ivory, [that is, beautiful, strong, and right. See above chapter 4. 4. And the annotate. There] thine eyes are (like) the fish-pools at Hesbon (To wit, the eyes of thine understanding, and of thy faith, they are full of clear and pure water, being clear to see and discern the truth, and to consider her own ways and goings, and the ways and going of others. See above chapter 4. Vers. 1. (at Hesbon) In the City of Hesbon King of Sihon formerly kept his Court, Numb. 21. 26. It lay in a goodly fat soil or region, which fell by lot unto the Reubinites, Numb. Cha. 32. Vers. 3, 4, 5, to 37. It seemeth that there were in this city very fair fish-pools, that beautified and adorned it, as the eyes do the body. Oth. Like fish-pools with consideration, or, with thought; that is, curiosly, or artificially made] by the gate of Bath-rabbim: [That is, by the gate, where many go out and in, or, by the gate where many men meet together. Some conceive that there was fair fish pools. Some take it for the sheep gate, Nehem. 3. 1. Or, the fountain-gate,, Nehem. 3. 15. Others take it to be a gate of the city of Hesbon] Thy nose is as the tower of Libanon, [Here by way of similitude or comparison is described the beauty of the nose, and consequently of the whole face. Some take the words thus, Because the nose is the instrument of smell, whereby we can discern the virtue of many things; therefore they understand by it, the judgement, and the spirit of discerning, whereby we are able to discern things that differ, Phil. 1. 10. See also Isai. 11. 3. (as the tower of Libanon) This may be understood of the tower of the house, which Salomon built in the forest of Libanon, or, of the trees of Libanon, 1 Kings 7. 2. And 10. 17.] which looketh toward Damascus. [Damascus was in those times the most famous city of Syria, Isai.7.8. lying Northward of mount Libanon: A very fair city, Jerem.49.24,25. This city was commonly enemy to, and made war often with the people of God: See 1 Chron.18.vers.5,6. 1 Kings 11.24,25. Isai.7.5,8. Amos 1.3. So that the tower of Libanon looking toward Damascus, may here signify the vigilant and watchful care of the spouse for the rest both of her self, and of her children against her and their enemies. For, which looketh toward Damascus, others have, seeing with the face toward Damascus. In Hebrew it is called Dammesek: and 1 Chron.18 5, and 6. Its called Damascus: but 2 Kings 16.10. and Acts 9.2. Damascus.]
\p
\v 5 . Thine head upon thee, is like Carmel, [See of mount Carmel, 1 Sam.25.2,5. And 1 Kings 18.vers.19,20, to 42. And elsewhere besides. Now these words, thine head upon thee, is like Carmel, may signify, that the spouse is excellently endued with wisdom and understanding, as mount Carmel being very fruitful, brought forth many good fruits. Others do render here the word Carmel, by Crimson, as a like word, to wit, Carmil, is so rendered, 2 Chron.3.14.] and the hairlace of thine head. [understand here such hair-lace or binding, or philiting, wherewith they bind up the dressing or ornament of the head. The Hebrew word dallath signifieth properly thineness, tenderness, daintiness; so that it may also signify here thin, or smooth hair. See chap.4.1.] like purple: [This colour as also the crimson-colour did Kings and Princes wear in ancient times, and therefore the same did well befit this spouse, who is called a Princes Daughter, vers.1. And these colours are representations of the blood of Christ] the King is (as it were) tied in the galleries. [Understand here by the King, King Salomon, who was a type and figure of Christ. The meaning is; When the King intendeth to go over the galley from one chamber into other, and spieth thee in his going; he is fain to stand still to look upon thee; no otherwise then as if he were bound and tied fast to the gallery. Oth. The King is (thereby) tied to the goings. The Hebrew word Repatim, is Genes.30.38,41. And Exod.2.16. rendered gutters: but a like word, above chap.1.5,17,18. Rendered galleries, as it must likewise be so taken in this place. And understand by the word Galleries, Fabrics or buildings that go all along the Houses. And to be tied upon, or, in the Galleries; signifieth here, that Christ hath a sure and firm habitation or abode, in the house of his church, where this King is tied, and continueth tied with the bands and cords of love, which he beareth unto his beloved spouse the church, Rom.8.35. See also Psal.45.12. Isai.62.4. Ezech.37.25,20. And chap.48.vers.35. Hos.2.19. Joh.14.23. 2 Cor.6.16. Revel.22.3,5.]
\p
\v 6 . How fair art thou, and how pleasant art thou, O Love, [Here the Bridegroom sheweth a reason why he is tied, and continued still tied with or by love unto his spouse, as he affirmeth vers.5. See above chap.1.vers.15,16. And chap.4.vers.9,10.] in delights! [That is, in all manner of recreation, so that all those that love this spouse, may rejoice with her, and be glad in the beauty of her glory, as Isai.66.10,11.]
\p
\v 7 . This thy length [Or, stature, shape] is to be likened to a palm-tree, [this is a fair tall tree, growing straight up or bolt up-right, always green and flourishing, and bearing fair and excellent fruit. Therefore the condition of the godly is compared unto it, Psal.92.13. See also 1 Kings 6.29. and 7.39.] and thy brests to clusters (of grapes.) [To wit, to such clusters of grapes, as are full of sap and moistures, which the faithful may suck, receiving from thence heavenly comforts and consolations unto satiety, Isa.66.11. and above chap.4.vers.5.]
\p
\v 8 . I said, [To wit, with my self; that is, I thought, I firmly resolved] I will climb up into the palm-tree, [to wit, to gather the fruits from off it. Take these words as being spoken by the Bridegroom, intimating that he greatly delighted in the spiritual fruits of his spouse. See above chap.5.vers.1.] I will take hold of the boughs thereof: [that is, I will take the boughs or branches of this palm-tree unto my self, and I will purge and keep them, that they may bring forth better fruit, Joh.15.7.] so then thy brests shall be as clusters of grapes on the vine, [this is a promise, which the bridegroom maketh unto his spouse, to wit, that he will bless her, filling her with the sap and moisture of his grace, so as that she shall not be barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of Christ, 2 Pet.1.8. See also Isai.27.6. But others take the words of the text to be a wish or desire, in this sense: that thy breasts might be, etc. That is, that thou wearest no empty, or an unprofitable vine, as is written of Israel, Hos.10 1. But that thou were full of the Spirit, that the babes and sucklings might suck, and be filled with the breasts of consolation, Isa.66.11.] and the smell of thy nose [compare above vers.4. with the annotate.] like apples. [which have a pleasant smell among other fruits of trees, of what sort soever they may be. But some understand here pomanders or sweetapples, which the Apothecaries make of divers sweet-smelling spices.]
\p
\v 9 . And the roof of thy mouth like good wine, which goeth straight to my beloved, causing the lips of the sleeping ones to speak. [That is, the Doctrine of the church is like good wine, to comfort and cheer the sad and heavy hearts, Prov.chap.31.v.6. See likewise this similitude taken from wine, Isa.55.1. and Prov.9.5. (which goeth straight to my beloved:) Hebr. According to the righteousnesses; that is, right on, straight forward, as we commonly use to say, so also Prov.23.31. Oth. Which goeth according to the righteousnesses to my beloved: That is, whose words tend thereunto, to bring others unto Christ, and consequently to righteousness; that is, to all good works, wherein he will have us to walk. (To my beloved:) That is, to every one of my members. (Causing the lips of the sleeping ones to speak:) The meaning is, As wine maketh men affable and fluent in words, Prov.23.29. So the spirit of God maketh those that have him dwelling richly in them, to speak of the mysteries of God, and to relate the great and wonderful works of the Lord, Acts 2.4,11,13. (of the sleepings ones:) that is, of those that are now raised or wakened out of the sleep of sin, by the preaching of the word of God, Ephes.5.14.]
\p
\v 10 . I am my best-beloveds; [These are the words of the Spouse, being filled with the wine of grace and comfort, which she had received of her Bridegroom. She testifieth and confesseth and confesseth her assurance by faith, that she belongeth to Christ, see Gal.3.29. see also the annotate. Above, chap.2. on vers.16. and chap.6.on v.3.] and his affection is toward me. [or, his desire tendeth unto me.]
\p
\v 11 . Come my best beloved, let us go forth into the field, let us overnight in the villages; [The Spouse requireth the company of Christ; for without him we can do nothing, Job 15.5. The Spouse petitioneth the Bridegroom for leave to go into the field, and into the villages; to wit, to visit her tillage, to see what success it had, and whether the trees brought forth good and plentiful fruit, as is said, v.12. This signifieth the love and care of Christ, and of his church, for the propagation of the Gospel, and the increase and augmentation of the church throughout the whole world, (for the field is the world, Matth.13.38.) as Christ himself in the days of his flesh, went into all the Cities and Towns, preaching the Gospel, Matth.9.35. Mark 6.6. so likewise the Apostles are sent forth to preach the Gospel to all the Nations of the world, Matth.28.19. see also Acts 15.36. The building up of the Church is also compared to husbandry, 1 Cor.3,9. And the faithful Pastors and Teachers are also called there Gods co-workers or fellow-labourers. (Let us overnight, etc.) hereby is shewed the vigilant care or carefulness of the church, which even by night watcheth and keepeth guard over her vineyard.]
\p
\v 12 . Let us get up early to the vineyards, [This is again a token of diligent carefulness, see 2 Chron.36.15. and Jerem.25.3,4. (To the vineyards) That is, to the Churches or places where the Gospel is planted or preached. For the house of Israel is the Lords vineyard, Isa.5.7.] let us see whether the vine flourisheth, (whether) the young grapes [see of young grapes, above, ch.2 13,15.] do open, [or, have opened. Oth. Bud, or blossom, see above, ch.6.11.] (whether) the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my excelling love. [To wit, in the vineyards of the church, in the congregations of the Saints, there will I offer up unto thee my soul and my body for an acceptable and sweet-smelling sacrifice. (My excelling love:) That is, the injoinment of the fruits of my faith, profession, thankfulness, good works, etc. See Isa.27.vers.3,6. And 65.9. Ezech.20.vers.40,41.]
\p
\v 13 . The Dudaim [The right signification of this word is unknown to us, see Gen.ch.30.on v.14. It cannot be the Mandrake, such as is known among us, as some conceive, because our Mandrake hath a stinking smell, which maketh the head heavy, and sleepy. The spouse doth intimate here, that there is already some good hope of repentance and conversion to be observed in her, as the sprouting out or blossoming of flowers is a good beginning and preparation of fruit to come, see above, ch.2.v,12.] give a smell; [to wit, a pleasant and acceptable smell. The meaning is, that the fume of the gifts and graces of God poured forth upon his people, is spread abroad into all places both far and neer] and at our doors [or, nigh our doors. Compare Matth.24.32,33.] are all manner of precious fruits, [see above, chap.4.v.13,16.] new and old: [this phrase signifieth variety and plenty of fruits, see Levit.26.on v.10. See also, Matth.13.52. By the old fruits, understand the first gifts, and works, which they formerly received, Rev.ch.2. v,5. By the new fruits, maybe understood the fresh graces, which they had but lately or newly received: for he that maketh a right use or improvement of the gifts of regeneration, shall by the grace and blessing of God, receive still more and more, Matth.25.29. Rev.2.19. Some do understand hereby double fruits upon trees; old, ripe, and decaying fruits, and new, green, and coming on; as may be seen in the Orange-trees, and in sundry other fruit-trees] O my best-beloved, I have laid them up for thee. [as the goodness, which the Lord hath laid up for them that fear him, is wondrous great, Psal.31.20. So likewise must all the good fruits, that flow from his people, be improved and employed to his praise and glory. For of him, and through him, and to him are all things: to him be glory forever. Amen. Rom.11.36. Prov.16.4.]
\c 8
\s The spouse wisheth and desireth, that the bridegroom might appear in the flesh, and dwell with her, vers.1, &c. An admiration concerning the churches rising, 5. The spouses wish, that she might have assurance of her Bridegrooms love unto her, 6, &c. After that the spouse speaketh of her young sister; that is, of the church of the Gentiles, 8. The answer thereunto, 9. The Spouse resteth satisfied, and contended therewith, 10. The care which the Bridegroom himself taketh for his vineyard, 11, &c. But be will also be published and preached by others, 13. The spouse longeth after the speedy appearing of her Bridegroom, 14.
\p
\v 1 . Oh that thou were unto me, as a Brother, [Heb. Who shall give thee unto me, as my brother! See the annotate. Deut.5.29. and Psal.14.7. This is a wish, and longing of the spouse, or of the godly, earnestly wishing and longing that they might live to see that day, wherein they might behold Christ, their Bridegroom (being become their brother, according to the flesh) manifested in the flesh. How greatly many of the people of God in the old Testament longed after this, see Matth.13.17. Joh.8.56. Heb.11.13.] sucking the breasts of my mother! [In a spiritual way here is to be understood by the mother, the universal church, the heavenly Jerusalem, which is the mother of us all, Galat,4.26. Christ sucked the same breasts, that we do or have sucked, when he did partake of the Sacraments of the Old and New Testament; as namely, of Circumcision, the Passover, Baptism, and the Lords Supper, so to fulfil all righteousness, Matth.3.15.] that I might find thee in the street, I would kiss thee, [kissing is a manifestation of love, sometimes also of honour, and obedience, see Psal.2.12.above, chap.1.2.] also they should not despise me. [those persons are despised, that either do, or at least are counted to do, something that is not honest, or not seemly and decent, Gen.38.23. 2 Sam.6.16. Isa.37.22. Therefore inasmuch as the spouse by kissing her bridegroom openly in the street; that is, by professing him publicly before men, and acknowledging him to be her Saviour, can do nothing unseemly or unbesitting, she cannot in that respect be justly despised or mocked by any godly or religious persons. Or these words (also they should not despise me) may be taken in this sence, as if the spouse had said, Mine enemies, that is, infidels or unbelievers would then no more deride mine hope and expectation, which I have concerning the Messia his coming in the flesh, as they were wont to do, when the promises of God tarried a while, and were not presently accomplished, as appeareth, Psal. 42. 11. And 2 Peter 3. 4.]
\p
\v 2 . I would lead thee, [To wit, with reverence and with joy; desiring to despise or spread abroad Christ, that is the knowledge of Christ in the universal Church both of Jews and Gentiles, as followeth in the next words] I would bring thee into my mothers house, [that is, into the Church, or assemblies of believers, which are Gods houses and Temples, Gal. 4. 26. 2 Cor. 6. 16. Heb. 3. 6.] thou shouldest teach me; [the Church speaketh this unto Christ, see Deut. 18. 15. Isa. 2. 2, 3. Mich. 4. 1, 2. Joh. 1. 18. And 4. 15. And 15. 15. Heb. 1. 1.] I would give thee to drink of spiced wine, and of the juice of pomegranates. [that is, I would bring forth such good fruits to thy praise and glory, that should be as pleasing and acceptable unto thee, as wine mingled with spices, or hypocras, or the juice of pomegranates can be to any man. This pleasant drink is quite contrary to that cup, whereof mention is made, Rev. 17. 2, 4.]
\p
\v 3 . Let his left hand be under mine head, and let his right hand imbrace me. [The Spouse considering her own weakness, beseecheth the Bridegroom to comfort and support her, to the end that she may find rest for her soul, above, chapter 2. 6. Oth. His left hand is, or lieth, under mine head, that is, in the mean while he taketh care for me, manifesting his strength in my weakness; he suporteth me in my greatest necessity, as a faithful husband assisteth his wife in her necessity and distress.]
\p
\v 4 . I adjure you, ye daughters of Jerusalem, [That is, I charge you by oath] that ye stir not up that love, nor waken (it) until it please (the same) [The spouse feeling now the gracious comforts and consolations of her Bridegroom, wisheth that she may be, and constantly continue partaker thereof, forbidding her friends to disquiet or molest the same. See above, chapter 2. 7. And 3. 5. To wit, by heresies, schisms, or scandal. Some are of opinion, that the Bridegroom speaketh in this vers. Oth. Why, or to what end should ye stir up that love, or awake (it) before it please her? This question signifieth as much as if it were said, Stir not up this love, it will neither benefit you nor us, to vex and grieve your mother, the Church. See the like phrase above, chapter 2. 7. And 3. 5.]
\p
\v 5 . Who is she that cometh up out of the wilderness, and leaneth lovingly upon her best-beloved? [These are the words of Bridegroom, admiring at the rising of a new church in a place, where there had been no assembly or congregation of believers before. Or, if these be the words of the ancient Church of believers (as some are of opinion they are) then it is an admiration of the daughters of Jerusalem at the growth, strength, steadfast, and unmoveable faith and patience of this Church, leaning, trusting, and relying onely upon the gracious defence and protection of her Bridegroom. Compare above, chapter 3. 6. By the wilderness in this place may be understood the Nations of this world, out of which the people of God are chosen and called, Joh. 15. Vers. 19. Oth. Joining her self unto, or associating her self with her best beloved. The Hebrew word that is used in the text is found no where else, but only here. By this phrase of leaning upon her best-beloved, is shewed the weakness and infirminity which the Spouse feeleth in her self, her strength consisting alone in Christ, her Bridegroom, upon whom she leaning and relying by faith, is strengthened in all fears, doubtings, temptations and dangers, as being by union and communion with him, made partaker of his graces and benefits, for he that is joined unto the Lord, is one spirit with him, 1 Cor. 6. 17. Which maketh him perfect, stablisheth, strengtheneth, and setleth him, 1 Pet. 5. 10.] I raised thee up under the apple-tree, [These are the words of the Spouse awaketh out of sleep by her earnest and fervent prayer, as Psal. 44. 24. And 68. 1. And 78. 65. Understand hereby the Apple –tree the tree of grace, whose shadow and fruits are pleasing and delightful unto the Spouse] there [to wit, under the apple-tree] thy mother brought thee forth with sorrow, there she brought (thee) forth with sorrow, (that) bare thee, [or, thus; There was thy mother in labour of thee, there was she in labour that bare thee. Thy mother, that is, the primitive Church, or assembly of believers, in whom Christ in a manner may be said to be born, to wit, by the preaching, professing, and practising of his Word, and by suffering for it. To bring forth Christ into the World by the preaching of the Gospel, is here typified and represented unto us under the comparison of a woman, being in travel, or in pain of child bearing is accompanied with much pain and sorrow, so it likewise when Christ is conceived and born in the hearts and minds of men, that they should believe in him. This is not done without much travel, care, pain and grief. See 2 Cor. 6. 4, 5. And 4. 8, to 11.]
\p
\v 6 . Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm. [In these words the Spouse prayeth unto Christ for assurance and confirmation of his love unto her, that she might be set and abide as a seal, in and upon his heart, and continue so for ever. This hath respect to the breastplate of the High Priest, wherein were graven the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, in or upon twelve precious stones, Exod. 28. 21, 29. At all times seals were made use of for confirmation of a thing that was written or promised; to the end, that the same might not be broken, see Nehem. 9. 38. Jerem. 22. 24. Hag. 2. 23. Mal. 3. Vers. 16. 2 Tim. 2. 19. The High Priest bare the names of the twelve tribes, not only upon his heart, but also upon his shoulders, for a memorial or remembrance of the children of Israel, See Isa. 49. 16. Some conceive, that by the heart here is meant the inward and intimate love of the Bridegroom, and by the arm the outward manifestation of his love, as Psal. 77. 16. And 86. 11.] for love [to wit, the spiritual love of the Spouse unto Christ, and in like manner the love of Christ unto his Church and elect] is strong as death: [The meaning is, As death by its power overcometh and conquereth even the strongest man that is, Psal. 89. 49. So the mutual love between us both is exceeding strong, and cannot be quenched in us by any enemy or adversity, no not by death itself] zeal is hard as a Grave: [Zeal or jealousy. This signifieth a vehement burning fervent love. This love or zeal is said to be hard as the grave, because it devoureth, and overcometh all difficulties, Gal. 5. 24. Colos. 3. 5. Even as death and grave do swallow up all things] the coals thereof are fiery coals, [here is spoken of the burning coals of love, that kindle and inflame the heart, and cannot be quenched] flames of the LORD. [that is, great mighty flames. Or flames that are kindled by the spirit of Christ, which may justly be called great, by reason of the strength of his love, and the powerful working of the Spirit in the hearts of the elect.]
\p
\v 7 . Many waters would not be able to quench this love; yea the Rivers would not (be able to) drown [or overwhelm, overflow] it. [By waters and streams are oftentimes in scripture signified adversities, persecutions, temptations, which the Lord Christ sustained for our sakes, and whereby the faith, love, and patience of the children of God are exercised and tried, as Psal. 42. 8. And 69. 2. Isa. 8. 7, 8. And 59. 19. Dan. 9. 26. And 11. 22. Matth. 7. 27. See the Annotat 2 Sam. 22. On ver. 17. Compare Rom. 8. 35. To 39.] though a man should give all the substance of his house for this love, he would be utterly contemned. [Hebr. Contemning they would contemn him: that is, he would not be able to get it for the same: or his wealth or substance would not be accepted of, to give him this love for it, it would be utterly despised. As the love rated, being tied and fastened together by the band of the Spirit: So neither can love, nor any other spiritual gift giveth it to whomsoever he pleaseth, Acts 8. Vers. 18. 19, 20. Rom. 9. 11, to 19.]
\p
\v 8 . We have a little Sister, which yet hath no breasts: [The Church of the old Testament speaketh here unto and gathered from among the heathens or Gentiles, which was often promised of old, as Psal. 2. 8. And 72. 8. Isai. 11. 10. Which Heathen Church she calleth her Sister, in respect of the unity of faith. The Jewish Church is called the eldest Daughter, because she was first called to the fellowship of the covenant. See Rom. 9. 4, 5. (A little Sister:) Thus the Church which consisteth of heathens or Gentiles is called, not because she is little in respect of the number of believers; but because she was called later to the knowledge of God in Christ; to wit, in the fullness of time, Ephes. 1. 10. And 2. 6. For otherwise this least or youngest sister, who had been so long barren and unfruitful, bare many more children, then the eldest sister did. (Which yet hath no breasts:) That is, she is not yet married, or, of age to marry; the time is not yet come, that the Gentiles should be brought unto Christ, and married to him] what shall we do for our Sister in that day, when she shall be spoken of [That is, when the time of her conversion unto Christ shell be come: what shall we then do or contribute towards her assistance, growth, and establishment in the truth and in the faith. It intimateth and sheweth the duty and office of love that one particular Church oweth unto another in the communication of gifts, and in praying for one another. See Acts 11 vers. 19, 22, 23. Oth. When she shall be spoken against, as the Hebrew letter Beth is taken, Numb. 21. 5. Where it is said, The people spake against God, and against Moseh. So Psal. 119. 25. Princes spake against me. As soon as a people convert themselves unto God, straight way the wicked set themselves against them both in words and works]
\p
\v 9 . If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will compass her about with boards of Cedar. [Some take these words to be the words of Christ: others, to be the words of Sister Churches, wishing and desiring her Prosperity. (If she) To wit, the Church of the Gentiles, (be a wall) that is, firm and strong in the faith, being well grounded upon the foundation of the Doctrine of the twelve tribes of Israel, and of the Apostles. See Rev. 21. Vers. 14. 19. (we, & c) By the word we may be understood the Sister Churches, or Jewish Churches; for by the members thereof the Lord called the Gentiles to the fellowship and communion of Saints, especially and by name by the Holy Apostles, who were all of them Jews born, who as wise builders laid the foundation of this silver-palace, 1 Cor. 3. 10. (will build upon her) That is, we will more and more strengthen and adorn her; to wit, by the word and the preaching of the Gospel. (a palace) Or, castle, or, strong tower, as they are wont to build in or at strong walls of Cities, (of Silver:) This signifieth the pureness, beauty, and lastingness of this palace, being adorned with the gift of Gods Word and Spirit, whereupon she was be to built, for an habitation of God, Eph. 2. 22. (and if she be a door,) That is, if her heart standeth open, to let in the preaching of the Word of God into her heart, and to receive it with joy, (we will compass her about) Or, strengthen, inclose, fence her. The Lord promiseth, Zach. 25. That he will be a wall of fire round about his Church. (with planks, or, boards of Cedar;) That is, with strong palisadores , or others fences. Cedar wood, and the boards or planks that are made of it, are fair, strong, lasting, and of a good smell. Of such kind of wood was Salomons Temple built, 1 Kings 6. 15. By these boards or planks of Cedar may here be understood the word of truth, against which the gates of hell cannot prevail, Matth. 16. 18. And 2 Corinth. 13. 8.]
\p
\v 10 . I am a wall: [That is, I am grown up, and become strong in faith, and in the love of Jesus Christ. In these words the little sister, doth (as in Prophetical and manner) shew her willingness and readiness to receive and entertain the Doctrine of the Gospel, and to grow and increase in it. Others take these words to be the Christ for his grace and mercy, in that she was become a City of God, or was received for the City of God: Or, because her faith was strong like a wall] and my breasts are like towers. [The meaning of these words is, My breasts are grown big, or fully grown, as Ezech. 16. 7, 8. That is, Church-government is settled in me, sufficiently to bring up children unto Christ, feeding them with the milk of the Word of God, 1 Pet. 2 vers. 2. The comparison of towers, signifieth also the strength, power, and glory of the administration of Gospel, and the public preaching and dispensing of it out of pulpits, or high places, to be heard by all. For the Hebrew word migdal is also taken for a pulpit of wood, Neh. 8. 5.] Then was 1 [To wit, when I got or obtained that answer, whereof or mention is made, vers. 9.] in his eyes [ To wit, in the eyes of Jesus Christ,] as one that findeth peace. [Hereby which she receiveth of her Bridegroom, that after long continued misery and affliction, she is comforted and relieved by him. See Isa. chapter 54. V. 7, 8. Etc. See also Eph. 2. Vers. 12, 13, etc. The Spouse speaketh this unto her companions (as one that findeth peace) We are all of us enemies of God, Rom. 5. 10. To wit, being considered in our corruption, or state of nature: but being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our God through our Lord Jesus Christ, Rom. 5. 1. Isa. 32. 17. It is, as if the Spouse here had said, The Bridegroom hath accepted of my faith and diligence, and therefore he was well pleased with me. Others take the meaning of these last words to be this. I was satisfied with that answer, and was well pleased]
\p
\v 11 . Salomon had a vineyard at Baal-Hamon: he gave this vineyard unto keepers, every one brought for the fruit thereof a thousand silverlings. [These words may be taken as spoken by Christ; or, by the Spouse. If they be the words of Christ, then it is a comparison between Salomon and his vineyard, and between Christ and his people. Salomon could not in his own person heed and attend his vineyards, (as neither David could do his, 1 Chronicles 27. 27.) but he appointed officers to keep and attend the same, which paid a yearly rent for them, and themselves enjoyed some profit or benefit thereof for their labour: But Christ, who is always present with his Church, Matth. 28. 20. Revel. 2. Tendeth his own vineyard himself, and therefore all the fruits and profits thereof pertain to him alone. If these be the words of the Spouse, then they signify a greater care and diligence in her now, then in former time, when she confessed, that she had not sufficiently kept, or regarded the vineyard which she had, that is, which she entrusted with, above cha. 1. 6. Of Salomons vineyards, See Eccles. 2. 4. (at Baal Harmon:) Oth. In a fruitfulplace. Heb a master, or, Lord of the multitude, that is, a place that beareth many fruits; Understanding hereby either the World, among the multitude of whose nations Christ hath those that belong unto him, Or else the Church is so called, in respect of the manifold fruits which she yieldeth unto God, or ought to yield, being placed or planted in a fruitful soil, upon which God had poured forth his blessing; See Isai. 5. 1. (He gave this vineyard unto keepers) That is, he let out this vineyard, or put it to farm unto farmers or keepers, to dress and manure it, that it might bring forth much fruit. By the keepers, or dressers of the vineyard, are to be understood the Prophets of the Old, and The Apostles, with their succesors, in the New Testament. See Matth. 21. 33. 1 Cor. 3. 9. (Every one brought for the fruit thereof a thousand silverlings: Or, a thousand (sheckels) of silver;) Hereby signifying the great fruitfulness of his vineyard, which brought in, or yielded so much profit for the owner, besides the gain and profit of the farmer, or of him that had hired it. See also Isa. 7. 23. Of the rate or value of the Silvering, See Genes. 20. 16. And 23. Vers. 15.]
\p
\v 12 . My vineyard, [That is, my Church, as above cha. 1. 6. Isai. 5. 1, 7. They are the words of the Bridegroom] which I have, [That is, which is committed to my care and custody; of which I have the oversight] is before my face: [I myself do continually heed and regard it; I myself take care, that it will be well dressed, & manured: not doing as Salomon, who left the whole care and business to the keepers, I myself in person do mind my vineyard, and my sheep, Ezech. 34. 11, 2 & c. Joh. 10. 14. Revel. 2. 1.] the thousand (silverlings) are for thee O Salomon, [As if he had said, Thou Salomon shalt have thy full rent or revenue, to wit, a thousand silverlings, vers. 11.] but two hundred are for the keepers of the fruit thereof. [That is, the labourers and keepers of the vineyard shall have also their due, every one according to his labour and pains. See Matth. 20. Vers. 1, etc. 1 Cor. 3. 8. Understand withal, But the fruits of the vineyard do wholly and solely belong unto me. This honour do all faithful Ministers of the Church, willingly ascribe and attribute unto their Lord Jesus Christ: we may plant, and water, but it is God alone giveth the increase, 1 Cor. 3. 6, 7. And 15. 10.]
\p
\v 13 . O thou inhabitant of the gardens, [Here Christ speaketh unto his Spouse, who dwelleth in the gardens, that is, who abideth or keepeth in those places, where Churches are planted, in divers Countries and Cities,] the companions attend unto thy voice: [It seemeth that here by the companions must be understood, the other believing Christians, which have obtained like precious faith, 2 Pet. 1. 1. And hear the Doctrine of the Church, and follow it] cause me to hear (it) [To wit, thy voice]
\p
\v 14 . Come quickly ; my best-beloved, [Come quickly Hebr. Flee. It seemeth not be taken so here in this signification. For the Church prayeth not the Christ would Flee, or depart from her, that is the request of the Gadarenes, Matth. 8. 34. But flee signifieth here, come to us as quickly, as a man fleeth, that is pursued. The Spouse prayeth and requesteth, that she may see the end of the Kingdom of Christ in this world, [where he is persecuted and afflicted in his members) and likewise her taking up into the high heavens. Now Christ reigneth in the midst of his enemies, Psa. 110. 2. And that shall henceforth continue so, until he shall have delivered up the Kingdom unto God his Father, 1 Cor. 15. 24, 25. After this day doth the Spouse earnestly long; and wisheth that he may come quickly, and that the Bridegroom would assist her, while she is here below in the conflict or combat, above chapter 2. 17. And that he would hasten his last coming for her deliverance and redemption. Or if we will needs retain the word Barach in its own proper signification, then this must be the rendering and meaning of the words, Flee, my best beloved, .......to the mountains of spices; that is, to the heavens, which are called here the mountains of spices, in respect of the height, the fruit, and delight which shall be for ever at the right hand of God. Above chapter 4. 6. Heaven is called a mountain of myrrhe, and an hill of frankiscense. It is as much as if the Spouse here spake after this manner: Although it would be very pleasing and delightful unto me, to enjoy thy bodily presence continually with me, yet I confess that it is better for me, that thou be in heaven so send from thence the Comforter the Holy Ghost unto me, and to prepare a place for me in thy father’s house, that thou mayest at length receive me unto thyself into everlasting bliss, Job. 14. 2. And 16. 7.] and be thou like a roe, [Which runneth swiftly and speedily; That is, make haste to come to us. See above chapter 2. Vers. 8. 9, 17. As this high Song beginneth with an earnest longing of the Spouse after her Bridegroom, that would kiss with the kisses of his mouth: So it endeth and concludeth with an earnest and fervent longing after the second coming of Christ, when he shall receive and take up his Church into everlasting joy: The Spirit and Bride say, Come, and let him that heareth say, Come. Christ himself saith, I come quickly, Amen. Yea come Lord Jesus. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all, Rev. C. 22. V. 17. 20, 21.]
