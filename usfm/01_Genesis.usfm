\mt2 THE FIRST BOOK OF MOSES CALLED
\mt GENESIS
\s THE ARGUMENT OF THIS BOOK
\p This first book of Moses is by a Greek word , termed Genesis which is as much as to say, birth, source; generation seeing that this is the same there are declared the beginnings which are in the manner the generation Genesis 2.4 of all things visible and invisible which in the beginning were created by God through his word, out of nothing and among the same that of man , endowed with the image of God, and seated in paradise that is persevering in obedience he might have lived forever whereof the tree of life was a visible token to him. Here is laid down the ground of keeping the day of Sabbath together with the institution of marriage. Here we find the original rise of sin, of death and of manner of miseries, powered up like a mighty torrent upon all mankind through disobedience of Adam and Eve in eating the forbidden fruit. Yet with all ye have likewise here the first promise of grace, touching man’s redemptions, b y the seed of woman which God of his mercy will give in due time for the bruise of the serpent who had seduced man to disobedience together with the sin and death and to restore again the gifts of life and righteousness which were quiet lost and forfeited. Here we find the first rudiments and fundamentals of sound doctrines of the true religion and worship of God introduced together with the promise aforesaid and consequently the history of a true church how the same was not only carefully gathered by the ministry of Adam, of Abel whom Cain murdered of Seth, Enoch, Noah and others, but graciously also preserved by God unto Noah besides they are in the book set down the beginnings of the Kainites apostasy which y the rejecting of the truth, falsifying of God’s worship and contempt of godliness did separate themselves from the holy people and by the enormous sins and pollutions, healed down at last upon themselves the punishment of the general deluge; wherein nevertheless God saved Noah and his family. Thereupon follows the beginning of the worlds restoration after the said deluge the pedigree of the nations the first promise of the calling of the gentiles the beginning of the first monarchy the division of the languages and the first genealogy serving the calculation of time and the distinguishing of nations the main aim of Moses in the mean time being to shew forth the reestablishing of the church which being sprung the main aim of Moses in the mean time being to shew forth the re-establishing o the church which being sprung forth out of the small company of Noah’s household after that it had been preserved a log time in the generation of Sem, fell likewise away at length in idolatry. And although Melchizedek and his were yet a remnant of the church nevertheless it pleased God to single out a certain lineage only of Sem and posterity to set the same apart from all the nations and hallow it for his own peculiar people. For this end he received Abraham and his posterity of his meer grace and calling him out of Ur in Chaldea where he had been an idolater into the land of Canaan and making promise unto him as of other temporal and spiritual blessing so especially that the messiah should be born of the seed and the striking covenant with him which he established the sign of circumcision. After that Isaac is born unto him in whom that seed was to be called and not in Ishmael whom he had gotten before thy Hagar nor in the children that were born unto him after the death of Sarah by Ketura nevertheless he is commanded to offer up thy son in sacrifice and though God suffered him not to execute the same yet having shewed his obedience God rewards him with a renewing of the former promises . from Isaac the inheritance of the promise descended upon Jacob to whom the right of primogeniture or first birth right is ordained by God sold by Esau avouched and ratified by the blessing of Isaac fro Jacob it is derived down in his posterity as appeareth by his prophetical benediction this chosen generation maintained all along in the true doctrine of the pure worship governing them by his word and spirit protecting them against their enemies and exercising them with many troubles and afflictions wherein nevertheless he comforted them ever and anon by his oracle and apparitions and helped them out of their thrills of singular deliverances all this while they wanted not a discovery of divers human frailties here and there even in the chiefest of these o these holy patriarchs which God graciously gave them of the messiah’s sake whom they embraced by upright faith with true repentance these things are very lively held forth to us in the several adventure of Abraham and Isaac in Canaan , Egypt and Gerar, and in those of Jacob and Joseph in Canaan Mesopotamia and Egypt at last they both die leaving them in posterity but likewise for the eternal concerning their own dying persons the last whose death we have recorded in the book of Joseph with whose life also this book ends comprehending a history above 2300 years.

\s God created the heaven and the earth verse 1,2 and the light on the first day 3 on the second the firmament or expansion severe the lowermost or uppermost waters 6 on the third he severeth the dry land and the waters 9 createth grass and fruitful trees 11 on the forth the sun moon and stars 14 on the first great and small fishes together with the fowls blessing them 20 on the sixth the beasts of the earth 24 and at the last man male and female according to his own image 26 likewise distinguishing the food of man and that of the beast 29 and approving all his creatures to be good 31.
\p
\v 1 In the beginning [viz. of the creation of all creatures which by creation received their being because there was none of them before only God was and is without beginning Psalms 90.2 Proverbs 8.22,23 Colossians 1.17 compare this with John 1.1] God created [to create in this chapter and elsewhere is as much as to say to make some excellent thing that was not before whether it be out of nothing verse 1 or out of somewhat else firsts created out of nothing as verse 21, 27 of the Hebrew word Elohim rendered God here see below chapter 20 on verse 13.] the heaven and the earth [by the heaven or heavens the Hebrew word using the word in the singular number and the earth there may be understood in the first verse either the heaven and the earth as they were created on the first day or all this world with all the creatures of heaven and earth therein contained compare Genesis 2.1.]
\p
\v 2 . Now the earth [understand here the earth which now is so namely as in that beginning it was created on the first day not as it became or was fashioned afterwards by the successive acts of creation ] was waste and void [ Heb wastness and deformity and emptiness or vanity which is said being destitute yet that shape order distinctness and calmness usefulness and inhabitants which afterwards it was furnished and embellished withal the Hebrew here used in the write imply the utmost devastation and desolation hideousness vanity nothingness or emptiness of anything see Deuteronomy 32.10 1Samuel 12.21 Job 12.24 Psalms 107.40 Isaiah 34.11 and 44.9 Jeremiah 4.23] and darkness was upon abyss [Heb. upon the face of the abyss that is upon the deep and bottomless waters which covered the earth like a garment and stood above the mountain Psalms 104.6 see 2 Peter 3.5 ] and the spirit of God [understand here by the word spirit the holy ghost not the wind which was not yet created] wavered[ or hovered or bestirred himself viz. for to sustain and foment the first being and condition of the earth and waters as they were then that through the powerful operation of the spirit there might be brought forth thence such excellent creatures it seems to be an allusion to such fowls and birds as fit hatching on their eggs to brig forth young ones thence and afterwards do hover and flutter over them to tend ease and cherish them in their feeble condition see Deuteronomy 32.11] upon the waters [that is upon the surface or uppermost part of the waters that covered the earth.]
\p
\v 3 . And God said [God saying is his will and command and deed Psalms 33.9 and 140.5 which he did execute by the essential word which was God and with God from eternity John 1.1, 2 Psalms 3.6] let there be light [that is a clear bright luminous substance enlightening the dark lump or chaos by its circuit constituting day and night] and there was light.
\p
\v 4 . And God saw the light that it was good [spoken of God after the manner of men the meaning is Gos approved of his creatures that is called good here which is pleasing to God godly and lovely in itself useful and serviceable to the creature especially to man] and God made partition between light and the darkness [viz. so as that the light succeeded the darkness and the darkness the light to make up night and day by turns.]
\p
\v 5 . And the Lord called the light day and the darkness night and he had been evening and morning first day [Heb. one day but it is very usual with the Hebrews to put on for first as Genesis 8.5 Numbers 29.1 Matthew 28.1 1Corinthians 16.2 the meaning of these words is that night and day had made up one natural day together with which the Hebrew began with the evening the darkness having been before the light and ended with the approach of the next evening comprehending twenty four hours.]
\p
\v 6 . And god said let there be expansion [the Heb. word he used cometh from a root that signified to spread forth or stretch abroad and by it is there to be understood here all the space that is comprehended between the nethermost and uppermost waters] in the midst of the waters and let that divide [Heb. be making divisions or partitions] between waters and waters [which are explained in the next verse.]
\p
\v 7 . And God made that expansion and made that partition between the waters that are under expansion [viz. within and upon the earth Heb. that are from under &c as so verse 9] and between the waters that are above expansion [Heb. from above &c. understand the clouds which are carried and the nethermost part of this expanded space or happily some other waters which may have taken their place in the upper region after partition] and it was thus.
\p
\v 8 . And God called the expansion heaven then it had been evening and hit had been morning the second day.
\p
\v 9 . And God said let the waters from under the heaven be gathered together in one place and let the dry land be seen [ by that it appears that the superficies or surfaces of the earth was all covered over before with water even the mountains themselves as was noted above verse 2] and it was thus.
\p
\v 10 . And God called the dry land earth and the gathering of water seas [ not sea but seas in regard that the Hebrews do they understand not only the main sea as Ecclesiastes 1.7 likewise al other particular and midland seas, lakes, gulfs, and gatherings or confluences of waters see Genesis 14.3 Exodus 14.23 numbers 34.11 Matthew 4.18 John 21.1 and elsewhere] and God saw that it was good.
\p
\v 11 . And God said let the earth sprout forth grass sprouts seed sowing herbs [that is such as of the felt doth yield bringing forth bear spread and shed seeds see below verse 12 & 29] the fruitful tree bearing fruits [ Heb. wood of fruit] according to its kind whose seed shall therein upon the earth and it was thus.
\p
\v 12 . And the earth brought forth grass sprouts seed sowing herbs according to its kind and the fruit bearing tree whose seed was therein and God saw that it was good.
\p
\v 13 . Then it had been evening and it had been morning the third day.
\p
\v 14 . and god said let there be expansion of the heaven [see psalms 74.16 ] to make partition between the day and between the night and let there be for signs and for set time and for das and years [that they may serve for signing and marking out of different constitution o times and seasons as spring and summer , autumn, winter, the lengthening, shortening, equalizing of night and day eclipses &c. together with the observations of set or certain days and weeks and months and years in the behalf as well the church as of the state civil and the household of household affairs and actions in this life.]
\p
\v 15 . And let them be for life in the expansion of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was thus.
\p
\v 16 . Then God made the two great lights [Viz. the sun and the moon which are called great in regard of their outward appearance and as they come under the apprehension of outer sight and by reason likewise of their singular influence and operation] the great light for the dominion of the day and that little light [viz. in comparison of the sun] for the dominion of the night also of the stars.
\p
\v 17 . And God put them [Heb. gave them] in the expansion of heaven to give light upon the earth.
\p
\v 18 . And for to have dominion in the day in the night and for to make partition between the light and between the darkness and God saw that it was good.
\p
\v 19 . Then it had been evening and it had been morning the fourth day.
\p
\v 20 . And God said let the waters bring fourthly abundantly crawling of living souls [Heb. crawling or creeping souls meaning such creatures thereby as have life and sense and therefore move and stir about especially in the sea and other waters by swimming implied in this place though otherwise the Hebrew word here rendered crawling is likewise applied to the creature flying in the air Leviticus 11.20 or creeping upon the earth in the same chapter verse 44] and let the fowl fly above the earth above the expansion of the heaven [Heb. in or to the face of the expansion of the heaven.]
\p
\v 21 . And God created [ see the note above verse 1]the great whale and every living creeping souls [the Hebrew word signified not only the swimming creature as here and Leviticus 11.46 and Psalms 69.35 but also which creepeth upon the earth or by lifting up the feet doth go and tread on it as below verse 24,25,26,28,30 and chapter 6.20 and 7.8 and Psalms 104.20] which the waters bought forth abundantly after their kind and all winged fowls [‘Heb all or every fowl of the wing and so likewise Psalms 78.27.] after its kind and God saw that it was good.
\p
\v 22 . And God blessed them [that is God gave them ability to maintain and increase their kind of propagation see below verse 28 and elsewhere also] saying be fruitful and multiply and replenish the waters in the seas and let the fowl multiply upon the earth.
\p
\v 23 . Then it had been even and it had been morning the fifth day.
\p
\v 24 . And God said let the earth bring living souls [Heb. souls see above verse 20.] after their kind cattle [the Heb. word doth signify here all manner of tame four-footed beasts conversing among men and serviceable for their work food and raiment] and creeping creatures [see above verse 21] and the savage beasts of the earth after its kind and it was thus.
\p
\v 25 . And God made the savage beast of the earth after the kind and the cattle after its kind and all the creeping creatures of the earth after its kind and God saw that it was good.
\p
\v 26 . And God said let us [God speak here in the plural number as doth he likewise immediately after saying after our image after our likeness as consulting with himself after the manner of men to represent unto us the divine trinity and the Excellency of this last creature men] make man [hominem that is male and female as appearreth by the sequel let them have dominion and by verse 27 and chapter5 verse 2] after [ Hebrew in] our likeness [these two words seem to have one and the dame signification in regard that in this matter this only one is sometimes put in the lieu of both see the next verse chapter 5.1 by image and likeness there principally to be understood the true knowledge of God Colossians 3.10 true righteousness and holiness Ephesians4. 24] and let them have dominion over fishes [Heb. fish as also verse 28.] in the sea and over the fowls of the heaven and over the cattle [the word is taken here in a larger sense then above verse 24 where it is distinguished from a savage beasts which here are comprehended under the word Bohema ] and over the whole earth and over all the creeping creatures that creep upon the earth.
\p
\v 27 . And God created man Hominem after his image after the image of God he created him [that is not after the image of man created as the foregoing words might be construed but after the image of God that did create him compare below chapter 5.1 and 9 verse 6] male and female created by them.
\p
\v 28 . And God blessed them [see the annotate on verse 22 although this word be of larger extent here as the text is self shewed] and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fishes of the sea and the fowls of the heaven and over all the beasts that creepeth [see on verse 21] upon the earth.
\p
\v 29 . And God said behold I have given ye all the seed sowing herb that is upon the whole earth [Heb. the face of &c.] and all the tree in which there is seed-sowing fruit let it be unto ye for food.
\p
\v 30 . But unto all the beast of the earth and fowls of the heaven and to all the creeping beasts of the earth there is a living soul have I given the entire green herb. [Heb. all the green of the verdure of the herb the words have I given are inserted here of the foregoing verse] and it was thus.
\p
\v 31 . And God saw all that it had made and behold it was vey good [these words behold and very are added here by Moses the greater to express the greatness and Excellency of this work and extraordinary delight which God took in all works and especially in the creation of man] then it had been even and it had been even the sixth day.
\c 2
\s God resteth upon the seventh day verse 1,2 blesseth and halloweth it verse 3 appointeth natural means of the fruitful earth 5 a more particular account of the account of the creation of man his body and soul 7 God putteth man into paradise 8 which is described by the four rivers of it 9 the inhibition and touching of the tree of knowledge of good and evil 17 Adam gives names to the beasts 19 the further relation of the woman creation 21 who is known and kindly received by Adam 23 the state of matrimony 24 men’s nakedness 25.
\p
\v 1 Thus are heaven [that is the air, heaven, sun, and moon and stars together with the third heaven and the inhabitants thereof the holy angels as also are termed the host of heaven 1Kings 22.19 compare above chapter 1 verse 1] and the earth accomplished and all their hosts [the creature comprehended in heaven and earth are called the hosts not only by reason of their great multitude and diversity their exact order singular lust and decency but also for that they are all entertained and governed by God as their commander general and must always stand ready for their service thus Psalms 103.21 Isaiah 45.12.]
\p
\v 2 . Now then when on the seventh day God had accomplished his works that he had made he rested [spoken of God after the manner of men for he is said here to have rested not as being wearied with working but only for having ceased to create any new kind of things seeing that he worketh still hitherto in the maintaining and governing of what he created Isaiah 40.28 John 5.17] on the seventh day from his work that he had made.
\p
\v 3 . And God blessed the seventh day [that is God exalted that day above the rest compare the word blessed with Genesis 24.31 the excellence consist in the use which is intimated by the word following hallowed it which implies the setting apart of something from common to an holy use so Exodus 13.2 Leviticus 8.10 Numbers 7.1 1Kings 8.64 &c ] and hallowed it for that he had rested on the same from all his works which God hath created to perfect it [that is to fit the same as now they are to all such uses and ends are suitable to the wisdom of God in the comeliest and convenient manner to everyone kind others which God made creation.]
\p
\v 4 . These are generations [that is the original sources or beginnings compare Psalms 90.2 with the notes] of heaven and earth as they wee created in the day which the Lord [after the fulfilling of the of creation the name of JEHOVAH is here first of all attributed to God signifying one-self existing self-subsisting , self-being , being and subsisting of himself from eternity to eternity and primordial cause of the being of all things wherefore also this name is attributed to none but to the true God alone observe here once for all wherever ye find the LORD written in the capital letters that there in the Hebrew text it stands the word JEHOVAH or shorter JAH being all one ] God made the earth an the heaven.
\p
\v 5 . And every bush of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it sprout forth [viz. before their creating when they had no being yet ] for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there had been no man till husband the earth [the meaning is that God had made the plants, herbs ,bushes trees to come forth out of the earth on the third day of the creation merely by his almighty word without any means of either the rain of the air or the labor help of the man that were existent yet.]
\p
\v 6 . But there was gone up [viz. after that for Moses now relate the ordinary means appointed by God in nature for the bringing of the forth herbs bushes and trees out of the earth viz. the damp which causeth the rain and moistened the earth] a damp out of the earth[which being through a sun-drawn up out of the water and the earth ascended into the middle region of the air whereby the means of the coldness thereof it is turned into clouds and thence afterwards returns again dissolved in rain whereby the earth comes to be moistened ] and moistened the whole earth[ Heb. whole face of the earth.]
\p
\v 7 . And the LORD God had formed [or shape fashioned viz. as a potter forms some vessels out clay Isaiah 45.9 Romans 9.28 understand this in regard of the body of man] man out of dust of the earth [ Heb. dust out of the earth ] blown into his nostrils by breath of life [this is said of God after the manner of men and sheweth us that the soul of men is not created out of any precedence matter like the souls of beasts Genesis 1.20 ,21,24 but put unto him from without out of it nothing through the spirit of God ] thus man became living soul [that is a creature endured with life consisting of a body and rational and immortal soul making up man together.]
\p
\v 8 . Also the Lord God hath planted [viz. on the third day of the creation before man was created] a garden [viz. the paradise or garden of pleasures which God had appointed for mans habitation ] in Eden [ Eden is the name of the country of Thessalor the upper part of Chaldea as may be seen 2Kings 19.12 and is distinguished from another Eden situated by Damascus in Syria whereof see Amos 1.5 the Hebrew word Eden signifieth pleasure delight recreation and thus this land is called by reason of beauty pleasantness and excellence of it as the same appeareth by the next verse of the chapter as also by Ezekiel 28.13 and 31.16,18 Isaiah 51.3] towards the east [Heb. from east out of the east that is to say in the eastern part of Eden or eastward from the place where Moses was in writing this ] and thee be put the man whom he had formed.
\p
\v 9 . And the Lord God had made every tree to sprout forth out o the earth desirable for sight and good for food [understand this of the fruit of the tree ] and the tree of life [ that is a token of life signifying that man hath received and should hold and continue his life at God hands if he continued his obedience until it should please God to take him up into his celestial mortality ] in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil [thus called the man by eating the should find or hath found experimentally what good he was forfeit or into what evil he was to fall thereby.]
\p
\v 10 . And a river [ some are of opinion that this is to be understood of a river Euphrates which riseth out of the great mountains Armenia mixing itself afterwards with a river Hiddikel or Tigris whence after the two other rivers Pison and Gibon do divide themselves &c but the proper and exact conditions of some rivers is somewhat uncertain now and much diversity of opinions among the learned about them] was issuing forth out of Eden [ see above the notes of verse 8 it ran through Eden to in and through the garden that lay in the land of Eden ] for to water this garden; and was divided thence and became four heads [that is capital rivers principally streams. The word head implies streams or sources of the rivers.]
\p
\v 11 . The name of the first river is Pison [Heb. Pischon this name occurs to nowhere else in the scripture but here it is an arm of river Euphrates falling as some conceive into Tigris beneath Apanea and from thence into the Persian sea surnamed by the inhabitants thereabouts Pasitigris and Pasotigris ] this is the same which runneth about [Heb. is running about ] all the land of Havila [Heb. Chavila this is the name of a country otherwise according to the conjecture of some learned men called from Susan the metropolis whereof see Ester 1.2 , Daniel 8.2 see likewise of another Havila Genesis 25.18 1Samuel 15.7 ] there the gold is.
\p
\v 12 . And the gold of the land is good there is likewise Bedola [this some hold to be the name of a certain tree others take it to be a token a precious stone Numbers 11.7 the color of manna is likened to that of Bedola] and the stone sardonyx [Heb schoham the name of a precious stone whereof there are likewise various opinion this name is likewise found Exodus 25.7 and 28.9 Ezekiel 28.13 &c.]
\p
\v 13 . And the name of the send river is Gibon [Heb. Gichon called the inhabitants as some do write Nahar sares ] this is the same which runneth about all the land of Cus [this word otherwise comprehend Ethiopia Arabia and the whole tract towards the south in general but here in particular it donates only Arabia Desert bordering upon Chaldea.]
\p
\v 14 . And the name of the third river is Hiddekel [Heb. Chiddekel this properly is the river Tigris Daniel 10.4 having as yet the name o Diglats or Tiglats as some do some do write but here it is an arm of Euphrates running into the river Tigris & therefore also called Tigris [this same is going towards the east of Assur from Assur the son of Sem Genesis 10.22 ] and the forth river is Phrath [understand the principal arm of Euphrates which for being great retain the name of the whole river of this river see below 15.18 Deuteronomy 1.7 Jeremiah 13.4.]
\p
\v 15 . So the LORD God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to husband the same and to keep the same.
\p
\v 16 . And the Lord God commanded the man [Heb. to or over the man viz. both male and female together see Genesis 3.1 ,3] saying of all or every tree of this garden shalt thou freely eat [Heb eating shalt thou eat this manner of speaking where one verb is doubled thus is very frequent in scripture and serveth to sharpen attention to add special weight and efficacy to the expression suitable to the matter treated of so also in the next verse item chapter 3 verse 4 , 16 and 17.13 and 18.18 Joshua 24.10 Jeremiah 24.17 &c.]
\p
\v 17 . But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil of that shalt not eat for on the day thou eatest thereof that shall die the death 1 the corporal together with al manner of proceeding miseries 2 the spiritual death of the soul 3 the everlasting one of the body and the soul together.]
\p
\v 18 . Also the Lord God had spoken it is not good that the man should not be alone l shall make him a help to be over against him [or before him that is one that is always like him in his presence well liking to him and ready still to serve and succor him and so below verse 20.]
\p
\v 19 . For when the Lord God had made out the earth all the beasts of the field and all the fowls of heaven he brought them [ or made them come ] to Adam [ otherwise to the man and so in the sequel ] for to see how he would call them as so as Adam should call every living soul [see above chapter 1.20 ] that should be its name [or that became or was its name.]
\p
\v 20 . So Adam gad named the names of the cattle and of the fowls of heaven and of all the beasts of the field but for the man [that is for himself] be found no help to be over against him.
\p
\v 21 . Then the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one his ribs and closed the place therefore with flesh [that is for instead of the ribs he had taken forth he made flesh wherewith he closed the gap again.]
\p
\v 22 . And the Lord God built the rib which he had taken from Adam into a woman [a comparison taken from the building of the house by a special master builder for a worthy use and design] and he brought to Adam.
\p
\v 23 . Then said Adam this now is bone of my bones and flesh o my flesh [or now is thee and see that is now at length I have gotten a companion like myself which I sought formerly but found not] they shall call her manes for being taken out of man.
\p
\v 24 . Therefore shall the man forsake his father and mother and cleave unto his wife [this doth not to take away the love and honor we owe unto our parents but differenteth only the manner of cohabitation and the strictness of the conjunction] and they shall be one flesh.
\p
\v 25 . And they were both naked Adam and his wife and were not ashamed [by reason of their perfection and innocence whereby they saw nothing dishonorable in their bodies nor had unclean motions o their souls.]
\c 3
\s The devil tempted the woman by the serpent verse 1 the woman is seduced and trespasseth as also the man verse 6 whereof they have an immediate comprehension 7 upon both their confession God pronounceth sentence upon the serpent the woman , and the man with insert promises of the savior 8 Adam called his wife Heavy 20 God gets them both apparel , mocks them, debars them from tree of life and banished them out of paradise.
\p
\v 1 Now the serpent was more subtle then the beasts of the field which the Lord God had made [this creature being very subtle the devil abuse here thereby to seduce man from God his creator from whom he himself together with all his evil angels was fallen away before John 8.44 2Peter 2.4 Jude verse 6 for which reason he is likewise called a serpent and the serpent 2Corinthians 11.3 Revelations 20.2] and he said [that is the devil space through her using a most subtle and deceitful way of the reasoning the words of this text and the sequel plainly show ] to be woman is it that God also say ye shall not eat of every tree of this garden ? [the devil plays with God’s command and labors by ambiguity to question the same or to obscure it and so to render it of no effect.]
\p
\v 2 . And the woman said to the serpent of the fruit of the trees of this garden we shall eat [that is we are freely permitted to eat.]
\p
\v 3 . But of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden God hath said ye shall not eat of that or touch of the same [viz. to eat thereof] that ye die not [ otherwise that peradventure ye die not ; conceiving that Eva began to waver her already.]
\p
\v 4 . Then said the serpent of the woman ye shall not [a bold shameless and palpable lie of the devil for which he is justly called a liar and the father of lies John 8.44] die the death [Heb. dying die others read these words ye shall not surely die.]
\p
\v 5 . But God knows that on the day ye shall eat thereof then shall your eyes be opened and ye shall be as God [or as Gods] knowing the good and the evil [the word knowing hath a double sense viz. to get and comprehend wisdom whereby one may attain to glory and happiness or to find and fill misery whereby one becomes wretched and forlorn the former sense Satan promiseth deceitfully knowing well enough that only the latter was to ensue of necessity.]
\p
\v 6 . And the woman saw that the same tree was good for food that it was pleasure for the eyes yea a tree that was desirable [otherwise to be wished or longed for] to give understanding [or for to get understanding] and she took of its fruit and she did eat and she gave also to her husband with her [or being with or by here] and he did eat [viz. being enticed to it by the woman as appeareth below verse 17.]
\p
\v 7 . Then the eyes of them both were opened [understand here not so much the eyes of the body whereby they saw their nakedness and the eyes of the mind whereby the came to discover their sin and the punishments which thereby they had brought upon themselves and posterity being sufficiently convinced thereof of their consciences] and they perceived that they were naked and they plighted fig-tree leaves together and themselves aprons [otherwise covering to hide their nakedness.]
\p
\v 8 . And they heard the voice of the Lord God [or the sound of &c.] walking in the garden art the wind of the day [that is to say as some expound it in the cool and windy part of the morning or evening or at the blowing of a certain wind on a set time of the day whereby the voice of the Lord was conveyed to Adam] then Adam hid himself and the wife before the face of the Lord God in the midst of a trees of the garden.
\p
\v 9 . And the Lord God called Adam and said unto him where thou art?
\p
\v 10 . And he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid for I am naked therefore I hid me.
\p
\v 11 . And he said who had made known to thee that thou art naked? Hast thou eaten of that tree of which I enjoined thee and that shouldst not eat thereof?
\p
\v 12 . Then said Adam: The woman thou gavest by me [ otherwise didst put by me that is she whom thou didst give and put to be by or with me] the same hath given me of that tree [that is of the fruit of the tree as above likewise verse 6 ] and I have eaten.
\p
\v 13 . And the Lord said unto the woman what is this that thou hast hath done? [Or what hast thou done that? Or why hast done that?] And the woman said the serpent did deceive me and I did eat.
\p
\v 14 . Then said the Lord God to the serpent [as having been the devil’s instrument by reason of which this whole curse doth corporally reach the serpent itself and spiritually the devil yet the serpent is not questioned or examined here as Adam and Eve were before the devil being without excuse ] because thou hast done this thou art [or be thou as chapter 4.11 ] curse above all the cattle and above all the beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.
\p
\v 15 . And I shall put enmity between thee and between this woman [this sentence is principally denounced against the devil as the chiefest cause of man’s fall ] and between thy seed [understand hereby all the children of the devil John 8.44] and between her seed [ this seed is properly the Lord Jesus Christ alone the only begotten son of God who was to be born in the fullness of time of a woman being a virgin by the operation of the holy ghost for to dispossess the devil through the merit of his death and the power of his spirit and all this force and to tread him under his and his churches feet see Psalms 110.1 and John 12.31 Romans 16.20 Hebrews 2.14 and 1 John 3.8 this is the first gospel promise of life put in opposition to the first preceding denunciation of death ] that same shall thy head and thy shalt bruise its heels [that is the devil and his seed shall persecute Christ and his church but never be able to extirpate or destroy them.]
\p
\v 16 . To the woman he [viz. God ] said I shall much multiply [Heb. multiplying multiply ] the pain namely of thy bearing with pain shall that bring forth children [Heb. sons this word is much used in the scripture to signify children that is both sons and daughters so Exodus 22.24 Psalms 128.6] and thy desire shall be to thy husband [that is thou shalt be obliged to bend to thy husband s will and seek for protection under him and to be ruled by him] and he shall have dominion over thee [that is he shall power to command thee which shall be troublesome now for thy flesh whereas the fall it was not but delightful.]
\p
\v 17 . And to Adam he said because thou hast hearkened [see the annotate above on verse 6] after the voice of thy wife and eaten of that tree whereof I commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat thereof be the earth therefore accused for thy sake [see Romans 8.19, 20, 21] and with pain shalt thou eat thereof the days of thy life [that is thou shalt not sustain the days of thy self with a great deal of toil and trouble upon the earth.]
\p
\v 18 . Also it shall bring there forth the thorns and thistles and thou shalt eat the herb of the field [or the growth field which thou shalt be put to find without this garden whose fits thou shalt be debarred of.]
\p
\v 19 . In the sweat of thy countenance thou shalt eat bread [that is get food and nourishment thus the word bread is taken for all manner of food and sustenance below chapter 18.5 and 28.20] until thou return to the earth [until thou die] because thou art taken out of it for thou art dust unto dust and thou shalt return.
\p
\v 20 . And Adam called the name of his wife Hevah [Heb. Chavah] for being the mother of all living [the Heb. hath it in the singular number that is of all man or of every human person.]
\p
\v 21 . And the Lord God made coat to Adam and his wife of skins and appareled them.
\p
\v 22 . Then said the Lord behold the man has become one of us knowing the good and the evil [God doth here expropriate unto men his arrogance of conceiting that he should be like God whereas now on the contrary he had brought himself and all the posterity into the gratest misery and baseness ] now then that he may not put forth his hand and take likewise to the tree of life and eat and live forever [ God would not suffer men to make use of the token of life having forfeited the same by his transgression.]
\p
\v 23 . Therefore the Lord God dismists him out of the Garden of Eden for to husband the ground out of which he was taken.
\p
\v 24 . And he drove the men out and put Cherubim’s [understand hereby angels called thus and known by this name Israelites seeing the ark of the covenant within the holy of holies was covered with two Cherubim’s in the human shape with wings spread abroad Exodus 25.16 1Kings 6.23 2 Chronicles 3.10] towards the east of the garden of Eden and fiery blade of a sword [whether it was fiery indeed or had the resemblance of a mounting flame ] turning itself [or wavering shaking to and fro] for to guard of the tree of life.

\s Cain and Habel are born verse1 both offer but Habel’s offering is acceptable to the Lord 3 at which Cain vexeth and is approved for it by God 5 he slays his brother 8 God questioned him for it and dooms him 9 he wandreth from God falls to building and gets children 19 speaks haughtily and presumptuously 23 Seth and enos are born and the public worship of God is settled again 25.
\p
\v 1 And Adam acknowledged Heva his wife [understand hereby the communion that is between man and wife for the propagation of children see below verse 17 and 25 item chapter 19.8 and 24.16 1Samuel 1.19 Matthew 1.25] and she conceived and bear Cain [Heb. Kejin that is gotten] and said I have gotten a man [that is a son ] of or from the Lord [the Hebrew particle eth is sometimes taken for meeth that is of or from out of whereof see Jeremiah 51 on verse 59 others with the Lord that is through the grace and help of the Lord others the Lord as if Hevah hath conceived she had gotten the promise of Messiah now.]
\p
\v 2 . And she continues to bear his brother Habel and Habel [the Heb. Hebel] became a shepherd [Heb. a herdsman of small cattle such as are sheep and goats the Hebrew word signifying both alike so below verse 4 and chapter 13.5 and 26.14 &c] and Cain became husbandmen.
\p
\v 3 . And it happened at the end some days [Heb from the end of the days that is after the time of some days past the word days standing alone is sometimes taken in holy writ for to signify some days as below chapter 24.55 and 40.4 Judges 14.8 Mark 2.1] that Cain brought an offering [Heb. Mincha that is a gift present or meat offering see Leviticus 2 on verse 1] of the fruit of the ground.
\p
\v 4 . And Habel he brought likewise of the first born of his sheep and of their fat [Heb their fatness understand hereby that Habel offered not only the fat also the very best of his flock; and (as it seems) a good number of them. Fat doth often betoken the best of choice of something in the holy scripture; as Numbers 18.12 &c.] And the Lord looked on Habel and his offering. [That is the person and offering of Habel was acceptable to God because his faith looking on the offering of the promised Messiah; see Hebrews 11.4]
\p
\v 5 . But Cain and his offering he looked not upon [this the apostle cleareth Hebrews 11.4 speaking of the testimony which God gave over Habel’s gifts whether it was by words or by the fire from heaven or by the manifest token compare Leviticus 9.24 Judges 6.21 1Kings 18.38 1Chronicles 21.26 2Chronicles 7.1 ] then Cain grew incensed very much [Heb. and it viz. anger incensed Cain and so in the next verse see the like manner of speaking the word anger or worth being added to it below chapter 39.19 Exodus 32.10,11] and his countenance grew dejected [that is the aspect and favor of his countenance changed.]
\p
\v 6 . And the Lord said to Cain why art thou incensed? And why is thou countenance dejected?
\p
\v 7 . is there not whiles thou dost well exalting? [that is shall not thou as the first born remain exalted and lifted up above thy brother / others shouldst not thou lift up thy head or countenance freely ? instead of being cast down or dejected now in this manner others for exalting read accepting acceptableness or forgiving according to the various signification of the Hebrew word ] or if thou dost not well the sin [that is the punishment of sin so below chapter 19.15 Leviticus 5.1 Numbers 18.1 see below the annotate on verse 13] lies at the door [that is very near and ready to hand so that there can be no doubt of its ensuing compare Matthew 24.33 James 5.9] his desire is to thee [this is to be understood of Habel and Karin’s brother as if God said but as for thy brother thy hast incensed against him he being well affected to thee and content that thou shalt be preferred before him as the first born compare above chapter 3.16] and thou shalt have dominion over him.
\p
\v 8 . And Cain spake with his brother Habel [that namely as some conceive by a pleasing look and insinuating words he might allure him forth into the field alone his heart harboring the while nothing but hate and murder against him Heb. said to his brother viz. as some understand it that which past between God and him so that it should be an abrupt discourse] and it happened as they were in the field and Cain raised up against his brother Habel and slew him.
\p
\v 9 .And the LORD said to Cain ;where is thy brother Habel ?and he said ;l know it not :[An impudent lie]am l my brother’s keeper ?[Presumptuous arrogance.]
\p
\v 10 . And he [the LORD namely] said; what hast thou done? There is a voice of blood [Heb .blood in the plural. So the scripture speaks of murder, because of the abundance of blood that shed thereby] of thy brother which cryeth to me [Hebrew which are crying, in the plural again: Murder is one of those sins that cry for vengeance; wherefore see like wise below chapter18.20.and19.13] from the ground.
\p
\v 11 . And now art thou accursed; from the ground; [or by reason of the ground. See chapter .5.29.as if he should say; The earth, which was created for thy blessing and service, shall execute this curse against thee in vengeance, not yielding thee the fruits, which other wise it would have done; as is expressed verse .12.] This opened its mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand.
\p
\v 12 . When thou shalt husband the ground, it shall no more give thee its ability: [Heb it shall not go on to give thee its ability] thou shalt be straggling and wandering upon the earth. [/between two sold disquiet, one bodily, he being to wander from one country to another; the other spiritual, his conscience, which ever followed him, not suffering him to enjoy any rest, but keeping him in perpetual fear of vengeance.]
\p
\v 13 .And Cain said to the LORD; my misdeed is greater then to be pardoned.[otherwise the word misdeed, iniquity , is taken by many for the punishment therefore; see Levit.5.verse 1.and in this sense the text should be read thus ;My punishment is greater then l shall be able to bear .Where Cain is represented as complaining .]
\p
\v 14 . Behold thou hast expelled me this day from the ground [Heb. from the face of the ground viz. by the sentence of thine which is as firm and sure as if it were executed already ] and I shall be hid before thy face [ this may be understood of Akins being banished out of the Gods grace and savior and with all out of communion of his church and people ] and I shall be straggling and wandering upon the earth and it shall come to pass that all or everyone that finds me shall slay me.
\p
\v 15 . Ye the Lord said to him therefore whoever slays Cain shall undergo a seven fold revenge [that is a manifold one according to the usual expression of the holy wits Psalms 12.7 & 79.12 & this sentence is given that Cain wandering along time from country to country he might be a warning example to others t beware o shedding blood and have the more time of repentance seeing that hither to he was only troubled at the punishment ] and the Lord set a mark on Cain [what kind of a mark that was is unknown but it made him known who he was and what he had done and that none should adventure to kill him ] that not all [ or everyone ] should slay him that found him.
\p
\v 16 . And Cain went forth from the face of the Lord [see above verse 14] and he dwelt in the land of the Nod [this land is so called in regard of punishment God laid upon Cain verse 12 for the Hebrew word used both here and there doth signify to wander about ] towards the east of Eden.
\p
\v 17 . And Cain acknowledge his wife and she conceived and here Hanoch [Heb. he was building &c. that is he busied himself with building of a city of his security his conscience still terrified him the honest patriarch dwell for the most part in tents not in cities Hebrews 11.9, 10] and the name of the city he called after his sons name Hanoch.
\p
\v 18 . And to Hanoch was born Hirad and Hirad begat Mechujael and Mechujael begat Methusael and Methusael begat Lamech.
\p
\v 19 . And Lamech took to himself two wives [this Lamech is the first man recorded to have two wives together directly against Gods ordinance above chapter 2.24Malachi 2.15] the name of the first was Ada and the name of the second was Zilla.
\p
\v 20 . And Ada bear Jabal this hath been a father of them that inhabited tents and kept cattle [that is he was the first inventor of making and using of the tents for the holding and keeping of cattle as the following word seems to import though otherwise it signifies also possession goods and cattle.]
\p
\v 21 . And the name of his brother was Jubal this was the father of all them that handle the harps [or Cittern] and organs [Heb. him that handleth &c. that is such as the conversant about the same what manner of musical instrument they had in those days is uncertain the words are rendered here according to the opinion most current among the learned.]
\p
\v 22 . And Zillah she likewise bear Tubalkain a teacher [the Heb. word doth properly signify a grinder wetter and so by consequence an instructor master or teacher] of all or every workman in copper or iron [Heb. of the copper &c.] and the sister of the Tubalkains was Naema.
\p
\v 23 . And Lamech said to his wives Ada and Zillah hear my voice ye wives of Lamech listen unto my voice verily I might well slay a men for my wound and a young man for my sore [that is if any should but offer to wound me or to strike me sore I should both well dare and be as able to kill him outright. Lamech seemeth with his presumptuous boast and vapouring to have regard o some of those arts invented by his sons as being better able now by that means to revenge himself or offend his neighbor then any other.]
\p
\v 24 . For Cain shall be revenged seven fold [see the note above on verse 15] but Lamech seventy times seven times [this same kind of speaking likewise Christ useth Matthew 18.22.]
\p
\v 25 . And Adam acknowledged his wife again and she bear a son and she called his name [viz. with consent of her husband as appeareth below chapter 5.3 were this giving of the name is attributed to Adam] Seth [Heb. Sceth that is setting] for God said she hath set me another seed [that is hath given me another seed so below chapter 21.23 and 38.8 Matthew 22.24, 25] for Habel for Akin slew him.
\p
\v 26 . And to the same Seth there was like wise born a son and he called his name Enos then they began to call upon the name of the Lord [the manner of speaking used in the Hebrew text here is taken in divers places for the calling upon of the name of the Lord as 1Kigs 18.24,25,26 2Kings 5.11 Joel 2.32 Acts 2.21 Romans 10.13 and so it is taken here likewise comprehending nevertheless as appeareth by some other places as below chapter 12.8 item chapter 26.25 the exercise of the whole worship of God so that the sense here is that they began to settle and establish the worship of God more openly more solemnly and frequently the same having formerly for a time in much corrupted and falsified by Cain and his progeny others then men began to call after the name of the Lord that is then begun the true children of God to separate themselves from the rest and called themselves the people and children of God this same kind of speaking doth likewise elsewhere signify to proclaim the Lord by name as Exodus 33.19 and 34.5.]

\s Mans creation summarily a repeated verse 1, 2. Adams posterity are born according to the image 3 the catalogue of them by Seth line unto Noah and their ages 5 Henock walked with God and is taken away 22 Noah his birth and sons 28.
\p
\v 1 This is the book of Adams generation [or rehearsal register account, enumeration , of births or generations that is of them that were born of Adam understand not of all but those only of whom the Lord Jesus Christ is born after the flesh by the line of Seth Luke 3 and who for the most part maintained the true worship of God among them until the time of Deluge ] on the day when God created men he created him after the likeness of God [that is after his own likeness see above chapter 1.26,27.]
\p
\v 2 . Male and female he created them and blessed them and called their name man homo [as well the woman as the mans not withstanding the difference of their originals viz. that Adam was created of the earth and Eve of Adams rib.] on they day when they created.
\p
\v 3 . and Adam lived one hundred and thirty years [Heb. thirty and hundred years & so both here and elsewhere in the Hebrew tongue is the lesser number mostly set before and the greater put after ]and begat a son[ the meaning of the these and the former words of he verse is that when Adam had lived so long and had so many years old then he got a son and so we are to understand the same phrase in the sequel ] after this likeness after this image [ in opposition to Gods image and likeness after which Adam was created here is now put the image an likeness of Adam after which Seth is born the image of God was perfect but after the fall the image of Adam was wholly corrupted whereby all man now born naturally out of Adam are sinful miserable and subject to death see Romans 5.12 ] and called his name Seth [viz. by reason of the words which Eva spake when she got this son see above chapter 4 on verse25.]
\p
\v 4 . The days of Adam after that he had begotten Seth have been eight hundred years and he begat sons and daughters.
\p
\v 5 . So all the days of Adam which he lived were nine hundred years and thirty years [ the word years is put twice here according to the custom of the Hebrews but hereafter we shall put it but once according to the use and propriety of our language ] and he died.
\p
\v 6 . And Seth liveth one hundred and five years and he begat Enos.
\p
\v 7 . And Seth lived after he had begotten Enos eight hundred and seven years and begat sons and daughters.
\p
\v 8 . So all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years and he died.
\p
\v 9 . And Enos lived for ninety year and him begat Kenan [Luke 3.37 he is called Kainan.]
\p
\v 10 . And Enos live after that he had begotten Kenan eight hundred and fifteen years and he begat sons and daughters.
\p
\v 11 . So all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years and he died.
\p
\v 12 . And Kenan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel [Luke 3.37 the Greek hath MAlelaleel.]
\p
\v 13 . And Kenan lived after he had begotten Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years and he begat sons and daughters.
\p
\v 14 . So all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years and he died.
\p
\v 15 . And Mahalaleel lived sixty five years and begat Jared.
\p
\v 16 . And Mahalaleel lived after that he had begotten Jered eight hundred and thirty years and he begat sons and daughters.
\p
\v 17 . So all the days of Mahalaleel wee eight hundred and ninety five years and he died.
\p
\v 18 . And Jered lived one hundred sixty and two years and he begat Henoch [Heb. Chanoch compare Jude verse 14, 15.
\p
\v 19 . And Jered lived after that he had begotten Henoch eight hundred years and he begat sons and daughters.
\p
\v 20 . So all the days of Jered were nine hundred and sixty two years and he died.
\p
\v 21 . And Henoch lived sixty five years and he begat Methusalah [Heb. Methuschlach.]
\p
\v 22 . And Henoch walked with God [that is he led a holy life before God with great zeal and steadfastness separating himself from impiety and evil courses of the world see below the like kind of speaking chapter 6 verse 9 Micah 6.8 and compare Jeremiah 12 on verse 3] after that he had begotten Methusalah three hundred years and he begat sons and daughters.
\p
\v 23 . So all the days of Henoch were three hundred and sixty five years.
\p
\v 24 . Henoch then walked with God and he was no more [this is explained Hebrews 11.5 that he was taken away and translated into eternal life] for God took him away.
\p
\v 25 . And Methuselah lived nine hundred and eighty seven years and begat Lamech [Hebrew Lamech.]
\p
\v 26 . And Methuselah lived after he had begotten Lamech seven hundred and eighty two years and he begat sons and daughters.
\p
\v 27 . So all the day of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty nine year [this Methuselah was the oldest of all men that lived in the world recorded in holy writ] and he died.
\p
\v 28 . And Lamech lived one hundred and eighty two years and he begat a on.
\p
\v 29 . And he called his name Noah saying this same shall comfort us over our work and over the pain of our hands [Noah in the new testament is called Noe, Luke 3.36 and 1Peter 3.20 Hebrews 11.7 the two Hebrew verbs Noah and Nicham which are used here both of them have some resemblance together the one signifies to rest whence the name Noah is taken the other to comfort wherewith the reason is shewed in giving the that name Lamech doubtlessly foresaw through the spirit of the Lord that Noah was to be employed for some special work.] because of the earth which the Lord hath cursed [see above chapter 3.17,18,19 and chapter 4.11.]
\p
\v 30 . And Lamech lived after that he had begotten Noah five hundred and ninety five yeas and begat sons and daughters.
\p
\v 31 . So all the days of Lamech were seven hundred and seventy years and he died.
\p
\v 32 . And Noah was five hundred years old [Heb a son of five hundred years that is Noah was so many years old or was entering into the five hundred year of his age this phrase is very frequent in scripture see below chapter 7.6 and 11.10 and 17.17 &c. and Noah begat Sem, Cham, and Japheth [that is he then began to begat as chapter 11.26 for these three sons wee not born in one year but first Japheth and Sem last Cham see chapter 9.24 and chapter 11.10 Sem is put here in the first place as a pious progenitor of our Lord Jesus Christ after the flesh together with all the Hebrews see chapter 10.21 &c.]
\c 6
\s Common voluptuousness and great impiety among men do cause the Deluge after one hundred and twenty years verse 2 &c. of giants 4 Noah finds grace with God and receiveth a charge and model of making the ark 8.14 Gods covenant with Noah 18 orders for all manner of creatures of provision to be put in the ark 19.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass when men began to multiply upon the earth [Heb upon the face of the earth that is they say upon the plain or flat parts thereof] daughters were born to them.
\p
\v 2 . The Gods sons looked on the daughters of men [ by these sons and daughters are understood the posterity of the faithful forefathers making profession of the true religion and being with their families which constituted the church of God separate from the unbelieving and the carnal generation of Cain. As the contrary by the daughters of men they are truly understood of Karin’s posterity practicing idolatry and living after the flesh see Deuteronomy 14.1 John 1.12 Luke 17.27 Jude 19] that they were fair [Heb. Good that is fair see chapter 24.16 7 41.22 Exodus 2.2] and they took them wives out of al that they have chosen [regarding only the outward beauty and the outward pleasure not the true religion and fear of the Lord nor their honest parents consent see chapter 36.34,35 and 28.8.]
\p
\v 3 . Then said the Lord my spirit shall not forever [that is always ] contend or strive with men [that is my holy spirit shall argue it no longer with these stiff-necked man to wit by the mouth of the honest Godly remnant and especially by Noah others my mind that is I myself shall debate or deliberate longer spoken after the manner of men what cause namely I shall take with this evil generation seeing that by no admonition nor punishment they will be reclaimed see 2 Peter 2.5 ] because also he is flesh [that is corrupt understand this not only the children of men but likewise of Gods children thus the word flesh is taken for the corrupt nature of men 1John 3.6 Romans 7.18 & 8.7] yet his days shall one hundred and twenty years [that is so much time I will allow them yet and after that defer my judgment no longer see 1Peter 3.20.]
\p
\v 4 . In those days were giants upon earth [ that is men of taller stature and strength than others see Numbers 13.33 the Hebrew words signifying giants is deduced from falling in regard that they being fallen off from God fell upon men with all manner of violence and tyranny fearing neither God nor man whereby every one that saw them dejected his heart and courage failing and falling to ground as it were before them this matter is likewise brought in here a particular cause and provocation of Gods wrath ] and thereafter when Gods sons were gone into the daughters of men [or come whereby is modestly and soberly implied the cohabitation of men and wife see below chapter 16.2 & 30.3 &c ] and had gotten to themselves children [or then they those namely did hear children to their husbands ] these are the mighty or powerful ones that have been of old [Hebrews from eternity see Jeremiah 2 on verse 20.] men of name [ that is famous and renowned men who according to the world’s accompt and judgment had achieved great things as on the contrary Job 30.8 it is said of others that they are men of no name.]
\p
\v 5 . And the lord saw [ in the verse there is contained a very naked and fundamental description of the original sin and the fruits thereof ] that the iniquity of man was manifold upon the earth and all the imaginations of the thought of the heart all day are always only evil.
\p
\v 6 . Then it repented the Lord [ thus the holy scripture speaks of God after the humane manner when he altereth his work or doing although n himself he remained unalterable see the next verse and Numbers 23.19 1samuel 15.11 ,29 2Samuel 24.16 Malachi 3.6 James 1.17 Acts 15.18] that he had made men upon the earth and it pained him at his heart [likewise humanly spoken of God to shew us the great displeasure against God against men by reason of his perverseness compare Isaiah 63.10 thus sorrow likewise is attributed to god Ephesians 4.30.]
\p
\v 7 . And the Lord said I will destroy men whom I have created from off the earth [Heb. Out of from the face of the earth] from men to the cattle [the Hebrew word doth here signify not only the tame but also the wild beast of the earth so below verse 20 see above chapter 1 verse 24, 25, 26, 28, 30.] and unto the fowl of the heaven for it repents me that I made them.
\p
\v 8 . But Noah found grace in their eyes of the Lord [that is the Lord of his grace took pleasure in Noah not for his worthiness see of this phrase below chapter 19.19 Exodus 33.13 &c.]
\p
\v 9 . These are the births of Noah [that is the generations and acts of Noah or that which befell him in the generation for the Hebrew word doth not signify only the off-spring descent and posterity but likewise that which betides and befall them which is as much as to say the history and relation of such a one and his affair compare below chapter 25.19 and 37.2 and Numbers 3.1] Noah was a righteous upright men [that is one that is matter of the true profession of faith and honest life and conversation was without hypocrisy and falsehood see below chapter 7.1 ] Noah walked with God [see above chapter 5 on verse 22.]
\p
\v 10 . And Noah begat three sons Sem, Cham, and Japheth [see above chapter 5.32.]
\p
\v 11 . But the earth [ understand by the men inhabiting the earth see below chapter 41.57 2 Samuel 15.23 1Kings 10.24 Ezekiel 14.13] was corrupted before the face of God that is sinning openly daringly presumptuously without either shame before men of fear before Gods presence see below chapter 10.9] and the earth was filled with violence.
\p
\v 12 . Then God saw the earth and behold it was corrupted for all flesh [that is all man and thus the word flesh I to be taken likewise Isaiah 40.6 Psalms 78.39 and elsewhere ] had corrupted his way [that is to say his purpose manners, life and conversation so Job 23.10 Psalms 1.1 Proverbs 13.15 &c.] upon the earth.
\p
\v 13 . Therefore God said to Noah the end of all flesh has come before my face [that is the time of their destruction is at hand as Ezekiel 7.2, 3, 6 Amos 8.2] for the earth is filled with violence by them [Heb. From their face] and loe I will destroy them with the earth [others from the earth.]
\p
\v 14 . Make thee an ark [a covered ship of wood in the manner of almost of a chest fitted to float upon the water] of gopher wood [what kind of wood or tree is gopher was is uncertain] with chambers [Heb. Nests] shalt thou make this ark and thou shalt pitch it within and without and with pitch [the Hebrew word doth signify a very tough glutenous and tenacious matter not unlike to our pitch.]
\p
\v 15 . And thus it is that thou shalt make it three hundred ells [or cubits or elbows dyers are of opinion that this kind of measure was threefold the common or vulgar the holy one and the geometrical the common to have contained five palms each palm holding the breath of four fingers the holy six palms Ezekiel 40.5 though some conceive the common was to six palm and the holy one as long again which was used in the holy structure of the building as that of the tabernacle and the temple but the geometrical they say was six times as long and the building of the ark some hold that this latter sort was made use of ] be the length of the ark fifty ells the breadth of it and thirty the height.
\p
\v 16 . Thou shalt make a window [others clear light which by one or more windows may conveniently defuse and spread itself throughout the ark ] on the ark and shall perfect it [ the ark namely ] to an ell from above [some do understand this of the cover of the ark as if the same should have been from both these sides a top slopping downward one ell for the falling off of the water ] and the door of the ark thou shall set in the side thereof thou shalt make it with the lowermost second and third stories.
\p
\v 17 . For I behold I bring a water-stood [Heb. Mabbul signifying a falling and overthrowing flood] over the fish excepted and al that was in the ark] wherein there is a spirit of life [others a living soul above chapter 1.20] all that is upon the earth shall give up ghosts [Heb expire or breath out.]
\p
\v 18 . But with thee I will establish my covenant [understand hereby besides the common covenant made with all the faithful and particular covenant to preserve Noah in the ark on condition that Noah should trust and obey God [and thou shalt go into the ark thou and thy sons and thy wife and the wives of thy sons with thee.
\p
\v 19 . And thou shalt cause to come into the ark all that lives [that is of all manner of earthly living creatures] of all flesh two of each to keep a live with thee male and female they shall be.
\p
\v 20 . of the fowl after its kind and of the cattle [ see above on verse 7 ] after its kind of al the creeping creatures of the earth after its kind two of each shall come unto thee [viz. by my instinct and ordering without thy pains or carefulness compare this with chapter 2.19.]For to keep the same alive.
\p
\v 21 . And thou take for thee of al food [that is all manner of food see above chapter 1.29, 30] which is eaten and gather it to thee that it may be food for thee and them.
\p
\v 22 . And Noah did according to all that God had commanded him so did he [that is Noah did execute and perform all that which and in the same manner as god had commanded him compare Exodus 40 verse 16.]
\c 7
\s God bids Noah to enter with his family into the ark verse 1 and of all kind of clean and unclean beasts to take into him a certain number 2 Noah performs all according to Gods commands 5 the flood begins with the bursting of the fountains of the great abyss from beneath and continued showering of the rain from above 10 the water increase of one hundred and fifty days together cover the mountains and all that hath life on earth doth perish 17.
\p
\v 1 After that saith the Lord to Noah go thou and all thy house [that is family so below chapter 17.12 and 24.3 and 39.11 Exodus 1.1 Proverbs 31.17 Acts 16. 14 &c.] into the ark for thee I have seen righteous before my face [that is only outwardly in shew and possession but inwardly also in truth and indeed and that through faith in the promised seed and sanctification of the spirit so Luke 1.6] in this generation [see above chapter 6 on verse 9.]
\p
\v 2 . Of all clean cattle [clean in regard of Gods ordinance whereby he had severed these beasts from the rest for sacrifice and for mans food whereof he had in deed revealed his will to the fore-fathers but afterwards more perfectly declared the same by Moses see Luke 11.2 ] shalt thou take it to thee seven and seven [Heb. Seven , seven as also in the sequel that is to say of each sort three couple and one over the sacrifice after the flood the Hebrew do often put one or more words twice down when they make partition see below chapter 32.16 Numbers 7.11 and 29.10 Mark 6.39 &c.] the male and his female but of the cattle that is not clean two the male and the female.
\p
\v 3 . Also the fowls of the heaven [via. Of the clean sort as verse 2] seven and seven the male and the female to keep seed alive on all the earth [Heb. On the face of all the earth and so in the sequel.]
\p
\v 4 . For over yet seven days [that is after or against the expiring of the seven days ] I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights and I will destroy from the earth and all the subsist s[all being that is alive viz. such as for its preservation alive must live and sustain itself upon the earth and by the virtue of the soul within stands up as it were and subsists of itself whereas on the contrary a dead body lies prostate see below verse 23.] which I made.
\p
\v 5 . And Noah did after all that the Lord had commanded him.
\p
\v 6 . Now Noah was six hundred years old [Heb. A son of six hundred year as above chapter 5.32 &c.]When the flood of the waters was upon the earth.
\p
\v 7 . So Noah went and his sons and his wife and the wives of the sons with him into the ark by reason of the waters of the flood [Heb. From the face of the waters or before &c that is for to escape them.]
\p
\v 8 . Of the clean cattle and of the cattle that was not clean and of the fowl and of all the creeps of the earth.
\p
\v 9 . There came [see chapter 6.20] two and two [see above on verse 2] to Noah into the ark the male and the female even as God had commanded Noah.
\p
\v 10 . And it came to pass after those seven days [see above verse 4] that the waters of the flood were upon the earth [that is came or fell on it.]
\p
\v 11 . In the six hundredth year of the life of Noah [so above verse 6 this was the year one thousand six hundred fifty six after the creation of the world ] in the second month [what month this was there are two several opinions according as the Hebrews had two several beginnings of the year in the holy matters with the month Nijan agreeing for the most part with our month of March when days and nights are of equal length in civil affair with the month Tisri answering mostly with our September when days and nights are again of a length of which year this second month here I to be understood that we live of the judgment of the intelligent reader] on the seventeenth day of the month on that same day all the fountains of the great abyss [that is of the profound waters enclose in the hollow of earthly globe from whence all the fountains and rivers streams and water-flood do issue forth ] were broken up and the sluices of heaven [or windows so that the clouds of rain are called here and below chapter 8.2 and 2 Kings 7.2 ,19 Isaiah 24.18 Malachi 3.10] were opened.
\p
\v 12 . And a shower of rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights [according to the threatening above verse 4.]
\p
\v 13 . Upon that every day [Heb. In or upon the bone or being the or existence of that day so below chapter 17.26 see Ezekiel 2 on verse 3] went Noah and Sem and Cham and Japheth [Heb. Japheth] Noah’s sons also Noah’s wife and three wives of his sons with them into the ark.
\p
\v 14 . They and all the beasts [that is all manner of beasts as likewise in the sequel and elsewhere understand therefore not each particular beast but of every sort such a proportion and certain number as was expressed above verse 2] after its kind and all the cattle after its kind and all the creeping beast that creepeth on the earth after its kind and all the fowls [The Hebrew word doth signify all kind of fowl or bird in general but here properly are understood such only as are of the greater sort called fowl or bird in general but here properly are understood such sort called fowl seeing that there follows another word presently which doth mostly signify the smaller sort called birds ] after its kind all birds of all sorts of wings [Heb. All birds all wings.]
\p
\v 15 . And of all flesh wherein there was a spirit of life [see above chapter 6.17] there came two and two [Heb. Two, two as above verse 2, 9] to Noah into the ark.
\p
\v 16 . And those that came there came male and female of all flesh according as god had commanded and the Lord shut too after him [Though Noah might have shut the door from within yet this implieth a peculiar shutting up and securing the ark made by God either without means or by the ministry of the angels.]
\p
\v 17 . And that flood [ understand this not of the main force and prevalence of the waters which lasted one hundred and fifty days below verse 24 but the rain only mentioned above verse 4 and 12 ] was forty days [ viz. natural days consisting of twenty four hours a piece and comprehending day and night above verse 4 , 12] upon the earth and the waters multiplied and lifted up the ark so that it rose up above the earth.
\p
\v 18 . And the waters prevailed and multiplied much upon the earth and the ark went upon the waters [Heb. Upon the face of the waters.]
\p
\v 19 . And the waters prevailed very much [Heb. Much, much] upon the earth so that all high mountains which are under all heaven were covered.
\p
\v 20 . Fifteen ells high [viz. above the mountains] the waters prevailed and the mountains were covered.
\p
\v 21 . And all flesh that stirred upon the earth gave up the ghost [according to the former threatening above chapter 6 verse 13 and in chapter 4] of the fowl and of the cattle and of the wild beasts and of all the creeping creatures that creeps upon the earth and all man [homo.]
\p
\v 22 . All hath the breath of the spirit of life in its nostrils [compare the annotations above chapter 6 verse 7] of all that was upon the dry or dry ground died [thus the fishes are clearly excepted compare with this fore going verse 21.]
\p
\v 23 . Thus there was destroyed all the subsisted that was upon the earth [Heb. Face of the earth] from man unto the cattle to the creeping creatures and to the fowl of the heaven and they were destroyed from the earth yet Noah alone remained over and that which was with him in the ark.
\p
\v 24 . And the waters prevailed above the earth one hundred and fifty days [in which are comprehended the days of the rain being forty see verse 17.]
\c 8
\s The fountains of the abyss of the clouds are stopped again whereby the waters came to be a stand and abate by the degrees verse 1 the ark sits down upon the mount Ararat 4 Noah lets fly a raven and afterwards a dove returning with an olive branch 7 the earth dried up again 13 Noah on Gods commands comes forth out of the ark with all that was with him 16 buildeth an altar and offereth sacrifice 20 God promiseth to destroy the earth no more thus for mans sake 21.
\p
\v 1 And God remembered Noah [spoken of God after the manner of men God is said to think on or remember when after some delay he either exhibits his mercies below chapter 19.29 Exodus 31.13 Nehemiah 13.14,22 Job 14.13 Psalms 132.1 or executes his judgments Hosea 9.9 Revelation 18.5] and on all the beasts and on all the cattle that was with him in the ark and God caused a wind to pass through over the earth and the waters became still.
\p
\v 2 . Also the fountains of the Abyss and the sluices of heaven were shut [which before were broken up and burst forth to execute this terrible judgment off God above chapter 7.11 ] and the showering rain from heaven was ceased [which had continued forty natural days together see above chapter 7 verse 4 and 12.]
\p
\v 3 . With all the waters returned from the above the earth floating to and again [Heb. Going and returning that is more and more returning and lessening so likewise in the next verse compare below chapter 26.13 and see John 1 on verse 11] and the waters decrease at the end of the hundred and fifty days [to reckon from the beginning of the flood see chapter 7.11 all which time the waters had been increasing upon the earth see likewise verse 24 there.]
\p
\v 4 . And the ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day of the month upon the hills of Ararat [that is upon the hills of the great Armenia.]
\p
\v 5 . And the waters were going and decreasing to the tenth month in the tenth month on the first of the month the tops of the mountain were seen [Hebrews the heads &c. so Deuteronomy 3.27 Josiah 15.8 Judges 9.7.]
\p
\v 6 . And it happened at the end of forty days [viz. after the end of the tenth month whereof mention is made in the verse foregoing] that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made [see above chapter 6.16.]
\p
\v 7 . And he let forth a raven [viz. to discover whether the earth was cleared of the waters] who went of times to and fro [Heb. Went forth and going forth turning that is flew hither and thither & especially about the ark the earth being for the most part yet covered with waters] until the waters are dried above the earth.
\p
\v 8 . After that [To wit seven days after the Raven had been let forth as it is to be seen verse 10] he let forth a dove from him [one that doth not easily abandon its companion but is wont to return still to the same] for to see whether the waters were taken up [that is more lessened further abated] from above the earth.
\p
\v 9 . But the dove sound no rest of the hollow of her foot so she turned again to him into the ark for the eaters were upon the whole earth [that is upon the flat country thereabout for otherwise the tops of the mountains had begun to be discovered above verse 5] and he put forth his hand and took her and brought her to him in the ark.
\p
\v 10 . And he stayed yet seven other days then he let the dove forth out of the ark again [Heb. He added or continued to let forth or send which kind of speaking we find likewise below verse 12 and 21 and elsewhere frequently signifying the doing of a thing over again and the renewing or repeating of the same.]
\p
\v 11 . And the dove came to him again the evening [seeing the sound no food for herself and sought to be the ordinary cote] and lo there was a plucked olive leaf in her bill [Heb. Mouth whereby god comforted Noah assuring him that his deliverance out of the ark was near at hand] so Noah perceived that the waters were taken up from above the earth.
\p
\v 12 . Then he tarried yet other seven days and he let forth the dove but she returned no more to him [having no found both rest and food for her self upon the earth.]
\p
\v 13 . And it came to pass in the sixth hundred and first year [viz. of the age of Noah which was the year 1557 after the worlds creation compare above chapter 7.11 where it is said that the flood began in the year of Noah age six hundred] in the first month upon the first of the same month that the waters were drying up from above the earth then Noah put off the cover of the ark and behold and lo the ground was dried [Heb. The face of the ground.]
\p
\v 14 . And in the second month upon the seven and twentieth day of the month the earth was dried.
\p
\v 15 . Then spake God to Noah saying:
\p
\v 16 . Go forth out of the ark [the command Noah had waited for as likewise he had gone into the ark on gods command having continued in the same one year and ten days ] thou and thy wife and the sons and the wives of the sons with thee.
\p
\v 17 . All the beasts that is with thee of all flesh of fowl and cattle [see above chapter 6 on verse 7] and of all the creeping beasts that creepeth upon the earth cause to go forth with the and let them abundantly propagate upon the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth.
\p
\v 18 . Then Noah went forth and his sons and his wife and the wives of the sons with him.
\p
\v 19 All the beasts all the fowls and all the creeping creatures all the moves itself upon the earth after their kinds went forth out of the ark [that is they went very orderly each coupled according to its sort or kind.]
\p
\v 20 . And Noah built an altar to the Lord and took of all the clean cattle [see above chapter 7.2] and of all the clean fowls offered burnt offerings [so named of being burnt altogether and rising up with the smoke till it was quite consumed in which regard it might likewise be called a rise offering see also Leviticus 6 on verse 9] upon the altar.
\p
\v 21 . And the Lord smelt [spoken of God after the manner of men or comparatively for even as a pleasant smell much creates a man so god took singular delights in the faiths and thankfulness of Noah ] that pleasant smells [Heb. That smell of rest or rest causing viz. reconciling men with God and settling him in rest and peace not by the proper virtue of the offering but by and through the betoken offering of our Lord Jesus Christ where by only there hath been purchased an everlasting reconciliation Hebrews 9. 12, 13] and the Lord said in his heart [or to that is by himself spoken to him in a human manner to declare unto us that according to his own pleasure he doth often reveal his secret counsel unto his servants] I will henceforth curse the ground no more [that is I will no more destroy the earth that is by a general inundation Heb. I will no more cause to curse and so in the end of this verse see above verse 10 ] for mans sake for the imagination ] of the mans heart is evil from his youth and I will no more smite all the living creature [viz. in the same manner with a deluge the word smite among the signification is sometimes taken for to slay or to kill or otherwise to undamaged the life by what means so ever the same is brought to pass see exodus 21.18 Numbers 14.12 and 35.16 Deuteronomy 28.22, 27. 1Samuel 17.49 and 26.82Samuel 3.27 1Kings 22.34 Amos 4.9 &c.] so as I have done.
\p
\v 22 Henceforth, all the dates of the earth, [i.e. while the world is to stand] sowing and reaping, and cold and heat, the summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease.
\c 9
\s God reneweth his blessing upon men after the flood verse 1 alloweth and forbiddeth certain viands 3 ordains punishment for murder 5 appoints the rainbow for a token of his covenant that no deluge shall cover the earth no more 9 Noah plants a vine 20 and in drunken sleep is mocked by Cham for his nakedness 22 who therefore is cursed with his posterity 25 but Sem and Japheth are blessed 26 Noah his age and death.29.
\p
\v 1 And God blessed Noah and his sons and he said unto them be fruitful and multiply replenish the earth [God here reneweth the blessing which above chapter 1.28 he had pronounced upon mankind to shew that the maintaining and multiplying of the mankind together with all the dominion and power which man had retained after the fall over the unreasonable creatures as well after as before the flood depend on his blessing.]
\p
\v 2 . And your fear and your terror be upon the beasts of the earth and upon all fowls of heaven upon all that stirs [or creeps or moveth as an unreasonable creature] upon the earth and upon all fishes of the sea they given unto your hand.
\p
\v 3 . All that stirs [all manner of eatable creatures upon the earth and in the air and in the waters ] that is alive [forbidding by this law to eat what dieth either of itself or n ill death ] be meat unto ye I have given all unto ye as the green herb [ Heb. Verdure or the green of the herb as above chapter 1.30 that is to say after the common opinion besides or over and above the green herb and the fruits which I formerly appointed for your food I do now give and allow ye likewise all kinds of eatable living creatures.]
\p
\v 4 . Yet the flesh with its soul that is its blood ye shall not eat [ God forbids the eating of the bloody flesh thereby to deter men from all the cruelty and the disposition of killing & murdering one another compare Leviticus 3 verse 17 and 17.11 Deuteronomy 12.23.]
\p
\v 5 . And verily I will require your blood the blood of your souls [that is your persons or bodily life the meaning is I will avenge it either by the order instituted by me or else without it] at the end of every beast will I require it [see Exodus 21.28] also at the hand of man poor man, or woman seeing man is his brother or sister or neighbor] at the hand of everyone’s brother will I require the soul of man.]
\p
\v 6 . Who so sheds mans blood his blood shall be shed by man [here the office of the magistrate is established and the sword delivered into his hands for the punishment of the evil doers Romans 13.1 ] for God hath made man after his image [see above chapter 1.27and though the image of God be much impaired and broken since the fall nevertheless God hath for considerable reason left come remainder thereof in man which he will not have abused but ordaineth every abuse thereof to be strictly punished .]
\p
\v 7 . But ye be ye fruitful and multiply propagate [or engender] abundantly upon the earth the earth and multiply upon the same.
\p
\v 8 . Moreover God said unto his sons and to his with him saying:
\p
\v 9 . But I behold I establish my covenant with ye [that is as for me to assure ye on my part that I will no more destroy all man and beast that is I do bind myself to ye by promise and give ye the ensuing pledge and token thereof ] and with your seed after ye [ that is with your posterity which shall be propagated and born by and of you thus the word seed is frequently taken see below chapter 12.7 Exodus 28.43 Leviticus 22.4 Deuteronomy 4.37 1samuel 24.22 2Kings 2.33 John 8.33 Romans 1.3 and 11.1 2Timothy 2.8.]
\p
\v 10 . And with every living soul that is with you of the fowl of the cattle and of the beasts of the earth with you of all is gone forth out of the ark and unto all the beasts of the earth.
\p
\v 11 . And I establish my covenant with ye that all flesh [that is all men and what else is living and stirring and moving upon the earth ] shall no more be destroyed by the waters of the flood [see above chapter 8.21,22 understand this of such a flood whereby the whole earth shall be covered with water to the destruction of all man and beast that have their abode and maintenance upon the earth insomuch that here are to be expected in so particular floods and inundation] and that they shall be no flood more to destroy the earth.
\p
\v 12 . And God said this is a token of the covenant that I give between me and between you every living soul that I with you to ever lasting generations [Heb. To generations of eternity that is as long as the world shall endure see below verse 16.]
\p
\v 13 . My bow have I given in the clouds [understand the rainbow which though in its nature be a token of rain yet by the ordinance of God it is an assured testimony that the world shall never perish again by the rain and a general deluge of water] shall be for a token of the covenant between me and between the earth.
\p
\v 14 . And it shall come to pass when the clouds over the earth [Heb. When I cloud a cloud upon the earth that is to say when I am drawing clouds together about it] that is bow [or and this bow] shall be seen in the cloud.
\p
\v 15 . then shall I remember my covenant [that is I shall perform my promise then see above chapter 8 on verse1 and here the next verse] that is between me and between ye and between every soul of all flesh and the waters shall be no more for a flood to destroy the flesh.
\p
\v 16 . When this bow shall be in the clouds then I shall look upon it to remember the everlasting covenant of eternity] between God [that is myself] and between every living soul of all flesh that is upon the earth.
\p
\v 17 . So God said unto Noah this is a token of the covenant that I have established between me and between all the fleshes that is upon the earth.
\p
\v 18 . And the sons of Noah that went forth out of the ark were Sem, Cham, and Japheth and Cham he is the father of Canaan [of whom the Canaanites issued and the land of Canaan was denominated which land became afterwards the inheritance of the Israelites descending from Sem the uncle of Canaan.
\p
\v 19 . These three were the sons of Noah and of these the whole earth is overspread [viz. the inhabitants.]
\p
\v 20 . And Noah began to be a husbandmen [or countrymen Heb. A man of the earth or of the ground that is to say one that husbanded or tilled the ground so below chapter 25.27 a man of the field tat is one that keeps the field more than the house or home 1Samuel 16.18 a man of war Proverbs 6.11 a man of the field that is such a one as doth practice shield and arms in wars and see] and he planted a vineyard [others being a husbandman he planted a vineyard.]
\p
\v 21 . And he drank of the wine and was drunk and he uncovered himself in the midst of the tent [to wit ignorantly or unaware in the sleep and not of set purpose.]
\p
\v 22 . And Cham the father of Canaan [this is again repeated here to the further punishment of Cham and comfort of the Israelites whom God was leading by Moses into the land of Canaanites] saw his father’s nakedness and he made it known to both his brothers without.
\p
\v 23 . And Sem and Japheth took a garment and put it upon both their shoulders and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father and their faces were turned backwards so that they did not see their father’s nakedness
\p
\v 24 . And Noah awaked from his wine [that is of the sleep which he was fallen by his drinking of wine] and he perceived [either by an instinct from God or by the relation of his two other sons or also by his own enquiry] what his youngest son had done to him.
\p
\v 25 And he said [not as a sinful man had transported with carnal passion and vexation but as a prophet through the inspiration of the holy Ghost ] cursed [ that is hateful before God and contemptible among man unhappy upon earth both in himself and his ] be Canaan[understand here not the on only but the father Cham also together with the sons off-springs] let him be a servant of servants to hi brethren [that is the most vile and abject slave thus vanity of vanities Ecclesiastes 1.2 wickedness of wickedness Hosea 10.15 for the highest and most enormous &c compare Leviticus 2 the annotate on verse 3.]
\p
\v 26 . Furthermore he said blessed be the Lord the God of Sem [Sem is named here in the extraordinary manner not only because he is first commended of the honor shewed to his father above verse 23 but likewise for that the Messiahs and God should come forth out of the loins see below chapter 10 on verse 21] and Canaan be servant to him.
\p
\v 27 . god spread forth Japheth [others god allure or persuade Japheth understand this as the prophesy of the calling of the gentiles Japheth’s posterity which should be brought about by the pleasing and persuasive preaching of the holy gospel] and let him dwell in the tents of Sem [that is his posterity shall come in and be admitted in the communion of the church of the people of God] and Canaan be servant to him.
\p
\v 28 . And Noah liveth after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
\p
\v 29 . So all days of Noah were one hundred and fifty years and then he died.
\c 10
\s The spreading of the mankind of the three sons of Noah whose posterity is recounted together with their habitations of Japheth verse 2 of Cham 6 amongst them there are Nimrod and Assure 8. 11 of Sem, 21
\p
\v 1 These now [ the scope of this account is principally to shew out of which fathers and progenitors the Messiahs sprung forth after the flesh among which people in the mean time the church of God was maintained and the secondarily to make known the original rise of the several nations and the division of the countries which they inhabited all which serves very much of the clearing of many scripture places as well appear in the sequel ] are the births [or generations ] of the sons of Noah , Sem, Cham, and Japheth and to them sons were born after the flood.
\p
\v 2 . The sons of Japheth are [these have spread themselves from the place of their habitation mostly towards the north and west part for being first set down in the lesser Asia they had degrees almost filled the northern countries and Europe ]Gomer [this mans posterity inhabited the north quarter of the lesser Asia wherefore they are likewise ranked among the northern nations Ezekiel 38.6 and whereas they spread themselves westwards also they are held to be progenitors with all of those people whose countries the Gallo-Grecian afterwards inhabited ] and Magog [the source of the Scythians of whom see Ezekiel 38.2 and 39.6] and Madai [ of whom the Medes came see 2Kings 15.6] Isaiah 13.17 Jeremiah 25.25 Daniel 5.6,8] and Javan [the father of the Greeks see of these Isaiah 66.19 Daniel 8.21 Joel 3.6 Ezekiel 27.13,19] and Tubal [from him it is thought the Iberians come forth as from those the Spaniards see Ezekiel 27.13 and 38.2,3 and 32.26] and Moshech [Heb. Meshech who they be that issued from him is uncertain some conceive the Cappadocians others those of Mysia others the Mosches or Moscovites see Ezekiel 38.2,3] and Tiras [ of him there is no further mention made in the holy scripture nevertheless by most opinion there should be the Tracians neighbors to the Macedonians.]
\p
\v 3 . And the sons of Gomar are Askenaz [the father of the inhabitants of Pontus and Bithynia countries lying in Asia the less some do hold the Dutch have come from him see Jeremiah 51.27]and Riphath [others Diphath 1Chronicles 1.6 he was the forefather of the Paphlagonians a people likewise of the lesser Asia formerly called Riphatees or Ripheans ] and Torgarma [ he is commonly held to have given beginning to the people in the lesser Armenia or according to the others to the high Germans see Ezekiel 27.14 and 38.6.]
\p
\v 4 . And the sons of Javan are Elisa [ of whom the Aeolians descended a certain people of Greece compare Ezekiel 27.7] and Tarsis [ of whom Tarsis the metropolis in Cilicia the apostle Paul’s place of nativity doth bear the name acts 22.3 so that this Tarsis seems to have been the head-spring of Cilicians see Ezekiel 27.12 John 1.3 ] Chittim [ the father of the inhabitants of Macedonia or of Italy or of Cyprus or of a part of Cilicia the opinions differing from about see numbers 24.24 Isaiah 23.1 Jeremiah 2.10 ] and Dodanim [ others Rodanim 1Chronicles 1.7 it is held the Rodians and Doreans came from this man.
\p
\v 5 . By these were divided the islands of the nations in their countries [understand the countries situated on the sea-side west-ward of Syria between the midland sea and the ocean namely not only those properly called island but those on the continent likewise which is so lie along the sea there that they seem to be the islands ] each according to its language [the division of the languages was not as yet introduced see below chapter 11 but Moses speaks according to the time in which he wrote this see likewise example Genesis 12.8 and 13.3 &c.] according to their families among their people.
\p
\v 6 . And Cham’s sons are [ the posterity of Cham divided themselves from Babel for the most part southward into a part of Asia and Africa and for a time in Palestine see of these 1Corinthians 4.40 Psalms 105.27.]Cus [of whom came the Arabians and the Moors or Ethiopians see above the annotate on chapter 2.13 item 2Kinhs 19.9 Job 28.19 Jeremiah 13.23 and 46.19 ] and Mitzraim [the father of the Egyptians whose name occurs frequently the holy scripture and it is the name likewise both of the country and the inhabitants of Egypt ] and Put [ who is conceived to have planted and inhabited part of Lybia where the river of Put is see Jeremiah 46.9 Ezekiel 27.10 and 38.5] and Canaan [the fore-fathers of the Canaanites sufficiently known in the scripture see above chapter 9.25 and below here verse 18.]
\p
\v 7 . And the sons of Cus are Seba [ from whom the Sebean came in Arabia desserta see Psalms 72.10 and Isaiah 43.3] and Havila [ the father of the inhabitants of Havila a country of so named see above chapter 2.11] and Sabia [ the learned to hold that this mans progeny inhabited the lower part of rich and happy Arabia ] and Raema [likewise one of the progenitors of a people in the same Arabia see Ezekiel 27.22] and Sabiecha [and this is held to have been a planter of the same nation ]and the sons of Raema are Scheba [dwelling southwards in Ethiopia whence it is conceived that the queen of Sheba descended see 1 Kings 10.1, 4 Ezekiel 27.22 Matthew 12.42 Acts 8.27 others do pace him in rich Arabia ] and Dedan likewise an inhabitant of Arabia or as others conceive of Ethiopia see Ezekiel 27.13 and 38.23.]
\p
\v 8 . And Cus begat Nimrod this man began to be mighty upon the earth [see above chapter 6 verse 4]
\p
\v 9 . He was a mighty hunter [Heb. Mighty in hunting viz. not only of the wild beasts but of men also with whom he dealt little otherwise then the hunter do deer killing and subduing them to their own pleasure see the like expression Jeremiah 16.16 Lam. Jeremiah 3.25] before the face of the Lord [that is openly daringly without either fear of God or shame before men compare above chapter 6.11] therefore it is said like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the face of the Lord.
\p
\v 10 . And the beginning of his kingdom [Nimrod is held to be the founder of the first Monarchy and the first builder of the cities after the flood even as Cain was the first that built a city before the same] was Babel and Erich and Accad and Calne in the land of Sinear [Heb. Schinar the land of Mesopotamia and Chaldea thus named from the hill lying by it see further of this Sinear below chapter 11.2 and 14.1 and Joshua 7.21.]
\p
\v 11 . out of this land of Assure went forth [others out of this land of Nimrod namely went forth to Assyria] and built Nineveh [the metropolis of Assyria John 1.2] and Rehoboth Ire and Calab [others Rhoboth the city or the streets of the city viz. of Nineve.]
\p
\v 12 . And Resen between Nineveh and between Caleb that is that great city [Nineve namely see John 3.3 and 4.11.]
\p
\v 13 . Mitzraim begat Ludim [the planter of the people of Lydia in Mauritania see of these Isaiah 66.19] and Anamim [who is held the source of Cyrenians] and Lebahim [the father of the Lybians in Africa] and Nephtuhim [from whom some hold the Ethiopians to issue the Numidians.]
\p
\v 14 . And Pathrusim [who dwelt about the city of Pathrose in Egypt of whom see Isaiah 11.11 ] and Casluhim [the inhabitants of Cassiotis ] from whence [as also the Capthorim see Deuteronomy chapter 2.23 Jeremiah 47.4 Amos 7.9 it should seem that some of the posterity of both these brothers went forth together out of their own habitation and took possession of the land of Palestine from whence they were called Philistines ] the Philistines [that is the inhabitants of Palestine ] went forth [other descended or issued ] and Capthorim [descending from Caphor of whom see Deuteronomy 2.23.]
\p
\v 15 . And Canaan begat Zidon [Heb. Tzidon the builder of the city of Tzidon or Zidon in Phenicia whereof see Joshua 11.8 and chapter 19.28 and Judges 1.3 &c.] his first born and Heth [the father of Hithites of whom see Joshua 1.4 and 9.1 &c.]
\p
\v 16 . And [these following names are not only the proper names of persons but of the whole nation besides such as descended from them and are therefore by others red and rendered the Jebusites the Amorites &c.] the Jebusi [of whose posterity see Joshua 15.8 and Judges 3.9] and the Emori [of the Emorites see Deuteronomy 2.24] and the Girgas [see Matthew 8.28.]
\p
\v 17 . And the Hivvi [see Judges 3.3 ] and Arki and Sinni [mentioned Isaiah 49.12.]
\p
\v 18 . And the Arvadi [see Ezekiel 27.8, 11] and the Zemari [see Joshua 18.22 and 2Chronicles 13.4] and the Hamathi [se Amos 6.2, 14 Zac.9.2 of some of these together see Genesis 15.19, 20, 21] and according to that are the families of the Canaanites spread forth [understand here all the Canaanites in general all the posterity and people of Canaan.]
\p
\v 19 . And the border of the Canaanites was Zidon wee ye go towards Gerar [here the borders or limits of the land of Canaan are described which were in length of the west side Zidon Northward and Gaza southward on the east side Laza and on the south end Gaza and Sodoma ] unto Gaza [Heb. Azza] where ye go to Sodom [Heb. Sedom of which and the three following places see below chapter 13.10 and 14.2 ] and Gomorra [Heb. Amora ] and Adama [Heb. Adma ] and Zeboim [Heb. Tzeboim ] unto Lasa [Heb. Leschab ]
\p
\v 20 . These are the sons of Cham after their families after their languages in their countries in their nations.
\p
\v 21 . Further unto Sem sons were born [Heb. Is or was born so verse 25 These chose their habitation of the most part eastward in Asia the greater wherein Syria Assyria Mesopotamia Chaldea &c. are situated] the same is likewise the father [not only the first planter of them according to the flesh in regard of the primogeniture but likewise a pattern and leader of them according to the spirit in regard of regeneration ] of all the sons of Heber [that is of the Hebrews who are likewise therefore are likewise called Heber Numbers 24.24 with whom the true church of God and the true doctrine religion and worship of God continued for a long time others children of the passage or passing over in regard of the river Euphrates which Abraham passed over Joshua 24.3 see further of Sem above chapter 6 verse 10] brother of Japheth [named here in particular as having had a share in the blessing pronounced by God upon Sem of which Cham was excluded see chapter 6.10] the greater [ that is the eldest.]
\p
\v 22 . The sons of Sem [of their habitation or plantation see verse foregoing ] were Elam [of whom are Elamites that is the Persians see of these chapter 14.1, 19 Jeremiah 49.34 &c. Daniel 8.2 Acts 2.9 ] and Assure [the father of the Assyrians a nation sufficiently known in holy writ compare above verse 11] and Arphaxad [of whom it is conceived the Chaldeans had their beginnings being called Casdim ] and Lud [of whom are in Lydia in Asia the less ] and Aram [the original of the Syrians see of another Aram below chapter 22.21 of both which it is held that the land of Syria and Syrians had their denomination.]
\p
\v 23 . And Arams sons were Uz [ Heb. Uts who is supposed to be the progenitor of the country of Trachonitis though others assign him rather to some that inhabited about Idumea of Uts see Job 1.1 Lamentations 4.21 ] and Hul [ who it is thought inhabited the country of Palmyrenians or of Armenia ] and Gether [of whom were Bactrians or the inhabitants of the Apamene ] and Mas [ others Mesech 1Chronicles 1.17 who inhabited as some think the upper part of Syria between Cilicia and Mesopotamia by a part of mount Amans called Masius others do place him in Mysia.]
\p
\v 24 . And Arphaxad [compare chapter 21 verse 13, 15] begat Selah and Selah begat Heber.
\p
\v 25 . And to Heber two sons were born the name of the one was Peleg for in his days the earth divided [that is the time of his birth it happened that the inhabitants of the earth parted asunder upon the division of the languages related in the next chapter ] and his brothers name was Jokian.
\p
\v 26 . And Jokian begat Almodad [of Jokians posterity there is but little information to be found in either holy scripture or other writings ] and Seliph and Hazarmavet and Jarah.
\p
\v 27 . And Hadoram and Uzal and Dikla.
\p
\v 28 . And Obal and Abimael and Scheba [this is a different one from him that was the son of Cus the son of Cham see above verse 7.]
\p
\v 29 . And Ophir [see 1Kings 9.28 and chapter 22.49 Psalms 45.10 Isaiah 13.12] and Havila [who is likewise to be distinguished from the other Havila descending from Cus the son of Cham of whom see above verse 7 of this man here some do hold that the country of the Ishmaelites and Amalekites is called thus Genesis 25.8 1Samuel 15.7] and Jobab all these were Joktans sons.
\p
\v 30 . And their habitation was from ,Mescha off as ye g towards Sepgar the mountain of the east [that is of Chaldea see Numbers 23.7]
\p
\v 31 . These are the sons of Sem after their families after their languages in their countries according t their nations.
\p
\v 32 . These are the families of the sons of Noah according to their births [see above chapter 5 verse 1] in their nations and by them are the nations divided upon the earth after the flood.
\c 11
\s All men hitherto had but one language verse 1 the children of men undertake of mere presumption to build a city with an exceeding high tower 3 God hinders their progress by dividing their language and scattereth them by the means abroad throughout the world 6 Babel retains the name thereof 9 Sem’s posterity unto Abraham 10 who together with his father with Sarai and Lot departs from Ur of the Chaldeans to Haran 29.
\p
\v 1 And all the earth [all the inhabitants of the earth before and after the flood until his division of his languages happened ] was of one language [Heb. Lip: and so in the sequel and this language is supposed to have been the Hebrew which hath its name since of Heber it having continued in its posterity among other reasons therefore that the proper names of the first man are of the Hebrew original and etymology as Adam, Heva, Heva, Cain,Abel &c.] and of sort of words.
\p
\v 2 . But it came to pass as they [this is understood of Cham’s posterity and their chieftain Nimrod see above chapter 10 verse 10] journeyed towards the east [from the place whither they were first gone when by reason of great increase and multitude of people they were driven to enlarge their quarters from mount Ararat were the ark rested see chapter 8.4] that they found a plain in the land of Sinker [where Babel lay see chapter 10 on verse 10] and they dwelt there.
\p
\v 3 . And they say everyone of his neighbor let us strike tiles [ or make prepare brick ] and thoroughly burn them [Heb. Burn with or unto burning that is make or bake hard by much burning ] and the tile or brick was instead a stone unto them and the slime was to them instead of lime or mortar [that which is rendered slime here was a very tough bituminous matter cleaving and sticking faster on then any pitch of which there was great plenty in those parts see chapter 14 verse 10 historians tells us that the walls of Babel were mortared with this matter and grown as hard as iron in this time.]
\p
\v 4 . And they said come on let us build us a city and a tower whose top or uppermost [Heb. Head] be in the heaven [ an expression serving for exaggeration and magnifying a ting see Deuteronomy chapter 1 verse 28 and 9.1 Psalms 107.26 Matthew 11.23 this was a most wicked and presumptuous design as if in despite of God and all men they would raise such a fabric that should secure them against any power whatsoever] and let us work a name for us left we be scattered over all the earth [Heb. All the face of the earth and so below verse 8, 9.]
\p
\v 5 . Then the Lord came down for to behold the city and the tower [spoken of God infinite and omniscious after the manner of man and implying God knew and saw all their presumptuous and wicked purpose and made it known that he was ready to punish the same accordingly] which the children of men did built [see chapter 6 on verse 2.]
\p
\v 6 . And the Lord said behold they are one sort of people and have all one sort of language and this is that they begin to make by now [by this kind of speaking is held forth the wrath of God and his purpose to interrupt this work of theirs] should they not be cut off unto them whatsoever they had projected to make? [Others they will nothing be cut off to them or there will be let in nothing that is they are resolved to go through with their business.]
\p
\v 7 . Come on let us descend [compare chapter 1.26 the first annotate there ] and let us confound their language there that everyone may not here the language of thy neighbor [not hear that is not understand thus the word hearing is taken for understanding what is heard see chapter 42.25 Deuteronomy 28.49 1Kings 3.9 Jeremiah 5.15 1Corinthians 14.2.]
\p
\v 8 . Thus the Lord scattered them thence over all the earth [that which they thought to prevent came through Gods just judgment unavoidably upon them] and they ceased to built the city.
\p
\v 9 Therefore they called the name Babel [others he called viz. the LORD see chapter 10.10 the word Babe signifies confusing a confuse mingling mixing together r confusion is come r in it is confusion] from there the lord confounded the language of all the earth and from thence the Lord scattered them all over the earth.
\p
\v 10 . These are the births of Sem and Sem was hundred years old [Heb.. a son of hundred years that is so old he was see chapter 7.6] and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood.
\p
\v 11 . And Sem lived [that is had lived or was so old see chapter 5.3] after that he had begotten Arphaxad five hundred years and he begat sons and daughters.
\p
\v 12 . Arphaxad lived thirty five years and he begat Selah [Heb. Schelach.]
\p
\v 13 . And Arphaxad lived after that he had begotten Selah four hundred and three years and he begat sons and daughters.
\p
\v 14 . And Selah lived thirty years and he begat Heber.
\p
\v 15 . And Selah lived after that he had begotten Heber four hundred and three years and he begat sons and daughters.
\p
\v 16 . And Heber lived thirty four years and he begat Peleg.
\p
\v 17 . And Heber lived after that he had begotten Peleg four hundred and thirty years and he begat sons and daughters.
\p
\v 18 . And Peleg lived thirty years and he begat Rebu.
\p
\v 19 . And Peleg lived after that he had begotten Rebu two hundred and nine years and he begat sons and daughters.
\p
\v 20 . And Rebu live two and thirty and he begat Serug.
\p
\v 21 . And Rebu lived after that he had begotten Serug two hundred and seveb years he begat sons and daughters.
\p
\v 22 . And Serug lived thirty years and begat Nahor[Heb. Nachor.]
\p
\v 23 . And Serug lived after he had begotten Nahor two hundred years and he begat sons and daughters.
\p
\v 24 . And Nahor lived twenty nine years and he begat Terah [Heb. Terach others Luke 3.34 Thera.]
\p
\v 25 . And Nahor lived after he had gotten Terah one hundred and nineteen years and he begat sons and daughters.
\p
\v 26 . And Terah lived seventy years and he begat [that is he began then begat see chapter 5.32.] Abraham, Nahor and Haran [Abram is put in the first place not as being the eldest but the worthiest the like we read before of Sem chapter 5.32 and chapter 10.1.]
\p
\v 27 . And these are the birth of Terah, Terah begat Abram, Nahor and Haran.
\p
\v 28 . And Haran died before the face of his father Terah [that is in his father’s life time and presence] in the land of his birth in Ur of the Chaldeans [a city in the country of the Chaldees see Nehemiah 9.7 Acts 7.4.]
\p
\v 29 . And Abram and Nahor took them wives and the name of Abram his wife was Sarai and the name of Nahor his wife was Milca a daughter of Haran father of Milca and father of Jisca [Milca was married to her uncle Nahor which marriage were not expressly forbidden by laws of those times Jisca is taken by some for Sarai Abrams wife others hold that Sarai was not daughter of Haran but his own and both Abrams and Nahors sifter y one and the same father Terah but not by one mother compare chapter 20.12.]
\p
\v 30 . And Sarai was barren she had no child.
\p
\v 31 . And Terah took Abram his son [viz. after that he had understood by his son Abram that God had called him to go forth out of his country according to the relation made thereof in the 12 chapter]And Lot Harans son his sons son and Sarai his daughter in law and wife of his son Abram and they journeyed [viz. Terah and Abram ] with them [viz. with and Sarai ] out of Ur of Chaldeas for to go towards the land of Canaan and they came to Haran [Heb. Charan Acts 7.4 we read Charran which was a city of Mesopotamia well known in the histories see chapter 24.10 and 29.4.] and dwelt there.
\p
\v 32 . And the days of Terah were two hundred years and Terah died at Haran.
\c 12
\s Abram removeth upon Gods command and promise with Sarai, Lot and all he had gotten at Haran from thence to the land of Canaan verse 1 comes out Sichema and Bethel and there after God’s apparition to him sets up the public worship of God 16 from thence he takes a journey into Egypt in a time of death and desireth Sarai to say that she was his sister which cause her to be taken from him but by Gods wonderful and gracious providence she was soon restored unto him 14.
\p
\v 1 Now the Lord had said to Abram [viz. before he came away out of Chaldea for this command was the cause of his removal before he knew yet whether he was to go which was revealed to him afterwards see chapter 11.31 compare Acts 7.3,4] go thou [or go for thee or get for thee that is for thy own good see chapter 22.2 item fly thee chapter 31.32 otherwise the word thee is often used in the Hebrew as a superstitious or redundant addition & thus some take it likewise in this place ] out of the country and from thy kindred and from thy fathers house towards the land that I shall shew thee [he names no country thereby to make trial of to exercise and manifest Abram his faith obedience and patience.]
\p
\v 2 . And I will make thee a great people [not only in regard of the multitude of people whose father thou shalt be after flesh but like wise for heir excellencies sake they being to be my own people and peculiar inheritance to whom ye shall be a father after the spirit Romans 4.11 ,12, 16, 17 and chapter 9.6,7,8 Galatians 3.7.] and bless thee [the blessing of God doth signify all manner of mercies and benefits either in general bodily and spiritually earthly and heavenly temporal & eternal see chapter 24.1 Deuteronomy 28.2, 3,4 &c. or in particular any one sort of them see chapter 1.22 ,28 and chapter 39.5 Deuteronomy 7.13 Ephesians 1.3 ] and make thy name great & be thou a blessing [ that so exceedingly blessed that thou shalt not only possess my blessing in thyself but likewise that the same blessing shall through thy seed be spread abroad upon many others without number.]
\p
\v 3 . And I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all generation of earth be blessed [in that is in thy seed see chapter 22.18 and 26.4 and 28.14 which seed is Christ Galatians 3.16 who was to come forth after Abram is Galatians 3.28,29 others with thee viz. through faith in Christ as Galatians 3.9 in thee explained with Abram see likewise Romans 4.111, 12, 16.]
\p
\v 4 . And Abram departed as the Lord had spoken to him and Lot when with him and Abram was seventy five years old [Heb. A son of five years & seventy years ] when he went out of Haran [wither he was come before with his father Terah out of Chaldea see chapter 11 verse 31.]
\p
\v 5 . And Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother son and all their substance which they had purchased [these were firstlings as it were of the promised blessing which Abram and his received in Haran the Hebrew word compriseth all manner of goods and chattels consisting in either cattle , money, plate or household staff and furnisher ] and the souls which they had begat in Haran [that is men or women of servile condition whom they had acquired and such as were born after by the same for Abram had no children as yet the Hebrew word rendered here souls is taken thus for men folks or persons chapter 17.14 exodus 12.15 Leviticus 2.1 Numbers 23.10Deuetronomy 24.7 Jude 16.30 Mark 3.4 &c.] and they went forth to go toward the land of Canaan [of the borders and limits of this land called Palestine afterwards and the land of promise it being to Abrahams posterity below verse 7 see chapter 10.19 and the annotate ] and they came into the land of Canaan.
\p
\v 6 . And Abram passed through that land till unto the place of Sichem [Heb. Schechem situated in the midst of the land of Canaan in mount Ephraim Joshua 21.21 Jude 8.31 and Chronicles 6.67 Acts 7.16 otherwise called Sichar John 4.5] unto the oak-bush or grove [ others the plain see Deuteronomy 11.30 for the Hebrew word signifieth either ]Merch [this may be the name of a man of whom this place was so called ] and the Canaanites [Heb. Canaanite an accursed idolatrous and godless people descending from Canaan and the son of Shem see Zach.. 14.21] were then in that country.
\p
\v 7 . So the Lord appeared to Abram [by a new revelation to strengthen the faith of Abram that saw all the land possess and inhabited before him by the Canaanites] and say unto thy seed will I give this land then be built an altar thereunto the Lord that had appeared to him [viz. to perform there his sacrifice prayers and thanksgiving and so to exercise and practice the whole outward worship of God there among his own in opposition of the Canaanites idolatry which is called otherwise the calling upon of the name of the Lord see verse 8 and chapter 4.26.]
\p
\v 8 . And then he broke up from thence to the mountain towards the east of Bethel [a city lying in that part of the land which afterwards fell to the tribe of Benjamin and was first named thus by Jacob in his journey to Mesopotamia before which time is called Luz see chapter 28.19] and he pitched his tents and Bethel west-wards see chapter 13.14 and chapter 288.14 Numbers 3.23 Deuteronomy 3.27 &c.] And Ai east-ward [Ai was a city of the land of Canaan in the tribe of Benjamin standing east-wards to Bethel see Joshua 7.2] and built there an altar to the Lord and called the name of the Lord [see chapter 4 on verse 26.]
\p
\v 9 . After that Abram departed going and parting [that is travelling fairly on and on still] south-ward.
\p
\v 10 . And there was famine in the country [here Abrams faith is to put trial Canaan was a very fruitful land indeed Deuteronomy 8.7,8 but now for the iniquity of the inhabitants visited with barrenness Psalms 107.34] so Abram went down [not to tempt God he resolved for a time to withdraw himself to eschew the present death]to Egypt[ a country called in the Hebrew Mitstraim of Mitstraim the son of Cham lying in Africa bordering eastwards on the red-sea and a part of Arabia southwards on Ethiopia west-ward on Lybia and north-ward on midland sea a country very frequently mentioned in the scriptures chapter 13.10 and 39.1 &c.] to sojourn there as a stranger the famine being grievous in the country.
\p
\v 11 .And it came to pass as he drew near to come into Egypt that he said to Sarai his wife behold yet I know that thou art a woman fair of counternance [here Abram falls into carnal fear where he should have trusted in his God.]
\p
\v 12 . And it shall happen when the Egyptians shall see thee they will say this is his wife and they will kill me and keep thee alive.
\p
\v 13 . Say yet thou art my sister that it may go well with me for thee and my soul may live for thy sake [my soul that is my person see above on verse 5.]]
\p
\v 14 . And it came to pass when Abram came into Egypt that the Egyptians saw this woman that she was very fair.
\p
\v 15 . Also Pharaohs princes saw her [that is the principal Lords nobles and officers of Pharaoh court who commonly seek to pleasure their princes with such kind of services ]and commanded her before Pharaoh [ Pharaoh was a common title of the king of Egypt which kept for ages till they got the name of Ptelomeus] and that woman was taken away to Pharaohs house [not to the king but to the royal Seraglio to be sitted and prepared there according to the custom of those countries that the king might take her to wife’s chastity together so then she was taken away viz. for to be brought and conducted to that house the Hebrews do frequently comprehend under the signification of one word another yet as here and elsewhere the word Lakach is used see chapter 18.5 chapter 24.22 and chapter 27.13 and other words in places see chapter 28.7 and Psalms 143.3 Ezekiel 28.16.]
\p
\v 16 . And he was beneficial for Abram for her own sake [as having taken her to his house with intent to marry her which he desired to do rather with the good will of Abram then otherwise] so that he had sheep oxen asses and men-servant and maid servants and she asses and camels [under the word of sheep and oxen all kind of small and great cattle is comprehended so chapter 13.5 and 20.14 and 26.14 &c. see likewise Leviticus 1 on verse2.]
\p
\v 17 . But the lord plagued Pharaoh with great plagues also his house by reason of Sara Abrams wife [what kind of plagues those were is uncertain but doubtless they served as well to hinder and obstruct the abusing of Sarai body as to punish the king and his domestic and country trespass.]
\p
\v 18 . Then Pharaoh called Abram and said what this that thou hast done unto me is? Why didst thou let me know that she was thy wife? [Pharaoh knew it by this timer question less partly by the quality of plagues that was upon him and the trouble of his conscience about it and partly also by an instinct and revelation from God as like happened another time with Abimelech see chapter 20.3.]
\p
\v 19 . Why hast thou said she is my sister so that I might have taken her for me to wife and now lo there is thy wife take her and adapt.
\p
\v 20 . And Pharaoh charged his men concerning him and they conducted him and his wife and all he had [here is no mention made of Abrams reply by way of excuse he having doubtless been sensible of his weakness in this particular and acknowledge the same freely together with the special favor of the Lord in managing the whole business to such an issue.]
\c 13
\s Abram returns with Sarai , Lot and great riches out of Egypt into Canaan and sits down by Babel verse 2 Abram and Lot by reason of both their store of wealth and cattle and their men’s debate and difference part asunder 5 Lot chuffing the godly tract of Sodom 10 God appears to Abram and repeats his promises 14 Abram travels on Gods commands to view the land of Canaan and pitcheth his tent by Hebron and built an altar to the Lord 17.
\p
\v 1 Thus Abram came up out of Egypt towards the south [that is the south quarters of Canaan ] he and his wife and all he had and Lot with him.
\p
\v 2 . And Abram was very rich [Heb. Very heavy thus already felt the truth of divine promise he intended but to keep himself from starving in Egypt and return thus loaded with riches ] in cattle in silver in gold.
\p
\v 3 . And he went following his journeys [following the ways and places through which he formerly descended into Egypt see chapter 12.9 or he journeyed according as a transportation and carriage of his goods and much of his cattle would permit] from the south unto Babel [see chapter 12 on verse 6, 8] unto this place where this tent had been in the beginning between Bethel and between Ai [see chapter 12 verse 6, 8]
\p
\v 4 . To the place of the altar which at first he had made there and Abram called there upon the name of the Lord [compare chapter 4. Verse 26 and 12.8.]
\p
\v 5 . And Lot who went with Abram had likewise sheep tents and oxen.
\p
\v 6 . And that land did not bear them [that is not able to sustain them] to dwell together for their substance was much.
\p
\v 7 . And there was a contention between the herdsmen of Abrams cattle and between the herdsmen of Lots cattle [see chapter 21 and 26 where you like find the contention recorded ] also the Canaanites and the Pherizites dwelt then in that country [because the old inhabitants left little room in part of the land for these strangers therefore Abram and Lot having great store of cattle and being doubtless not a little envied by the inhabitants they could not well find sufficient accommodation in one place for such a quantity whence not only contention arose between the herdsmen but further trouble likewise was to be feared might ensure from these Canaanites see below chapter 21.25 & 26.15,20,21.]
\p
\v 8 .And Abram said to Lot let there be no stifle now between me and between thee and between my herdsmen and between thy herdsmen for we are men brethren [Heb. We are brethren not only after the flesh I being thy uncle and thou my nephew but also after the spirit we save one and the same God and giving scandal to the inhabitants by such contentions drawing reproach thereby upon the true worship of God and our possession.]
\p
\v 9 . Is not [such kind of asking implies strong affirmation so chapter 20.5 Exodus 14.12 Jude 4.6] the whole land before thy face? [that I it lies open for thee to be made use of or implode by thee seethe like phrase chapter 20.15 and chapter 34.10,21 and 47.6] part from me I pray if thou choose [this word is put here out of the 11 verse following] the left hand I will go to the right and if thou go to the right I will go to the left.
\p
\v 10 . and Lot lifted up his eyes and behold all the plain of Jordan [ this is the name of the river moistening the land of Canaan and springing from two heads in mount Lebanon called Jor and Dan] that the same wholly moistened it before the lord had destroyed Sodom and Gomorra it was as the garden of the Lord that is to say an extraordinary fair & pleasant garden as the Camp of God 1 Chronicles 12.22 the hills of god Psalms 36.7 the Cedars of god Psalms 80.11 the wrestling of God Genesis 30.8that is every and mighty ones the word God here signifies here a great excellence ] as Egypt [see Ezekiel 31 where the fruitfulness of Egypt and Assyria are compared together] coming to Zoar [ Heb. Tsobar a city that lay about Sodom and Gomorra which had the name that Lot had retreated thither see chapter 19.23 being formerly called Bela see chapter 14.2.]
\p
\v 11 . So Lot chose for himself all the plain of Jordan and Lot went to the east and they were parted the one from the other [Heb. The man from his brother.]
\p
\v 12 . Abram then dwelt in the land of Canaan and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched tents even unto Sodom.
\p
\v 13 . And the men of Sodom were evil and great sinners against the Lord [Heb. Sinners against the Lord much notwithstanding the great wickedness of Sodomites and neighboring people Lot chose this tract for the goodness of it others before the Lord compare chapter 6.11 and 10.9.]
\p
\v 14 . And the Lord said to Abram after that Lot was parted from him [ God here doth comfort Abram upon his nephew parting from him and choosing fro himself that goodly tract ] lift up the eyes and regard the place where thou art north-ward and south-ward and east-ward and west-ward [Heb. To the sea as chapter 12.8.]
\p
\v 15 . For all this land that thou seest [not that he then saw all but all that was promised him that will I give to thee [viz. to thyself the right to the earthly Canaan and to thy seed after the flesh in due time the real possession and afterwards to thee and thy spiritual seed together here the right to the heavenly Canaan and hereafter the everlasting fruition of the same all of my own free gift and grace ] and thy seed [not only as earthly habitation for thy fleshly seed but likewise as a pledge and token of heavenly country and mansion place for thy spiritual seed compare Hebrews 11.9,10,14,15,16] in eternity [ that is for a long time viz. until the Messiah the seed of the blessing shall be born of flesh and have accomplished the work of salvation upon the earth the Hebrew word among the signification is often taken fro the whole time of the law see chapter 17.13 and 48.4 Psalms 132.14 or properly in eternity in regard namely of the spiritual seed and Canaan.]
\p
\v 16 . And I shall put thy seed as the dust of the earth [Abrams seed is likened to the dust of the earth in regard not of just the like quantity or number but so great and vast a multitude of them as is held numberless or part account among men see the like phrase chapter 15 verse 5 and 22.17 and 32.12] so that if any shall be able to tell the dust of the earth thy seed also shall be told.
\p
\v 17 . Get thee up walk through this land in its length and its breadth I will give it to thee.
\p
\v 18 .And Abram pitched tents [that is in his journeys and removing he pitched his tents here and there ]and came and dwelt at the oak-bushes [or grove others in the flat fields or plain ] of Mamre[this Mamre was an Amorite dwelling by Hebron see chapter 14.verse 13 and 24 and this name is to be distinguished from that of more above chapter 12 verse 6 ] which are by Hebron [or who is at Hebron which city at that time was called Kiriath Arbe or the city of Arba but afterwards Hebron see chapter 23.2 and 35.27 Numbers 13.23 Joshua 14.15 2Samuel 5.5 ] and he built an altar there to the Lord.

\s The kings of Sodom and other cities revolt from Kedor Lamoer and are thereupon invaded and subdued by him with the help of three kings verse 1 Sodom is plundred and Lot together with others carried away captive11 Abram hearing of it marcheth with his own men and confederates to pursue those king and surprising and defeating them sets Lot and the rest of the prisoners at liberty 14 after the victory of his refreshed and blessed by the king and priest Melchizedek to whom he gives the tenth of the spoil 18 and swears that of whatsoever belonged to the king of Sodom he desired nothing of himself 21.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in the days of Armaphel the king [understand here none of such great and mighty kings and monarchs as got up afterwards but such chieftains and governors only as had the command and the government but some of the tracts or places with some quantity o men restoring under their jurisdiction which appears by this that the five cities Sodom Gomorra &c. had each of them their king verse 2] of Sinear [see chapter 10 on verse 10] Arioch the king of Ellasar [upper Suffiana in Assyria compare chapter 2 on the annotate on the name of Havila verse 11] Kedor Laomer the king of Elam the son of Sem[a country of Perside called Elymias of Elam the son of Sem see chapter 10.22] and Tideal the king of the nations [it should seem that the kings subject and soldiery consisted of several nations though some take it as if the word Gojim here was but the name of the certain place or country.]
\p
\v 2 . That they waged war [this is the first war plainly set down and recorded in holy writ nor is there any other history extant in the world that gives account of any war is old as this] with Bera king of Sodom and with Bisra king of Gomorra Sinah king of Adama and Semeberr king of Zehoim and the king of Bela this is Zoar [see chapter 13.10 those cities which here are visited with war were all of them Zoar only excepted not long after consumed with fire and brimstone from heaven because of their intolerable wickedness.]
\p
\v 3 . All these assembled themselves in the vale of Siddim [others towards or to this was the plain or low country wherein the foresaid cities were situated ] that is the salt sea [thus called after the destruction of the said cities the same whole tract abound before with abundance of salt and blackish slime pits verse 10 becoming afterwards or turning into great stinking pool otherwise called Lacus Asphaltites that is pitch or glue or slime sea as also the dead sea no living creature being able to remain alive in it.]
\p
\v 4 . Twelve years they had served Kedor Laomer [having been it is like subdued so far by him in some former war that they were become tributary to him ] but in the thirteenth year [Heb. Thirteen years that is the thirteenth and so in the next verse fourteen and fourteenth ] they fell off.
\p
\v 5 . So Kedor Laomer came in the fourteenth year and the king that were with him and smote the Rephaim[a people descending from Canaan see chapter 15.20 others giants who are conceived to be so called from their sound vigor and strength ] in Asteroth Karnaim [ a city beyond Jordan called likewise Asteroth by itself Deuteronomy 1.4 and Joshua 9.10 & 13.31 her surname is Kernaim which it sems was given her from the situation resembling two Ram horns ] and the Zuzim in Ham and the Emim [a certain people which is likewise were reputed Giants Deuteronomy 2.10 ,11] in Schave KIriathaim [a city built afterwards in Gilead by the Reubenites formerly as it seemeth called Schave see verse 17 Numbers 32.37 Joshua 13.10 others in the plain and champion-field.]
\p
\v 6 . And the Horites [Heb. The Chorites a people that dwelt in Seir as likewise Esau afterwards see chapter 32.3 until the Edomites or Esau's posterity droe them out thence see chapter 36.20 and Deuteronomy 33.2 and 1Samuel 25.1 Habakkuk 3.3 hence the desert or wilderness of Paran hath its name see chapter 21.21 an numbers 10.12] which is by the desert.
\p
\v 7 . Then they turned again and came to En mispat that is Kades [as viz. it was called in Moses times lying in the desert of sin see Numbers 20.11,14,16,22 a distinct place as some do hold from Kades Barnea where may be seen Numbers 32.8 Deuteronomy 1.19 ] and smote al the land ] of the Amalekites [a people descending from Esau which inhabited the same afterwards see chapter 36.12 ] and the Emorites also [likewise a people of Canaans off-spring see chapter 10.16 ] that dwelt at Hezezon Tamar [Heb. Chatsatson afterwards called Engedi see Joshua 15.62 1Samuel 24.1 and 2Chronicles 20.2.]
\p
\v 8 . Then there went forth the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorra and the king of Adama and the king of Zechoim and the king of Bela this is Zoar and they put buttail-array against them in the valley of Siddim.
\p
\v 9 . Against Kedor Laomer the king of Elam and Tideal the king of nations and Amarphel the king of Sinear and Arioch the king of Ellasar four kings against five.
\p
\v 10 . Now the valley of Siddim was full of flame pits [Heb. Pits-pits thus one and the same word is doubled by the Hebrews to express the quantity or multitude of things 2Kings 3.16 Jeremiah 2.13] and the king of Sodom and Gomorra fled and fell there [a phrase of such a perish in the battail or otherwise see Joshua 8.24,25 Jude 8.10 and 12.6 and 1Chronicles 21.14 the fallen ones are here put in the oppositions to them that escaped others fell therein or fell down ] and the remainder fled to the mountains.
\p
\v 11 . And they took all the substance of Sodom [see chapter 12.5 and here verse 16, 21] and Gomorra and all their victual went away.
\p
\v 12 . Also they took Lot Abrams brothers sons and his substance and went away for he dwelt in Sodom [Lot namely see chapter 13.12.]
\p
\v 13 . Then there came one that was escaped and related it to Abram the Hebrew that was dwelling by the oaken bushes [see chapter 13 on verse 18] of Mamre the Emorite brother of Escol and brother of Aner who were Abrams confederates [Heb. Lord of covenant the word Bathal doth in general signify him that is in possession of anything or useth it or is inclined & affected to it &c. as chapter 37.19 Lord of dreams one that hath many dreams chapter 49.23 Lords of arrows they that use many arrows 2Kings 1.8 Lord of hair one that hath much hair Proverbs 29.22 Lord of heat or wrathfulness one that giveth to that of passion here in this place Lords of covenant are those which were covenant together.]
\p
\v 14 . When Abram heard that his brother [that is nephew his brother Harans sons see chapter 11.27] was taken prisoner he armed his instructed or trained ones [or apprentice the Hebrew word doth signify one that is instructed in something from his youth whether it be in matters of religion or military affairs or otherwise others his dedicated and appropriated ones] the in-born of his house three hundred and eighteen and the pursued them with Dan. [A little city lying at the foot of the mount Libenus and the north border of Palestine formerly called Laschem Joshua 19.47 or Lais Jude 18.27.]
\p
\v 15 . And he divided himself by them against them by night he and his servants [together with the man of Aner Escol and Mamre who were marched forth with him as confederates see verse 24] and smote them and he pursed them unto Hoba which is on the left hand of Damascus [this is that famous metropolis in Syria see Isaiah 7.8 and 17.1 Jeremiah 49.25 Acts 9.2.]
\p
\v 16 . And he brought all the good substance back and Lot likewise his brother and his substance brought again as also the woman and the people.
\p
\v 17 . And the king of Sodom went forth to meet him after that he was returned from smiting Kedorlaomer and the kings that were with him unto the vale of the schave [see above verse 5] that is the kings vales [ thus called by reason of this encounter see further of this vale 2Samuel 18.18.]
\p
\v 18 . And Melchizedek [Heb. Melchitsedek who was a type of Christ see Psalms 110.4 Hebrews 7.1] King of Salem [Heb. Schalem afterwards called Jerusalem] brought forth bread and wine [to present Abram with and to refresh with wearied army not to make an offering thereof to God the Hebrew verb here used being nowhere in scripture taken for offering] and he was the priest of the most high God.
\p
\v 19 . And he blessed him [as a priest of the most high see Heb. 7.7] and said blessed be Abram to the most high God that possesseth heaven and earth [that is the Lord be gracious unto him and endue him with all manner of blessings in soul and body.]
\p
\v 20 . And blessed be the most high [that is extold with praise and thanks as chapter 9.26 and chapter 24.27] that hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and hath gave him the tenth of all [Abram gave the tenth to Melchizedek see Hebrews 7.4 &c. and compare the same with the following verses here.]
\p
\v 21 . And the king of Sodom said to Abram give me the soul [Heb. The soul that is the men or persons or people see chapter 12.5] but the substance take for thyself.
\p
\v 22 . Yet Abram said to the king of Sodom I have lifted up my hand to the lord the most high God that possesseth heaven and earth[that is I have sworn and lifted up hands see of the manner of swearing Exodus 6.8 Numbers 14.30 Deuteronomy 32.40 Ezekiel 20.5,6 Revelations 10.5,6.]
\p
\v 23 . If from a three to a shoe-latchet yea if of all that is thy I take I ought [this is an imperfect speech very usual among the Hebrews whereby they use to conceal the punishment which they make themselves liable to swearing falsely shewing thereby that tey except no kind of punishment but refer the same to the just judgment of God understand therefore in such passage woe be unto me or God do this or that thus and thus with me if I &c. see chapter 26.29] that thou do not say I have enriched Abram.
\p
\v 24 . Be it forth or without me [because I will take nothing of what is thine others read it besides only what &c. see the like phrase chapter 41.verse 16] only what the youths have spent and a part of these men that went forth with me Aner Escol and Mamre let them take their share [that is let not only the young men pass with what they spent of the enemies prey but those three men also be supplied with such a share as they shall demand.]
\c 15
\s Abram growing faint hearted is comforted by God in a vision by very glorious spiritual and temporal promises and justified through faith verse 1 God establisheth his covenant with Abram in peculiar manner foretelling and typifying what should befall his seed after him.9.
\p
\v 1 After these things the word of the LORD was or happened to Abram in a vision [a certain kind of divine revelation whereby a man that is not asleep hath either outwardly something representing unto him by God or his spirit taken up thereby to see or understand inwardly that which the Lord is pleased to make known to him Numbers 12.6,7,8 and 24.4 Isaiah 1.1 Acts 10.10 ,11 it should seem that God in this vision appeared likewise outwardly to Abram see verse 5 &c.] saying fear not Abram I am thy shield thy reward very great [these words comprehend the faithfulness of all happiness which God doth promise and give unto his children consisting in protection against all evils and he grant of all good to begin here and to be completed hereafter.]
\p
\v 2 . Then said Abram Lord LORD what shouldest thou give me [that is what gift shall I take pleasure or comfort in as long as I do not see the fulfilling of thy promise touching my seed whence the Messiah is to proceed ?] while l go along without children? [Others yet I go without children] and the steward of my house [Heb. The son of the errand or managing or stewardship of my house that is the steward or baily of my house so a son of strength is put 1Kings 1.52 for a strong or stout man and sons of captivity sons of oppression Proverbs31.5 for oppressed ones and Jeremiah 48.45 sons of uproar for man making uproar ] is this Damasco-man [Heb. Damesek that is man of Damascus DAmasco-man this is an imperfect speech which Abram completes in the next verse] Eliezer [the name Abram steward.]
\p
\v 3 . Moreover Abram said behold unto thou hast given no seed [that is no son see chapter 4 on verse 25] and lo he son of my house [that is my servant that was born in my house compare chapter 14.14 by this expression the house born servant are differenced from the sons of ones body or proper children as Job 19.17 Proverbs 31.2 Jeremiah 2.14] shall be my heir [Heb. Shall inherit me as also verse 4.]
\p
\v 4 . And behold the word of the Lord was to him saying this man [this Eliezer namely of Damascus] shall not be thy heir but he that shall come forth out of thy body [Heb. Out of thy bowl see 2Samuel 7.12 compare Genesis 35.11 and 2Chronicles 6.9] he shall be thy heir.
\p
\v 5 . Then he [God namely] led him [Abram] forth [the tent] and said look up now to heaven and tell the stars if thou canst tell them and he said unto them thus shall thy seed be [compare 13.16 and 1Kings 4.20]
\p
\v 6 . And he believed in the Lord [ not as if Abram had but then begun to believe but that he grew stronger in his faith overcoming the doubts of his flesh and more and more embracing and relying on the great promises which God had made him verse 1,4,5 concerning his seed and principally the Messiah to his own souls comfort and salvation ] and he imputed it to him for righteousness [the particle for is put in here out of Psalms 106.31 and Romans 4.3 Galatians 3.6 James 2.23teh sense is God of his mere grace held him righteous and justified that had no righteousness in himself whereby to subsist before the judgment seat and that through faith in his promise and in the promised mediator Romans 4.2,3&c.]
\p
\v 7 . Moreover he said unto him I am the Lord that led thee forth out of Ur of the Chaldeans [see chapter 11 verse 31] for to give thee in this land hereditarily to possess the same.
\p
\v 8 . And he said Lord, Lord whereby shall I know that I shall hereditarily possess it? [Abram though he believed yet he desireth further information and confirmation of god as others believers likewise have done in their times Jude 6.37 2Kings 28.]
\p
\v 9 . And he said to him take me a three-years heifer and a three years Goat and a three years ram and a turtle dove and a young dove [it is remarkable that here such beasts or creatures only are made use of as were mostly used for sacrifices.]
\p
\v 10 . And he brought all these unto him [viz. unto God who formerly verse 9 bid him take me that is to take to bring unto me &c.] and he [ Abram namely being doubtless instructed by God ] divided them through the midst and he laid each one part over against the other [Heb. The man of his part over against his neighbor or friend that is to say he laid the pieces belonging together right over against one another as the right side of the heifer over against the left &c.] But the fowl he divided not.
\p
\v 11 . And the wild fowl came down upon the carcass but Abram chased it away [by blowing as the property of the Hebrew word doth imply.]
\p
\v 12 . And it came to pass when the sun was going down there fell a deep sleep on Abram and behold a terror and great darkness fell upon him [darkness doth often in scripture signify terror affliction adversity tribulation Psalms 35.14 and 38.7 &c.]
\p
\v 13 . Then said he to Abram know for certain [Heb. Knowing thou shalt know ] that thy seed shall be foreign or a stranger in a country that is not theirs [understand the land of Canaan but principally Egypt ] and shall serve them [that is the inhabitants or owner thereof ] and they shall oppress them four hundred years[the number of these four hundred years after the plainest sense is here set down in gross not in the exactness the round number being made use of and the odd number left out as usual in the like relations see Jude 11.26 and 20.46,2Samuel 5.5 1Kings 15.25 the full number is four hundred and thirty years Exodus 12.41 Galatians 3.17 beginning from the time of the covenant made here by the God with Abram in confirmation of the former promises as doth appear by the words of the saints Paul Galatians 3.17 the end of the foresaid years is going forth of the children of Israel out of Egypt or the giving of the law others begin these years from Abrams going forth out of Ur in Chaldea and out of Haran or from the birth of Isaac or from time when Ishmael mocked Isaac which mocking is termed a persecution by Paul Galatians 4.29.]
\p
\v 14 . Yet shall likewise judge the people [to judge implieth many times as much as to judge and shew or to determine a mans cause either to his damage by punishing of him as he and Psalms 51.6 or to his advantage by protecting him as chapter 30.6 Psalms 7.9 Jeremiah 5.28 and 22.16] whom they shall serve and after that they shall go forth with great substance.
\p
\v 15 . And thou shalt go to thy father with peace [that is thou shalt die a bodily death while thy soul shall be gathered to others into life everlasting compare chapter 25 verse 8 and 17] thou shalt be buried in good age [Heb. In good age properly consists not only in good grayness a good age properly consists not only in length of life and temporal happiness but in a life pass and transacted in piety before God justice towards men sobriety and contentedness in and by ones self so chapter 25.8 and Jude 8.32 1Chronicles 29.28.]
\p
\v 16 . And the forth generation shall turn hither again [others in the forth generation they shall return &c. that is after the end of four hundred years the age of men being at that time ordinarily reckoned about a hundred years ] for the unrighteousness of the Amorites [and those other wicked nations rehearsed below verse 19, 20,21 so chapter 48.22,1 Kings 21.26 2Kings 21.11] is not perfect as yet [God having given this land unto the Amorites and determined not to drive them out thence until they should have deserved it in the highest degree he is resolved to let them spend and make up that time accordingly and in the interim to prove & exercise his own people Jeremiah 51.13 Matthew 23.32.]
\p
\v 17 . And it came to pass that the sun went down and it grew dark and lo there was a smoking furnace [Heb. Furnace o f smoke the oppression of people of Israel in Egypt is compared in the iron furnace Deuteronomy 4.20 and 1Kings 8.51 Jeremiah 11.4] and fiery torch [Heb. Torch of fire signifying the presence of God and the future deliverance from the oppression see Jude6.21 Isaiah 62.1 Zach. 12.6]which past through between those pieces [God makes up his covenant here with Abram in a most peculiar and solemn though very friendly manner like as the custom was to do at that time between one men friend and confederate with the other namely by slaying of beasts and dividing of the parts or pieces and the confederates passing through the midst of them in token that the covenant breaker deserved to be cut in pieces thus see Jeremiah 34.18,19.]
\p
\v 18 . At or on that the same day the Lord made [Heb. Cut or stroke a borrowed phrase from the slaying of the beast and dividing of the pieces mentioned verse 17.]a covenant with Abram saying unto the seed have I given this land [viz. by my determined purpose and declared promise chapter 13.15 however the performance and execution thereof must be deserted yet until the time aforesaid verse 13 ] from off the river of Egypt [ hereby is understood the river Sicher which divided Egypt from Canaan Numbers 34.5 Joshua 13.3 2Chronicles 13.15others do understand here the river Nilus] unto that great river the river Phrath [see chapter2.14 and the fulfilling hereof 2Samuel 8.3 and 1Kings 4.21 and 9.21 and 1 Chronicles 18.3 2Chronicles 9.26.]
\p
\v 19 . The Kenite and the Kenezite and the Kadmonite [the Rowl of the nation which did possess the land of Canaan the Israelites compare the same with chapter 10.15,16 &c. and the annotation there.]
\p
\v 20 . The Hethite and the Pherizite and the Rephaim [see of this chapter 14.5.]
\p
\v 21 . And the Amorite and the Canaanites and the Girgasite and the Jebusite.
\c 16
\s Sarai being barren, giveth Hagar her maid servant unto Abram for concubine verse 1 Hagar being with child begin to despise Sarai who complains thereof gets leave to humble Hagar and she fieth from Sarai into the wilderness 4 where God speak unto her sending her back to Sarai with temporal promises touching her son Ishmael whom she bare t Abram when he was eighty six years old 7.
\p
\v 1 Yet Sarai Abrams wife did not hear to him or brought net forth unto him and she and Egyptian maid-servant whose name was Hagar.
\p
\v 2 . Therefore Sarai said to Abram behold I pray the Lord hath shut me up [that is made me barren compare chapter 20 verse 18] that I bear not go in I pray to my maid-servant [see chapter 6.4 and so below verse 4 Sarai despairing of her own bodily issue and yet heartily longing for the promised seed she doth so far here forget herself that without asking Gods advice she counsels her husband to endeavor the fulfilling of Gods promises by such a means which though of common practice in those days was nevertheless contrary to the first institution of marriage] peradventure shall I be built up out of her [thus then Sarai did to make trial whether Abram might get a son by Hagar whom she might count her own maid-servant in her own house see chapter 30.3 Exodus 21.2 as for the phrase of building or building the house the same is likewise used chapter 30.3 Ruth 4.11 Deuteronomy 25.9 and by it meant the maintaining and the propagation of a family ] and Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai [Abram without once asking God about it whose promise it concerned suffers himself to be persuaded by Sari not through any base lust but through the reason she alleged and himself much affected the rather as that for yet it was hid to him whether the promised seed should be born of Sarai or some other.]
\p
\v 3 . So Sarai Abrams wife took the Egyptian Hagar and her maid-servant at the end of ten years that Abram had dwelt in the land of Canaan [viz. since he had quitted Haran and was come into the land of Canaan ] and she gave to Abram her husband [abusing the power which otherwise she had over the maid-servant and the body of her husband 1Corinthians 7.4] for a wife to him or to be a wife for him [understand such a alone as was of less worth and esteem then the first Hagar continuing a servant still and under the command of the mistress Sarai verse 4,8,9. See further the like concubines chapter 25.6 and 30.3,9 and of the spiritual sense of this match Galatians 4.22 &c.]
\p
\v 4 . And he went into Hagar and she conceived now when she saw what she had conceived then her mistress was despised in her eyes [Heb. Light in &c. that is undervalued slightly or little regarded.]
\p
\v 5 . Then Sarai said to Abram my wrong [that is the wrong I suffer this Sarai spake out of impatience ] is upon thee [or for thee for thy sake I is to be imputed to thee since thou canst not but take notice of Hagars vilifying of me And yet doest not reprove or chastise her for it ] I have given my maid servant into thy bosomy now she sees that she had conceived I am despised in her eyes the Lord judge between me and between thee [out of infirmity she commends the business to Gods judgment to punish the wrong doing party not making amends compare 1Samuel 24.13,16.]
\p
\v 6 . And Abram said to Sarai behold thy maid-servant is in thy hand [under thy power authority and command so below chapter 24.10 & 39.4,6,8 Numbers 31.49 Joshua 9.25 1Samuel 14.48 2Kings 8.20 Abram implies thus much although I have taken her for my second or secondary wife yet I have not withdrawn her from thy command therefore if she do amiss use thy authority as over ne that is still under thee] do to her what seems good in thy eyes and Sarai humbled her and she fed from her face.
\p
\v 7 . And the angel of the LORD [that is head of the angels the Lord Jesus Christ who therefore is likewise called the LORD verse 13 and chapter 18.26,33 Jude 6.14 and chapter 13 verse 19,22 ] found her [this expression doth set forth the watchful eyes of the Lord over this straying and distress Hagar ] by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain of water of Sur [Heb. Schur in the road or way of Egypt whence she was see below chapter 25.18 & Exodus 15.22 1Samuel 15.7.]
\p
\v 8 . And he said Hagar thou maid-servant of Sarai whence comest thou and wither thou go/ and she said I am flying from the face of my mistress Sarai.
\p
\v 9 . Then the angel of the Lord said to her turn again unto thy mistress and humbles thyself under her hands.
\p
\v 10 . Moreover the angel of the Lord said to her I will greatly multiply thy seed [Heb. Multiplying I will multiply here a divine work is attributed to the angel whence it appears that it was not a creature but the creator himself] so that by reason of multitude it shall not be numbered [note that this temporal blessing is to be differenced from the spiritual which remained with the seed of the promise.]
\p
\v 11 . Also the angel of the Lord said unto her behold thou art with child and shall bear a son and shall call his name Ishmael for the Lord hath heard thy distress [Heb. Heard after thy affliction.]
\p
\v 12 And he shall be a wild ass of the of a man [that is he shall be a savage rude man like unto a wild ass implying with all that he should be undaunted dreadful warrior see below chapter 21.20] his hand shall be against all hands against him [that is he shall provoke everyone to fighting and warring and by reason thereof shall be as much troubled by others which is to be understood not of his persons only but likewise of his posterity ] and he shall dwell before the face of all brethren [the sense is that he should exceedingly spread and enlarge the limits of his habitation to and among his kindred of whom he should not stand in fear but stoutly face them everywhere see chapter 25.18.]
\p
\v 13 . And she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her [ here the angel above mentioned is expressly called JEHOVAH the LORD compare above verse 7] thou God of regard [that is he hath seeth all things and hath now also been pleased favorable to regard me in thy grievous affliction putting me into the right way again reviving me with his comfort .] for she said have I also seen after him that regardeth me ?[ that is it not a wonder that I do yet regard the light now and still remain alive after that he appeared to me who looked after me in this my sad condition ? she thought she must need die for having seen the Lord compare below chapter 32.30 Exodus 24.11 Jude 13.22.]
\p
\v 14 . Therefore they called that well Lachai Roi [that is of the living one that seeth me she dominates that well from herself for having remained alive after that she had seen the Lord and from the LORD likewise for having so favorably regarded her yet some of the opinion that both denominations have regard to God that liveth and seeth all things] behold the same is between Cades [see above chapter 14 verse 7 and the annotations] and between Bered.
\p
\v 15 . And Hagar bare a son unto Abram and Abram called the name of the son whom Hagar had born Ishmael [doubtless being informed of Hagar that God himself had named the child thus in the womb see verse 11.
\p
\v 16 . And Abram was 86 years old [Heb. A son of eighty years and six years so in the first verse also of the next chapter] when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.
\c 17
\s God appears to Abram and renews his promise and covenant verse 1 changeth his name Abram into Abraham 5 institueth circumcision for a sign of the covenant 9 changeth the name of Sarai to Sarah with a promise of a son and mighty seed by her 15 at which Abraham rejoiceth very much yet prayeth for Ishmael and obtained a temporal blessing for him 17 Abraham and all the male of his house are circumcised 23.
\p
\v 1 Now when Abraham was ninety nine years old [Heb. A son of ninety and nine years this was the twenty fifth year after that he had received the promise of the multiplying o the seed at Haran above chapter 12 verse 2,3,4 ] the LORD appeared unto Abram and said to him I am God the almighty [that is being not only strong and able to defend and protect thee against evil but likewise as sufficient to provide all good things for both thy body and soul as being thy God that in myself do everlastingly and unchangeable possess an all sufficiency in so much that he must need be in a happy condition whom I accept to be in covenant with me ] walk before my face and be upright [without simulation and with an upright relying upon me and standing continually in fear and aw of me as in my presence so below chapter 24.40 compare above chapter 5.22,24 of the word upright see chapter 6 verse 9.]
\p
\v 2 . And I will put my covenant between me and between thee [that is I will renew the same and establish it with a holy sacrament see verse 10] and I will multiply thee very much [Heb. In much.]
\p
\v 3 . Then Abram fell upon his face [testifying thereby not only his nothingness and unworthiness but likewise his revering humble and thankful heart towards the almighty and gracious God so below verse 17 Leviticus 9.24 Ezekiel 43.3 ] and go spake with him saying.
\p
\v 4 . As for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt become a father of the multitude of people [not only according to the flesh of the Israelites, Ishmaelites, Idumeans, Kethureans, but especially according to the spirit of all true believers throughout the world of what stock nation or condition so ever they may be Romans 4.16,17 compare above chapter 12.2 and the annotations.]
\p
\v 5 . And thy name shall no more call Abram but thy name shall be Abraham [in the name the letter He is inserted being the first letter of the word Hamon which God alludes unto signifying multitude or a main quantity this is the first name God changed and hence the custom obtained of his giving names circumcisions] for I have put thee a father of a multitude of nations.
\p
\v 6 . And I will make thee exceeding fruitful and I will put or establish thee to or for nations [see above on verse 4] and shall come forth out of thee.
\p
\v 7 . And I will erect or establish my covenant between me and between thee and between thy seed after thee in their generation for an everlasting covenant [everlasting for all believers in Christ in regard of the spiritual part but for the Israelites temporally unto the coming of Christ in regard of the corporal part together with the dependence thereof and especially this sacrament of circumcision ] for to be a God unto thee [ that is savior through the messiah to come this manner of speaking comprehends all the good an benefits which this covenant of grace brings along with it see Leviticus 26.12 psalms 33.12 & 144.15 Jeremiah 31.33] and unto thy seed after thee.
\p
\v 8 . And I will give unto thee and thy seed after thee the land of thy sojourning strangers [into which thou art come and wherein thou hast travelled and sojourned hitherto and yet they shall sojourn for a time see below chapter 28.4 & 36.7 & 37.1 the word starship or sojourning is set down in the plural number to shew forth the continuance and length of time of his being a stranger in that land ] the whole land of Canaan for an everlasting possession [Heb. Possession of eternity see above on verse 7.] and I shall be a God unto them.
\p
\v 9 . Moreover god said unto Abraham thou now [that is as for thee or concerning thy part of the covenant after that God hath given and past his promises he recquireth likewise his peoples duty as the second completing part of the covenant compare this with verse 4] shalt keep my covenant thou and thy seed after thee in their generations.
\p
\v 10 . This is my covenant [ that is the sign and seal for my covenant as is declared verse 11 see Romans 4.11 this kind of speech whereby the son doth bear the name of the thing signified is frequently used about the sacraments not only to signify and declare unto the spiritual benefits but likewise to seal and confirm the same to every partaker of the covenant compare herewith Exodus 12.11 Matthew 26.17 Acts 22.16 & 1Corinthians 10.16 & chapter 11.24,25 Titus 3.7] that ye shall keep between me and between you [even as the natural impurity was common to both men and women so the promise of grace belonged likewise to both nevertheless God ordained a sacrament here which only could be administered unto men because that the men are the principal cause of progeny and consequently also propagating that natural impurity and corruption this was sufficient for that time until the Messiah should come and institute another sign applicable to both sexes that the women themselves are equally interested in the covenant appears chapter 34.14 Exodus 12.3 ,4 Joel 2 verse 15,16.]
\p
\v 11 . And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin [see Joshua 5.2, 3] and that shall be a token of the covenant between me and between you [here God speaketh properly of circumcision being that the same was properly a sign of the covenant and not the covenant itself as likewise he speaketh of the sacraments as of the Passover Exodus 13.9 of the holy baptism Matthew 3.11 and of the holy supper 1Corinthians 11.28.]
\p
\v 12 . A son then of eight days shall be circumcised to you all that is male in your generation the in-born of the house see above chapter 14.14 & chapter 15.3 ] and the bought one with money [ Heb. The getting or buying of money that is those gotten or bought for money] of all or every stranger [Heb. Son of the stranger] who is not of thy seed.
\p
\v 13 . The in-born of thy house and the bought with money shall surely be circumcised [Heb. Circumcising circumcised] and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant [see above on verse 7]
\p
\v 14 . And that which is male having fore-skin whose fore-skin flesh shall not be circumcised [understand he being of age and through unbelief or contempt neglecting the circumcision or not amending afterwards his parents neglect about him in that behalf by receiving circumcision others that shall no circumcise the flesh of the foreskin ] that same soul shall be destroyed out of her people the plural [that is the same man shall be excommunicated from the communion of gods people this phrase doth likewise according to the opinion of some imply a corporal punishment to be inflicted by the magistrate compare Exodus 31.14 Leviticus 17 on verse 4] he hath broken my covenant [see 1Corinthians 11.27,29.]
\p
\v 15 . Moreover God said to Abraham thou shalt not call the name of thy wife Sarai , sarai; but her shall be Sarah [ as the name of Abram was changed to Abraham by inserting the letter He so the name of Sarai is altered by exchanging the letter Jod or J into He or H at the end Sarai doth signify according to some my princess whereof Sarah doth properly signify whereof the reason is given in the next verse.]
\p
\v 16 . For I will bless her [see chapter 1.28] and give thee likewise a son out of or by her yea I will bless her so that she shall become nations kings of nations shall grow or be out of her.
\p
\v 17 . Then Abraham fell upon his face [see verse 3] and he laughed [viz. not doubting as Sarah chapter 18 verse 12 but wondering and rejoicing at it being strong in faith and fully persuaded God would and could make good his promise see Romans 4.19, 20, 21] and he said to his heart shall one that is an hundred years old have a child born? [Heb. A son of an hundred year &c.] And shall Sarah that is 90 year old [Heb. A Daughter of 90 year old] bear?
\p
\v 18 . and Abraham said unto God ah that Ishmael might live before thy face [ Abraham wisheth that Ishmael might wholly be abandoned by god but that God would have his eyes upon him to protect and bless him.]
\p
\v 19 . And God said indeed Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son and shall call his name Isaac [Heb. Jitschak God give him this name by reason of fathers laughing see verse 17] and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant [ see verse 7 ] to his seed after him.
\p
\v 20 . And concerning Ishmael I have heard thee and behold I have blessed him and make him fruitful and exceedingly multiply him twelve princes he shall get [ see the names of those princes chapter 25.13,14,15,16.] and I will put him to be a great people .
\p
\v 21 . but my covenant I will establish with Isaac [ observe this difference Ishmael hath outward or corporal good promised him but Isaac the covenant comprehending not only the corporal benediction but the spiritual also ] whom Sarah shall bear or bring forth unto thee on this set time in the second year[ that is the next ensuing]
\p
\v 22 . And he finished the speaking with and God went up from Abraham [viz. to heaven in that form or shape in which he had appeared to him verse1.]
\p
\v 23 . And Abraham took his son Ishmael and his in-born of his house all the bought ones with his money all that was male among the men of the house Abraham and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskin on that very day according as God had spoken with him.
\p
\v 24 . And Abraham was 99 years old [Heb. A son of 99 years old so in the sequel] when the flesh of his foreskin was circumcised.
\p
\v 25 . And Ishmael his son was 13 when the flesh of his foreskin was circumcised.
\p
\v 26 . And on that same day Abraham was circumcised and his son Ishmael [that is very same day on which God hath joined Abraham the circumcision so that he may no delay at all compare verse 23.]
\p
\v 27 . And all man of his house and the in-born of the house and brought ones with money even from the strangers were circumcised with him [Heb. From with the son of the stranger. The sense is that not only the in-born of Abrahams house and the bought ones were circumcised but the strangers also that served him being neither inborn nor bought others being of the strangers and not of Abrahams family others bought of the strangers Heb. From the son or child of a stranger as elsewhere.]
\c 18
\s Two angels and the Lord himself appear unto Abraham in the shape of three men whom he friendly invites and entertains verse 1 receives a promise of a son by Sarah the next year 10 Sarah laughs at it and is reproved 12 the two angels go on to Sodom but the Lord stays speaking with Abraham to whom he declares his purpose of destroying Sodom and Gomorra &c. 16 Abraham intercedes fervently for those of Sodom and God answers and satisfies him. 23.
\p
\v 1 After that the Lord appeared unto him [viz. to Abraham ] at the oak bushes or grove of Mamre [ see chapter 13 on verse 18 here Abraham had chosen him out of his habitation after that Lot was departed from him chapter 13 verse 18] as he sate in the door of his tent when the day grew hot.
\p
\v 2 . And he lifted his eyes and he saw and behold there stood three men over against him [ viz. there in the shape of men and men in Abrahams apprehension but indeed two angels and third the Lord indeed himself who for the time of employment appeared with human bodies wherewith they did walk sit down discourse and eat see Heb. 13.2 that the one of them was the Lord God is plain out of the first verse and by the sequel of his story ] when he saw them he ran to meet them from the door of his tent and bowed himself to the ground [viz. to exhibit them civil honor and respect so chapter 23.7,12 1Samuel 25.24 2Samuel 14.2 1Kings 1.23 Esther 3.2.]
\p
\v 3 . And he said my Lord [others my lords] have I now found grace [that is if thou count me of worthy of so much favor honor and friendship to find grace with men is to get their favor affection and friendship see chapter 32.5 & 34.11 & 39.4 &c.] in thy eyes [Abraham addresseth his speech to one of them that had the best presence whom afterwards he found to be the Lord] then I pray do not pass by from thy servant.
\p
\v 4 . That yet a little water might be brought [Heb. Taken see chapter 12.9, 10.]and wash your feet [ according to the custom of those countries to cleanse and refresh the same being that by reason of heat they used there to go with soles and fastened to their feet or barefoot altogether see chapter 19.2 & 24.31,43.24 & John 13.4,5] and lean under this tree [ that is rest yourselves there.]
\p
\v 5 . And I will fetch a bit of bread [ the Hebrews call all manner of meat bread 1Samuel 14.24 Matthew 6.11 & 15.2 Luke 14.11,15 compare chapter 3.19 ] that ye may strengthen your heart [see of this manner of speaking Jude 19.58 psalms 104.15 1Kings 13.7 to strengthen is here to refresh and nourish which is effect of bread Psalms 104.15 not of itself but through the blessing of God Deuteronomy 8.3 Matthew 4.4] then ye shall go forth therefore because ye are come over to your servant [ others for therefore are ye &c. not that he thought they had come of purpose to him but that God had led them thitherward by his prudence see chapter 33.verse 10] they said d as thou hath spoken.
\p
\v 6 . And Abraham hasted to the tent to Sarah and he said hast thee need three measures [Heb. Seim which was a certain measure for wares holding as much as 144 hen egg shells the third part of an Epha of which measure see likewise Exodus 16 on verse 36] of flour and make cake [Heb. Word doth signify such cakes as are on an hot heart under or upon hot cumbers see Exodus 12.39 Numbers 11.8 1Kings 17.3 & 19.6.]
\p
\v 7 . And Abraham ran to the beeves and he took a calf [Heb. A bus son that is a calf or young buck] tender and good and he gave it to the servant who hasted to make it ready.
\p
\v 8 . And he took butter and milk and the calf which he had made ready and he set it before them [Heb. before their face] and stood by them] to wait upon and serve them [under that tree and they did eat. [See verse 2.]
\p
\v 9 . Then they said unto him where Sarah is thy wife? [ not as if they knew it not but take occasion thereby to come upon the following discourse ] and he said behold in the tent [ Abraham pointed at his wives tent as appears by the next verse for the father of the family and the mother of the family had each of them their tent apart chapter 23.2 and 24.67 and 31.33.]
\p
\v 10 . And he said [ the Lord namely ] I shall assuredly return unto thee [ Heb I shall returning return this return must not be understood by just another apparition as this was but of the fulfilling of this promise called a visitation chapter 2.11 ] about this time of life [ that is the next year about this time of the men’s living another when this time of men’s living see the same phrase likewise verse 14 and 2Kings 4.16] and behold Sarah thy wife shall have a soon and Sarah heard it at the door of the tent which was behind him [either behind him that spake or behind Abraham as he stood there .]
\p
\v 11 . Now Abraham and Sarah were do full of days we be-dayed [Heb going in days the like phrase ye have chapter 241 Joshua 13.1 and 23.1 1Kings 1.1 Luke 17, 18] it had ceased to go [Heb. to be] with Sarah after the manner of women [or custom Heb. the way going or path thus the way is put by the Hebrews for custom use manner see also chapter 19.31 and 31.35.]
\p
\v 12 . So Sarah laughed [ not out of faith as Abraham had done before but out of weakness and difference looking more upon nature then upon the power of God ] by herself [ Heb. Her midst] saying shall I have pleasure after that I am grown old and my Lord is old?
\p
\v 13 . And the Lord said to Abraham [observe that he which hitherto was a spokesman and called before verse 9 is here called Jehovah the LORD] why did Sarah laugh saying should I indeed bear now I am grown old?
\p
\v 14 . Should there be ought wonderful for the Lord? [ viz. to compass or perform having past his promise once others should there be anything hid before the Lord viz. that he should not know it ] at the set time I shall return unto thee about this time of life [ so verse 10] and Sarah shall bear a son.
\p
\v 15 . And Sarah denied it saying I have not laughed for she was afraid [by reason of her discovered sin against God shame before the guests and ungratefulness towards her husband] and he said no thou hast laughed.
\p
\v 16 . Then the men arose from thence and looked towards Sodom and Abraham went with them for to conduct them [by way of civility see the like readiness Acts 20.38 and 21.5 Romans 15.4 and 1Corinthians 16.11 Titus 3.13.]
\p
\v 17 . And the Lord said shall I hide before Abraham what do I do? [That is sure I shall not hide it before him see the like asking implying a strong negative 2Samuel 7.5 compared with 1Chronicles 17.4 and Matthew 7.16 compared with Luke 6.44 see likewise Amos 3.7.]
\p
\v 18 . Because that Abraham shall certainly become [Heb. Shall being be] a great and mighty people and all nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? [That is in the seed Jesus Christ see chapter 12.3 and 22.18.
\p
\v 19 . For I have known him [ that is I have chosen affected and tendered him as my own thus the word knowing is taken in divers places as Psalms 1.6 Jeremiah 1.5 and 24.5 Hosea 13.5 Amos 3.2 John 10.27 2Timothy 2.19 ] that [ thus the Hebrew particles used here are taken Leviticus 17.5 Deuteronomy 20.18 and 27.3 &c.] he should command his children and his house after him and they keep the way of the Lord [ that is the pattern of Gods word instructing us in all things concerning our faith and conversation see Psalms 51 verse 15 &c.] for to d righteousness and judgment [ a phrase frequently occurring in holy scripture signifying whatsoever is good and right and comprehended in the first and second table of the law and appertaining to the private or public life of man compare Psalms 119.121] that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken over him.
\p
\v 20 . Further said the Lord because the cry of the Sodom and Gomorra is great [see chapter 4 on verse 10] and because their sin is very heavy or grievous.
\p
\v 21 . I will descend now [ see chapter 11 on verse 5] and view whether [ God knows all things most perfectly of himself but he speaks hereafter the manner of men as one that hath no mind to punish without enquiring and full knowledge of the fact and matter ] according to her cry, [ viz. Sodom or according to the cry of him that &c.] that is come to me they have done the utmost [Heb. Done or made the accomplishing that is fulfilled or filled up the measure of their sins see chapter 15.17 and 1Samuel 20.7 ,9 other whether they deserved the utmost destruction by their works ] as if not I shall know it .
\p
\v 22 . Then those men [understand the two angels see chapter 19. 1 for the Lord stayed speaking with Abraham remained standing yet before the face of the Lord.
\p
\v 23 . And Abraham slept on and said wilt thou destroy likewise the righteous with the wicked?
\p
\v 24 . Peradventure there are 50 righteous in the city wilt thou likewise destroy them and not spare the place the place for the sake of the 50 righteous that are within her?
\p
\v 25 . For be it from thee to do such a thing [ Heb. Be it far from thee to do after this thing here it appears that Abraham had no mind at all by the preceding queries to suspect God of righteousness for he takes not upon him to mind God of his office and to shew him what he ought to do otherwise but right] to kill the righteous with the wicked that the righteous should be like the wicked far be it from thee should the judge of earth do no right? [Here Abraham acknowledge the person speaking with him for the judge of the world which is the Lord Jesus Christ John 5.22, 27Acts 10.42 and 17.31.]
\p
\v 26 . Then the Lord said if at Sodom within the city I shall find the fifty righteous then I will spare the entire place for their sake.
\p
\v 27 . And Abraham answered and said behold yet I have presumed to speak to the Lord though I am dust and ashes [ viz. according to the body in regard of my beginning and ending in this world see chapter 3.19 Job 4.19 Ecclesiastes 12.7 1Corinthians 15.47 ,48 and 2Corinthians 5.1.]
\p
\v 28 . Peradventure the fifty shall want five shalt thou five then destroy the whole city? And he said I will not destroy her if I shall find forty five there.
\p
\v 29 . And he continued to speak to him and said peradventure shall forty be found there [viz. forty righteous person and so in the next verse] and he said I will not do it for the forty sake.
\p
\v 30 . Further said he let the Lord not incensed I pray [Heb. That it not incense the Lord his wrath namely see chapter 4.5,6 and verse 31 and 32.36] that I speak peradventure shall thirty be found there and he said I will not do it if I find thirty there.
\p
\v 31 . And he said behold yet I have presumed to speak to the Lord peradventure shall twenty be found there and he said I will not destroy her for the twenty’s sake.
\p
\v 32 . Yet adhuc said be let not the Lord be incensed I pray that I speak only this time peradventure shall there found ten and he said I will not destroy them for the ten sake.
\p
\v 33 . Then the Lord departed having finished speaking with Abraham and Abraham returned to his place.
\c 19
\s The two angels come in human shape to Sodom and are lodged and entertained by Lot verse 1 the Sodomites surrounded the house by night and intend abominably to abuse those guest 4 Lot goes about to dissuade them but in vain an d not without danger to himself 6 from which the angel withdraw him and strike the Sodomites with blindness that they were fain to quit the house 10 Lot with his wife and two daughters the son in law making mock of it are led out of Sodom and charged to save themselves of the mountain 17 but Lot entreats and obtains to shelter himself in zoar 18 the four cities and all the territories about together with the inhabitants and growth thereof are consumed with fire and brimstone from heaven 24 the Lord punisheth Lots wife 26 Abraham considers the destruction of these cities 27 Lot retires to the mountains where through drink he is ignorantly abused by both ibis daughters 31 from whence issued Moab and Ammon.
\p
\v 1 And the two angels [of whom mention is made above chapter 18.22 where they are called men as below verse 5 &c. the Hebrew word doth signify ambassadors sent ones messengers as also doth the word angels taken from the Greek tongue] came to Sodom in the evening and Lot sate in the gate of Sodom and when Lot saw them he arose to meet them and bowed himself with the face to the ground [compare above chapter 18. Verse, 2.]
\p
\v 2 . And he said Lo now my Lords turn in I pray unto the house of your servant [ that is into my house ] and overnight lodge there and wash your feet and ye shall arise early and go your way and they said no but we will overnight in the streets [ namely in case Lot should not persuade to the contrary of the importunity and to take up their lodging in his house as came to pass compare Luke 24 verse 28,29.]
\p
\v 3 . And he pressed them very much so that they turned into him and came to his house and he made them a feats and baked unleavened cakes [ which could be soon made ready that they might betake themselves so much the sooner to their rest compare above chapter 18.6.] and they did eat [ see above chapter 18 on verse 2.]
\p
\v 4 . Before they lay to sleep [ Heb. Before they lay down or when laid down viz. for to sleep so below chapter 28.13 Leviticus 14.47 and 26.6 &c.] the man of that city the man of Soddom from the youngest to the eldest had surrounded the house [ a most shameless and abominable insolence wherein they all conspired young and old from all parts of the city and that by night too ] and all the people from the utmost end [ of the city namely understand from one end and the other end of it.]
\p
\v 5 . And they called upon Lot and said to him where are those men that came this night unto thee? Bring them forth to us [ they are not ashamed to proclaim their sin and abominations in public and to have it known by all men this Sodomitical boasting in evil God reproacheth to the Israelites Isaiah 3.9 where he saith they boast themselves of their sins like those of Sodom and do not hide them ] that we may acknowledge them [ what kind of abomination they mean by this expression is plain enough by Lots answer see Leviticus 18.2 and 20.13 and 20.13 Romans 1.26,27 and 1Corinthians 6.9 and Jude verse 7.]
\p
\v 6 . Then Lot went forth unto them at the door and he shut the door after him.
\p
\v 7 . And he said my brethren do no evil I pray [ thus courteously Lot spake to these wretched men calling them brethren in regard of the common brotherhood of nature compare above chapter 9.5 and c below chapter 29.4 and Leviticus 19.17.]
\p
\v 8 . Behold yet I have two daughters who acknowledged men [ see of this phrase below chapter 24.16 Numbers 31.18 and Jude 11.39 Luke 1.34 ] I will bring them forth unto you and do unto them [ Lot endeavoring to hinder one abominable sin he gives way here through human fearfulness and adverseness unto another sin contrary to his fatherly duty and the rule Romans 3.8] as it is good in your eyes [ even what you will yourselves at your own pleasure see of this phrase below chapter 20.15 an d41.37 Numbers 24.1 &c.] only do nothing to these men for therefore they are gone in under the shadow of my roof [ viz. to be free and safe from all harm and violence to come under one shadow is to break one under his protection and safeguard compare Jude 9.15Psalms 36.8 Jeremiah 48.44.]
\p
\v 9 Then they said come father on [as threatening him if they could but get him into their hands] moreover said they this such a one is come for to dwell here as a stranger and should he judge judging? or he would judge judging see the annotate above chapter 2.16 compare 2Peter 2.8now shall we do the more evil then them and they pressed much upon the men upon Lot and they slept on to break open the door.
\p
\v 10 . Yet the men [the two angels Lot his guests] put forth their hand and caused Lot to come into them into the house and shut the door.
\p
\v 11 . And they smote the men at the door of the house with blindness [ viz. not only corporal but spiritual also this miraculous punishment was such upon the sight of their eyes not that they could not see at all but that they were blinded chiefly in the judgment and apprehension of their understanding and disabled thereby to discern and distinguished what they saw in some measure see the like 2kings 6.18] from the least to the greatest so that they grew weary for to find the door [ seeking the door with much labor and not able to find it they were so tired that they were fain to give over and shift away.]
\p
\v 12 . Then said those men to Lot whom hast thou here yet more? A son in law or thy sons or thy daughters and all whom or what thou hast in this city bring out of this place.
\p
\v 13 . For we go to destroy this place for that her cry [ understand that of the inhabitants of Sodom is become or grown great see above chapter 4 on verse 10 and 18.20] before the face of the Lord [thus made known unto him that according to his justice he was now about to avenge it for the face of the Lord is over them that do to avenge it for the face of the LORD is over them that do evil that he may destroy their embrace from the earth Psalms 34.17] and the Lord hath sent us forth to destroy her.
\p
\v 14 . And then Lot went forth and spake to his sons in law that were to take his daughters [ viz. to marry them so above chapter 6.2 and below chapter 24.3 an d228.6 an d34.9 Deuteronomy 7.3 ] and said get ye up go forth out of this place for the Lord goeth to destroy this city but he was in the eyes of his sons in law as jesting [ a lively image of the reckless and carnal men in the time approaching judgments see Matthew 24.38 Luke 17.28 ,29 , 1Thessalonians 5.3.]
\p
\v 15 And when the dawning arose the angels pressed Lot saying get up thee take thy wife and thy two daughters which are present [ Heb. Which are found hence some conjecture that Lot had more daughters which remained and perished with their husbands in Sodom ] that thou perish not with the unrighteousness of this city [ or in the punishment of the unrighteousness &c. see above chapter 4 on verse 13.]
\p
\v 16 . But he delayed [ doubtless being troubled & destructed with manifold carnal thoughts and cares ] so the men apprehend his hand and the hand of his wife and the hand of his two daughters for or because of the sparing of the LORD over them [ which Lot acknowledgeth below verse 19.] and they brought them forth and put them without the city.
\p
\v 17 . And it came to pass when they had brought them forth without then he said [ Heb. Viz. the LORD that had stayed with Abraham, above chapter 18.22 and was gone from him verse 33 though some do hold that this is one of the two angels that appeared unto Lot] save thee [ and escape so in the sequel ] for thy lifes sake [ Heb. Soul so below chapter 37.21 Deuteronomy 22.16 Joshua 2.13 1Kings 19.3 2Kings 7.7 Matthew 2.0 the meaning is that he should forget to care of his goods and look only to the saving of his life ] and look not about thee back and stand not this plain save thee towards the mountain that thou perish not.
\p
\v 18 . And Lot said to them [ viz. to the angels and addressing himself nevertheless in the sequel to the LORD who it seems to be present now with the two angels as before at Abraham ]] chapter 18 Nay I pray Lord.
\p
\v 19 . See yet thy servant hath found grace in thy eyes [ see above chapter 6 on verse 8] and hast made thy bounty great which thou hast don eto m for to save my soul alive but I shall not b able to b preserved towards the mountain left peradventure that evil cleave to me and I should die [ by the evil understand here that of punishment as this word is frequently used see Deuteronomy 31 verse 17 1Kings 9.9 and 14.10 Isaiah 45.7 Jeremiah 6.19 Amos 3.6 Lot is afraid that the mountain would be too far from him and that he might be surprised with that destruction by the way .]
\p
\v 20 . Behold yet this city is near to escape thither and she is little [otherwise it is but a small thing and so in the sequel] let me I pray be saved thitherward is she not little? [Otherwise is not that a small matter?] That my soul may live.
\p
\v 21 . And he said Lo I have received thy face also in the matter [ that is I shall be favorable to thee and in mercy grant thee this request also see this phrase below chapter 32.0 and compare the annotate] that I do not destroy this city wherefore thou hast spoken.
\p
\v 22 . Make hast save thee thitherward for I shall not be able to do ought until thou be come in there [for as much as I have decreed in mercy to spare thee ] there they called the name of the city Zoar [ that is a small or little formerly called Bela above chapter 14.2 see likewise above 13. On verse 10.]
\p
\v 23 . The sun arose above the earth when Lot came in at Zoar.
\p
\v 24 . Then the Lord [viz. the son of God of one and the same essence power and glory with the father and before both in this and preceding chapter often called JEHOVAH or the LORD to whom the father there hath surrendered all judgments John 5.22] made it to rain brimstone and fire [ before God executed a general judgment by the water here he maketh use of a some the hot lust burning Sodomites a type of everlasting judgment Revelations 19.20 this happens as some do calculate in the year after the creation 2048] over Sodom and over Gomorra [ to which add Adama and Zeboim out of Deuteronomy 29.23 Hosea 11.5 for all these four cities were burnt together ] from the LORD [ that is according to the judgment of many excellent interpreters from the father who worketh by the son John 5.19.]
\p
\v 25 . And he destroyed the same cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of these cities also the growth of the land.
\p
\v 26 . And his wife looked about [ contrary to the express charge verse 17 in which transgression unbelief and disobedience were mixed with covetousness and thankfulness] from behind him [ namely from Lot as the leader and the foreman of the company hastening towards the place where he might be saved ] and she became a salt-pillar [ her body namely which was turned into selfish matter the harder to grow and the longer to stand and endure there see Luke 17.32 Josephus recordeth that the same salt pillar stood yet in his time see the first book of the antiquites chapter 12 the tract of this county was afterwards called the salt-sea see above chapter 14.3.]
\p
\v 27 . And Abraham got himself up that morning very early towards that place where he had stood before the face of the Lord [see above chapter 18.22.]
\p
\v 28 . And he looked towards Sodom and Gomorra and towards all the land of the plain and he saw and behold there went up a smoke from the land like the smoke of the furnace.
\p
\v 29 . And it came to pass when God destroyed the cities of this plain the Go remembered Abraham [partly the intercession h had made above chapter 18.22,24 and partly the promises made unto him above chapter 12.3] and he led forth Lot out of the midst of destruction in the destroying f those cities in which Lot had dwelt [that is in one of which see the like phrase above chapter 18 .9 and 19.12 John 1.5 Matthew 7.44.]
\p
\v 30 . And lot went up out of Zoar and dwelt upon the mountain and his two daughters with him for he was afraid to dwell within zoar [ not withstanding that before he had thought it the safest place to retreat see verse 20 but now he fears God he would likewise destroy that city or else that the inhabitants might do him some mischief and violence .] and he dwelt in a cave he and his two daughters.
\p
\v 31 . Then said the first born to the youngest [ Heb. The little one ands in the sequel that is the youngest ] our father is old and there is no man in this land [ They knew well enough that there are men at Zoar but they were afraid that these would perish like the rest ] to go in to us [ see of this phrase above chapter 6.4 and 16.2,4 item Deuteronomy 25.5] after the manner of all the earth [ Heb. The way of &c. see above chapter 18. On verse 11.]
\p
\v 32 . Come let us give wine [ which doubtless they have brought along with them from Sodom or Zoar for provision ] to drink to our father and lie with him [ an abominable enterprise and grievous fall in Lots family.] that we may keep [ a son or child so below verse 34 see above chapter 4 on verse 25] alive of our father.
\p
\v 33 . And they gave their father wine to drink that night and the first born and lay with her father and he was not aware of it in her lying down or in her rising.
\p
\v 34 . And it came to pass the second day that the first born said to the youngest behold I lay yester night with my father let us give him likewise this night the wine to drink go in then lie with him that we may keep seed alive of our father.
\p
\v 35 . And they gave their father that night also wine to drink and the youngest arose and lay with him and he was not aware of it in her lying down or in her rising.
\p
\v 36 . And the two daughters of Lot conceived of their father.
\p
\v 37 . And the first born a son called his name Moab this is the father of the Moabites [ Heb. Moab a people sufficiently known in holy scripture having inhabited on the east side of Jordan and the dead sea between the river of Arnon and Jabbok] unto this day.
\p
\v 38 . And the youngest she likewise bare a son and called his name Ben Ammi this is the father of the children of Ammon [ that is the Ammonites the people likewise well known in holy scripture having likewise dwelt east ward of Palestine though northwards of the Moabites ] unto this day.
\c 20
\s Abraham removes to Gerar and saith Sarah to his sister verse 1 which causeth Abimelech to fetch her away for to marry her 2 but God hinders him by plagues and warning in a dream 3 whereupon he restores her back to Abraham not without civility and presents 9 Abimelech and his are cured again through the intercession o f Abraham verse 17.
\p
\v 1 And Abraham journeyed from thence [ viz. from the oak bushes or gross of the Mamre by Hebron see chapter 13.18 an d14.13 and 18.1 ] towards the south country [ Hebron and Mamre lay indeed themselves in the south end of Palestine but Abraham removed more southerly for reason not mentioned in the scripture ] and dwelt between kades [ see above chapter 14.7] and between Sur [ see above chapter 16.7] and he sojourned as a stranger at Gerar [ a city situated in the south-borders of Canaan not far from Bersaba and Zicklag see above chapter 10.19 and below chapter 26.1 and 2Chronicles 14 verse 13.]
\p
\v 2 . Now when Abraham had said of Sarah his wife she is my sister [out of like fear as had seized on him before his travel in Egypt see above chapter 11 .29 and12.13 and in this chapter verse 12] then Abimelech [this name is held to have been common to the kings of that country even as the name of Pharaoh in Egypt see above chapter 12.15 compare below chapter 12.15 compare above below chapter 26.1 and Psalms 24.2] the king of Gerar sent and took Sarah away.
\p
\v 3 . But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night [ God revealed himself in former times by dreams not only to his own but also to such as were none of his people and that in the behalf and for the good of his see below chapter 28.12 and 31.24 and 40.8 and 41.1 Daniel 2.1 and4.2] and he said to him behold thou art dead [ others thou art goest to die that is thou shalt die presently thou art a dead man if thou do not immediately restore his woman untouched compare below verse 7 and see like phrase below chapter 30 verse 1 and 48.21 an d50.24] because of the woman which thou hast taken for she is married to an husband.
\p
\v 4 . Yet Abimelech had not approached to her [ that is he had not lain with her this phrase is synonymous or equal with knowing or acknowledging of a woman above chapter 4.1 going into a woman above chapter 6. 4 or to touch a woman Proverbs 6.29 an d1Corinthian s7.1 and below verse 6 understand that he was hindered by God through sickness see below verse 6,17] therefore he said Lord wilt thou then also put to death a righteous [ that is innocent and guiltless in this matter compare 2Samuel 4.11] people? [That s not only those of my own family as verse 17 but others also of my subject as verse 9.]
\p
\v 5 . Did not he tell me she is my sister? and she also said he is my brother in uprightness of my heart and in purity of my hands [ Heb. Palms or the hollow of my hands see Job 17.9] have I done this [ that is the matter that my heart is clear from any adultery purpose and my body from any unchaste action thus the inward and outward innocence and unfainedness ether in general of the whole course of godly or in particular of or in any thing or action is expressed elsewhere also as 1Kings 9.4 1Chronicles 9.17 Psalms 24.4 and73.13 and 78.72 and 101.2.]
\p
\v 6 . And God said to him in the dream I knew it likewise that thou didst this in uprightness of thy heart [ hereby God doth not mean to pronounce him guiltless altogether in the taking away of Sarah away but only in regard of the purpose and act of adultery a very single unfeigned purpose in a bad action but proceeding out of unadvisedness or ignorance is expressed in such terms as these see 2Samuel 15.11 and 1Kings 2.34 and 2Chronicles 18.33] and I likewise did hinder thee to sin against thee to sin against me [ to trespass against Sarah and Abraham God reckoned as done to himself compare Psalms 51.6 and 105.14,15 Acts 9.5] therefore I did not permit thee [Heb. Give thee] to touch her [ see above verse 4 the annotations]
\p
\v 7 . Therefore now restore this mans wife for he is a prophet [ that is a man of God for singular knowledge and piety to him I do very freely reveal myself and whom I love and tender very much ] and h shall pray for thee [ or let him pray for thee ] that thou mayst live but if thou restore her not know that thou shalt die assuredly thou and all what is thane .]
\p
\v 8 . Then Abimelech rose up early in the morning and called all his servants [ understand his counselors principal officer and courtiers so 1Kings 1.2 an d10.5 2Kings 6.8 2Chronicles 24.25] and spake all those words [ or things matter what happened to him in the dream so likewise below verse 10 and chapter 24.66 &c.] before their ears [ that is that they heard them in their hearing ] and those men were greatly afraid [ as having themselves much furthered the taking away of Sarah for their kings service compare above chapter 12.15.]
\p
\v 9 . And Abimelech called Abraham and said to him what hast thou done to us? And what have I sinned against thee that thou hast brought a great sin over me and over my kingdom? [ that is thou wouldst by thy inconsiderateness have brought over us all or involved us in all great sin of adultery and the punishments thereof it is remarkable that the heathen king even in those days before the law did hold adultery to be such an abominable sin as might justly have brought a plague or great judgment upon the whole kingdom for this sake see below chapter 38.24 Leviticus 20.10 Deuteronomy 22.22 2Samuel 12.5,10,11 Jeremiah 29.22,23 Ezekiel 16.8,40 an d3.45,47 John 8.5] thou hast done deeds with me which ought not to be done [ that is such as are both unwarranted an dill becoming thee see the like phrase below chapter 34.7 Leviticus 4.2 ,13.]
\p
\v 10 . Moreover Abimelech said to Abraham what hast thou seen [or what hast thou looked into or observed moved thee thus deal with me?] that thou didst this thing?
\p
\v 11 . And Abraham sad for I thought [Heb. Said I that is I thought according as the word is oftentimes taken Exodus s2.14 Joshua .14 1Kings 5.5 2Chronicles 2.1 Isaiah 8.12 Acts 7 .28] only the fear of God is not in this place [as it he would have said here is goodly country indeed and plenty of all things but only there wants the fear of God among these people others sure there is no fear] so that they will put me to death for my wife sake [Heb. For the matter of my wife.]
\p
\v 12 . And verily also is she my sister she is my fathers daughter but not my mothers daughter [see above chapter 11 on verse 29] and she became a wife to me.
\p
\v 13 . And it was so when God made [ although the name of God ELOHIM being the plural number is commonly joined with a verb of the singular signifying the unity of divine essence nevertheless here it is constructed with a plural verb too for as some learned to conceived to signify the trinity o the persons Heb. When my ELOHIM they did or made &c. see the like phrase below chapter 35.7 Joshua 24.19 2Samuel 7.23 Psalms 58.12 Jeremiah 10.10 ] and wander out of my fathers house then I spake to her this by thy kindness which thou shalt do by me in every place where we shall come say of me he is my brother [ hereby Abraham seems to imply that departing from his fathers house he doubted much whether he should find any fear of God among any people where he was to come so that those of Gerar should have no reason to take exception as if he held this of themselves only in particular.]
\p
\v 14 . Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen also men servants and maid-servants and gave them to Abraham [this together with the following and former passages argue a great deal of civility in a heathen king God so disposing and ordering the same] and he restored him] Sarah his wife.
\p
\v 15 . And Abimelech said behold my country is before thy face [ that is open for thee to dispose of thy abode therein at pleasure Pharaoh did otherwise above chapter 12.19,0 see above chapter 13 on verse 9] dwell where it is good in thy eyes.
\p
\v 16 . And to Sarah he said behold I have given thy brother [ hereby the mind Sarah covertly that she had given occasion herself himself to his misshape by saying that Abraham washer brother ] a thousand silver lings and the shekels being two fold the civil in value somewhat more that the forth part of a Rix-dollar which is about thirteen pence half penny and that of sanctuary of the double weight it is conceived that here the common or civil shekel is to be understood these thousand silver lings amounting by that account to somewhat more than two hundred and fifty rix-dollars or fifty six pounds sterlings and five shillings ] behold let him be a cover of the eyes to all that are with thee [ that is acknowledge freely hereafter that he is thy husband and cover thy face in a token that thou art a married woman and that consequently he is the shield and defense of the chastity see of this covering of the face in woman below chapter 24 verse 65 and 1corinthians 11 verse 10 others let it be for a cover to thee &c. that is the money be given to thee to buy thee such a cover ] yea with all [ that is let it be a lesson an warning to thee to be more circumspect hereafter or else all this or that thou maist b taught some take these to be Moshe his word reading thus she was reproved.]
\p
\v 17 . And Abraham prayed to God [ see above verse 6] and God healed Abimelech [ so that he did not die of his sickness as God had threatened him verse 3 an d7] and his wife and his maid-servant so that they bare [ that is were able to bear and bring forth children ] see the next verse.]
\p
\v 18 . For the Lord had wholly shut up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech [Heb. Had shutting over the very womb of that is he had made them barren see this phrase 1Samuel 5, 6 on the contrary the opening of the womb doth imply the gift of fruitfulness below chapter 29.31] because of Sarah Abraham wife [ Heb. For the sake of Sarah.]
\c 21
\s Isaac according to Gods promise is born at length circumcised verse 1 &c. Abraham make a great feast at the time of Isaac weaning 8 Ishmael mocks upon it and is thereupon at the instance of Sarah ratified by God expelled 9 Hagar goeth astray in the wilderness and Ishmael is in danger of starving 15 but God provides for him and comforteth Hagar 17 Ishmaels education and marriage 20 Abimelech makes a covenant with Abraham at Barseba 22 Abraham doth worship God. 33.
\p
\v 1 And the Lord visited Sarah [ God visiting is twofold either by special mercies and fulfilling of his promises as below chapter 50.24 Exodus 4.31 Ruth 1.6 Psalms 8.5 and as it is likewise taken in this place or by executing of his threatening and judgment Exodus 20.5 Deuteronomy 5.9 Psalms 59.6 Isaiah 27.1] according as he had said and the Lord according as he had spoken.
\p
\v 2 . And Sarah conceived and bare a son to Abraham his old age [ others of his old age and so likewise verse 7] at the appointed time which God hath told him [ see above chapter 18.10 and 14.]
\p
\v 3 . And Abraham called the name of his son that was born him whom Sarah bare unto him Isaac [according to Gods command above chapter 17.19 see the annotate there.]
\p
\v 4 . And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old [Heb. A son of eight days and so in the next verse] according as God commanded him.
\p
\v 5 . And Abraham was hundred years old when Isaac was born to him.
\p
\v 6 . Then Sarah said God has made me laugh [partly for wondering as so strange a matter as this and partly for joy because many will rejoice at this mercy of God] everyone that hears it will laugh with me [partake of my rejoicing see Luke 1 verse 58.]
\p
\v 7 . Moreover she said who should have told Abraham? Sarah gave suck to the sons [ that is a son to the plural number being sometime in scripture phrase put for the singular as below chapter 46 verse 7,23 and Numbers 26 verse 8] for I have born a son in his old age.
\p
\v 8 . And the child grew up and was weaned then Abraham made a great feast on that day when Isaac was weaned.
\p
\v 9 . and Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian woman whom she had born to Abraham mocking [ doubtless saucily gibing at this that they kept so much a do or busied themselves so much with Isaac born so long after him this mocking proceeded from such a bitterness that the apostle term is a persecution Galatians 4.9.]
\p
\v 10 . And she said to Abraham drive out this maid servant and her son for the son of her maidservant shall not inherit with my son Isaac [ hence it appeareth that Ishmael doubtless through the instigation or instructions of his mother and likewise boasted of his right of primogeniture and that he as the first born ought to inherit Abrahams goods and this was the matter that provoked Sarah so much as well against the mother as against the son.]
\p
\v 11 . And this word was very evil in Abraham’s eyes because of his son [that is it displeased him exceedingly for the great loves sake which he bore to Ishmael and in regard likewise of promises which God had given him in his behalf above chapter 17.18,20 to be evil in ones eyes is as much as to say displease one and be very unacceptable to him so in thee mext verse also and below chapter 28.8 Exodus 21.8 Numbers 11.10.]
\p
\v 12 . But God said to Abraham [ viz. in the night verse 14] let it not be evil in the eyes touching the youth and touching thy maid-servant all that Sarah shall say unto thee [ concerning the business of Ishmael and Hagar ] hearkening after her voice for in Isaac shall thy seed be named [ others called that is the people of God with whom Gods covenant abides and especially the Messiah they shall not issue from Ishmael but from Isaac withal the true posterity and generation of Abraham shall be not they that issue carnally from him according to the course of nature like Ishmael but those that shall be his children through the grace and efficacy of the spiritual promises made to him as Isaac was see Romans 9.6,7,8.]
\p
\v 13 . Yet I shall likewise put the son of this maid-servant to be peopling [see above chapter 16.10 and 17.20] for that he is thy seed [that is because he is son and off-spring.]
\p
\v 14 . Then Abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water [ by the bread and water is to be understood all necessary provision for the journey] and gave them to Hagar laying the same upon the shoulder also he gave her the child [ Ishmael namely called a youth above verse 11 and below verse 17 of the spiritual type of the signification of this whole business see Galatians 4.23,24 &c.] and sent her away and she went forth and strayed in the wilderness of Berseba [ lying inn the south-border of Palestine not far from Gerar through at this time not so called yet but afterwards when king Abimelech mad ea covenant with Abraham thereabout see below verse 31.]
\p
\v 15 . Now when the water of the bottle was spent then she threw the child [she being not able to lead him further by the hand by reason of this faintness and he too big to carry him as being about seventeen years of the age then see below verse 18.] under one of the bushes [viz. to be sheltered there against the heat of the sun and the more quietly to expire as she thought in the shadow.]
\p
\v 16 . And she went and set herself over against going down so far as they that shoot with a bow [that is as far as an Archer goeth off from his mark or about to bow-shot] for she said that I may not see the child die or the dying of the child] and sate ver. against and lifted her voice and wept.
\p
\v 17 . And god heard the voice of the youth [who doubtless cried no less than the mother in the desolate condition] and the angel of God called upon Hagar out of heaven and said unto her what is or ails thee Hagar? Be not afraid because God have heard the voice of the youth at the place where he is [Heb. In which or in that where he is.]
\p
\v 18 . Arise take up the youth and hold him fast by thy hand for I will put him to be a great people.
\p
\v 19 . And God opened her eyes [ not as if she had not seen before but that God had so ruled and kept her eyes that she took no heed of that well compare Luke 24.31 ] that she saw a well of water and she went and filled the bottle with water and gave the youth to drink.
\p
\v 20 . And God was with the youth [God was favorable to him and blessed him according to the tenor of his promise in temporal things compare below the annotations on verse 2] and he grew tall and he dwelt in the wilderness and became an Archer [Heb. A shooting bow-shooter that is a valiant hunter and warrior see above chapter 16.12.]
\p
\v 21 . and dwelt in the wilderness of Paran [see above chapter 14 on verse 6] and his mother took him a wife out of Egypt [ observe here the right and authority of the parents in bestowing and marrying their children even the mothers alone compare below chapter 24. Verse 3, 4&c.]
\p
\v 22 . Further it happened at that time [ that is about the time of Abrahams aforementioned feast and the expelling of Hagar and her son] that Abimelech [ king of Gerar spoken of before chapter 20.2] together with Pichol his chief captain or chieftain of his host spake to Abraham saying god is with thee in all thou doest [ God is with his blessing them not only in outward and temporal but also and chiefly in spiritual concernment though Abimelech and Pichol and their eyes principally fixed upon bodily and temporal blessed which Abraham enjoyed see the like phrase below chapter 39.3 Joshua3.7 and 7.12 2Chronicles 1.1.]
\p
\v 23 . therefore swear now unto me by God if thou shalt lie [ or deceitful speak or deal] to me and my son or my nephew [ understand hereupon that then woe or punishment shall come upon thee or God do thus and thus or this and that unto thee see above chapter 14.23 ] according to the kindness which I have done by thee salt thou do by me an day the land wherein thou doest sojourn as a stranger.
\p
\v 24 . And Abraham said I will swear.
\p
\v 25 . Yet Abraham taxed Abimelech [before Abraham swears he will take away all scrupling] because of a water-well [which himself had digged and the water having been having hard to come by otherwise in regard of dry soil of those part and therefore very needful and behoofful and much to be valued compare below chapter 26.19,20,21 &c. Judges 1.15] which Abimelech’s servant had taken by force.
\p
\v 26 . Then said Abimelechh I wits not who did this feast [Heb. Word thing matter] and also thou hast not made it known to me and I likewise have not heard of it but this day.
\p
\v 27 . And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech [viz. in token of 1. of his gratefulness to the king for the friendship received from him 2. of being satisfied with the king’s answer touching well 3. Of his readiness and promise to be true and faithful to him and his] and those two made [Heb. Cut struck] a covenant [see above chapter 15 verse 18.]
\p
\v 28 . Yet Abraham put seven ewe-lambs of the stock apart [Heb. them alone and so verse 29.]
\p
\v 29 . Then said Abimelech to Abraham what shall or mean these seven ewe-lamb here which thou hast set apart?
\p
\v 30 . And he said that thou shalt take these seven ewe-lambs from thy hand that it may be for witness to me that I have digged this well [ and that consequently the same doth lawfully appertaining to me and mine Abrahams care proved not in vain see below chapter 26.15.]
\p
\v 31 . Therefore they called that place Beersheba [ which name both here an above verse 14 is attributed to this place and the territory about it but below chapter 26 verse 33 appropriated to a city lying in that tract which was afterwards allotted to the tribe of Judah Joshua 15.8 1Kings 19.3 yet inhabitated by the tribe of Simeon Joshua 19.2 and was the south border of the land of Canaan as Dan was the north border 2samuel 17.11 and 24.2] because these two had sworn there.
\p
\v 32 . Thus made they a covenant at Beersheba after that Abimelech arose and Pichol his chief captain and they returned to the country of the Pilistines [understand to Gerar not far distant from this place.]
\p
\v 33 . And he [Viz. Abraham] planted a groove at Beersheba and called thereupon the name of the Lord [having received new cause of thankfulness he there set up and exercised the public worship of God see above chapter 4.26] the eternal God [Heb. The God of eternity.]
\p
\v 34 . Then Abraham dwelt as a stranger in the land of the philistines many days [that is for a long time the Lord affording him good security and rest there.]
\c 22
\s God tempteth Abraham charging him to offer up his son Isaac verse 1 Abraham obeyed and is ready for the utmost for to slay Isaac 3 but hindered by God from highly commended and rewarded with renewed promises and the oath of God 11 Abraham receives good tidings of his brother Nahors welfare and issue 20.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after these things [after that Abraham had received so many promises even of the birth of the Messiah himself wherefore none could be fulfilled if Isaac had died without issue the Lord was pleased to put Abraham to this trial as if he would have rescinded and mulled all the former promises at one blow ]that God tempted Abraham [ God is said to tempt his when he makes trial of their weakness or graces either to humble or exalt them by the manifestation of the same see Deuteronomy 8.2 and 13.3 Judges 2.22 2Chronicles 32.31 Psalms 139.23,24 as for Abraham god knew him perfectly but intended to manifest his faith and the unfeignedness of his obedience in an extraordinary manner as for his own glories sake so both for Abrahams and the whole church of God their benefit and improvement see below verse 16,17] and he said unto him Abraham and he said here I am [Heb. Loe I viz. am here such a kind of answer which implieth a great deal of readiness and attentiveness in them that are called upon see below verse 7 and11 and chapter27.1 and 1Samuel 3.4 ,6 &c.]
\p
\v 2 . And he said take now thy son thy only snotty beloved Isaac[each word had been enough to pierce the fathers heart this and that which is rehearsed below verse 6.9,10 can in some sort represent unto us the great mystery of Gods grace a and salvation he having not spread his only begotten an dwell beloved son but delivered him up for all to bear our sins upon the true Romans 8.32 1Peter 2.4] and go thy way towards the land of Morija [ thus called after the common opinion from issue of this temptation see below verse 14 and the annotations this is the land wherein Jerusalem lay and the temple was built upon the hill of Morija 1Chronicles 22.1 2Chronicles 3.1 sidewards of mount Zion about three days journey fro Beersheba see below verse 4] and offer him there [ that is slay him first with thine own hand s and afterwards burn his head and body to ashes as the manner was to proceed with burning offerings Leviticus 6.9,10&c. this commandment was not to be construed or examined with natural sense and understanding but only through faith with gods promise and Abraham’s fatherly duty and affection to his only begotten son but of Gods hidden purpose and counsel in this command see the first verse of this chapter and below verse 12 ] for a burn sacrifice [ see the annotate above chapter 8 on verse 20 ] upon one of the hills which I shall tell thee.
\p
\v 3 . Then Abraham rose up early in the morning [ Abraham is instantly ready overcoming flesh and blood and firmly believing that notwithstanding all this God would perform his promises as being able to restore him Isaac even from the dead which also after a manner awes done as the apostle testifies Heb. 11.19] and saddled his ass and took two of his youths with him and Isaac his son and the cleft would be burnt offering [ Heb. Woods of the burnt offering ] or up made himself ready & went towards the place which God told him.
\p
\v 4 . On the third day [this great distance from the place of about three days journey served to further manifestation of Abraham singular steadfastness] then Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off.
\p
\v 5 . And Abraham said to his youths stay ye here with the ass and I and the youth [this word is not only attributed to the little children but to young men likewise full grown as above you Abrahams armed trained men chapter 14 verse 14 and to the young men of sachem that abused Dina below chapter 34.19 and to Joseph when he called to interpret Pharaoh’s dream below chapter 41.12 to Joshua serving Mosheh Exodus 33.11 to Absolom making war against his father 2samuel 18.9 adhere both to Isaac and Abrahams servant compare the next verse ] shall go on yonder when we shall have worshipped [ see below chapter 24.26] when we shall return unto ye [ though Abraham intended to offer up his son the special issue of this work was unknown to him he nevertheless believed that God was able to restore him his son again and thus without knowing what should be done he foretold what came to pass.]
\p
\v 6 . And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon his son Isaac [ although it be uncertain how old Isaac was by this time so guessing twenty five years some less some more yet hence may well be gathered that he was of a ripe age seeing he was able to bear all the wood the ass was charged with and to carry it up the hill see above on verse 5] and he took the fire and the knife in his hand and both they went together.
\p
\v 7 . Then spake Isaac to Abraham his father saying my father [ this sweet appellation of Isaac might well have been able according to the flesh to have hindered Abraham but through the spirit of LORD it riseth up in him so much that the more confidence of a good issue as appeareth by his answer ] and he said see here I am my son and he said Lo the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?
\p
\v 8 . And Abraham said God shall provide [Heb. See compare below verse 14] himself a lamb for burnt offering my son so they both went together.
\p
\v 9 . And they came to the place which God had told him and Abraham built there an altar and disposed the wood and bound his son Isaac [ even as the beast of the burnt offering were bound by their four legs so Abraham bound his four legs Isaacs hands and feet as some conceive the Hebrew word being used about sacrifices often signifying the same observe here the singular patience and obedience of Isaac being doubtless first exhorted and persuaded to it by his father ] and laid him upon the altar atop the wood.
\p
\v 10 . Then Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife for to slay his son [others to cut the throat of &c.]
\p
\v 11 . But the angels of the Lord [understand the son of God as appears by the latter end of verse 12 and the whole series and drift of this story compare chapter 18 verse 1, 17, 22 and chapter 19 verse 18, 19, 21, 24] called unto him from heaven and said Abraham, Abraham [the is doubled thus the matter requiring haste and prompt attention Abraham even being ready to give the stroke and to dispatch the execution] and he said see here I am.
\p
\v 12 . Then said he do not stretch forth thy hand on the youth and do nothing to him [ by this command God reveals the secrets counsel and purpose in this temptation which in the former command verse 2 he had not done ] for now I know [said after the manner of men as verse 1 for Abraham was sufficiently known to God before but now he is said to take knowledge of it in regard that this temptation he made the same fully known to his whole church thus the Hebrew word is taken Psalms 139.23 prove me and know my thoughts for before he had said verse 2 though understandeth my thought afar off ] thou hast fearing God and not withheld thy son thy only one from me [ Hence it is plain that it is God himself that speaketh here.]
\p
\v 13 . Then Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked about and behold behind there was a ram [[it should seem that the angel called Abraham from behind so that he turning himself about to spy the ram withal instantly apprehending that he was to slay and offer the same there in his son instead] fast by his horns intricate thickets [viz. of some briar or thorn bush] and Abraham went and took that ram and offered to him for a burnt offering in his sons stead.
\p
\v 14 . And Abraham [comparing his on his confidence verse 8 with this issue] named the name of that place the LORD shall provide it [understand that the mountain of Morija itself doth signify almost the same thing that is the sight or vision of God] wherefore to this day it is said on the mountain of the LORD it shall be provided [a preverbal speech used by those who being in the exceeds extremity and seeing no human issue cast themselves altogether upon the faithful providence of God.]
\p
\v 15 . Then the angel of the Lord called Abraham the second time from heaven.
\p
\v 16 . And said I swear by my self [ having none greater to swear by Heb. 6.13 see likewise Jeremiah 2.5 elsewhere God swears by his great name Jeremiah 44.26 or by his soul Jeremiah 51.14 an day his holiness Amos 4.2 that is by himself ] speaketh the Lord [Heb. Neum of this word see jeremiah 23.31] therefore because thou hast done this thing and not withheld thy son thy only son [understand hereby no meriting cause of the ensuing promise which was already before made to Abraham but the fruit and the end of Abrahams obedience which God was pleased of his grace and to remunerate and reward with the renewing of his promise with this oath here to the further strengthening of the faith of Abraham and of al true believers the whole church of God see hereof Heb. 13.14,17,18]
\p
\v 17 . Assuredly I will greatly bless thee and multiply thy seed very much [Heb. Blessing bless and multiply I will multiply &c.] as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is on the sea shore [Heb. At the lip of the sea so below chapter 41.3 Joshua 11.4 1Samuel 13.5] and thy seed shall hereditarily possess the gates of the enemies [that is the jurisdiction power and authority cities and countries for of old the place or courts of the public judicature and administration of justice was in the gates Deuteronomy 21.19 and 22.15 Amos 5.12 ,15 Zachariah 8.16 item the strength of the city see judges 5.8 Psalms 147.13 Isaiah 22.7 Ezekiel 21.22 therefore the cities themselves also are called gates Deuteronomy 12.15 and 18.6 even the cities of the whole land Jeremiah 14 verse 2 this was fulfilled as the temporal part in Joshua David &c. but especially and spiritually in the Messiah Psalms .8,9 and 110.1,2,3 Colossians 2.15 who makes his church and servants partakers of his conquest 1Corinthians 15.57 and 2Corinthians .14 and 10.5,6.]
\p
\v 18 . And in thy seed [that is Christ who is to proceed out of thy seed after the flesh see above chapter 12.3] all nations of the earth [not only the off-spring of thy own flesh but all other people likewise that shall believe in thy seed the Messiah see Galatians 3.29] shall be blessed [see Acts 3.25 Galatians 3.8, 16] since thou hast been obedient to my voice [see above on verse 16.]
\p
\v 19 . Then Abraham returned to his youth and they got themselves up and they got themselves up and they want together towards Beersheba [see above chapter 21 on verse 31] and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.
\p
\v 20 . And it happened after these things that word was brought to Abraham saying behold Milca [who was not come along with Abraham from Ur of Chaldea into Canaan; but had removed her habitation into Mesopotamia see above chapter 11.9,31 and 24.10] she likewise hath born sons to Nahor thy brother.
\p
\v 21 . Uz his first born [this Uz Nahors son is to be distinguished from the two others of that name the one was the son of Aram ,Sems son above chapter 10.23 the other the son of Dischan the son of Seir the Horite below chapter 36.28] and the Buz his brother [from whom some conceive Elihu the Buzrite descended see of him Job 32.2 ] and Kemuel the father of Aram [see of another Aram above chapter 10.2 it is thought that from the one or both of these of the countries of Syria was called Aram .]
\p
\v 22 . And Chesed and Hazo and Pildas and jidlaph and Bethuel.
\p
\v 23 . And Bethuel begat Rebecca [Heb. Ribka married afterwards to Isaac below chapter 24] these eight Milca bare to Nahor the brother of Abraham.
\p
\v 24 . And his by-wife or concubines [understand such a wife which was taken indeed for propagation of children according to the abusive custom of those days but without any dowry or matrimonial contracts she being subordinate and subject in a manner to the lawful and principal wife her children likewise could not inherit but had only some gifts or legacies bestowed upon them above chapter 21.14 and 25.6 the Hebrew word signifieth a divided or half wife ] whose name was Reunia the same have likewise Tebah and Gaham and Tahas and Maacha [this seems to be the mans name here also 2Samuel 10.6 the name of a certain king and thus likewise the mother of the king Asa was named 1Kings 15.13.]
\c 23
\s Sarah dieth and is bemoaned by Abraham verse 1 Abraham doth solemnely purchase the field of Ephron the Hethite with the cave of Machpela for a hereditary burying place and there he burieth his wife Sarah 19.
\p
\v 1 And the life of Sarah was an hundred and twenty seven years those were the years of the life of Sarah.
\p
\v 2 . And Sarah died at Kiarth-arba [others in the city of Arba some do hold it had a name of this giant so called the builder thereof see Joshua 14.15 and 15.13] this is Hebron [ a city afterwards allotted to the tribe of Judah lying not far from the Oak-field of Mamre where Abraham had lived a long time see further above chapter 13 on verse 18] in the land of Canaan and Abraham came [viz. into the tent of his wife see above chapter 18.6,9] for to bemoan Sarah and bewail her [this was an ancient custom amongst the godly to manifest their grief and sorrow in general for the miserable mankind an din a particular for the temporal loss of their friends or any eminent person see hereof below chapter 50.3 Deuteronomy 34.8 1Samuel 25.1 2Samuel 3.32 Acts 9.39 &c. which custom was superstitiously afterwards imitated by unbelievers see Mark 5 verse 38 ,39 &c.]
\p
\v 3 . After that Abraham arose from the face of his dead [like a believing patriarch moderating the grief and mourning over Sarah and going about now to provide her an honorable interment in a strange country ] and he spake to the sons of Heth [others to the children of Heth and c. as also verse 5,7,10,11,16,18,19 that is the governors or principal men of the Hethites who were Canaanites of the race of Heth the grand child of Cham see above chapter 10.15] saying:
\p
\v 4 . I am a stranger and inhabitant with you give me an hereditary burying place with you that I may bury my dead once from before my face [the burying of the dead bodies hath been a very ancient custom among men as appears by this and the next verse nature itself and teaching that the one part of the reasonable creature man ought not to be thrown away by the dishonored or abused by another and religion minding us to lay us and safe keep the same against the day of the resurrection from the dead. See below chapter, 50.5,6 Numbers 33.4 Deuteronomy 21.23. Job 5.26.]
\p
\v 5 . And the sons of Heth answered Abraham saying to him.
\p
\v 6 . Hear us my Lord thou art a prince of God in the midst of us [that is with whom God is as above chapter 21.22 or a prince of God that is an excellent or very eminent Lord and prince see above chapter 13 on verse 10] bury thy dead one in the choice of our graves [that is the best and choicest we have compare Jeremiah 2.7] none of us shall keep his grave from thee that thou shouldst not bury thy dead one.
\p
\v 7 . Then Abraham stood up and bowed up himself down before the people of the land before the sons of Heth.
\p
\v 8 . And he spake with them saying it is with your will? [Heb. It is with your soul? or if it be with your soul the word soul doth often times signify will contents allowance approbation as Deuteronomy 21.14 1Kings 19.32Kings 9.15 Psalms 27.12 and 41.3 and 105.22] that I bury my dead from before my face? Therefore hear me and speak for me with Ephron the son of Zoar [Heb. Tsochar and Hethite who is distinguished from another Zoar that was the son of Simeon afterwards chapter 46.10.]
\p
\v 9 . That he would give me the cave of Machpela [the proper name of this cave as appears verse 17 and 19] which he hath with which is at the end of the field that he would give it to me for the full money [in regard of the price of the ground and the weight and the value of the money] for an hereditary burying place in the midst of you.
\p
\v 10 . Now Ephron sate in the midst of the sons of Heth [he was not a citizen and Native of the Hethite but one of the principal men among them sitting in the assemble before which Abraham had represented himself thus the word sitting is taken for the state or place of the public counselors or governors of people as Psalm 119.23] and Ephrone the Hethite answered Abraham before the ears of the sons Heth of all those which entered the gate [that is were citizens or inhabitants of the city so below verse 18 compare chapter 34.24] of his city [either were he was born as Luke 2.3,4 or where he dwelt as below chapter 24 verse 10. Matthew 9.1] saying.
\p
\v 11 . No my Lord hear me the field I give thee also the cave that is in it I give thee the same before the eyes of the sons of my people do I give the same to bury thy dead.
\p
\v 12 . Then Abraham bowed himself down before the face of the people of the land.
\p
\v 13 . And he spake to Ephron before the people of the land saying throth art thou it? [Others but have indeed good now if thou be it &c. viz. Ephron it should seem that Abraham knew him by name though not by face and that Abraham did not know that Ephron was sitting there] hear me I will give money of the ground [Heb. I have given that is I am ready to give it and lay it down] take it of me so shall I bury my dead there.
\p
\v 14 . And the Ephron answered Abraham saying to him.
\p
\v 15 . My Lord hear me a land of four hundred shekels of silver [shekel was ascertain kind of coin having the name from weighing about as much as the forth part of a Rix dollar or thirteen pence half penny and the holy one of double the value see above chapter 20.16 where mention was made of the silver lings being the same price the sum here then amounts to a matter of an hundred rix-dollars somewhat better about two and twenty pounds shilling the speech being here o the common or civil shekel ] what is that between me and between thee? Do but bury thy dead.
\p
\v 16 . And Abraham hearkened Ephron and Abraham weighed Ephron the money whereof he had spoken [of old it was the custom to weigh the money one to another in payments buying and selling as now the use is to tell it out to one another] before the ears of the sons of Heth four hundred shekels of silver currant among the merchants.
\p
\v 17 . Thus the field of Ephron that is the Machapela that lay over against Mamre the ground and the cave that was therein and all the trees that stood upon the ground that was round about the whole border thereof was established [ Heb. Stood or stood up that is it became remained Abrahams and so below verse 20.]
\p
\v 18 . On Abraham for a possession before the eyes of the sons of Heth with all that went into the city gates [see above on verse 10.]
\p
\v 19 . And after that Abraham buried his wife Sarah in thecae of the field Machapela over against Mamre [Heb. Against the face of Mamre ] which is Hebron [see above on verse 2] in the land of Canaan [which indeed was given to God to Abraham and his seed hereditarily to possess the same in due time but he having hitherto and still continuing a stranger in it therefore like to other faithful patriarchs he desires to be buried in it in token and testimony that they believed the promise of God touching the possession of this land which was a pledge unto them of the heavenly Canaan.]
\p
\v 20 . Thus that ground and cave that was therein was established on Abraham for a hereditary burying place from the sons of Heth.
\c 24
\s Abraham being old and rich takes his oath of this eldest servant and sends him to Mesopotamia to his kindred for to fetch his son Isaac and a wife thence verse 1 the servant being well instructed and furnished parteth and dispatcheth the business faithfully and piously 10 and through a wonderful providence very successfully obtaining Rebecca forth with full consent of her friends he thereupon returneth thence with Rebecca and brings her to Isaac 61 who receiveth marrieth and loveth her 67.
\p
\v 1 Now Abraham was old [see above chapter 18.11 Abraham was by this time a hundred and forty years old for he was an hundred when Isaac was born above cahpetr 21.1 and Isaac was forty when he married Rebecca below chapter 35. Verse 20] and he well bedayed [Heb. Going in days see of this phrase above chapter 18.11] and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things [see above chapter 12.2.]
\p
\v 2 . Then Abraham spake and his servant the eldest of his house [Heb. The old on understood the Steward or Bailiff and upper-servant of his family by the name Eliezer of Damascus see above chapter 15.2] ruling over all that he had lay the hand I pray under the thigh [a kind of practice used by masters of families in taking an oath from any of their household in token of their subjection and faithfulness see likewise below chapter47.29 otherwise it was also the custom in swearing to lift up the hands see above chapter 14.2 and Revelations 10.5.]
\p
\v 3 . That I may swear thee by the Lord the God of heaven and the God of earth that thou shalt take no wife for my son of the daughters of Canaanites [Heb. Of the Canaanites of whom see above chapter 10.15, 16&c.Abraham would have none of those to be matched with his son because they were wholly given up to idolatry an doll manner of wickedness and without the covenant of God compare below chapter 28.1,2 Exodus 34.16 Deuteronomy 7.3 Joshua 23.12 Ezra 9.1,2,3 Nehemiah 13.23,25 &c. 2Corinthians 6.14,15 of this right of the parents in general in marrying their children see above chapter 6 on verse and chapter 21.21] in the midst of whom I dwell.
\p
\v 4 . But that thou shalt go to my country [which was Uz of Chaldea being the whole par of the whole land that lay between the river Euphrates and Tigris wherein Mesopotamia also in which Nahor lived was comprehended ] and to my kindred [of whom he had lately received news above chapter 22 verse 20 those where indeed likewise somewhat tainted with the idolatry of people among whom they lived as appears below chapter 31.19,30,32,35 and Joshua 24.2 but yet not so abominably and grosley given up to the same and other grossly given up to the same and other gross sins as reprobate Canaanites were see Deuteronomy 12.30,31] and take a wife for my son Isaac.
\p
\v 5 . and that servant said unto him peradventure [by this and the sequel and the singular prudence and piety of this servant appeareth who before it takes the oath will be first be fully satisfied of his masters intent and purpose ] that woman shall not be willing to follow me [Heb. Go after me so below verse 8] into this land must I then bring thy son into the land out of which thou art gone? [Heb. Shall I bringing back bring back &c. this is said not in regard of Isaac who never was there but of Abraham in whose loins Isaac had been shut up.]
\p
\v 6 . Abraham said to him take heed to thy self that thou do not bring my son back thither [partly because God called him and his seed to come out of Chaldea into Canaan with promise that they should inherit the same and partly to avoid the danger of idolatry into which Isaac might have been seduced [Heb. Be regarded or kept or beware thee look to thee.]
\p
\v 7 . The Lord of heaven that hath taken me out of my fathers house and out of the land of my kindred and that hath spoken to me and that hath sworn to me saying unto thy seed will I give this land the same shall send his angel before thy face that thou maist take a wife for my son thence.
\p
\v 8 . But if so be that the woman will not follow thee thou shalt be clean of thy oath [that is discharge free and clear of the engagement which I am putting upon thee by this oath] only not bring my son thither again.
\p
\v 9 . Then his servant laid his hand under Abraham his master’s thigh and he swear to him over this matter.
\p
\v 10 . And that servant took ten camels of his master camels and went his way and all the good of his master were in the hand [that is he took along with him with his master good liking all manner of necessary and precious goods and commodities as well for his journey as for bestow in gifts and presents were it should be expedient in this affair see verse 53.] and he got up and went on to Mesopotamia [Heb. Syria of two rivers called thus by reason of it lying between two rivers called thus by reason of its lying between two rivers Tigris on the east and Euphrates on the west see of this name likewise Deuteronomy 23.4 Judges 3.8] to the city of Nahor [that is where Nahor dwelt see chapter 23 on verse 10 understand the city of Haran as is to be gathered by chapter 28.10 and 9.4.]
\p
\v 11 . And he caused the camels to kneel down [for to rest themselves or to bait them according to the nature and condition of those beasts when they are weary] without a city by a well of water in the evening time at the time when the women drawers came forth.
\p
\v 12 . And he said Lord God of my master Abraham make her I pray [viz. the young woman or daughter or make it that is my wish and desire] to meet me [Heb. Before my face] this day and shew kindness to Abraham my master.
\p
\v 13 . Behold I stand by the fountain of water and the daughters of the man of this city are going forth to draw water.
\p
\v 14 . Let it come to pass that young maid to whom I shall say thy pitcher I pray that I may drink and she shall say drink [this token he desireth not out of many difference or presumption out of a singular confidence had disposed all things accordingly which the event revised as appears in the sequel see the like example Judges 6.17 and 1Samuel 14.9,10] thou hast [others ordained prepared determined ] to thy servant Isaac and that I may acknowledge thereby that thou hast done kindness to my master.
\p
\v 15 . And it came to pass before he had made an end to speak behold Rebecca came forth she that was born to Bethuel the son of Milca NAhors wife the brother of Abraham and she had her pitcher upon her shoulder.
\p
\v 16 . And the young maid was very fair [Heb. Good see chapter 6 on verse 2] to look on a virgin and no man had acknowledged her [see of this manner of speaking chapter 19 verse 8] and she went down to the fountain and filled her pitcher and came up.
\p
\v 17 . Then that servant ran to meet her and he said let me drink a little water I pray out of thy pitcher.
\p
\v 18 . And she said drink my Lord and she made haste and let down her pitcher upon her hand and gave him to drink.
\p
\v 19 . Now when she had done giving him to drink she said I will likewise draw for thy camels till they have done drinking.
\p
\v 20 . And she made haste and purred her pitcher out into thee through a darn again to the well for to draw and she drew for all his camels.
\p
\v 21 . And the man was amazed over her [viz. for great joy and admiring how readily and exactly the token which he had desired from the Lord was presented to his eyes] holding his peace [pondering with himself how wonderful Gods providence did here shew forth itself and resolve to observe whether the sequel and he success should be answerable in all things to his beginnings] to observe whether the Lord had made his way prosperous or not.
\p
\v 22 . And it came to pass when the camels had done drinking that, that man took a golden frontlet [the Hebrew word here doth signify an ornament of the forehead as appears below verse 47 Isaiah 3.22 Ezekiel 16.12 sometimes indeed it doth likewise betoken an earing or ornament for the ear chapter 35.4 and Exodus 32.2,3] whose weight was half or the moity of [the Hebrew word here used is rendered by itself half a shekel Exodus 38.28] a shekel [of the silver shekel see above chapter 20 on verse 16 the golden and the silver shekel were both of one weight the common containing an hundred and sixty barley grains or a quarter of an ounce the holy one as much again viz. three hundred and twenty grains that is to say half an ounce one ounce of Gold was valued at ten times the quantity of silver one ounce of silver was as much as a Rix-dollar and consequently one ounce of gold was worth ten Rix-dollars or five twenty gilders two pounds ten shillings ] and two bracelet on her hands [understand he bestowed them or put them on her hands like as the word to take used in this verse doth oftentimes imply another signification besides its own see above chapter 12 on verse 15] whose weight was ten shekels of gold [six pounds two shillings six pence.]
\p
\v 23 . For he had said [compare below verse 47.] whose daughter art thou? Let me know it I pray is there room also for us in thy fathers house to over-night? Or lodge.
\p
\v 24 . And she had told him I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milca whom she bare to Nahor [this is added here that Abraham’s servant might know that she was true and lawfully begotten daughter of Bethuel born likewise of true and lawful principle wife of Nahor and not of the concubine Reuma [see above chapter 22 verse 23, 24.]
\p
\v 25 . Moreover she had said to him there is straw likewise and store of a provender with us also room over night.
\p
\v 26 . Then that men bowed his head [the Hebrew word doth properly signify to bow or incline the head down wards] and worshipped the Lord [the Heb. Word here signify here the bending and bowing of the whole body which doth here imply a very religious and devout reverend posture of the body accompanied adoration and prayer see likewise above chapter 22.5 item Psalms 66.4 Nehemiah 9.3&c.]
\p
\v 27 . And he said praise [ or bless see above chapter 14.20] be the Lord the God of my master Abraham that hath not withheld his kindness and truth [that is the faithfulness in keeping his promises so below chapter 32.10 Psalms 143.1 Isaiah 38.18 ,19] from my master [Hebrew I that is as for me or touching concerning myself that it is taken likewise above chapter 9.9 and 17.4 1Chronicles 28.2 Psalms 35.13an d41.13and elsewhere] the lord hath conducted me upon this way to the house of my masters brethren [ that is kindred consanguinity see chapter 13.8 and in the chapter verse 48 Mark 3.31,32.]
\p
\v 28 . And the young maid ran and made it known at her mothers house so as these things were.
\p
\v 29 . And Rebecca had a brother whose name was Laban and Laban ran to that man forth to the fountain.
\p
\v 30 . And it came to pass when he had seen the frontlet and the bracelet on his sisters hand and after he had heard the words of his sister Rebecca thus that man spake to me then he came to that man and lo he stood by the camels of the fountains.
\p
\v 31 . And he said come in thou blessed of the Lord [this is a very honorable title which the Israelites used to attribute to gods special friends implying that God had done singularly well by them and was still with his grace and favors about them see chapter 26.29 Ruth 3.10 Psalms 115.15] why shouldst thou stand without? For I have prepared the house and the place for the camels [prepared or cleansed sitted drest the same and removed or rid away all impediments thus the Hebrew word is taken Leviticus 14.36.]
\p
\v 32 . And that man came unto the house and they did ungird the camels and they gave the camels straws and provender and water to wash his feet [see above chapter 18.4 and the annotations] ad the feet of theme that were with him.
\p
\v 33 . Then they set meat before them to eat [Heb. And before his face was set to eat] but he said] I shall not eat until I have spoken my words or delivered my errand he said [Laban namely] speak or say on.
\p
\v 34 . Then said he I am Abraham’s servant [see above verse 2.]
\p
\v 35 . And the Lord hath blessed my master greatly so that he is become [or grown] great [that s very rich and wealthy] and he hath given him sheep and oxen and silver and gold and men-servants and maid-servants and camels and asses.
\p
\v 36 . And Sarah my masters wife hath born a son to my master after she was grown old [Heb. after her old age that is by a supernatural operation of the Lord from whence there is to be expected or an extraordinary blessing according to his promise [and he hath given him all he hath [that is he hath made him the sole full heir of all.]
\p
\v 37 . And my master made me swear saying thou shalt take no wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell [see above verse 3.]
\p
\v 38 . But thou shalt go [others shalt or shouldst thou not go or if thou goest not &c. understand hereupon WO be to thee then or then god do thus and thus by thee see above chapter 14.22,23 and 21.23] to my fathers house and to my kindred ands halt take a wife to my son.
\p
\v 39 . Then said I to my master peradventure that woman will not follow me.
\p
\v 40 . And he said to me the Lord before whose face I have walked [see above chapter 17 on verse 1] shall send his angels with thee and shall make thy way prosperous that thou maist take away my prosperous that thou maist take a wife to my son out of my kindred and out of my fathers house.
\p
\v 41 . Then shalt thou be clean or clear of my oath [others curse or oath of the curse that is free of punishment which a forsworn person makes himself liable unto] when thou shalt have gone to my kindred and if they shall not give her to thee then shalt thou be clean of my oath.
\p
\v 42 . And I came this day to the fountain and I said O LORD God of my master Abraham if now thou shalt make my way prosperous whereon I go.
\p
\v 43 . Behold I stand by the fountain of the water let it come to pass that the virgin coming forth to draw and to whom I shall say give me a little water to drink I pray out of thy pitcher.
\p
\v 44 . And she shall say to me drink thou also and I shall likewise draw for thy camels that this same be that woman which the Lord hath appointed for my masters son.
\p
\v 45 . Before I had done speaking in my heart behold there came Rebecca forth and had a pitcher upon her shoulder and she went down to the fountain and drew and I said unto her give me to drink I pray.
\p
\v 46 . Then she made haste and let down her pitcher from her and said drink thou and I shall likewise water thy camels and I drank and she likewise watered the camels.
\p
\v 47 . Then I asked of her and said whose daughter art thou? And she said the daughter of Bethuel the son of Nahor whom Milca bare unto him then I laid the frontlet upon her face [or upon her nose so namely that it was hanging from her forehead downwards on the nose] and the bracelet on her hand.
\p
\v 48 . And I bowed down my head and worshipped the Lord and I praised or blessed the LORD the God of my master Abraham that had guided me upon the right way [Heb. The way of truth that is the true or right way ] for to take the daughter of my masters brother [that is near kinsmen nephew here for Bethuel was the son of Nahor Abrahams brother see above verse 27.] for his son.
\p
\v 49 . Now if you will do [Heb. If you be doing] kindness and faithfulness [Heb. Truth] to my master make it known to me and if not make it likewise known to me that I may turn myself [or look about] to the right or to the left hand [that is I may be able t resolve one way or another what course to take in my masters behalf.]
\p
\v 50 . Then answered Laban and Bethuel [the son is put before the father here in regard that Laban as is thought was ordered by his father to speak in and manage that affair as he did most of the household the father being not only well bedayed or very aged but perchance sickly too]and side this business has proceeded from the LORD [hence it appears that there was yet some knowledge and fear of the true God among them see here verse 51] we can speak neither bad nor good unto thee [that is we hath nothing at all to gain say in this nature compare below chapter 31.24,29 and 2Samuel 13.22.]
\p
\v 51 . Behold Rebecca is before thy face take her [see above on verse 3] and go thy way let her be thy masters sons wife even the LORD hath spoken.
\p
\v 52 . And it came to pass when Abraham servant Herad their words he bowed himself to the ground before the LORD.
\p
\v 53 . And the servant reached forth silver jewels and gold jewels [Heb. Vessels of silver and vessels of gold that is all kind of gold and silver plate manufactured] and garment and he gave them to Rebecca also he gave preciousness or precious things but especial choice and rare fruits and speceries see Deuteronomy 33.13,14,15 and 2Chronicles 21.3 and 32.23 Ezekiel 1.6] to her brother and to her mother.
\p
\v 54 . Then they did eat and drink him and the man that were with him and they overnighted and they rose up early in the morning and he said let me go to thy master.
\p
\v 55 . And said her brother and mother let the young man tarry with us some days or ten [see above chapter 4 on verse 3 some do understand by days or turn a full year which is called of days or ten months in time the particle is sometimes also taken for at least] after that thou shalt go or then go [others she shall go.]
\p
\v 56 . But he said unto them stay me not because the LORD hath made my way prosperous let me part or dismiss me that I may go to my master.
\p
\v 57 . Then said let us call the young maid and ask her mouth [that is let us see what she will say to this hasty departure for the marriage she had yielded unto upon her parents and kindred’s pleasure and in kindred thereof accepted of the presents.]
\p
\v 58 . And they called Rebecca and said to her wilt thou go with this man? And she answered I will go.
\p
\v 59 . Then they [that is all the kindred] let her sifter [or kinswoman for not Laban only her brother but all the kindred took their leave from her and so in the next verse] and her nurse [Deborah by name below chapter 35.8] go together with Abrahams’ servant and his man.
\p
\v 60 . And they blessed [see above chapter 14.19] Rebecca and said unto her O our sifter he or become thou to thousand of millions [or ten thousand they wish that she may become the mother of the innumerable or numberless posterity compare Daniel 7.10] and let thy seed possess the gate [see above chapter 22 on verse 17] of his haters or those that hate him.
\p
\v 61 . And Rebecca rose up with her young maids [whom the friends sent along with her for company and service] and they rode on camels and followed the man and that servant took Rebecca and went his way.
\p
\v 62 . Isaac now came from whence one comes to the well Luchai-roi [of this well see above chapter 14 and 25.11] and he dwelt in the south country [in the south part of Canaan about Bersheba and Gerar.]
\p
\v 63 . And Isaac was gone forth to pray [or to meditate contemplate that is he went forth there to take and exercise his mind with pious meditations and prayers before the LORD] into the field against the approaching of the evening [Heb. Against or towards with the look or aspect of the evening likewise Exodus 14.7 towards or with the aspects of the morning] and he lifted up his eyes and beheld and see the camels come on.
\p
\v 64 . And Rebecca likewise lifted up her eyes and she saw Isaac and she fell off from the Carmel [that is she let herself suddenly down being surprised in her thoughts whether this might not be Isaac and therewith all asking her servants about it others conceive she lightened not before she had understood by the servant that it was Isaac in that since that in the following verse is read by some for had said unto the servant &c.]
\p
\v 65 . And she said to the servant who is that man that walks to meet us in the field? And the servant that is my master then she took the vial and covered herself [in token of shame fastness and subjection.]
\p
\v 66 . And the servant related unto Isaac all the things he had done.
\p
\v 67 . And then Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah [see above chapter 18.10 and 23.1] and he took Rebecca and she became his wife and he loved her thus Isaac was comforted after his mothers death [which happened three years before this long grief for the loss of his mother was the sign of the great love and respect he bare to her.
\c 25
\s After death of Sarah Abraham take Ketura and gets children by her and children’s children verse 1 &c. he makes Isaac the sole heir of all his estates and concubines children’s he dismisseth with presents to the east country 4 Abraham age death and burial 6 Isaac is blessed after his fathers death 10 Ishmaels offspring’s age and death 12 Isaac prays to God on his wife’s behalf who conceives and bears him Esau and Jacob both their condition are set down verse 21 Esau sells his birthright or primogeniture to Jacob 29.
\p
\v 1 And Abraham went on to proceed and took a wife whose name was Ketura [the meaning is that after the death of his wife Sarah and the marriage of his son he did not continue widower but went on to marry again.]
\p
\v 2 . And she bare him [though Abraham was now about an hundred and forty years old and his body was much decayed already at an hundred years above chapter 17.17 Romans 4.119 nevertheless he got children by his Ketura not as being miraculously strengthened thereunto as he was fro the begetting of Isaac but having retained much of that miraculous vigor to his age ]Zimran [this man and the following wee most of them inhabitants of Arabia and some other part lying east from Canaan ] and Joksan and Midian [the father and the original of the Midianites of whom see below chapter 36.35 judges 6.2 Isaiah 10.26 they were neighbors of the Moabites Numbers 22.4 and fell soon away from Abraham faith to idolatry Numbers 25.16,17,18 the country likewise is called Midian Exodus 2.16 and 1Kings 11.18 ] and jiksbak and Suah [Heb. Schuah of whom it should seem that Bildad Jobs friend issued Job 2.11.]
\p
\v 3 . And Joksan begat Seba [Heb. Jokschan] and Dedan and the sons so Dedan were Assurim and Letusim and Leummim.]
\p
\v 4 . And the sons of Midian were Epha [ of Epha see Isaiah 60.6] and Epher [ of which some conceive that Africa bears the name ] and Hanock and Abidda and Eldaa all these were sons of Ketura [the sons and the sons or grand children being all comprehended under one name.]
\p
\v 5 . Yet Abraham gave all he had unto Isaac [see above chapter 115.4 and 24.36.]
\p
\v 6 . But unto the sons of the concubines [of the word concubines or by-wife see above chapter 2.24 understand hereby Abrahams concubines both Hagar and Ketura though they are likewise expressly called wives] whom Abraham had Abraham gave presents and sent them away from his sons Isaac while he was alive yet east-wards to the east country [understand the country lying east from Canaan such as are Arabia and Asia the greater &c.]
\p
\v 7 . These now are days of the life of Abraham which he lived an hundred and seventy five years [Heb. An hundred year and seventy years and five years thus Abraham lived stranger since he came from Ur and hundred and five years and left grand children behind him of fifteen years of age viz. Jacob and Esau as may be gathered from verse 26 during all this time Abraham never fainted in his faith in Gods promise nor in patience under many advertise nor in the hope of glory to come not withstanding that he left likewise some examples of human frailty behind him he died as some do calculate in the year after creation of the world 124 and the 38 after his wife Sarah.]
\p
\v 8 . And Abraham expired and died in a good old age [Heb. Grayness cavities according to Gods promise to him above chapter 15.15] old and satisfied satur of life [that is being wearied of the toils and troubles and longing of the rest of that to come] and he was gathered to his people [compare above chapter 15 the note on verse 15 see this phrase likewise below verse 17 and chapter 49.29 Numbers 0.24 and chapter 27.13 Judges 2.10.]
\p
\v 9 . And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpela in the field of Ephrone the son of Zahor the Hethite which over against Mamre [see above chapter 23.9, 17, 19, and 20.]
\p
\v 10 . In the field which Abraham had bought from the sons of Heth there Abraham is buried and Sarah his wife [there also were Isaac and Jacob buried with their wives after them see below chapter 49.29, 31.]
\p
\v 11 . And it came to pass after Abraham’s death that God blessed his son Isaac [according to the promises formerly made to Abraham above chapter 17.7, 19] and Isaac dwelt by the well Luchai-roi [se above chapter 16.14 and 4.62.]
\p
\v 12 . These now are the births of Ishmael [that is the posterity issued from him this is related here as a confirmation to the truth of Gods promises made above chapter 16.12 and 17.20] the son of Abraham whom Hagar Sarah’s Egyptian hand maid did bear to Abraham.
\p
\v 13 . And these are names of the sons of Ishmael with their names according to their birth whereby are called according to the order of their births it is thought that these twelve sons of Ishmael inhabited the land of Nabathea between Euphrates and the red sea ] the first born of Ishmael Nebajoth [see Isaiah 60.7] then Kedar [see Psalms 120.5 Cant1.5 Isaiah 21.16 Jeremiah 49.8 Ezekiel 27.21] and Abdel and Misbam [see of another Misbam the son of Simeon 1Chronicles 4.25.]
\p
\v 14 . And Misma and Duma [see Isaiah 21.11 it is the name likewise of a city in the tribe of Judah Joshua 15.21] and Massa [thus the place also called mount hereby, where the people of Israel contented with Moseh.]
\p
\v 15 . Hagar and Theme [see Job 6.19 Jeremiah 25.23] ether nap his and Kidman.
\p
\v 16 . And these are the sons of Ishmael and there are names in their villages and palaces princes [this is the fulfilling of the promise made above chapter 17.20] according to their nations.
\p
\v 17 . And those are the years of life of Ishmael and hundred and seventy years and he expired and died and he was gathered to his people [see above chapter 15.15 a don this chapter on verse 8.]
\p
\v 18 . And they dwelt from Havilla off see above chapter 2.11 and the annotations thereupon] unto Sur [ see above chapter 16.7 and 20.11] which is over against Egypt as thou goest to assure he pitched himself down [viz. with his abode and habitation see Numbers 34.2 Judges 7.12 Heb. He fell viz. by his lot and inheritance Joshua 23.4 and Psalms 78.55] before the face of all his brethren [see above chapter 16.12.]
\p
\v 19 . Those now are he births [that is issue and posterity] of Isaac the son of Abraham Abraham begat Isaac.
\p
\v 20 . And Isaac was forty years old [Heb. A son of forty year] when he took him Rebecca to wife the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian out of Padan Aram [or the country of Mesopotamia called Syria of the two rivers above chapter 24.10 or a city or tract of that country [the sister of Laban the Syrian.
\p
\v 21 . And Syrian earnestly entreated the Lord in the presence of his wife for she was barren [others Isaac insisted praying to the Lord in which exercise it seems Isaac held on for a long time in regard he got his two sons but in the sixth year of his age below verse 26 having been married twenty years with Rebecca verse 20 it seems to have been a solemn or set prayer which both of them together unanimously and constantly offered up to God for the obtaining of the children from him others take and understand it as if Isaac had prayed alone thus by himself for or in behalf of Rebecca as having her before him in his mind ] and he Lord was entreated by him [Heb. For or on him that is the Lord was entreated for his good advantage] so that Rebecca his wife conceived.
\p
\v 22 . And the children [Heb. sons] trussed one another in her body [viz. in an extraordinary strange and painful manner betokening the division and enmity of these two children and both their posterity Heb. In the inmost of her] then said she it is so? Why am I thus? [Heb. Why I thus or what for I this? Abrupt expression proceeding of impatience and distemper upon this strange and painful accident the meaning seems to be it is the course? What should make me wish for children? And why doth god give me any? Or what end have I conceived? Or what do I live for yet?] And she went to enquire of the Lord [viz. in some private retired place fervently to call upon the Lord in this distress or to lead and understand this meaning by some prophet Abraham himself or some other pious Patriarch yet living.]
\p
\v 23 . And the LORD said to her [viz. either some present speech and allocation or by a vision or in a dream by an inward instinct and inspiration in either her own person or some prophet that acquainted her with it from god] two nations they are in thy belly [that is the father of two nations to wit the Demotes and the Israelites ] and two sorts of people shall separate themselves asunder out of the bowels [which is fulfilled not only corporally but literally in regard of Jacob and Esau together with the Israelites and the Edomites but spiritual likewise in regard of the two church and people of God and the enemies of the same] and the people shall be stronger than the other people [meaning that the one brother shall be more mighty and powerful than the other] and the greater shall serve the less[these words declare the foregoing by the greater we are to understand Esau whom in regard of the primogeniture of strength of body and of the outward means and ability and was doubtless the greater more considerable as also his posterity having a long posses mount Seir and reigned there while the children of Israel were yet strangers and sojourners in Canaan slaves and bondmen in Egypt and despicable wandering people in the wilderness nevertheless this greater people should be made subject to and serve lesser which was fulfilled first in Jacob when having gotten the prerogative of primogeniture he became thereby Lord ver. his brother and afterwards in the posterity when they inherited the land of Canaan and made the Edomites tributaries to them see 2Samuel 8.14 and this is likewise fulfilled in the true church who notwithstanding her small appearance of the most part in outward glory and power compared with the false one doth nevertheless keep Christ in the midst of her by his word and spirit exercising the dominion over and his and her enemies .]
\p
\v 24 . Now when her days were filled to bring forth behold there were twins in her belly.
\p
\v 25 . And the first came out red he was wholly like a Barry garment [the Hebrew word doth signify an upper garment such as a cloak and a coat] therefore they called his name Esau [that is made up perfected being hairy like a man full grown.]
\p
\v 26 . And after that his brother came forth whose head was hold Esau’s heel therefore they called his name Jacob [Heb. Jacob as if one should say heel holder see below chapter 27 on verse 36] and Isaac was sixty years old [Heb. A son of sixty year as Abraham being an hundred year old and stayed thirty five for the fulfilling of Gods promise above chapter 12.4 so Isaac being now threescore he was fain of fairy twenty years for the further fulfilling of the same promise thus God knows how to try and exercise his children ] when he begat them [or when she bare them the word of the text bears either signification.]
\p
\v 27 . Now when the youths grew up Esau became a man expert in hunting [Heb. Understanding the hunting that is a good huntsman a crafty hunter ] a man of the field [that is one that loved rather to be in the field than at home see above chapter 9 on verse 20] but Jacob became an upright man [see above chapter 6 on verse 9] dwelling in tents [that is he led a peaceable quiet life being not wild and ranting abroad like his brother but minding the household affairs and the herds of the stock of his father in both regards wherefore tents are requisite see above chapter 4.20 and Heb. 11.9.]
\p
\v 28 . And Isaac loved Esau for the venison was to his mouth or palate [that is was grateful meat to him he found a special relish in it a piece of human frailty in this good patriarch that for so vain a thing he loved him most of which he was sufficiently instructed before that God did love him least] but Rebecca loved Jacob.
\p
\v 29 . And Jacob had boiled a boiling [the Hebrew word doth signify in general any kind of meat drest broth portage frumenty &c. but below verse 34 it is called a or dish of lentils ] and Esau came forth from the fields and was weary.
\p
\v 30 . And Esau said to Jacob let me so I pray of that red that red there [the word is doubled to shew the greediness of his appetite to his dish whose color and taste seemed to be pleasing and enticing to him or else for that it was exceedingly red so good, good is put for very good Judges 11.25 bad, bad for very bad Proverbs 20.14 ] for I am weary therefore they called his name Edom [that is red partly because he was red of the skin himself verse 25 and partly for being so besorted with longing for this red pottage.]
\p
\v 31 . Then Jacob said sell me for this day thy first-birth primogeniture or being first born [that is the right and prerogative of being first born consisting 1. In the honor and lordship over his brethren above chapter 4.7 and 43.9 and 2Chronicles 21.3 Psalms 89.28 2. In the double portion of the goods to be inherited Deuteronomy 11.17 3. In the right of the priest hood after the deceased of the father especially after the staying of the first born in Egypt until the priesthood was transferred upon the tribe of the Levi Numbers 8.16,17,18,19.]
\p
\v 32 . And Esau said behold I am giving to die [that is I am daily abroad of hunting and in continual danger to know what shall I be the better than for all my birth-right? Some refer this answer of his to present faintness and hunger] and what for the primogeniture to me? [Thus doth Esau with an ungracious heart rejected this excellent right of primogeniture see Heb. 12 verse 16 and have below verse 34.]
\p
\v 33 . Then said Jacob swears unto this day [Heb. As today] and he swear unto him and he sold his primogeniture to Jacob.
\p
\v 34 . And Jacob gave bread to Esau and the oiling of the lentils and he did eat and drink and heroes up and went his way thus Esau despised his primogenitures.
\c 26
\s Isaac driven by famine to remove to Gerar verse 1 &c. where god bids him to stay and not to go into Egypt renewing unto him the promises made unto Abraham 2isaac gives out Rebecca to his sister 7 king Abimelech discovering the contrary reproves him and forbids his subjection to wrong this married couple in the least kind 8 Isaac is greatly blessed by God which draws envy upon him from the philistine that they stop this well 12 upon the imitations from Abimelech he removeth thence towards the lower ground of Gerar and is at some pains to get spring water but finds at length 18,19,32&c. he removes to Beersheba and his comforted there by an apparition of God to whom the returneth thanks by public worship 23 Abimelech enters into the covenant with him 26 Esau to the vexation of his old age 34.
\p
\v 1 And there was famine in that country [to wit in that part of the land of Canaan where Isaac dwelt at this time] besides tee first famine which had been in the days of Abraham [see above 12.10] therefore Isaac went to Abimelech [see above chapter 20. On verse 2 it may be doubted whether this was the same person spoken of in the chapter or else he must have very old by this time so that it is more likely it was his successor ] the king of the philistine to Gerar [see above 10.19 and chapter 20 on verse 1.]
\p
\v 2 . And the Lord appeared to him and said do not go down to Egypt [as thou didst intend according to the example of thy father above chapter 27 verse 8] dwell in the land that I shall tell thee [see the next verse.]
\p
\v 3 . Dwell as a stranger in this land and I shall be with thee for unto thee antsy seed will I give all these countries [which were rehearsed and all set down by name chapter 15] and will establish the earth which I have sworn to thy father Abraham [see above chapter 2 on verse16,17.]
\p
\v 4 . And I will multiply thy seeds at the stars of heaven and will give all these countries toothy seed and in thy seed all nations of the earth shall be blessed [see the annotation above chapter 22 on verse 16.]
\p
\v 5 . Therefore that Abraham hath been obedient to my voice [see above chapter 22 on verse 16] and hath kept my commandment [Heb. Entertaining keeping or guarding observation that is that which I commanded and ordained and the latter three to respect things particular as it percepts on the moral law on the doctrine of what we are obliged to believe &c. elsewhere there are added unto these the rights whereby are understood the civil or political laws Deuteronomy 11.1.]
\p
\v 6 . Thus Isaac dwells at Gerar.
\p
\v 7 . And when the men of that place asked him of his wife he said she is my sister [see the like example in Abrahams above chapter 12, 13 and 20.2] for he was afraid to say my wife left said he [this is inserted out of verse 9 see the like insertion Joshua 4.23 1Kings 20.34 2Corinthians 9.6 [the men of this place perchance kill me for Rebecca for she was fair of aspect.
\p
\v 8 . And it came to pass when he had been there for a long time [Heb. When the days were become enlighten or become long to him there ] that Abimelech the king of Philistine looked out at the window and he saw that behold Isaac was spotting with his wife Rebecca [understand that he was using some familiar though honest gesture by which the king might easily conjecture that they were man and wife together.]
\p
\v 9 . Then Abimelech called upon Isaac and said truly lo she is thy wife how hast thou said then she is my sister? And Isaac said to him for I have said to him for I said [viz. by myself, that is, I thought see above chapter 20 on verse 11] lets peradventure I die for her sake.
\p
\v 10 . And Abimelech said what this that thou hast done to us is? Lightly one of these people might be lain by thy wife so that thou wouldst brought a guilt over or upon us [that is misdeed or iniquity deserving punishment see above chapter 20.9]
\p
\v 11 . And Abimelech commanded all people saying who so toucheth [that is doth hurt or wrong unto whether in words or deeds in holy body honor or goods touching is likewise used thus for damaging or wrong below verse 29 Joshua 9.19 Ruth 2.9Job 1.11 Psalms 105.15 and Zachariah 2.8.] this man or his wife shall surely be put to death [Heb. Dying be put to death or put to death by death.]
\p
\v 12 . And Isaac sowed in that same land and he found [that is he got received reaped ] in the same year an hundred measure which he had sowed he received an hundred in the harvest the Hebrew word doth signify a public known measure of the dry wares.]For the LORD blessed him.
\p
\v 13 . And that man became great [that is rich and mighty as above chapter 24.35] yea he became or waxed greater throughout [Heb. He went gaping or becoming great see the like phrase chapter 8.3 2samuel 3.1 and Jonah 1.11in the annotations] until he was become very great.
\p
\v 14 . And he had possession of sheep and possession of oxen [that is store of small and great cattle see above chapter 12 on verse16 ] and a great household service [that is abundance of servants and attendants for his several employments about his cattle his grounds pasture cornfields vineyards gardens orchards see Job 1.3] so that the philistines envied him.
\p
\v 15 . And the entire well which his fathers servants had digged in the days of the father Abraham [see above chapter 21.25] those philistines stopped and filled them up with earth [Heb. With dust.]
\p
\v 16 . Also Abimelech said Isaac go from us [Heb. From with us] for thou art grown much mightier than we.
\p
\v 17 . Then Isaac went from thence and he leagued himself [see the like phrase below chapter 33.18 and elsewhere] in the vale of the Gerar [that is in the lower country at some distance thence] and dwelt there.
\p
\v 18 . And now when Isaac was returned again he digged up again [Heb. And Isaac returned and digged up others and Isaac digged again ] those wells of water which they had digged in Abrahams his father time and which the Philistines had stepped up after the death and he called their names after the names whereby his father had named them.
\p
\v 19 . the servants of Isaac digged in the vale and they found a well thereof the living waters [that is such as came forth from hidden veins underground and were ever springing with clear fresh and wholesome water to drink compare Leviticus 14.5 ,50 and chapter 15.13 numbers 19.17 Cant. 4.15.]
\p
\v 20 . And the herdsmen of the Gerar contended with Isaacs herdsmen saying this water belong to us therefore he called [namely Isaac] and the name of that well is Esek [that is strife contention] because they have been striving and contending about it.
\p
\v 21 . Then they digged another well an there were likewise contented over therefore this name sitna [that is enmity hate and resistance from this word Satan hath his name signifying an adversary a hater.]
\p
\v 22 . and he broke up another from whence and digged another well and they contended not over the same therefore called the name Rahoboth [that is enlargements spreading ] and said for now the LORD hath made room for us and we are grown in his land [others that we may grow or we shall grow .]
\p
\v 23 . After that he went up from thence [viz. out of the valley of Gerar] to Berseba [where his father had lived a long time see above chapter 21.31, 32, 33.]
\p
\v 24 . And the Lord appeared to him in that night [to wit when he was new to come to Berseba god tarried not long behind with his comfort ] and said I am the God of Abraham [see above chapter 17.7] thy father [to whom I have past my word and promise as likewise her hath accepted of the same see below chapter 31 verse 5, 42] be not afraid [ to wit of the Philistines compare above chapter 15.1] for I am with thee [see chapter 21 on verse 22] and I will bless thee and multiply thy seed for the sake of Abraham my servant [that is not for his merits but for the covenants sake which I have made him with him.]
\p
\v 25 . Then he built an altar there [to shew thereby that he would serve and worship no other God but the god of his father Abraham] and called upon the name of the Lord [see above chapter 4 on verse 26] and he pitched his tents there and Isaacs servants digged a well there.
\p
\v 26 . And Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Abuzzath his friend and Pitchl his chieftain of war [see above chapter 21.22 this Phichol should seem to have been another f the same name some are of opinion that this name Pichol was common to the commanders in the chiefs or generals of the country even as the name Abimelech to the king thereof .]
\p
\v 27 . And Isaac said to them whereore are ye com to me seeing ye hate me and have sent me away from ye? [See above on verse 16.]
\p
\v 28 . And they said we have apparently seen [Heb. seeing we have seen that the Lord with thee therefore we said there is an oath between us [an oath or curse sees above chapter 14.23 on verse 41.]Between us and between the and let us make a covenant with thee [se above chapter 15 on verse 10, 17, 18.]
\p
\v 29 . If thou do ill with us as we have not [or according as we have not &c. and according as we have &c. a form of swearing wherein the imprecation or punishment is omitted se above chapter 14 on verse 23] touched thee [that is have not done thee the least hurt see above verse 11 but of the contrary see verse 14,15,16] and even as we have only done good t thee and have suffered thee to go away in peace [that is we did not hurt neither to thy self nor to thy family nor to thy goods ] thou art now the blessed of the Lord [this seems to be an abrupt speech implying thus much since God hath blest thee so abundantly thou oughtest not to remember the small annoyance shewed thee.]
\p
\v 30 . Then he made them a feast and they did eat and drink.
\p
\v 31 . And they rose up early in the morning and swear to one another [Heb. The man of his brother] after that Isaac had let them go and they went from him in peace.
\p
\v 32 . And it happened on that day that Isaacs servants came and brought him word about the well that the had digged [see verse 5] and they said to him we have found water.
\p
\v 33 . And he named the same Seba [Heb. Sebiba that oath see above chapter 21 on verse 31] therefore the name of then city is Beersheba [the oath well or well of oath above chapter 21 verse 31 it is said that the country was Abimelech made there the one to the other but here mention is made of a city in that country which likewise got this name from the oath of Isaac and Abimelech] unto this same day.
\p
\v 34 . Now when Esau was forty years old [Heb a son of forty years the same age his father was of when he married above chapter 5.20] he took to wife Judith [Heb. Jehudith some hold this to have been the same which below chapter 36 verse 2 is called Aholibama so that it seems she had two names as her father likewise had being called Beeri here and chapter 36.2 Anah yet they may well have been two several women it being plain that Esau was sufficiently to the abuse of having several wives together ] the daughters of Beeri the Hethite [one of the nations of Canaan see above chapter 10.15 These matches Esau entered into without contrary to the will and pleasure of his parents see above chapter 24 verse 3 and below chapter 27.46 and chapter 28.2 ] and Basmath [below chapter 36 verse 2 called Adah] and daughter of Elon the Hethite.
\p
\v 35 . And these were the bitterness of the spirits of Isaac and Rebecca [in regard namely of 1. The abominable idolatry 2. Their ill vain worldly spiteful and wordful conditions and 3. That there were the issue of an accursed nation and generation whom God determined to destroy and extirpate.]
\c 27
\s Isaac being old and dim sighted intends to bless Esau as the first born but is deceived therein by the prudent managing Rebecca in so much hat he blessed Jacob instead of Esau verse 1 &c. Esau coming from hunting and understanding this is much distempered at it and so is Isaac himself who nevertheless provided Esau upon his great lamenting with a temporal blessing 30. For this Esau hates his brother and purposed to slay him 41 which being perceived by Rebecca she adviseth Jacob to depart towards her brother Laban and disposeth Isaac to approve of the same 42.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass when Isaac grown old [as some conjecture about 137 years now ] and his eyes became dim [not withstanding Gods wonderful providence who by this blindness or dim sightedness did not only exercise his servants Isaac but likewise brought it about that the right of primogeniture was conferred upon Jacob] that he could not see he called Esau his greatest son [that is the first born ] and said to him my son and he said lo here I am [see above chapter 22 on verse 1.]
\p
\v 2 . and he said behold now I am grown old I do not know the day of my death [that is I have so small time to live left me that I know soon death may surprise me and must look for him every hour and moment.]
\p
\v 3 . Now then take I pray thy instruments thy quiver of arrows [Heb. Pendant quiver r any kind of Bandelier] antsy bow and go to thy field and hunt me some venison [Heb. Hunt me a hunting take any kind of venison for me such as thou knowest I love to eat as below verse 5,7.]
\p
\v 4 . And make or dress me savory meats or dishes [or some dainties ] so as I love the same and bring them to me eat that thy my soul [that is myself with full intent and purpose of mind ] may bless thee ere I die [understand this is not a common or ordinary blessing which parents are able to give their children in any occasion but of a most singular extraordinary and excellent solemn prophetical blessing drest and solemnized in a manner of a last will and testament declairing his son the heir apparent of al the spiritual and corporal promises made to him his father and so below chapter 8.1.]
\p
\v 5 . Now Rebecca hearkened to it when Isaac spake to his son Esau and Esau went into the field for to hunt some venison that might bring it in.
\p
\v 6 . Then Rebecca spoke to her son Jacob saying behold I have heard thy father speak to Esau thy brother saying:
\p
\v 7 . bring me some venison and dress me savory meats and dishes that I may eat and bless thee before the faceoff the LORD [that is to say with such a blessing as shall be pronounced in his name and as in his presence and confirmed by his guidance and direction ] before my death.
\p
\v 8 . Now then my son hear my voice [howbeit Rebecca makes use of means in this business which cannot wholly be excused nevertheless the matter itself that she endeavored to derive the right of the progeniture upon Jacob did agree with Gods will and declaration see above chapter25.23] in that which I command thee.
\p
\v 9 . Go to the stock now and fetch or bring [Heb. Take but the Hebrew word doth likewise here comprehend the signification to bring and both they together imply as much as to fetch see above chapter 12 on verse 15] me thence two good kids of the he goats [ that is two fat ones well liking and well fed compare below chapter 41.5] and I will make or dress them for savory meats to thy father such as he loves.
\p
\v 10 . And thou salt bring the same to thy father and he shall eat that he may bless thee before his death.
\p
\v 11 . Then said Jacob to Rebecca his mother behold my brother Esau is a hairy men [that is rough skinned] and I am a smooth man [that is soft skinned.]
\p
\v 12 . Perhaps my father will feel me and I shall be a deceiver before his eyes [Heb. Seducer the particle as is sometimes used not for that which only seems so but which is so indeed see Nehemiah 7.2 John 1.14 2Corinthians 3.18] so should I bring a curse upon me and not a blessing [compare Deuteronomy 27.18.]
\p
\v 13 . And his mother said to him the curse be upon me my son [Rebecca speaks thus confidently not out of any levity but as it seems out of an assured hope of a good issue arguing and concluding with herself not only from the clear oracle of God but likewise from the ungracious life and conversation of Esau that the right of primogeniture did not belong to him but to his brother Jacob] only hearken to my voice and go fetch them me [Heb. Take me that island bring them me to wit the two young he goats as I bad thee see above verse 9.]
\p
\v 14 . Then he went and he fetched them and brought them to his mother made savory meats such as his father loved.
\p
\v 15 . then Rebecca took Esau her greatest sons precious garments [Heb. Desirable garments or garments of the desirableness that is such as are much desired and delighted in that is fair and costly ones ] which she had by her in the house [that which she kept and laid up in the well scented presses or wardrobes as appears by verse 27] and she put them upon Jacob her least son [this and the following action verse 16 which Rebecca made use of to compass her design indeed a kind of deceit but so much the less to be found fault with as her intent was thereby to help to reduce him into the right way to fulfill the way of God and to put Jacob in the possession of which Gods intimated decree belonged unto him.]
\p
\v 16 . And the skins of the kids of the he-goat she put on his hands and upon the smoothness of his neck.
\p
\v 17 . And she gave the savory meats and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of Jacob her son.
\p
\v 18 . And he came to is father and said my father and he said Lo here I am who art thou my son?
\p
\v 19 . And Jacob said I am Esau the first born [it is indeed commendable to Jacob that he did highly esteem and earnestly long for high primogeniture but the way he goeth deserves no praise making use of untruth the former was in from God through faith in his promises that the latter was from himself through frailty of human corruption] I have done as thou hast spoken to me get thee up sit and eat for my venison that thy soul may bless me [see above verse 4]
\p
\v 20 . Then said Isaac to his son how is this that thou hast found it so soon my son? [Heb. That thou didst hasten so much to find? These words may likewise be rendered thus what is this that thou hast found so soon? Or thou hast found that so soon?] And he said because the Lord thy God made that meet or occur before my face.
\p
\v 21 . And Isaac said to Jacob draw near I pray that I may feel thee my son? Whether thou be son Esau himself or not?
\p
\v 22 . Then Jacob came nigh to his father Isaac who felt and said the voice is Jacobs voice [that is as rough if they were Esau’s hands as it is declared verse 23 hereby it appears that Isaac began to doubt whether this carriage was right nevertheless God purpose proceeded.]
\p
\v 23 . Yet he knew him not [notably by a wonderful direction of the providence of God who besides the blindness of his eyes suffers such a dullness of mind to surprise him in this particular that he proceeds to the blessings although he knew the voice of Jacob and was doubtful still as appears by the next verse] because his hands were hairy as his brother Esau’s hands and he blessed him.
\p
\v 24 . And he said art thou my son Esau himself? And he said I am.
\p
\v 25 . Then said he put it near me that I may eat of the venison of my son [to wit of that which thou hast taken and drest for me] that my soul may bless the and he put it near him and he did eat he brought him wine also and he drank.
\p
\v 26 . And his father Isaac said unto him come near I pray and kiss me my son [the kiss was used for the old in such solemn benediction as a pledge of honor and affection see below chapter 48 verse 10.]
\p
\v 27 . And he came near and he kissed him then he smelt the smell of his garments [whereby he was the more persuaded that Jacob was his son Esau as if the same he said my apparel doth smell of the stables and cattle but of the fields and wood of pleasure ] and bless him and he said behold the smell of my son [that is the smell of my sons garments ] is like the smell of the fields which the Lord hath blessed [which smell is chiefly caused by the temperateness of the air the goodness of the soil and the precious abundance of all manner of growing things. The meaning is , that like as a pleasant smell of the field is a token of its goodly situation precious fruits and rich abundance so the smell of my sons garments is a token unto me of his and his posterities future blessedness which shall more then deserve to be compared to such goodly field.]
\p
\v 28 . Thus then God gives unto thee [this is not to be understood as a wish only that it may be so but as a prophecy that it should be fulfilled thus according to the letter indeed not so much in Jacobs person as in his posterity nevertheless the spiritual benefits typified thereby were common to him with all the true believers ] of the dew of heaven [under the name of the dew which was very necessary to the land of Canaan to supply the scarcity o frail he comprehends all manner of blessing conveyed and bestowed upon the earth by means of the air and the heavens compare Deuteronomy 33 verse 13,14] and the fastness of the earth [that is abundance of god and precious things produced out of good and fruitful soil compare Deuteronomy 8.8 and 32.13,14 and 33.24] and the abundance of wheat and must.
\p
\v 29 . People popular shall serve thee and the nations shall bow down before thee[this wish or blessing was especially fulfilled in the times of David Solomon and king of Judah unto Jorum see above chapter 25 on verse 23] be thou LORD over thy brethren and thy mothers sons shall bow down before thee [according to the right of primogeniture see above chapter 25 on verse 31] cursed must he be who so curseth thee and he who so blesseth thee must he be blessed [see above chapter 12 on verse 3.]
\p
\v 30 . And it happened when Isaac had finished blessing Jacob it happened then Jacob was just gone forth from his father Isaacs face [Heb. Going forth was gone forth ] that Esau came from his hunting.
\p
\v 31 . He now likewise make drest savory meats and brought them to his father and he said to his father let my father arise and eat of the venison of his son that thy soul may bless me.
\p
\v 32 . And Isaac his father said to him who art thou? And he said I am thy son the first born Esau.
\p
\v 33 . Then Isaac was astonished with very great astonishment exceedingly [the Hebrew word doth signify a very great fright and terror accompanied with shaking and trembling as below chapter 4.8] Exodus 19.16,18 this terror God suffered to seize upon him from being angry with Jacob and partly to make him consider that the issue and success of the blessing renounced was a thing proceeding from Gods decree and his everlasting purpose see above chapter 25.23] then said who is he then that hunted the venison and broth it to me ? And I have eaten of all before thou comest and have blessed him also he shall be blessed.
\p
\v 34 . When Esau heard the words of his father he cried out with a great and bitter cry exceedingly and he said to his father bless me also my father [others I am likewise my father or I am likewise thy son my father so verse 38.]
\p
\v 35 . And he said thy brother is come with deceit [Isaac indeed called Jacobs action deceit as indeed it was but now he understood plainly that himself had been the cause of it by his foregoing advertency as the same appears by his ratifying an firmly adhering to what bring deceived thus he had done upon it see above verse 23] and hath taken thy blessing away [that is which by nature appertained to thee and I was fully resolved to have bestowed upon thee.]
\p
\v 36 . Then thou said it is not because they call his name Jacob that he hath deceived me twice now? [wherefore he was called Jacob that is to be seen above chapter 25 verse 26 to wit because he laid hold on his brothers heels at his birth but Esau interprets this name as if he had trip up his heels that is had coarsened and cheated him which signification the Hebrew word may bear well enough see Jeremiah 17.9] my first birth he hath taken away [this is false for he has freely accord sold the same unto him see above chapter 25.32,33] and behold now he hath taken away my blessings [the blessing belonged to the right primogeniture but he having sold the same the blessing did not appertain unto him ] moreover he said hast thou then kept no blessing for?
\p
\v 37 . Then Isaac answered and said unto Esau behold I set him to be the Lord over thee an doll his brethren [that is all the progeny and posterity of Esau] have I given him for servants and I have supported him with corn and must [that is I have so furnished and provided for him that he shall have enough not only to supply the common wants and necessities but likewise to cheer and comfort himself abundantly] what shall I now do unto thee my son?
\p
\v 38 . And Esau said to his father hast thou but third one blessing my father? [understand by this one blessing the chief and principal whereby now Jacob was now declared heir of the divine covenant an of the land of Canaan ] bless me also my father and Esau lifted up his voice and wept.
\p
\v 39 . Then his father Isaac answered and said unto him behold the fatnesses of the earth shall be thy habitation and of the dew of heaven shalt thou be blessed above.
\p
\v 40 . And thou shalt live upon thy sword [that is thou shalt be put upon to it to maintain the people country and substance by force of arms and by reason thereof live a troublesome life in the midst of many wards] and shalt serve thy brother [see above chapter 25 on verse 23] nevertheless it shalt come to pass when it shalt bear sway then shalt withdraw his yoke from thy neck [see 2Samuel 8.14 and the fulfilling hereof 2 Kings 8.20, 22.]
\p
\v 41 . And Esau hated Jacob for that blessing wherewith his father had blessed him [this hatred descended as by inheritance upon the children and posterity see Ezekiel 35.5 Amos 1.11 Obadiah verse 10] and Esau said in his heart [that is by himself howbeit he not only thought so but either by words or gestures made it sufficiently known afterwards so that it cam to his mothers ears appears verse 42.] the days of my fathers mourning draw near and I will kill my brother Jacob.
\p
\v 42 . When Rebecca was made acquainted with these words of Esau her greatest son she sent and called Jacob her least son and said to him behold thy brother Esau comforts himself over thee that he shall kill thee [Rebecca reveals unto her son Jacob what she had understood of Esau’s design for to encourage him thereby to undertake his journey she had thought on as a means of his safety.]
\p
\v 43 . Now then my son hearken my voice and get thee up flee [or flee thee or for thee see above chapter 12 on verse 1] to Haran [see above chapter 11 on verse 31] unto my brother Alban.
\p
\v 44 . And tarry with him for some days [that is for a while or certain time Heb. Had the plural this dies unos and so below likewise chapter 29.20] until the servant wrath [the Heb. Word doth signify a hot burning wrath such as this of Esaus was] of thy brotherbrothers turn.
\p
\v 45 . Until the wrath of thy brother turn away from thee, and he shall have forgotten that which thou didst to him then I will send and take thee thence why should I be bereaved of you both in one day? [That is of thee if Esau should chance to kill thee and of Esau if for his murder should be put to death by the magistrate or otherwise destroyed by a just judgment of God upon him or should be driven away from the presence of God like Cain.]
\p
\v 46 . And Rebecca said to Isaac I am vexed to live or in my life because of the daughters of Heth [Heb. From or before the face of &c. understand Esau’s wife of daughters of Heth such as these are of the daughters of this land what shall I live for?
\c 28
\s Isaac sends for Jacob and chargeth him to travel into Mesopotamia and to take him a wife of the daughters of Laban wishing him good speed of his journey with the renewing and confirmation of the benediction which he had given him before without knowing him verse1 &c. Esau perceiving that his design was frustrated and that his Canaanitish wives were not acceptable to his father he goes and married another yet of Ishmaels family 6 Jacob undertakes the journey and by the way seeth that most remarkeable vision of a ladder in a dream receiving there most excellent promises of God 12 whereby being strengthened and encouraged he sets up a memorial there and engageth himself in a vow of thankfulness to God 16.
\p
\v 1 And Isaac called Jacob and blessed him [that is the benediction which he had been before given him unknowingly he now upon better light wittingly and willingly confirmed and ratified unto him wishing Jacob withal prosperous and happy journey as Joshua 22.7] and commanded him and said to him take no wife of the daughters of Canaan.
\p
\v 2 . Get thee up go to Paddan Aram [see above chapter 25 on verse 20] to the house of Bethuel [see above chapter 25 on verse 22,23] my mothers father and take thee a wife thence of daughters of Laban thy mothers brother.
\p
\v 3 . And God almighty bless thee [see above chapter 17 verse 1 and the annotate] and make thee fruitful and multiply thee that thou maist be a heap of people acervus or coetus populorum.
\p
\v 4 . And he give unto thee the blessing of Abraham [that is promised to Abraham above chapter 12.3,7 and chapter 15.1,4,5,7, &chapter 17.5,6,7,8] and to thy seed with thee which that thou maist hereditarily possess the land of thy strangership or sojourning [see above chapter 17 on verse 8] which God gave unto Abraham.
\p
\v 5 . So Isaac sent Jacob away that he went to Paddan Aram to Laban son of Bethuel the Syrian [Heb. Aramean or Aramite] the brother of Rebecca, Jacob and Esaus mother.
\p
\v 6 . Now when Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paden Aram to take him a wife from thence and when he blessed him had commanded him saying take no wife of the daughters of Canaan.
\p
\v 7 . And that Jacob had been obedient to his father and his mother and was gone for Paddan Aram.
\p
\v 8 . And that Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were evil in the eyes of Isaac his father [that is unacceptable displeasing to him see above chapter 21 verse 11.]
\p
\v 9 . And Esau went to Ishmael [that is to Ishmaels house or family and offspring Ishmael being dead already by this time as some do gather from chapter 25.17] and took him a wife above his wives [that is over and above the wives he had before which were two above chapter 26.34 so that this was the third it should seem that Esau did this as a thinking to please his father by matching into his kindred ]Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael the son of Abraham the sister of Nehajoth [Ishmael first born see above chapter 25.13.]
\p
\v 10 . Jacob then went forth from Beersheba [see above chapter 21 on verse 31] and journeyed to Haran.
\p
\v 11 . And he lighted a place whereby he overnighted [see below verse 19] for the son was gone and he took the stones of that place [that is one of the stones as is to begat hereby verse 18] and made his head pillow and laid himself to sleep at the same place.
\p
\v 12 . And he dreamt [to wit a dream which God sent him extraordinarily for to reveal thereby some hidden and holy matters of mysteries unto him see of the like divine revelation above chapter 20 on verse 3] and lo a ladder was set upon the earth and whose top or uppermost [Heb. Head] did reach to heaven and behold the angels of God [that is the good and blessed ones] and ascending and descending thereon.
\p
\v 13 . And behold the Lord stood upon the same and said I am the Lord [see above verse 3 and 4] the God of thy father [that is grand-sire or grand father] Abraham and the God of Isaac this land whereon thou list asleep will give I to thee and to thy seed.
\p
\v 14 . And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth [see above chapter 13 verse 16] and thou salt break forth in the multitude [that is spread and multiply exceedingly in a short time so likewise below chapter 30 verse 30 Isaiah 54.3] west-wards [Heb. Sea-wards or to the sea see above chapter 12.8] and eastward and northwards and southwards an din thee and in thy seed shall all generations of the earth be blessed [see above chapter 12.3 and 22.18.]
\p
\v 15 . And behold I am with thee [see above chapter 21 on verse 22 and chapter 26 on verse 4] and I will keep thee everywhere wither thou shalt go and I will bring thee back into the same country for I will not forsake thee until I shall have done that which I have spoken unto thee [that is never according t the usual purport of this phrase2 Samuel 6.23 Matthew 1.25 and 18.34.]
\p
\v 16 . Now when Jacob awaked out of his sleep he said assuredly the Lord is in this place [viz. in a peculiar manner in regard of the precedence apparition otherwise God is everywhere] and I knew it not [that is I did not think of or imagine that ucha divine revelation should happen to me.]
\p
\v 17 . And he was afraid as said how dreadful this place is? [in regard of the glorious majesty of God which was manifested here to Jacob in a very extraordinary manner to declare and reveal himself unto men by speaking to them and to be spoken unto by men praying and worshipping of him whereby they may from whence as by a gate ascend up into heaven to converse wit him.]
\p
\v 18 . And Jacob raised up early in the morning and he took that stone which he had laid for his head pillow and set it up for a monument and poured forth oil [which he had taken along with him for provision by the way to use with his meat and anointing according to the custom of whose countries oil was likewise used in offerings and consecrations of things to God see exodus chapter 29] upon the top [Heb. Head] of it [this Jacob did in token that the consecrated or hallowed this stone thee both to testify his thankfulness to God at present and to leave a memorial behind for time to come for that God had there appeared to him.]
\p
\v 19 . And he named the name of that place Bethel [a house of God sees above chapter12 verse 8 and chapter 13 verses 3] whereas the name that city formerly was Luz. [See below chapter 35 verse 6 and chapter 48 verses 3.]
\p
\v 20 . And Jacob vowed a vow [as desiring some special mercies of God for the which he engaged himself to be thankful] saying when God shall have been with me and shall have kept me upon this way wherein I go and shall have given, me bread to eat [see above chapter 3 on verse 19] and apparel to put on.
\p
\v 21 . And I shall be returned to the house of my father in peace [compare above chapter 26 the annotations on verse 29] then the LORD shall be God to me [that is I shall evermore profess and acknowledge him the true God and only savoir and accordingly set up his public worship as followeth.]
\p
\v 22 . And this stone which I have set up for a monument shall be an house of God [that is a place which I shall hallow and consecrate for me and mine to serve and worship god there compare above verse 17 and see the performance thereof below chapter 35 verse 1, 3, 7] and whatsoever thou shalt give me thereof will I surely give thee the tenth [Heb. I will tithing tithe thee decimando decimabo tibi that is pay the tenth therefore assuredly viz. For the entertainment and maintenance of God and for the practice and exercise of all manner of pious and charitable uses compare below chapter 35 verses 3, 7.]
\c 29
\s Jacob being near Haran by a wonderful providence of God becomes acquainted with Rachel Labans daughter verse 1 &c. who runs to tell it her father 10 Laban comes running forth to meet Jacob and brings him to the house hears all what happened to him and entertains him 13 they bargain together that Jacob shall serve seven years for Rachels 15 but when he thought to marry Rachels elder sister is coupled with him 21 yet he gets Rachel too for the service of yet other seven years 27 Rachel is beloved but barren Leah on the other hand bears Reuben Simeon Levi and Judah.31.
\p
\v 1 The Jacob lifted up his feet [hereby is shewed that Jacob being comforted and strengthened thus by the late vision and heavenly oracle he now went cheerfully and courageously in his journey] and went to the land of the children of the east [that is of the people that inhabited the country lying east from Canaan so Judges 6.33 1 Kings 4.30 Job 1.3 Jeremiah 49.28.]
\p
\v 2 . And he looked , and behold ,there was a well in the field ,and there were three flocks of sheep lying down by it ;door out of that well they watered the flocks ,and there was a great stone on the mouth of that well .
\p
\v 3 . and thitherward all the flocks were gathered and they rolled the stone from, and watered the sheep; and laid the stone again upon the mouth of that well on his place.
\p
\v 4 . Then said Jacob to them; my brethren [compare above chap19the annotations on verse 7] whence ye? And they said we are Haran.
\p
\v 5 . And he said to them know ye Laban the son of Nahor? [His grand son] and they said we know him.
\p
\v 6 . Further he said to them is it well with him? [Heb. Is peace to him? Or hath he peace? So above chapter 27.23 2Samuel 18.32 2Kings 4.26 &c. see of this word peace below chapter 37 on verse 14] and they said it is well and Lo Rachel his daughter that comes with the sheep.
\p
\v 7 . And he said behold it is high day yet [Heb. Great day yet] it is no time that the cattle he gathered water the sheep and go your way and feed them.
\p
\v 8 . Then they said we cannot [Heb. We shall not be able viz. by reason of the stones heaviness which a few of us cannot remove and because of our custom to wait one for another] till all the flocks shall be gathered together and that the stones be rolled off from the wells mouth that we may water the sheep.
\p
\v 9 . When he was yet speaking with them there came Rachel with the sheep belonging to her father for she was a shepherdess [see the like example Exodus 2.16 Cant 1.7, 8.]
\p
\v 10 . And it came to pass when Rachel saw Jacob the daughter of Laban the mothers brother and the sheep of Laban his mothers brother that Jacob slept on and rolled on the stone from the mouth of the well [that is he helped the rest of the shepherds to roll it off in Rachel stead for alone he was not able to do it see backwards verse 8] and watered the sheep of Laban his mothers brother.
\p
\v 11 . And Jacob kissed Rachel [after the manner of those countries kissing by way of salutation as well at the first meting as here verse 13 and below chapter 33 verse 4 Exodus 4.27. and 18.7 as at parting Ruth 1.14 and 1Samuel 20 verse 41 and 1Kings 19.20] and he lifted up his voice and wept [viz. for joy to have met his cousin there so soon and opportunely see of the weeping below chapter 33 verse 4.]
\p
\v 12 . And Jacob acquainted Rachel that he was his father’s brother [see above chapter 13 verses 8] and that he was the son of Rebecca then she ran and acquainted her father with it.
\p
\v 13 . And it came to pass when Laban heard the news [Heb. The hearing] of Jacob his sisters son that he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house and related all things to Laban [to wit the reason and occasion of his journey and what happened to him by the way all which it was fit Laban should understand for the preventing of all sinister surmises as might be occasioned by such an unusual and slender arrival in comparison of Eliezer formerly chapter 24.]
\p
\v 14 . Then said Laban to him verily thou art my bon earn my flesh [that is my near kinsmen and nephew see the like phrase above chapter 2.23 and Jude 9.2 and 2Samuel 19.12,13 and 1 Chronicles 11.1 and so likewise in the spiritual sense Ephesians 5.30] and then he tarried with him a full month [Heb. A month of days that is a complete month or so many days as go to the making up of a month so a year of days below chapter 41 verse 1 is as much as to say a whole or full year.]
\p
\v 15 . After that Laban said to Jacob because thou art my brother shouldest thou therefore serve me for naught? Declare unto me what shall be thy wages?
\p
\v 16 . And Laban had two daughters and the name of the greatest [that is the eldest] was Leah and the name of the least [that is the youngest] was Rachel.
\p
\v 17 . Yet Leah had tender eyes [that is weak one and defective] but Rachel was fair of feature and fair of aspects.
\p
\v 18 . And Jacob loved Rachel and he said I will serve thee seven year for Rachel thy least daughter [Jacob bids a long time to serve both in regard that his uncles greediness was not unknown to him and likewise for the great love to bare to Rachel desiring to pay thus the dowry withal which the bridegroom were obliged to give in those times as appears by Exodus 22.17 and 1Samuel 18.5.]
\p
\v 19 . Then said Laban it is better I give her to thee than that I give her to another man [a doubtful and subtle answer as the event taught Jacob] stay with me.
\p
\v 20 . So Jacob served for Rachel seven years and those were in his eyes as some few days [Heb. One or single days see of the manner of speaking before chapter 27 verse 44 the meaning is that all that time did seem very short to Jacob ] because he loved her.
\p
\v 21 .Then Jacob said to Laban give my wife [that is my betrothed wife by virtue of out matrimonial contract see the like phrase Matthew 1.18,19 and Luke 2.5]my days are fulfilled [the conditioned seven years of my service ] that I may go into her [ see above chapter 6on verse 4 an d16 verse 2.]
\p
\v 22 . So Laban gathered all man of that place [that is very many viz. all his friends or kindred and acquaintance and the principal man of the city according to the custom see Judges 2.1,2 &c. an dh invited the more that Jacob should less date the disannulled the vile plot he had devised to entangle and deceive him withal] a and made a feast.
\p
\v 23 . And it came to pass in the evening that he took his daughter Leah and brought her to him [it seem it was the custom in those days to bring the bride in the bridegrooms bed-chamber being covered with a vial or scarf for her modesties sake but under his pretence Jacob is deluded.] and he went into her.
\p
\v 24 . And Laban gave her Zilpha his hand-maid into Leah his daughter for an hand-maid [ the particle for is put in here out of the following twenty ninth verse it was the custom of those times that the parents giving out their daughters in marriage gave a maid-servant or other woman with her see above chapter 24 verse 59.]
\p
\v 25 . And it happened in the morning and behold it was Leah therefore he said to Laban what is this that thou hast done to me? Have not I served thee for Rachel? Why hast thou deceived me then?
\p
\v 26 . And Laban said it is not practiced thus in this our place [ if it were so Laban ought to have told Jacob so much before-hand and not so basely circumvented and abused him] that the least [Heb. The little one that is the youngest] be given out before the first born.
\p
\v 27 . Fulfill the week of this [that is hold out these seven days of Leah’s wedding feast see the like example of a seven day wedding Judges 14.12 and 15.17 some take this week for a year week] then we shall give thee that also [ viz. after the end of this week as appears by the next verse] for the service which thou shalt serve with me other seven years yet.
\p
\v 28 . And Jacob did so and he fulfilled the week of this then he gave him Rachel his daughter for a wife to him [ though it seems that the liberty of marrying two sisters to one man was not prohibited yet to human laws yet was it repugnant to nature itself and to the express law given afterwards by Moseh Leviticus 18.16.]
\p
\v 29 . And Laban gave unto his daughter Rachel his hand-maid Bilha for a hand-maid to her.
\p
\v 30 . And he went likewise in unto Rachel [Jacob suffers himself to be persuaded to marry two wives together at a time which though it was customary in those days was contrary to Gods institution above chapter 2 verse 24 Malachi 2.15 see likewise the annotations on chapter 4 verse 19] and loved Rachel likewise more than Leah and he served with him seven other years yet.
\p
\v 31 . Now when the Lord saw that Leah was hated [that is she was not so much beloved tendered and cared for as Rachel was see above verse 20 the word hate is sometimes used to love less see Deuteronomy 21.15 Matthew 6.24 and Luke 14.6] he opened her womb [that is he made her fruitful see above chapter 20 on verse 18] but Rachel was barren.
\p
\v 32 . And Leah conceived and bear son and she called him Reuben [behold videte a son or a son of regard as if she would have said behold how God hath given me a son now in my affliction which was that her husband did not love her so well as her sister] for she said because the Lord hath regarded my affliction therefore my husband shall love me now [that is than before.]
\p
\v 33 . And she conceived again and bear a son and she said because the LORD heard that I was hated therefore he hath given me this also and she called his name Simeon [Heb. The word comes from a name that signifies to hearken or to hear excaudate God having heard and granted her prayers and sighing.]
\p
\v 34 . And yet she conceived and bare a son and said now this time my husband shall join himself to me because I have born him here sons therefore [he viz. Jacob ] called his name Levi [that is joined or joining or my joining the reason f this name is given in the text.]
\p
\v 35 . And she conceived again and bear a son and she said this time I will praise the LORD therefore she called his name Judah [Heb. Judah signifying praise thanksgiving confession profession] and she ceased to bear [Heb. she stood from bearing and so below chapter 30.9.]
\c 30
\s Rachel being impatient by her reason of barrenness gives Jacob her hand-maid Bilha who bears him Dan and Naphtali verse 1 &c. Leah likewise ceasing to bear gives Jacob her hand-maid Zilpa who bears him Gad and Aser &c. Reuben finds Dudaim and Leah conceives again and bears Issaschar Zebulon and a daughter Dinah 14 at last Rachel likewise bears Joseph 22 now when Jacob was desirous to return to his own country Laban stays him with a new bargain of wages 5 whereby Jacob contrary to Laban expectation was very richly blessed of God.
\p
\v 1 Now when Rachel saw that she did not bear to Jacob then Rachel envied her sister[or grew jealousy] and she said to Jacob give me children or if not I am dead [that is then I must die for grief heart words of human frailty proceeding from impatience see the like phrase above chapter 20.3.]
\p
\v 2 . Then Jacobs anger was kindled against Rachel then he said am I then in the place of the Lord [that is am I almighty then to make thee fruitful God alone is he that can bestow children see 1Samuel 2.5 Psalms 113.9 and 127.3 the like words Joseph useth below chapter 50.19] who hath withheld the bellies fruit [that is children Deuteronomy 7.13 and 28.4 Psalms 132.11 Isaiah 13.18 thus Christ himself also is called in regard of his human nature Luke 1.42] from thee?
\p
\v 3 . And she said behold there is my hand-maid Bilha go in to her [she rather follows the example of Sarah above chapter 16.2 then the commendable example of Isaac and Rebecca above chapter 25 verse 21] that she may bear up on my knees [that is that I may receive the children into my bosom and hold and tender them as my own see the like phrase below chapter 50.23] and also I may be built out of her [see of this kind of speaking above chapter 16.2.]
\p
\v 4 . So she gave her hand-maid Bilha as wife [see above chapter 16.3] and Jacob went into her.
\p
\v 5 . And Bilha conceived and bear a son to Jacob.
\p
\v 6 . Then said Rachel God hath judged me [that is he hath determined the cause to my advantage see above chapter 15 verse 14] and all likewise heard my voice and hath given me a son therefore she called his name Dan[that is one that pleads a cause or shews the right or pronounceth sentence in judgment.]
\p
\v 7 . And Bilha Rachels hand-maid conceived again and beara second son to Jacob.
\p
\v 8 . Then said Rachel I have wrestled the wrestling of God with my sister[that is a very great and extraordinary hard and difficult ones see above chapter 13 on verse 10 the sense is I and my sister have in a manner striven and sought for getting of children and I got my wish at length beyond my sisters expectation or wrestling of God that is prayers to God wherewith I have wrestled against my sister and through his grace and savor have overcome now ] also I have prevailed and she called his name Naphtali[that is my wrestling.]
\p
\v 9 . Now when Leah saw that she ceased to bear her likewise took her hand-maid Zelda and gave the same to Jacob a wife. [Out of human emulation and not and not contenting herself with former benediction.]
\p
\v 10 . And Zilpa Leah’s hand-maid did bear a son to Jacob.
\p
\v 11 . And there said Leah there comes a company [or there is a company coming that this joined to the former will and a company or a troop of men in the Hebrew there is a word compounded of two as if one should say company come or troop come] and she called his name Gad [that is company troop band of men.]
\p
\v 12 . After that Zilpa Leah’s hand-maid bear the second son of Jacob.
\p
\v 13 . Then said Leah to my luck [ or with my luck viz. is this son to me ] for the daughters that is the women in general] shall count me lucky or fortunate she called him Aser that is Lucky fortunate or one that makes lucky or brings luck.]
\p
\v 14 . And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and he found Dudaim [this word signifies a certain pleasant fruit or flower very acceptable and grateful for smell color and taste such as with us are called the love flower or loveably the Hebrew word here used is no where to be found but here in this place and Cant7.13] and he brought them to his mother Leah then said Rachel to Leah give me I pray for thy sons Dudaim.
\p
\v 15 . And said to heirs it little or small thing that thou hast taken away my husband that thou wilt likewise take my sons Dudaim? Then Rachel said therefore shall he lie with thee this night for thy son Dudaim.
\p
\v 16 . Now when Jacob came out of the fields in the evening Leah went to meet him and said thou shalt come to me for I have surely hired thee [Heb. Hiring I have hired thee [Heb. Hiring I have hired thee that is firmly certainly expressly others for bargained or conditioned have I hired thee] for my son Dudaim and he lay that night with her.
\p
\v 17 . And God heard exaudiebate Leah [of his grace not withstanding her human frailty and weakness] and she conceived and bears the fifth son of Jacob.
\p
\v 18 . Then said Leah god hath given my wages after that I have given my hand-maid o m husband [that is I count my self well rewarded for my son Dudaim since my after that I got children my hand-maid hath yet given me this son of my own body beyond my own expectation for the words after that some read for that ] and she called his name Issachar [Heb. Ischaschar that is there is wages or hire.]
\p
\v 19 . And Leah conceived again and she bear the sixth son to acob.
\p
\v 20 . And Leah saith God hath me he had begifted or presented with a good gift [the Heb. Verb with the noun following gift ] this time my husband shall co-habit with me for I have born him six sons and she called his name Zebulon [Heb. Zebulun that is habitation or co-habitation.]
\p
\v 21 . And after that she bear a daughter and she called her name Dinah [that is a law case or judgment.]
\p
\v 22 . God remembered Rachel likewise [see above chapter 8 on verse 1] and God heard her and opened her womb [see above chapter 20 on verses 18.]
\p
\v 23 . And she conceived and bears a son and she said God hath taken away [Heb. He contracted gathered together drawn in withdrawn] my reproach [which in that time lay open barrenness see 1Samuel 1.6 Isaiah 4.1 Luke 1 verse 21 and that principally for two reasons 1. Because that those that were barren did seem to be excluded from the promise made unto Abraham touching the multiplication of his seed 2. Because they were without hoping that the Messiah who was to proceed out of the seed of Abraham should be one of their posterity.]
\p
\v 24 . And she called his name Joseph [this name seems to respect upon two Hebrew words one used in the former signifying to draw back or to take away and the other here expressed here signifying to add or adjoin ] saying the Lord add me another son thereto.
\p
\v 25 . And it came to pass when Rachel had born Joseph that Jacob said to Laban [viz. when the other seven years of his years were now past and he had quit scores with his father in law ] let me depart that I may go to my place and to my country.
\p
\v 26 . Give my wives and children for the which I have served thee [understand this properly of the wives ] that I may be gone for thou knowest my service which I have served thee [the time of fourteen years with much pains and faithfulness.]
\p
\v 27 . Then said Laban to him if I have found grace in thine eyes [see concerning of such phrase above chapter 18 on verse 3 it is the abrupt speech usual on such occasion and may be supplied and made up with then I pray tarry with me but the wages thou desireth at my hands] I have observed that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.
\p
\v 28 . He said then names me expressly [Heb. Over or upon as who should say lay upon me what wages thou pleases the Hebrew word here doth signify to pierce or bear through to fix or set down and consequently to name expressly down right ] the wages that I shall give thee [or I shall give thee the same.]
\p
\v 29 . Then said he to him thou knowest how I have served thee and thy cattle hath been with me [or what service I have done thee and what thy getting or acquiring hath been by me that is how well thou didst thrive and prosper by my service.]
\p
\v 30 . For the little that thou hadst before me [that is before my coming to thee and so below chapter 32.3] is broken out [see of the propriety of this word above chapter 28 on verse 14] to a multitude and the LORD hath blessed the by my foot [that is by my painful and careful going about thy affairs or ever since I put my foot within thy doors [now then when I shall likewise for my house? [Or do something of my own family?]
\p
\v 31 . And he said what shall I give thee? then Jacob said thou salt give me nothing at all [viz. no wages set or determined by thyself but such only as Gods providence vouchsafe dispose for me ] if thou wilt do me this thing I will keep and feed thy flock again [Heb. I shall return I shall feed &c.]
\p
\v 32 . I will go this day through thy whole flock severing there from all the speckled [that is those marked with small sprinkling as it were ] and spotted [that is marked with broad or large spot or stains ] cattle [understand here only the smaller sort such as sheep lambs goats] & all the brown cattle [or burnt colored the Hebrew word comes from burning heat warmth ] among the lambs and spotted among goats and such or the speckled and such or his shall be my wages[that is those shall be wages which being cast or brought forth by the single colored or all white ones under my keeping shall prove speckled or spotted or brown.]
\p
\v 33 . so my righteousness shall on the day of morrow [that is in the time to come thus the word morrow is often taken in scripture as Exodus 13.14 Deuteronomy 6.20 Joshua 4.6 Matthew 6.34] testify with me [the meaning thereof is when to day or tomorrow that is any time hereafter thou shalt come to view what fell to my wages then it plainly and evidently appear what is my clear and upright due or the contrary ] when thou shalt come over my wages [others when she shall come viz. righteousness for my wages] before thy face and all that is not spckled among the goats and sparkled and spotted among the goats and brown among the lamb that the stolen with me.
\p
\v 34 . Then said Laban Lo yea be it according to thy word.
\p
\v 35 . And he [viz. Laban] severed that same day the ring straked [about the legs in fashion of a band as the propriety of the word here implies] and spotted he-goats and all the speckled and spotted goats all where some white was on an doll the brown among the lambs and he gave them into the hand of the sons.
\p
\v 36 . And he put away of three days [or three days journey] between them and between Jacob [that is he put distance between them of three days journey understand between the flock of Labans sons and the rest which Jacob kept lest in any wise the white ones might come to the intermixed with the spotted or brown.] and Jacob kept pascebat the rest of Labans flock.
\p
\v 37 . Then Jacob took him rods [or stick wands] of green [or fresh] polar-wood and of hazel and of chestnuts and he peeled thereon white strakes making bear the white which was on the rods [this Jacob did by the instinct and direction of God. See below chapter 31 verse 9 thus God took care for Jacob that Laban should not let him return home empty see below chapter 31 verse 42.]
\p
\v 38 . And he laid these rods which he had peeled in the gutters an din the water-though where the flock came to drink over against the flock and they were heated [that is being heated they conceived] when they came to drink.
\p
\v 39 . When the flock then was heated by or with or at the rods the flock lambed or brought forth straked [viz. on the legs as above verse 35] speckled and brown ones.
\p
\v 40 . Then Jacob severed the lambs [or various colors] and he turned the face of the flock upon the speckled all the brown among Labans flock [these he caused to go before and the other to follow that they might have them in their sight when they went a rutting] and he put his flocks apart and he set them they should bring forth their like that is single colored ones.]
\p
\v 41 . and it happened all the time when the flock of the prime lings [that is these are cast into the spring time of the year being according as the Hebrew word implies well girt as it were that is firm and compact of body and strength] was heated then Jacob put the rods in the gutters before the eyes of the flock that they might be heated by the rods.
\p
\v 42 . But when the flock was heated late [that is in the fall of the year when they proved weak and feeble of the body] then he put them not so that the late lings became Labans and the primelings Jacobs.
\p
\v 43 . And that man brake forth [see above chapter 18 verse 14] very much in abundance [Heb. Much] and he had many flocks and maid-servants and men-servants and camels and asses.
\c 31
\s Jacob observing Labans envy departs with all he hath on Gods command and with the consent of his wives without Labans privity towards the land of Canaan and Rachel steals her fathers idols verse 1&c. Laban hearing of it pursues Jacob and overtake him at mount Gilead where he is warned not to deal otherwise then friendly with him nevertheless he taxeth him sharply for this secret departure and the stealing away of the idols 22. Jacob excuseth himself and when Laban could find his idols nowhere Jacob rebukes him vehemently upbraiding him with all the discourtness he had suffered as his hands 31 how be it at last they make a covenant between them and part as under in peace 34.
\p
\v 1 Then heard the words of Labans sons saying Jacob hath taken away all that was our fathers and that of which our fathers he hath made up all his glory [that is all this wealth which usually is attached with honor and glory.]
\p
\v 2 . Jacob likewise looked at the face of Laban and behold that was not towards him as yesterday [that is as formerly it was not towards him as yesterday [that I as formerly it was thus the same words are likewise tank below verse 5 and Exodus 4.10 and 5.7,8 an 21.29 and Joshua 3.4 an d4.18 &c.]
\p
\v 3 . And the Lord said to Jacob return to the land of thy fathers [that is the land of Canaan which I promised to thy father Isaac and grandfather Abraham although as yet they possess nothing in it but the field and the cave wherein Sarah was buried] and thy kindred and I will be with thee [see above chapter 21.2 and 6.24item below 32.9 where Jacob doth declare these words.]
\p
\v 4 . Then Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field of his flock [there to confer with them about this matter without neglect of his calling and with more freedom and secrecy.]
\p
\v 5 . And he said to them I see your fathers face that it is not towards name as yesterday & ere yesterday yet the God of my fathers [ see above chapter 28.13] hath been with me [that is he appeared to me and commanded me to return into my own country see below verse 13.]
\p
\v 6 . And ye know that I have served your father with all my might [as well of the mind with care and forecast as of the body by watching running drudging compare below verse 40 and 42.]
\p
\v 7 . But your father hath dealt deceitfully with me [others hath mocked me] and hath changed my wages ten times [that oftentimes thus the word ten is often or frequently below verse 41 Leviticus 26.26 Numbers 14.22 and 1Samuel 1.8 Job 19.3] yet God hath not permitted him to do me ill.
\p
\v 8 . whenever h said thus the speckled shall be thy wages then all the flock lambed or brought forth and speckled and whenever he said thus the ring straked shall be thy wages the flock lambed straked ones [observe here that the condition which Jacob made with Laban above chapter 30.32 were often altered through Labans greediness and the alteration long born through Jacobs meekness.]
\p
\v 9 . Thus God withdraw all the cattle from your father and gave it to me [hence it appears that all the practice of Jacob did not proceed from any sinister and deceitful device of Jacob but from gods direction.]
\p
\v 10 . and it happened at what time the flock was heated that I lifted up my eyes an did swain the dream [see above verse 5] and behold the he-goat [others rams it may be understood of both] which backed the flock were stracked speckled and bail-spotted [that is such a had spots of about the bigness and color of common hailstones distinguished from the speckled which had black stains upon the white skins.]
\p
\v 11 . And the angel of God [understand the LORD Jesus Christ as appears above verse 5 and below verse 13] said to me in the dream Jacob and I said see here I am.
\p
\v 12 . Do but lift up thy eyes and behold the he goats which back the flock are straked and hail-spotted for I have seen all that Laban doth to thee.
\p
\v 13 . I am the God of Bethel [which did appear to thee at Bethel and promised to be with thee to keep thee and to bring thee back into Canaan] there thou didst set up the monuments where thou vowedst me a vow get thee up depart out of this land and return into the land of thy kindred [see above verse 3 and below verse 18.]
\p
\v 14 . Then answered Rachel and Leah and said unto him is there a share yet for us or inheritance in our father’s house? [They imply none at all seeing he doth grudge the conditioned wages having so often changed and altered them.]
\p
\v 15 . Are we not counted strangers of him?[ he hath not put us forth like daughters with honest dowries but thrust us forth like servants for hired wages]for he hath sold us [to wit for thy fourteen years service which indeed was a kind of sale] and he hath likewise still consumed or eaten up [Heb. Eating eaten that is continually and all along] our money [by this money they understand the fruit and gain of Jacobs service which Laban not only kept for them but also consumed and spent it for himself without imparting ought of it unto them.]
\p
\v 16 . For the riches or wealth God hath withdrawn from our fathers [see above on verse 9] the same is ours and ours sons/ [that is children as frequently] now do all what God hath said unto thee.
\p
\v 17 . Then Jacob got himself up and put his sons [children] and his wives upon the camels.
\p
\v 18 . And he led away all his cattle and all his substance that he had gotten the cattle which he possess [Heb. Cattle of his possession ] which he had gotten at Paddan Aram [see above chapter 25.20] for to come to Isaac his father the land of Canaan.
\p
\v 19 . Laban now was going to share his sheep then Rachel stole his fathers Teraphram which her father had [ the teraphrim were a sort of image of the shape of men 1Samuel 19.13,18 for idols Genesis 31.30,32 to enquire of them of things to come Ezechiah 21.21 and by whom they were received the devil answer true or false Zachariah 10.2 of the teraphims you may likewise see Judges 17.5 and 18.14,17,18,20 1Samuel 15.15 ,23 and 2Kings 23.24 and Hosiah 3.4 these teraphims Laban through otherwise the true God was not unknown to him above chapter 30 verse 7 and in this chapter verse 24 and 9 honored with divine worship endeavoring thus to serve God and the idols together or altogether to keep under the supress the worship of god through idoalatry in unrighteousness this is the first scripture makes mention of idols although they were in use long before.]
\p
\v 20 . And Jacob stole himself away from the heart of Laban of Syrian [that is he got away secretly and stealingly as it were without Laban leave and privity as the following words declare and verse 26 and 27 in the sense the like phrase is also used 2Samuel 19.3 but in another sense 2Samuel 15.6 the reason and ground of his sudden and private withdrawing seemed to have been an instinct and express command from God verse 13] in as much as he had not made it known to him that he fled.
\p
\v 21 . And he fled and all that was his and he got him up and passed over the river [viz. Phrath or Euphrats running between Chaldea and Canaan above chapter 2.14and 15.18 without opposition of proper name the same is called the river for its greatness and same sake both here and Exodus 23.31 Joshua24.2,3&c.] and he set his face [or directed or put that is he purposed and resolved to take away homewards see Jeremiah 50.5 and Luke 19.51 and 53] to mount Gilead [lying behind Phenicia beyond Jordan and bordering on mount Libanus at the bottom of his mount here lay a very precious country likewise called Gilead being very fruitful and full of pasture below chapter 37.25 Deuteronomy 34.1 Jeremiah 8.22 and 22.6 this ;land was afterwards taken from the Amorites and did fall in partition to the tribes of Gad and Reuben the tribe of Manasseh see Numbers 32.1 &c. Deuteronomy 3.12,13,15,16 Joshua 13.8,9,10,11 &c.]
\p
\v 22 . And the third day news was brought to Laban [whose stock was kept at three days from Jacobs above chapter 30.36] that Jacob was fled.
\p
\v 23 . Then he took his brethren with him [that is some of the kindred and kinsmen and so in the sequel] and pursued after him a way f seven days [that is seven days journey see above chapter 30 verses 36] and he apprehended him on mount Gilead.
\p
\v 24 . Yet God came to Laban [viz. before he took Jacob or was come up to him ] the Syrian in a dream by night [ see chapter 20 on verse 3] and he said unto him take heed that thou speak not with Jacob either good or ill [Heb. From good to the bad that is thou shalt go about to withdraw him from his journey by any fair soul means but suffers him to march on and perform it compare above chapter 24.50.]
\p
\v 25 . And Laban overtook Jacob now had pitched his tent [Heb. Fastened fixed] on that mount Laban also with his brethren pitched his on the Gilead.
\p
\v 26 . Then said Laban to Jacob what hast thou done that thou hast stolen thyself away from my heart [see above verse 20] and carried my daughters away as captives taken with the sword? [That is such as are carried away by force against their will which Laban wrongfully lays to Jacobs charge seeing above verse 14, 15, and 16.]
\p
\v 27 . Why art thou fled secretly [wherefore didst thou hide thyself flee?] andhast stolen thee away from me? [That is why didst thou depart from me in such a stealing manner without my knowledge and consent? compare this with verse 20 before others read why hast thou stolen from me [viz. my own or robbed me of my own? And hast not acquainted me with it that I might have conducted thee see above chapter 18 on verse 16] with joy with songs with the drum with the harp? [See above Genesis 4 on verse 21.]
\p
\v 28 . Neither hast thou permitted me to kiss [see above chapter 29 on verse 13] my sons my daughters now thou hast don foolishly so doing.
\p
\v 29 . It were in power of my hand to do ill but thy father God spake to me yester night saying take heed of speaking with Jacob either good or bad [see above on verse 24.]
\p
\v 30 . And now since thou wouldst need to depart [Heb. Art going gone] for thou wast so disastrous [Heb. Desiring desirest] after the fathers house why hast thou stolen away my God? [A strange blindness in Laban that he held his idol for God which nevertheless according to his own opinion could be stolen away compare above verse 19.]
\p
\v 31 . Then answered Jacob and said to Laban because I was afraid for I said [viz. with myself that is I thought or considered see above chapter 20.11 others I say to my wives or to my family ] I lest peradventure thou force away thy daughters from me [Heb. From with me.]
\p
\v 32 . With whom thou shalt find thy God let him not live discover or make known discern [Heb. Make known for thee see above chapter 12 on verse 1] before our brethren what is with me [viz. of thy goods] and take it to thee for Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
\p
\v 33 . Then Laban went into Jacobs tent and into Leah’s tent and into both the hands maids tents and he found nothing and when he was gone out of Leah’s tent he came into Rachel’s tent.
\p
\v 34 . but Rachel had taken the terahims and she had put them in the camels saddle furniture [others litter] and she sate upon the same and Laban felt all the tents over and he found nothing.
\p
\v 35 . and he said to her father let not anger kindle in my Lords eyes [that is let it not provoke my Lords displeasure which discovers itself most readily in the eyes] that I cannot rise up before thy face for it goeth with me after manner of women [Heb. The way of women is upon me] but he searched and found not the teraphins.
\p
\v 36 . Then Jacob grew and increased and contended with Laban and Jacob answered and said to Laban what is my trespass? What is my sin? That thou hast so hotly pursued me? [Heb. That thou doth often times signify to pursue one with a burning eager fierce and hostile mind as 1Samuel 17.53 Psalms 10.2 Lamentations 4.19.]
\p
\v 37 . When thou feltest all my household staff [ Heb. All my vessels and so by and by of all the vessels of thy house] why hast thou found of all the vessels of thy house? Lay it down here before my brethren and thy brethren and let them judge between us both.
\p
\v 38 . These twenty years have I been with thee thy ewes and thy goats have not miscarried and the rams of thy flock I have not eaten.
\p
\v 39 . The torn I have not brought to thee I made amends for or expiated it or thou hast required it at my hand whether it was stolen by day or stolen by night [that Jacob was made to make good to Laban what was torn by the wild beast was unjust and contrary to the law Exodus 2.13.]
\p
\v 40 . I was that by day the heat consumed me and the frost by night and my sleep retired from my eyes [others fled or ran like the phrase here we have Esther chapter 6.1.]
\p
\v 41 . I have been twenty years now in thy house Heb. These were twenty years to me in thy house] I have served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters and six years for thy flock[that is for such a portion of thy flock as fall to my share by the wages conditioned on between us] and thou hast changed my wages ten times [see above on verse 7.]
\p
\v 42 . Where it not that God of my father the God of Abraham and fear of Isaac [that is the same God whom my father Isaac serves with so much fear and reverence thus God is called our fear Isaiah 8.13by reason of the filial awe and fear we ought to stand in before him.] hath been with me assuredly thou wouldst have sent me now empty away God hath looked upon the affliction and the labor of my hands [the looking on or regarding of God betoken his present mercy and assistance as above chapter 16.13 and 29.32 Exodus 3.7,9 Psalms 31.8 and here or his judgments and execution of it above chapter 11.5 and 1Chronicles 12.17&c.] and rebuked thee yester night.
\p
\v 43 . Then Laban answered and said unto Jacob these daughters are my daughters and these sons are my sons and this flock is my flock ye all what thou sest is mine and what should I do this day to these my daughters?[that is how should I be able to go about to hurt or trouble them seeing they are my own flesh and blood he now makes shew of seeking friendship seeing he was not able to do any hurt or mischief to Jacob and his this was the special over ruling of our Lord who had appeared unto Laban for this very end.] or to their sons other children whom they bear?
\p
\v 44 . Now then come let us make a covenant [see above chapter 15 on verse 18] I and thou that it may be for a witness between me and between thee.
\p
\v 45 . Then Jacob took a stone [shewing thereby that letting pass by all former complaints he was very ready to accept of and enter into the covenant offered] and he raised it for a monument.
\p
\v 46 . And Jacob said to his brethren [kinsmen friends that were with him see above verse 32 and 37 and below verse 54] gather stones and they took stones and made an heap and they did eat thereupon thy heap [viz. after the making and establishing of the covenant.]
\p
\v 47 . And Laban called it Jegar Sehadutha [that is in the Syrian language Labans own heap of witness regarding the covenant which they made together]but Jacob called the same thing which the former Syrians mane did for Jacob being an Hebrew would likewise give this heap a name in his own language.]
\p
\v 48 . Then Laban said this heap be a witness today between me and between thee therefore they called the name of it Gilead.
\p
\v 49 . And Mizpa [Heb. Mitzpah that is a place of inspection or surveying or guard watch being that as followeth God was to have that care and oversight how this covenant should be observed] because he said the LORD take inspection in sight between and between thee when he shall be hid the one from the other[Heb. The man from his neighbor or friend [that is when we shall be so far parted a doubt of sight one another.]
\p
\v 50 . If thou afflict or oppress my daughters and if thou take wives above my daughters nobody is with us [that is there is none else with us to bear witness and to punish the transgressor others none shall be with us viz. when we are parted once as under but God &c.] behold God shall be witness between me and between thee.
\p
\v 51 . Laban said moreover to Jacob behold there is this same heap and behold there is this monument which I have cats upon between me and between thee.
\p
\v 52 . This same heap be witness and this monument he witness that I shall not come to thee passing by this heap[others if I &c. viz. concerning myself to be wronged and passing by here that I shall not do it in any hostile but in a friendly way and thou in like manner or otherwise thus in case it be I that pass here to thee ward that I shall not do it for evil nor thou neither] and that thou shall not come to passing by this heap and monument of evil.
\p
\v 53 . The God of Nahor the God of their father judge between us [he intermixeth here the God of Abraham the only true God with the idols which Terah Nahor and Abraham himself before his conversion he served in Chaldea Joshua 24.2not only to comply a little with Jacob but also like an idolatrous dissembler to halt on both sides others hold that Laban spake right out of the idolatrous manner the Gods of Abraham and the God of Nahor of their father &c. by which words he should reproach Jacob that he had forsaken religion of his forefathers and that in opposition thereunto there is put down Jacobs oath apart likewise which he had made by there God alone] and Jacob swear by the fear of his father Isaac [see above verse 42.]
\p
\v 54 . Then did Jacob slay a slaying [that is beast fit for slaughter preparing for the ensuring joyful feast the Hebrew word indeed is used for offering sacrifice but for slaying towards a feast likewise as 1Samuel 28.24 and 1Kings 1.9 2Chronicles 18.27&c.] on that mount and he invited his brethren for to eat bread [that is to the feast he had made to take their repast with him see below chapter 27.25 Exodus 18.12 and 2Kings 6.22 and Luke 14.1 &c.] and they did eat bread overnight on that mountain.
\p
\v 55 .and Laban raised early up in the morning and kissed [see above chapter 29 on verse 11] his sons and his daughters and blessed them and Laban went his way and returned to his place [by Labans blessings is to be understood that he wished them all happiness and posterity at their parting as it was the received custom when people met thus to greet one another only at parting but in arriving see below chapter 47.7,10 and Ruth 2.4 1samuel 8.10.]
\c 32
\s Jacob being encouraged by having met the host of the holy angels sends messenger towards his brother Esau verse 1 &c. but understanding that he was marching down to him with a great number of men he divides his people and cattle for fears in two hands and prays to God in a very server and humble manner for succor and deliverance verse 6 then he sends presents before to Esau with certain order and charge and gets his wives and children over the food by night13 but stays behind himself on his side where God wrestled with him gives him the name Israel blesseth him and tucheth his thigh so that he halted 24.
\p
\v 1 Jacob also went his way and the angels of God met him [the more to assure God f Jacobs’s presence and assistance.]
\p
\v 2 . And Jacob said as he saw them this is Gods camp of hosts or a double camp of host whether the angels had divided themselves in two leagues for Jacob to pass between them both or that the one league consisted on angels and the other on Jacobs retinue hereabout there was a city afterwards which was called by the name of Mahanaim Joshua 13.26 and 21.38.]
\p
\v 3 . And Jacob sent forth messengers before his face [that is before his arrival or before he should come thither viz. for to prepare the way of regain his brothers favor the like phrase we find also Malachi 3..1 Matthew 11.10 Luke 9.52 and 10.1] to his brother Esau unto the land of Seir [see above chapter 14.6] the countries of Edom [viz. Idumea bordering on the south end of Judea and having its name from Esau who is likewise called Edom above chapter 25.30 and was now dwelling in the country below chapter 36 verse 8 having driven out thence the former inhabitants the Horites Deuteronomy 2.12,22.]
\p
\v 4 . And he charged hem saying thus shall ye say to my Lord [though Jacob himself was the Lord of Esau by right of the purchase of his primogeniture above chapter 27.29 nevertheless he calls his brother by the title keeping the right to himself the better to recover his favor and friendship by his submissive carriage the rather because he was not as yet put into possession of his right which chiefly regarded the time to come thus did David likewise towards Saul 1Samuel 24 verse 7,9 and chapter 25 throughout] to Esau thus saith Jacob thy servant I have dwelt as a stranger or sojourned with Laban and tarried there till now.
\p
\v 5 . And I have oxen asses sheep and men-servant and maid-servants and I have sent to inform my Lord [viz. of my coming and condition] that I may find grace in thy eyes [see above chapter 18 verse 3 he sues for friendship partly to procure and amnesty or oblivion of all former distaste and partly that he may pass safely and peaceable through the country.]
\p
\v 6 . And the messengers came back to Jacob saying we are come to thy brother Esau and he likewise is marching to meet thee and four hundred men with him [doubtless armed as may be gathered verse 8 and 11.]
\p
\v 7 . Jacob was so afraid and distressed him [out of human frailty viz. because the messengers brought no other news back from Esau then that he was coming against him with four hundred men without any other message] and he divided that people that was with him and the sheep and the oxen and the camels in two host.
\p
\v 8 . For he said Esau comes upon one host and smites then shall the remaining host escape [Heb. He to or for escaping or saving.]
\p
\v 9 . Moreover Jacob said O God [Jacob being in distress he doth not call upon the hosts of the angels whom he had seen so lately before but hath his recourse to the true God alone] for my father [that is grandfather here] Abraham and God of my father Isaac O LORD that hast said unto me return unto thy country and to thy kindred and I will deal well by thee.
\p
\v 10 . I am less than all this faithfulness [Heb. Truth see above chapter 24.27] which thou hast performed to thy servant [that is l am altogether unworthy of good hast shewed me already and that now am craving of thee casting my self and relying only upon thy mercy and grace and not all upon any worth or merits of my own ] for past over this Jordan [see above chapter 13.10 ] with my staff [understand a plain walking staff or shepherds crooked staff hereby Jacob acknowledgeth the mean and poor condition he was in formerly ] and now I am become two hosts.
\p
\v 11 . Rescue me I pray out of my brothers hand out of the hand of Esau for I am afraid of him lest he come and smite me the mother with the sons [or upon the sons a phrase most lively representing the tenderness of a mother when seeing her children in distress the spares not her own body nor life to hazard the same for the children preservation by interposing herself even to be massacred together with and upon them see Hosea 10.14.]
\p
\v 12 . Thou said indeed I will assuredly do well by thee [Heb. Well doing do well &c.] and I will put thy seed as the sand of the sea which can not be numbered by any reason of the multitude.
\p
\v 13 . And he overnighter there that same night and he took of that which came into his hand a gift for Esau his brother [that is he took some haste of all the cattle for a present to his brother being surprised partly by the approaching night and partly by fear of instant danger that he could not stand upon it to make a curious choice others of that which was come to him that is of that which he had acquired and gotten.]
\p
\v 14 . Two hundred goats and twenty he-goats two hundred ewes and twenty rams.
\p
\v 15 . Two hundred milch camel with their colt [Heb. Sons ] forty cowes and ten bulls twenty she-asses and ten young asses [or asse colt.]
\p
\v 16 . And he gave and put them into the hands of his servants [a notable present indeed of so many hundred beasts and small and great of different sort which would come to a round price nowadays] each flock apart [Heb. Flock alone by itself see the like expression above chapter 7 on verse 2] and he said to his servants pass ye over before my face and put space room that give free doom to breathe this served that his present being everyone viewed apart by his brother Esau it might make the better shew and by little and little usage his violent humor see below verse 20] between flock and between flock.
\p
\v 17 . And he charged the first [to wit by the savant that led the first and foremost of the flock or drove so in the sequel of the second and third &c.] saying when my brother Esau shall meet thee and ask thee saying whose art thou? And wither dost thou go? And whose are these before thy face? [That is the beast thou art driving before thee or which are passing on before thee.]
\p
\v 18 . Then thou shalt say that is a present of thy servant Jacob sent to my Lord to Esau and also himself is also behind us [this he added of purpose that his brother should not think he was afraid to come his way to avoid him.]
\p
\v 19 . And he charged likewise teh second and the third and all that went after the flock or droves saying after his same word [that is according to what I said before] shall ye speak to Esau when ye shall find him.
\p
\v 20 . And ye shall likewise say behold thy servant is behind us for he said [viz. by himself that is thought conceived see above chapter 20 on verse 11] I shall reconcile his face [that is appease his wrath which commonly is seen much in the face see Proverbs 21.14] with his present that goes before my face and after that I shall I see his face peradventure he will accept my face [this kind of expression being taken in the good sense signifies to be favorable to another and to do him good out of a friendly and rational observation of some good in him and it is spoken of God when of his mere mercy and grace he looked favorable upon the good in any which came from him alone into him above chapter 19.21 an d of men when for any considerable reason they are favorable to their neighbor as here and 1samuel 25.35 2Kings 3.14.]
\p
\v 21 . Thus the present went on before his face yet himself overnighter that the camp.
\p
\v 22 . And he arose in that same night and he took his two wives and his two maid-servants and his eleven children and he passed over Ferry or ford wading place of Jabbok [this is the name of the brook or river springing by Rabba the metropolis of the Ammorites and issuing into Jordan beneath the sea of Galilee see Numbers 21.24 Deuteronomy 2.37 and chapter 3.16 Joshua 12.2 Judges 11.13.]
\p
\v 23 . And he took them and he made them pass over that brook and he made pass over what he had.
\p
\v 24 . Yet was lest behind alone [that is he alone remained on this side of the brook by mount Gilead for to pray to God in private] and a man [that is the son of God who appeared in the shape of men here as may be gathered by verse 28 and 30 &c. and Hosea 12.3, 4] wrestled with him until the dawning arose.
\p
\v 25 . And when he saw that he could not prevail against him [ this is said after the manner of men the Lord complying with human infirmity suffered himself to be overcome to assure Jacob of good issue about the instant danger only he gave him a touch for to teach him to be sensible and mindful still of his own weakness] he touched or ht the joint of the thigh [others the hollow or pane blade plate] so that he joints of Jacob s thigh was wrung about when he wrestled with him.
\p
\v 26 . And he said let me go for the dawning has risen up but he said I will not let thee go unless thou bless me [as beginning to feel and apprehend now that he wrestled not with a man but with one far surpassing therefore it is that desireth to be blessed by him.]
\p
\v 27 . And he said to him how is thy name?[this God doth not ask as if the name of Jacob was unknown to him but to get occasion thereby of changing his name for an everlasting remembrance o this wrestling ] and he said Jacob.
\p
\v 28 . Then said he thy name shall not be called Jacob hence forth [not implies as much here as not only or not so often not so much for he is likewise called Jacob afterwards but the posterity of the most part of the name here given see the like manner of speaking 1Samuel 8.7John 7.16 and 1Corinthians 1.17 and John 3.18] but Israel [that is a prince of God or one having princely power with God or one having the princely power with God as appears by the following words this name God gives unto Jacob the second time below chapter 35.10 ] for thou carried thyself prince like with God [having undergone the combated which God put him too and overcome] and with men [viz. first with Esau and afterwards with Laban and now being about to enter the lifts again with Esau ] and hast overcome or prevailed.
\p
\v 29 . And Jacob asked and said let me know thy name I pray and he said wherefore dest ask thou ask thou for my name? [this is a question of refusal as Judges 13.17,18 he refuseth to reveal his name unto him to assure him the more that he had not wrestled with a man] and he blessed him there [this was that which Jacob had desireth before verse 26 and whereby he was now fully assured that God had appeared to him see the next verse.]
\p
\v 30 . And Jacob called the name of that place Pinal [Gods face or aspect see 1 Kings21.25 in the sequel it is Pnuel] for said he I have seen God face to face [not with divine essence but in such a shape whereby he hath more clearly manifested himself unto me then ever before] and my soul hath been rescued [and he admireth that he died not in having seen God see above chapter 16 on verse 13 compare Exodus 20.19 Judges 6.22,23 and 13.22.]
\p
\v 31 . And the sun arose to him when he was sat Pnuel and he was halting on his thigh.
\p
\v 32 . Therefore the children of Israel do not eat the distorted sinew which upon the joint of the thigh to this day [ distorted or dislocated shrunk wrung wrestled that is that which hath lost its vigor ands dulled or sprained or slept and hath in a manner forgot its proper place being wrung & wrestled out of it the Jews call this is new likewise thus in the beast according to what happened here to Jacob others the sinew leaned on for passing off from the pane or hallow of Oscar unto the thigh or being leaned on or leaning thereon from the Oscar as for the not eating of the sinew there is to be understood the flesh also about the sinew and this they did not out of superstition or conceit to do God service thereby but in remembrance only of what that wonderful combated and the victory of Jacob and his posterity upon it the practice hereof was useful before the coming of the Messiah but since that cannot be used anymore without superstition] because he had touched the joint of Jacobs thigh [that is touching it had hurt the same ] on the distorted sinew.
\c 33
\s Jacob having marshaled his wives and children Goethe to meet his brother verse 1 &c. who demeans himself courteously to him and his wives and his children 4 and after the civil refusal and reply dot accept of Jacobs presents parting thus in a friendly manner 8 Jacob comes to Succoth and from thence Sichem where he pitched his tents and builts an altar to the Lord 17.
\p
\v 1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked and behold Esau came and four hundred men with him than he divided the children under Leah and under Rachel and under two maidservants.
\p
\v 2 . And he put the maid-servants and their children before and Leah and her children were behind but Rachel and Joseph were hindmost [the best beloved he placeth hindmost and lastest that if the foremost were hurt they might escape yet in some sort see above chapter 32.7,8.]
\p
\v 3 . And he past on before their face and he bowed himself [see above chapter 18 verse 2] seven times [that is several times a certain number for an uncertain see Leviticus 26 on verse 8] down to the ground until he came to his brother.
\p
\v 4 . Then Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell upon his neck and kissed him [see above chapter 29 on verse 11] and they wept [this often happen at the meeting of the friend as here and above chapter 29.11 and below chapter 43.30 an d46.29 or at parting Ruth 1.14 Acts 20.37.]
\p
\v 5 . After that he lifted up his eyes and saw the wives and the children and said who these by thee are? And he said the children whom God graciously bestowed upon thy servant.
\p
\v 6 . Then the maid servant drew near they and their children and they bowed themselves down.
\p
\v 7 . And Leah too came on with her children and they bowed down themselves and after that Joseph slept on [others he was made and bid to approach being but about six years of ages at this time] and Rachel bowed down them.
\p
\v 8 . And he said for whom is all this host to thee that I met? [Or what is this entire host to thee &c. that is what serves it for? What dost thou mean by it? He had doubtless understood it already by the servant that led or drive the flock but he takes occasion that upon Jacobs own reply and he may courteously wave he accepting of I resents ] and he said for to find grace in the eyes of my Lord.
\p
\v 9 . But Esau said I have stored of it my brother [ that is I have store enough myself of all this here we see Gods promise made good to him above chapter 27.39] be it thine what thou hast [keep thou hast for thy thy own self.]
\p
\v 10 . Then said Jacob Nay I pray if now I have found grace itchy eyes then take my present at my hand therefore because I have seen the face of God [as if he should say even as the favor of God doth much revive and comfort a man so do I myself much cleared by this thy kind and peaceable meeting of me holding the same for a sure pledge of Gods favor to me ward as if God himself has appeared thus favorable and friendly unto me ] and thou hast taken thou pleasure in me [others take pleasure in or be it pleased with me I pray or so friendly or kindly hast thou received me.]
\p
\v 11 . Take I pray my blessings [that is the present which is called thus Joshua 15.19 an d1Samuel 25.7 and 30.26 an d2kings 5.15 and 2Corinthians 9.5,6 in regard that the same consists in things which through Gods bountiful blessing are bestowed on men and are given away with appreciation of all happiness and received with thankfulness and reciprocal wishes of welfare] which is brought to thee because God graciously gave it to me and because I have of all and he pressed him so that he took it.
\p
\v 12 . And he said [Viz. Esau] let us travel and March on and did will march before thee [that is by thee over against or with are along with thee in thy company accommodating myself to thy pace and progress although my people be more expedite fresh and strong then thane.]
\p
\v 13 . But he [viz. Jacob] said to him my Lord knows that these children are tender [Reuben the eldest was about twelve or thirteen years of age then] and that I have ewes and comes giving suck [or with young] by me [or upon me that is under my care custody] if one should over drive them but one day the whole flock or drove would die.
\p
\v 14 . Let my Lord pass by and I pray before the face of his servants and I shall at my ease [or softly at leisure] apply myself as leader according to the gate or pace [Heb. Foot and so in the sequel] of the business or work [thus Jacob calls his cattle the providing and tending whereof was his daily task and employment so likewise Exodus 22.8 and 36.6] which is before my face and according to the gate of these children until I come o my Lord to Sire.
\p
\v 15 . And Esau said let me I pray put some of this people by thee that is with me and he said to what end that? let me find grace in my Lord eyes [that is shew me this favor and do that which I desire without leaving any of thy men with now.]
\p
\v 16 . So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
\p
\v 17 . But Jacob journeyed to Succoth [not so called yet at that time but afterwards as appears by what followeth at the end of this verse] and he built him an house and made huts for his cattle and therefore he called the name of that place Succoth [huts tents booths this place lay beyond Jordan in the tribe of Gad not afar from Pnuel see Joshua 13.27andJudges 8.5,14,15 another Succoth we read of Exodus 12.37.]
\p
\v 18 . And Jacob came safe [Heb. Salem which others take to be the name of the city by the river Jordan about the place where John baptized afterwards and so distinct from another Salem called afterwards Jerusalem see above chapter 14.18 called Psalms 76.3.] to the city of Sichem [se above chapter 12.6] which is in the land of Canaan when he came from Paddan Aram and he camped himself in the faceoff the city [or right be fore the city.]
\p
\v 19 . And he bought a part of the field wherein he had extended his tent from the hand of the sons of Hemor [Heb. Cahmor Acts 7.16 he is called emmor ] the father of Sichem for an hundred pieces of money[ called lambs the coin bearing the stamp and figure of lamb see Joshua 24.32 Job 42.11 and compare Acts 7.16 others do understand natural sheep and that he had so many for that ice of ground it having likewise been the custom to buy and sell by such exchanging and trucking of commodities.]
\p
\v 20 . And he erected an altar there [to offerings of thanksgiving and to exercise the whole public worship and service of God there according to the example of his father see above chapter 12.7 and 13.18] and called the same the God of Israel it is God [ Heb. El Elohe Israel.]
\c 34
\s Dina being gone forth to see the daughters of the country comes to the abased and defiled by Sichem son of the Lord of that country verse1 &c. who loves her and desireth to marry her whereupon his father conferring with Jacob and his sons the sons of Jacob give him a deceitful answer making the condition that all the males of the Sichemites should be circumcised 6 that being yielded unto and performed by Hemor Sichem and their subjects while they lay in the pain of circumcision they are surprised and murdered by Simeon and Levi the city plundered by Jacobs sons and women an children carried away captive 18 for which Jacob is exceedingly troubled and afraid.
\p
\v 1 And Dinah the daughter of Leah whom she had born to Jacob went forth [viz.from the place where their parents dwelt which was near Sichem above chapter 33.18 where she might have done better to have stayed Titus 2.5 the rather that she was about fourteen years of age yet] for to see or visit the daughters of that country[some do hold that about this time there was kept some great feast or fair or some such like solemnly at Sichem with a great concourse of people.]
\p
\v 2 . Sichem now Hemors the Hevites [see above chapter 10 on verse 17]] the prince of the country his son saw her and he took her and lay with her and forced her [the Hebrew word doth properly signify to oppress or bumble debase and so the holy scripture called the abusing and defiling of women Judges 19.4 2Samuel 13.14.]
\p
\v 3 . And his soul did cleave to Dinah Jacobs daughter [that is his heart, mind desire and delight depended all on her having no other object in a manner ] and he loved the young maid and space according to the heart of the heart of the young maid [that is whatever he taught might be pleasing and acceptable unto her to practice comfort her she being doubtless much more troubled and perplexed at it that she was so unaware overtaken thus see the like kind of expression below chapter 50.21 Judges 19.3 Isaiah 40.2 Hosea 2.13.]
\p
\v 4 . Sichem speaketh likewise to his father hemor saying take me this daughter to be wife [an example among very heathen people that children ought to marry with the consent and the direction of their parents.
\p
\v 5 . When Jacob heard that he had defiled his daughter Dinah his sons were with the cattle in the fields then and Jacob held his peace till they came.
\p
\v 6 . And Hemor Sichems father went forth unto Jacob to speak with him.
\p
\v 7 . And the sons of Jacob came forth to the fields when they heard this and it pained those men and they were much incensed [Heb. And it wrath namely incensed them much see above chapter 4 verse 5,6] for that he had practiced folly [or a base part or baseness falling off madness this word betoken such a sin as proceeding out of a base and shameless lust is committed not against Gods commandments but even against civil honesty and sometimes against nature itself being the cause of great scandal and offence ending in shame and confusion compare Deuteronomy 22.21 Joshua 7.15 Judges 19.40 and 20.6 2Samuel 13.12] in Israel [that is in or against the house of Israel or the people of God which issued from Jacob which ought not to be done thus [or thus it is not done that is this was not the manner nor ought to be practiced among them see the like phrase chapter 20.9.]
\p
\v 8 . Then Hemor spake with them saying my son Sichem soul is enormared with your daughter give her him to wife I pray.
\p
\v 9 . And ally yourselves with us [ or marry yours &c. so Deuteronomy 7.3] give us your daughters [viz. in marriage to our sons so below chapter 38.14 Deuteronomy 7.3 &c.]and take for you our daughters [viz. in marriage to your sons see above chapter 19 on verse 14.]
\p
\v 10 . And dwell with us and the land shall be before your faces [ see above chapter 13 on verse 9] dwell and traffic therein and put yourselves possessor therein [or take firm possession therein or maintain yourselves therein.]
\p
\v 11 . And Sichem said to her father [ viz. Dinahs ] and to her brethren let me findgracein your eyes [see above chapter 18 on verse 3] and what ye shall say unto me I will give.
\p
\v 12 . Enlarge the dowry much upon me an dthe present and I will it to thee even as ye shall tell me [that is ask never so much of me in these regards yes hall have your demand the dowry which the man gave to the woman remained her own even after his death the present or gift was that much the bridegroom gave to the bride at the time of the betrothing in pledge of his plighting troth the like we now call with us in the Netherlands a troth-penny see further of the bride dowry Exodus 2.16,17 and of the present above chapter 24 verse 53] give me but the young maid to be wife.
\p
\v 13 . Then answered Jacobs sons to Sichem and Hemor his father deceitfully [Heb. In or with deceit for they had no mind at all to yield to the match as appeared afterwards too plain] and spake seeing he had defiled their sister Dinah.
\p
\v 14 . And they said to them we shall not be able to do this business that we should give our sister to a man that hath a foreskin for that were a reproach to us [they speak truth indeed but therein they sin that they abuse the sacraments of circumcision for a cover of deceitful plot when as the circumcision was not the thing they aimed at but as a means of compassing their revenge the better by murder.]
\p
\v 15 . Yet herein we shall agree with you if you will become like unto us that all what is male [or man] among you be circumcised.
\p
\v 16 . Then shall we give you our daughter and we shall take us your daughters and we shall dwell with you and we shall be one people.
\p
\v 17 . But if ye shall not hearken unto us for to be circumcised then shall we take our daughters [that is the daughters of our father or of our house as above verse 8] and be gone.
\p
\v 18 . And their words were good in the eyes of Hemor and in the eyes of Sichem Hemors son [ that is they were pleased with them that is said to be good in ones eyes which doth contend and please him above chapter 16.61Samuel 9.6 &c.]
\p
\v 19 . And the youths or young men delayed not to do this thing for the delighted in Jacobs daughter and was honored above all his fathers house [that is his family children retinue courtier officers so below chapter 41.40 1Kings 2.4 and 4.6 and it seems he was indeed very much beloved regarded an esteemed not only because the city was called by his name but likewise that his father was made very known by him being called the father of sichem see above chapter 33.18, 19.]
\p
\v 20 . So Hemor and Sichem his son came to the gate of the city [where the civil affair were usually transacted by the governors or the magistrates even as with us in the Ghild-halls or town houses see above chapter 22 on verse 17] and they spake to the men of their city saying.
\p
\v 21 . These men are peaceable with us therefore let them dwell in this land and trade therein and let the land behold it is large of compass [Heb. Large of hands so Judges 18.10] be before their face [that is let it be open for them to chose their abode where they please see above chapter 13 on verse 9] we will take us their daughters to wives and we shall give them our daughters.
\p
\v 22 . Yet herein these men will agree with us to dwell with us for to be one people when all that is male among us shall be circumcised.
\p
\v 23 . Their cattle and their possession and all their beasts shall they not be ours? only let us agree with them and they will dwell with us [they propound the matter so to the people as if Jacob and his sons had sought this at there hands concealing that it was but the condition of what they sought themselves and besides that they cover their particular aim and interest with the pretence of the common good and thus deceiving their own citizens they were likewise deceived by Simeon and Levi soon after.]
\p
\v 24 . And they hearkened to Hemor and to simeon his son [they suffer themselves to be persuaded to change their religion not means of their religion not by means of instruction nor out of love to the truth but merely through fair promises and by received hopes of outward profit ]all that went forth at his city gate [that is all the citizen of the city who are decsribed to be going forth out of the city as here or to go into the city as above chapter 23.10 and Jeremiah 17.20] and they were circumcised all that was male all that went to the city gate.
\p
\v 25 . And it came to pass on the third day when they were in the pain [that is when they were in the greatest pains sounds commonly smarting more the third day then before ] that the two sons of Jacob Simeon and Levi brethren of Dinah [these two were the ring leaders of this plot and were full brothers of Dinah by the same father and mother it is true Reuben Judah and Issachar and Zebulon stood in the self same relation with her but yet had no communion with them with this bloody act as well because that these two last were too young yet as that these two were more inclined to meekness then to cruelty see below chapter 37.21,22,26] took each one his sword and came stoutly or confidently daringly into the city and killed all that was male.
\p
\v 26 . They likewise put to death [of this word see above chapter 18 on verse 21] Humor his son sachem with the edge of the sword [Heb. At or in the mouth of the sword] and they took Dinah out of Sachems house and departed.
\p
\v 27 . The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the city [many do understand of this of the rest of Jacobs sons as that having heard of the murder committed by their brethren they ran all to prey upon the dead and plundered the whole city ] because they had defiled their sister [that which sichem alone had done had done is imputed to the citizens in general in as much as they taking rather pleasure therein or else they that is one of them viz. Sichm so Exodus 4.19 Matthew 2.20.]
\p
\v 28 . Their sheep and their oxen and the asses that which was in the city and that which were in the field they took away.
\p
\v 29 . And all their substance and all their little children and their wives they carried away captive and plundered them and all that was within the house.
\p
\v 30 . Then said Jacob to Simeon and Levi [hence it appears that Jacob knew nothing of the plot of his two sons much less had given his consent to it compare below chapter 49.5,6,7] ye have troubled me [or ye have disquieted disturbed me not only distempering my mind by this act of yours but likewise exposing me and all my affairs therefore unto eminent danger hazards and confusion having lived before in peace and quiet in this country see Joshua 7.25 and1Kings 18 on verse 17] making me to stink [that is odious and hateful that the people will not be able to endure my fight or abode among them a comparison from things or ill and noisome sent which make men turn away their face from among them see Exodus 5.21 and 1Samuel 13.4 and 27.12 and1Chronicles 19.6] among the inhabitants of the land [Heb. Inhabitants] among the Canaanites an damming the Pherizites [Heb. Canaan and Pherizites ] and I am few people in number [Heb. Folks of number that is but of small number soon told as Numbers 9.20 Deuteronomy 4.27 and 33.6 ] if they assemble against me I shall be destroyed I and my house.
\p
\v 31 . And they said should be [viz. Sichem or Should one ] then do with our sister as with a whore? [viz. without vengeance or punishment.]
\c 35
\s Jacob having purged his house and prepared it for the worship of God he removes on Gods commands to Bethel verse 1&c. whither being safely come he build an altar 6. The death and burial of Deborah Rebecca’s nurse 8 God appears to Jacob giving him the name of Israel the second time with the renewing of the promises 9 for which Jacob sets up a memorial and changeth the name of the place 14. Going thence Rachel dies in labor of Benjamin and is buried there 16 Reuben commits incense in his fathers house 21 the catalogue of Jacobs sons 23 Jacob at length comes to his father Isaac who dieth and is buried by him and Esau 27.
\p
\v 1 After that God said to Jacob arise go up to Bethel and dwell there and make an altar there to that God who appeared to thee upon thou steadfast before the face of thy brother Esau [that thou maist call to mind there what promises I past unto thee and what vows thou madest unto me then above chapter 28 verse 13, 14, 20. This seem stop have served to comfort and encourage Jacob against the fears that hath seized on him before chapter 34.30.]
\p
\v 2 . Then said Jacob to his household [Heb. House see above chapter 7 on verse 1] and to all that were with him [that is all man and maid servants and such as were come to him from without and lived in his family ] put away the strange Gods [Heb. God of the stranger understand the images of the idols whom the strangers served being not the true God that hath revealed himself to Abraham Isaac Jacob thus the idols are called Deuteronomy 31.16 and 32.12 Joshua 24.20 Psalms 81.10 those are called other Gods Deuteronomy 6.14 Josiah 23.16 Judges 10.13item new Gods Judges 5.8]which are in the midst of you [hence it seems that there were some such images kept in secret yet among his family whether they were the idols of Laban above chapter 31.19 or some costly images which they had gotten in the plundering of Sichem or some of the prisoners had brought thither with them] and cleanse you and change your garments [to shew by this outward ceremony the inward cleansing and the reforming of the heart which the stood indeed not only by reason of that idolatrous defilements but also especially in regard of that base murder committed upon the Sichemites thus to prepare themselves for that solemn worship of God which Jacob was commanded now to set up and exercise with the family at Bethel see exodus 19.10,15.]
\p
\v 3 . And let us arise and go up to Bethel and I will an altar there unto God that answereth me in the day of distress [that is doth use to hear and help me God answers his people and makes it appear by word or indeed that he hath heard them see 1Kings 18.4 Isaiah 41.17,18 Psalms 2.22] and hath been with me upon the way that I have walked [that is upon my journey from Haran hitherto.]
\p
\v 4 . Then they gave unto Jacob all those strange Gods which were in their hands [that is such as they had or kept among them see 2Samuel 8 on verse 10] and the ear-ornament which were on the ears [those Jacob took away it being probable that they had gotten him in their plundering from the idols at Sichem or had been worn by that people in honor of them [without his people knowledge that none might find and further abuse them for superstition and idolatry] under the oak of Sichem.
\p
\v 5 . And they journeyed on and Gods terror [that is a very great one sent by God into apprehension see Exodus 23.27 2Chronicles 14.14 and 17.10 the word God is sometimes used to express the greatness and excellence of a thing see above chapter 13 on verse 10 without this terror upon this people around about them Jacob might easily have been set upon and destroyed with all his by reason of that enormous fact of Simeon and Levi above chapter 34.25] was upon the cities that was round upon them so that they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
\p
\v 6 . Then Jacob came to Luz [see above chapter 12.8 and 28.19] who is in the land of Canaan that is Bethel [called so by Jacob verse 7] he and all the people that was with him.
\p
\v 7 . And he built an altar there and he named that place El Bethel –El [that is God is at Bethel thus calleth this place the second time see chapter 28.19 compare chapter 33 the annotate on verse 20] for God had appeared there unto him when he fled before his brothers face [see above chapter 28.13 and of God appearing chapter 20.3.]
\p
\v 8 . And Deborah the nurse of Rebecca died [viz. she that was sent with Rebecca out of Mesopotamia to the land of Canaan see above chapter 24.59] and she was buried beneath Bethel under the oak whose name he called Allon Bachuth [that is the oak of weeping for having there bewailed and wept over Deborah.]
\p
\v 9 . And God appeared again to Jacob when he was come from Paddan Aram and he blessed him.
\p
\v 10 . And God said unto him thy name is Jacob [God here confirms to Jacob what he had spoken of before unto him see above chapter 32.28.] thy name shall be called Jacob henceforth but Israel shall be thy name and he called his name Israel.
\p
\v 11 . Moreover God said unto him I am God the almighty [see above chapter 17verse 1] be fruitful and multiply [Here God doth ratify the blessing of his father Isaac which he gave him when he fled to Mesopotamia see above chapter 28.3, 4] a nation yea an heap of nations shall become of thee and kings shall come forth out of thy loins [that is be born out of thy flesh and blood so 1Kings 8.19 2Chronicles 6.9 Acts 2.30 compare chapter 40.26.]
\p
\v 12 . And this land which I gave to Isaac and Abraham the same I will give to thee and to thy seed after the will I give this land.
\p
\v 13 . Then God went up from him [Heb. Went up from above him God is said to go up and come down without changing of places as being everywhere present therefore that is only to be understood of the tokens of his presence which he manifests by his descending above chapter 11.5 Exodus 3.8 and Numbers 11.17 and take away again his ascending as here and above chapter 17.22 Judges 13.20 in that place where he had spoken with him.
\p
\v 14 . And Jacob set up a monument [Jacob reneweth the monument here which he had erected formerly above chapter 28.18 it being properly much decayed through length of time and the neighboring peoples abusing of it or overthrowing it that it might serve for a perpetual memorial of Gods goodness to him and his reciprocal duty and engagement] in that place where he had spoken with him a monument of stone and he poured forth thereupon drink offering[understand hereby either oil as immediately follows or wine or some other liquid matter that was usual in drink offerings of effusion for thanksgiving ] and poured oil thereon.
\p
\v 15 . And Jacob called the name of that place where God hath spoken with him Bethel-El [being upon the performance of his vows he renews not only the monument but the mane likewise formerly given to the place and this seems to be a distinct place from that of El Bethel before verse 7.]
\p
\v 16 . And they journeyed from Bethel and there was a little tract of land yet [others about a bait or bait way of land and as much land as usual they went one baiting about a league see chapter 48.7 2Kings 5.19] for to come to Ephrath [this is the city commonly called Bethlehem see both these names verse 19 and Micah 5.1] and Rachel bare and she had hard labor.
\p
\v 17 . And it happened when it went hard with her in her labor then the midwife said to her fear not for thou shalt likewise have this son [nor hast likewise this son viz. besides Joseph according to thy former wish that there might be one more added to him above chapter 30.24.]
\p
\v 18 . And it came to pass when her soul went forth [a clear description of death whence it appears that the same is a parting of the soul which remaineth over for another life and goeth forth out of the body which by death is consumed for which cause is said of them that live yet that their soul is in them 2Samuel 1.9 and of those that die that their spirit goeth forth Psalms 146.4 and of those that rise again from the dead that their spirit returns again into them 1Kings 17.21,22] for she died that she called his name Bennoni [that is son of my pain smart aching ] but his father called him Benjamin [that is son of the right hand that he shall always be near and most dear to me as to a man his right hand is Psalms 80.18.]
\p
\v 19 . Thus Rachel died and she was buried by the way to Ephrath [this name seems to have been given to Bethlehem by Caleb s wife see 1Chronicles 2.19,4 and thereby also is in Bethlehem lying in the tribe of Judah Micah 5.2 Matthew 2.6 differenced from another Bethlehem in the tribe of Zebulon Joshua 19.15] that is Bethlehem [Bethlehem signifies a house of bread.]
\p
\v 20 . And Jacob erected a monument above her grave this is the monument of Rachel’s grave until this day [viz. of Moseh his writing this book yea it stood yet in the time of Samuel and Soul 1Samuel 10.2 of the infants murder which Herod practiced hereabout at the time of Christ’s nativity see Jeremiah 31.15 and Matthew 2.16,17.]
\p
\v 21 . Then Israel departed [here Jacob is called Israel the first time according to Gods command above verse 10] and he extended his tent on yon-side of Magidal Eder [that is a tower of flock see likewise Micah 4.8.]
\p
\v 22 . And it fell out when Israel dwelt in that land Reuben went and lay with Bihar his fathers concubines or by wife [see above chapter 22.24] and Israel heard it [doubtless with great deal of hearts grief seeing that by this fact of Reuben God must need be highly offended his own family dishonored and cause was given of great scandal and reproach so that Jacob had reason even when he lay his death bed to complain of this souls transgression below chapter 49.3,4 and to deprive Reuben to the right primogeniture for it 1Chronicles 5.1,2] and the sons of Jacob were twelve.
\p
\v 23 . the sons of Leah were [ here the sons of Jacob are reckoned up because now since Benjamin’s death the number of them was complete no sons more being born unto him and because these twelve were the fathers of the twelve tribe of Israel of whom mention will be made afterwards] Reuben Jacobs first born then Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar and Zebulon.
\p
\v 24 . The sons of Rachel Benjamin and Joseph.
\p
\v 25 . And the sons of bilha Rachel’s maid-servant Dan and Naphtali.
\p
\v 26 . And the sons of Zilch Leah’s maid-servant Gad and Asar those are Jacobs sons which were born unto him in Paddan Aram [except Benjamin who was born by Ephrath in the land of Canaan above verse 16 Moseh speaketh thus in regard of all the rest that were born there this is a kind of speech whereby a thing is not exprest not precisely and exactly what it is but in gross and in a certain respect see above chapter 15.13 and below verse 46.15 Judah 20.46 and 1Corinthian 15.5.]
\p
\v 27 . And Jacob came to Isaac his father in Mamre [of which place see above chapter 23.17 bearing the name of one of Abrahams confederates who was called Mamre see above chapter 13 on verse 18 and chapter 14 verse 13.24] at Kiriath-Arba [see above chapter 23.2] which is Hebron [see above chapter 13.18 and 23.2, 19] where Abraham had sojourned as a stranger and Isaac [who was yet living and dwelling there as a stranger.]
\p
\v 28 . And the years of Isaac were hundred and eighty years.
\p
\v 29 . And Isaac gave up the ghost or expired [compare above chapter 25.8] and died and gathered to his people [see above chapter 15 on verse 15] old and satisfied Saturn of days and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him [viz. in the cave whereof ye read above chapter 23 wherein Abraham likewise lay buried above chapter 25.9the same was in Hebron as Isaac died this happened a great while after the things related before Jacob having lived in Canaan about twenty three years since his return out of Mesopotamia before his father died and but it is brought in here by Moseh to sum up here the history of Isaac and to prosecute that of Jacob.]
\c 36
\s Esau’s wives and children born in Canaan verse 1,2 &c. his removal to sier 6 his posterity 19 as also that of Sier the Horite 20 among whom there is Ana that first found out the Mules 24a catalogue or lift of the kings and princes in Edom 31.
\p
\v 1 These now are the births of Esau [that is his posterity issue or off springs other generation] which is Edom see above chaper25.30.]
\p
\v 2 . Esau took his wives [see above chapter 26.34 and 32.3 and 33.14,16] out of the daughters of Canaan [that is the Canaanites see above chapter 10 verse 18 ,19 and 12,6] Ada the daughters of Elon [Hebrews Adah above chapter 26.34 called Besmath] the Hethite [one of the people of Canaan descending from Canaan the son of Cham above chapter 10.15] Aholibama [see above chapter 6 on verse 34] the daughters of Ana [Heb. Anah otherwise called Beri above chapter 26.34 at leastwise if Judith here mentioned an dthis Aholibama were one and the same woman] the daughters of Zebeon the Hevite [his grand child thus Athalia is called as well the daughters of Amri her grand father as of Achab her immediate father of the surname Hevite see above chapter 10 verse 15,17 the Hethites and the Hevites seem to lain so contiguous one to another an dpermixed that their names might easily be taken the one for another.]
\p
\v 3 . And Basmath [above chapter 28.9 called Mahalath] Ishmaels daughter Nebajoths sister [of this woman see above chapter 28 on verse 9 and Nebajoth chapter 5.13.]
\p
\v 4 . Now Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz [this same name on of Jobs friends Job 2.11 so that some conceive him to be issued from this Eliphaz here by means of his son Teman whose name is recorded below verse 11 among the children of Eliphaz.] and Basmath bare Rebuel [this name Jethros father likewise had the grand father likewise had the grand father of Mosehs wife Exodus 2.18 Numbers10.29.]
\p
\v 5 . And Abolihama bare Jebus and Jaelem and Korah [of another korah we read Exodus 6.21 Numbers 16.1] these are Esaus sons [he had daughters likewise verse 6 but their names are registered] which were born to him in the land of Canaan.
\p
\v 6 . Now Esau had taken his wives and his sons and his daughters and all the souls [that is persons as chapter 12.5] of his house and cattle and all his beast [by cattle here we understand the lesser sort by the beast the bigger as likewise above chapter 34.23 and 2Kings 3.17] and all his possession which he had gotten in the land of Canaan and was gone to another land [viz. to the land of Seir as followeth ] from the face of his father Jacob [or before the face that is by reason of Jacob this was brought to pass by Gods secret disposing and ordering it thus since his father had according to Gods command promised Jacob the inheritance of the land of Canaan which Esau therefore stood obliged to clear for his brother.]
\p
\v 7 . For their substance or wealth [viz. Jacob and Esau] was too great for to dwell together [though Esau dwelt in Sier at this time nevertheless it should seem that being reconciled with his brother he returned and took up his habitation in the land of Canaan but being both strangers in the country and not having room enough for all their cattle Esau afterwards returned again into Sier] and the land of their stranger ship or sojourning [that is the land of Canaan see above chapter 17 on verse 8] could not bear them by reason of their cattle.
\p
\v 8 . Therefore dwelt upon mount Seir [see above chapter 14 on verse 6] Esau is Edom [that is Esau is the same man who elsewhere is called Edom.]

\p
\v 14 . And these were the sons of Aholibama daughters of Anah daughters of Zibeon Esau’s wife and her bare to Esau Jebus and Jaelam and Korah.
\p
\v 15 . These are the princes of the sons of Esau [these princes did not reign successively after one another death but much together at one time each one over another death but much together at one time each one over their peculiar people nevertheless they were no very great or mighty princes but the heads of the chief among their generation or families s the governors and leaders of the rest] the son of Eliphaz the first born of Esau were Prince Teman Prince Omar prince Zepho an dprince Kenaz.

\p
\v 32 . Bella than the son of Beor reigned in Edom and the name of his city [viz. where he was born and so in the sequel the name of the city joined to these kings were the places of the Ninivites which having been divers it should seem those kings came not to the government by order of succession but by election or the prevalence of power] was Dinhaba.

\s Joseph being better beloved of Jacob then the rest of his brethen is therefore hated by them verse 1 &c. especially upon the relation of his dreams 5 which makes then conspire together as he came to Dothan by his fathers command to kill him 12 but upon the intercession of Reuben they throw him into a pit 21 and afterwards by Judah’s advice they fell him into Ishmaelite passing by there who carry him into Egypt 26 his brethren cover their fact with deceit before Jacob 31. Who takes on graciously for the loss of Joseph 33 whom the Ishmaelite in the mean while fell sells to Potiphar, 36?
\p
\v 1 And Jacob dwelt in the land of stranger ship of his father [see above chapter 17 on verse 8] in the land of Canaan.
\p
\v 2 . These are Jacobs acts or occurrences [Heb. Births that is here that which happened unto Jacob in his generation and posterity thus the Hebrew word is taken sometimes see above chapter 6 on verse 9] Joseph being a son of seventeen years fed his flock with his brethren and he was a youth with the sons of Bilha and the sons of Zilpha his fathers wife and Joseh brought their bad report to their father [that is all such things as they either said or did tending to discredit and dispute of themselves and whole family.]
\p
\v 3 . And Israel loved Joseph above all his sons for he was to him a son of old age [whom he had gotten being about ninety one years of age [whom he had gotten being about ninety one years of age as also because he was the first born of Rachel of whom he was born after a long tedious time of barrenness compare below 44 verse 20] and he made him a coat off many colors [Heb. Of various pieces being of divers colors compare 2Samuel 13.18.]
\p
\v 4 . Now when his brethren saw that their father loved him above all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceable with him [Heb. To peace or for peace that is they could find that meekness in their heart which is requisite for the maintaining of peace and love.]
\p
\v 5 . Likewise Joseph dreamnt a dream which he told his brethren wherefore they hated the more [Heb. They did or added or continued him yet or the more to hate so below verse 8they hated him for three reasons 1. For bringing their bad report to their father Jacob. Verse 2. 2. For being better beloved by his father Jacob then the rest of his brethren verse 4. 3.For his dream sake which he told them.]
\p
\v 6 . And he said unto them hear this dream I pray which I dreamnt.
\p
\v 7 . And behold we were binding of sheaves in the middle of the fields and behold my sheaf stood up [God was pleased to declare this and the following dream what should come to pass afterwards for to shew and make known that those things did not happen by chance but his own direction and appointment] and remained likewise standing [Heb. Stood likewise also erect] and behold this [ this word behold is thrice repeated here by Joseph to shew that this dream was really strange to him and have left a singular impression upon him see the fulfilling thereof below chapter 42.6 ] your sheaves came around about and bowed themselves even before my sheaf.
\p
\v 8 . Then said hios brethren to him shalt thou then be wholly [or assuredly] rule over us [ Heb. Shalt should dest thou ruling rule and so in the sequel lording lord Josephs brethren interpretes this dream upon themselves much like unto the Medianites Judges 7.13.] shalt thou then wholly lord over us? So they hated him yet the more for his dream and his words sake.
\p
\v 9 . And he dreamnt yet another dream and related it to his brethren and he said behold I have dreamnt another drem yet and behold the sun and the moon and the eleven stars bowed down before me. [See the fulfilling thereof below chapter 45.9&c.]
\p
\v 10 . And when he related it to his father and his brethren and his father rebuked him [more to allay his brethren envy then for any anger towards Joseph for he observed enough that this dream signified some extraordinary matter as appears by the next verse ] and said to him what a dream is this that thou dreamiest ? shall we then wholly come I and thy mother [understand his step-mother Leah and Bilha Rachels hand-maid if we shall take it for his own mother who was dead already then Jacobs meaning must be as if he said shall thy mother rise out of the grave to bow herself down before thee on the ground?] and thy brethren for to bow ourselves down to the ground before thee.?
\p
\v 11 . Then his brothers envied him and his father kept or observed this thing [others this word that is these words or this relation the meaning is weighed the dreams of Joseph and looked them up in his heart judging that they must needs betoken something and waited observing what it would produce and prove in time compare Luke 2.19.]
\p
\v 12 . And his brethren went to feed their fathers flock by Schichem [see above chapter 12 on verse 6 about this place Jacob had formerly bought a piece of ground above chapter 33.19.]
\p
\v 13 . Then Israel said to Joseph do not thy brethren feed the flock by Sichem? Feed the flock [the Hebrew had but one word signifying pascere Annon pascunt fraters tui &c. implying the keeping and keeping of the sheep] come let me send thee to them and he said to him behold here I am [see above chapter 22 verse 1 and the annotations.]
\p
\v 14 . And he said to him I pray go look after the welfare [ Heb. Peace this word doth signify all manner of welfare and prosperity of men not only in general Leviticus 26.6 1Kings 2.33 Psalms 125.5 Jeremiah 29.7 but also in particular in regard of they bodily health and strength 2Samuel 18.32 Psalms 38.4 and here item of their souls good estate Numbers 6.26 Isaiah 48.22 Luke .14 John 14.27 together with that of all their goods and cattle moveable and unmovable 1Samuel 25.6 Job 5.24 and here in the words following ] for thy brethren after the welfare of the flock and bring me word again [or bring me the business over again that is bring me news or an account of all how things go there ] so he sent him out of Vale of Hebron [see above chapter 23 verse 2] and he came to Sichem.
\p
\v 15 . And a man found him and he was straying in the field so the man asked of him what sleekest thou?
\p
\v 16 . And he said I seek my brethren I pray acquaint me where they feed the flock.
\p
\v 17 . Then the man said they are gone from hence for I heard them say let us go to Dothan [a place not far distant from sichem and Samaria where some time where a city was built of that name 2Kings 6.13] so Joseph went after his brethren and found them at Dothan.
\p
\v 18 . And they saw him afar off and before they approached him they plotted a crafty design after him [the Hebrew verb doth signify to device or find out or practice some evil with malicious subtilty ] and to put him to death [a sad and grievous scandal in Israel family though God who draweth light out of darkness did wonderfully rule and direct the same to his own glory and the accomplishment of his counsel about Jacobs household as appears by the succeeding story.]
\p
\v 19 . And the one to the other [Heb. The man of his brother ] behold there comes this master dreamer on [or the upper dreamer Heb. Master of dreams see above chapter 14 on verse 13.]
\p
\v 20 . Now come then and let us slay him and throw him into one of these pitted and we will say [ viz. to our father and all those that shall ask us thus they go about to conceal their vile act with lies] an evil beast hath eaten him up so we shall see what shall come of his dreams [Heb. What his dreams shall be.]
\p
\v 21 . Reuben heard that [or when Reuben had heard that and so in the sequel it should seen that Reuben perceiving that his brethren should kill Joseph he was the more willing to yield to this manner set down in the precedent verse his design being to save him afterwards out of the pit as followeth ] and delivered him out of their hands [that is he endeavored to deliver him] and he said let us not smite him in his life [Heb. Soul that is life as if he had said let us not take away his life by our own hands the word soul is likewise used like elsewhere see above chapter 19 on verse 17.]
\p
\v 22 . Also Reuben said to him spill no blood and throw him into the pit that is in the wilderness and lay not hand on him.[ that is put him not to death by your hands see the like phrase above chapter 22.12 where to lay the hand on any is as much as to say to kill him with ones own hand even as Abraham intended it with his sons and this is the same phrase below here verse 27 let not your hand be on him that he might deliver him] out of their hand for to bring him again unto his father.
\p
\v 23 . And it came to pass when Joseph came to his brethren that they strip him off his coat of many colors which he had on [see above verse 3 why they did this see below verse 31.]
\p
\v 24 . And they took him and threw him into the pit [how Joseph behaved himself in this case see below chapter42.21] yet the pit was empty there was no water in it.
\p
\v 25 . After that they sate down to eat bread [viz. to take their ordinary repast see above chapter 31 on verse 54] and lifted up their eyes and saw and behold travelling company of Ishmaelites [a people descending from Ishmael the son of Abraham by Hagar of whose country see above chapter 25 on verse 18below there is mentioned made like wise of Midianites verse 28.36 whence it appears that it was amixt company of several nation dwelling in Arabia ] came out of Gilead [see above on chapter 31 verse 21] and their camels carried spices [the Hebrew word doth signify all manner of spices in general ] and balsam or balm [others Rofins or Terpentine ] and myrrhe [others mastix or stacts see of this spicery likewise chapter 43.11] travelling to bring that down to Egypt [see above chapter 12 verse 10.]
\p
\v 26 . Then said Judah to his brethren what gain shall it be that we slay our brother and hide his blood ?[that is his death or his being killed and murdered by us thus the word blood is taken Deuteronomy 17.8 2Samuel 1.16 and 3.28 2Kings 9.7 &c.]
\p
\v 27 . Come and let us sell him unto these Ishmaelites and let not our hand be on him [see above verse 22] for he is our brother and our flesh and his brethren hearkened to him.
\p
\v 28 . Now when the Mediannites Merchants [people descending from Median the son of Abraham by Ketura [se above chapter 25 on verse 2 and 36 on verse 35] were passing but then they pulled and lifted up Joseph out of the pit and sold to these Ishmaelites for twenty silverlings [Heb. Twenty silverlings that is about fiv rix-dollars or twenty two shillings six pence see above chapter 20 on verse 16 and chapter 23 on verse 15] and they brought Joseph into Egypt.
\p
\v 29 . Now when Reuben returned to the pit [for he had withdrawn himself from his brethren that he might have the more private opportunity afterwards to get Joseph out of the pit again but in the mean time he was sold away] behold Jopseph was not in the pit then he rent or tore his clothes [this was a customer of old when people heard out there happened some sad and grievous hung to them see below verse 34 Numbers 14.6 2Kings 19.1 Ezra 9.3 Job 1.20 and 2.12 Matthew 26.65.]
\p
\v 30 . And he returned to the brethren and said the youth is not [Joseph was about seventeen years old at this time see above verse 2] and wither shall I go? [Reuben is greatly troubled in regard of his father who doubtless would call him to account as the eldest about the loss of Joseph and take the same so much the worse at his hands because of the late trespass whereby he had so highly provoked his father above chapter 35 verse 22.]
\p
\v 31 . Then they took Josephs coat and they slew a he goat and dipped the coat in the blood [not doubting the father would judge thereby that Joseph was torn by a wild beast as also he did below verse 33]
\p
\v 32 . And they sent the coat of many colors and did bring it unto their father and said this we found acknowledge or discern we pray whether this be his sons coat or not?
\p
\v 33 . And he acknowledged and said this is my sons coat and evil beast had devoured him assuredly Joseph is torn in pieces [Heb. Tearing torn that is certainly without all peradventure or wholly and intolerably see above chapter 2.15,16.]
\p
\v 34 . Then Jacob rent his clothes [see above verse 29] and laid or put a sack about his loins [that is a very course sleight and worthless garment or weed not just a sack wherewith they were wont of old to wrap themselves about as with a sack in token of their great grief and sadness see 2Samuel 3.31 1Kings 20.32 and 21.27 Psalms 35.13 Lamentations 2.10 Matthew 11.21] and he went [or wore so 1Samuel 15.35 and 2Samuel 13.38] mourning over his sons many days [that is for a long time more than he was wont to do upon other sad occasion.]
\p
\v 35 . And all his sons and daughters[his daughter Dinah his daughters in law and his sons daughters ]arose to comfort him but he refused to be comforted [not as if Jacob neither had admitted any spiritual comfort but that through human infirmity and greatness of his love to Joseph he was not able so to give over his mourning nor to moderate the same but a remainder of it would or was a hang upon him while he lived ] and said for mourning I shall go down to my son [others of my son for my sons sake compare 1Samuel 4.19 ,21 2Samuel 21.1 ] into the grave [the Hebrew word signifies sometimes the grave as here below chapter 42.38 and 44.29,31 and Psalms 6.6 and 10.10 Ecclesiastes 9.10 Isaiah 38.18 item all manner of great depths or profound hidden places Job 26.6 Psalms 139.8 Amos 9.2 sometimes hell or the places of the damned as Job11.8 Proverbs 15.111 but thus it cannot be taken here Jacob believed the contrary of his son some whiles it was like wise denotes extraordinary great anguishes and distresses with the sensible apprehension of Gods wrath and displeasure as 1Samuel 2.6 Psalms 18.6 and 86.13.] thus his father wept over him.
\p
\v 36 . And the Medanites [see above chapter 25.2] sold him in Egypt to Potiphar Pharaohs courtier [the Hebrew word doth properly signify an Eunuch as Isaiah 56.3,4 and consequently a chamberlain or groom of the chamber the great ladies in those times and countries being allowed none but such to attend them Esther 4.4 from thence the signification began to extend to all kind of courtiers or officers in princes court as here and below chapter 40.2 and 2Kings 8.6] captain of the guard [such as were appointed and entertained to punish the evil doers at the kings command see below chapter 40 verse 3 1Samuel 22.17 mark 6.27 the Hebrew word signifies slayers of beasts and slayers of men.]
\c 38
\s Judah marries a Canaanite woman who bears him three sons verse 1 &c. the first whereof he bestows on Tarmar as also after the same put to death by God the second who being likewise put to death by God he doth promise her the third 6 put not performing his promise Tamar by a subtle practice committed incent with Judah 13 and escaping the punishment thereof for his sake she bears two sons at once Perez and Zerah. 27.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass at the same time [that is in the time while Jacob returned out of Mesopotamia was dwelling in the land of Canaan for here are mentioned divers things which happened some before some after the selling of Joseph but Moshe joins them together as having relation to one Patriarch and being of that nature that they might conveniently related together ] that Judah went down from his brethren and turned into a man of Adullam [which was a small town about Hebron allotted afterwards the tribe of Judah Joshua 12.15 and 15.34 ] whose name was Hira.
\p
\v 2 . And Judah saw there the daughters of Canaanites man whose name was sua and he look her [viz. to wife against Gods command and the good example of his primogeniture as doubtless also without if not against this fathers advice and consent see of the like matches above chapter 6.2,4 and 26.34 an d27.46] and he went into her [see above chapter 6 on verse 4.]
\p
\v 3 . And she conceived and bears a son called Er.
\p
\v 4 . After that she conceived again and bears a ason called Onan.
\p
\v 5 . And she continued yet and bear a son and called his name Sela yet he was [viz. Jodah] at Chezib [the name of the place or city in the land of Canaan afterwards in the tribe of Judah not far from Adullam elsewhere called Aczib Joshua 19.29 Judah 1.31 Micah 1.14 ] when she bear him.
\p
\v 6 . Now Judah took a wife for Err his first-born son and her name was Tamar.
\p
\v 7 . But Err the first born of Judah was evil in the eyes of the LORD [that is he displeased the LORD see above chapter 21 on verse 11 for he was inclined and broke out into very gross and heinous sins which provoked gods just judgment against him compare chapter 6.11 and 10.9] therefore the LORD slew him [viz. in a such manner that by this death the just judgment of God did manifestly appear so below verse 10.]
\p
\v 8 . Then said Judah to Onan go to thy own brothers wife and marry her in thy brothers name [the Hebrew word implies to marrty ones deceased brother widow according to the use of that time confirmed afterwards by an express law Deuteronomy 25.5,6 Ruth 1.11 Matthew 22.24 &c.] and raise seed to thy brother [for the condition of such a marriage was that the first born was to be counted the deceased brothers son.]
\p
\v 9 . Yet Onan knowing [ see the notes on the precedent verse ] that this seed [that is son see above chapter 4 on verse 25] should not be for him it happened when he went into his brothers wife that he spoiled it against the ground [or defiled it &c. the Hebrew word signifying both the one and the other this was even as much as if he had in a manner pulled forth the fruit out of the mothers womb and destroyed it ] not to give seed to his brother.
\p
\v 10 . And it was evil in the eyes of the LORD that did [in the LORDs eyes in the judgment &c. Job 11. On verse 4] therefore the LORD likewise slew him.
\p
\v 11 . then said Judah to Tamar his brother in-law abide [ or sit or remain sitted or so in the sequel ] widow in thy fathers house until my sons Selah grew up [making shew as if he intended to give her this son also in marriage but what follows it appears he meant no such thing ] for [others but ] he said [viz. by himself that is he thought thus see above chapter 20 verse 11] least perchance this die likewise as his brothers did so Tamar went and abode in her fathers house.
\p
\v 12 . Now when many days were run by [Heb. When the days were multiplied that is after much time past when nevertheless Selah was not given to Tamar in marriage ] the daughters of Sua Judah’s wife died after that Judah comforted himself [ he gave over his mourning compare above chapter 37 verse 35] and went up to his sheep-shears [for in the sheep shearing time they used to make feasts and to rejoice with friends 1Samuel 25.38] untoTimna [a place not far distant from Adullah which fell afterwards to the tribe of Judah Joshua 15.57 we read likewise of another Timna in the tribe of Dan Joshua 19.43] he and Hira his friend the Adullamite.
\p
\v 13 . They told Tamar saying behold thy father-in-law goes up to Timna to shear his sheep.
\p
\v 14 . Then she put off the apparel of the widowhood [for widows went in very sleight and mean habits in comparison of other women and she covered herself with a vial and muffled herself [Tamar the better to resemble a light dishonest woman dresseth distinguisheth and masketh herself in this manner sitting by the high way side that remaining unknown she might allure and beguile her father- in-law compare Proverbs 7.12 and 9.14 Ezekiel 16.24,25] and sate at the entry of the two fountains [or of Enaim which some do hold for the name of a certain place some render it at the cross way called as they conceived the door of the eyes for that on a cross way called as they conceive the door of the eyes for that on a cross way called as they conceive the door of the eyes for that on a cross way the eyes are opened as it were to look this way and that way [that is upon the way of Timna for she saw that Selah was grown up and she not given to him to wife.
\p
\v 15 . When Judah saw her and took her and held her for a whore seeing she had covered her face.
\p
\v 16 . And he turned to her towards the way [viz. where she sates] and said come I pray and let me go unto thee for knew that it was his daughter in law and she said what wilt thou give me to go into me? she demands the hire of the whore not for the gains sake but to have something in hand to conceive him afterwards with as appears below verse 25 and Judah was not transported with the severance of the carnal lust that he knew not the voice of his daughter in law.]
\p
\v 17 . And he said I will send thee a kid from the flock and she said if thou wilt give me pledge until you send [understand I shall be ready to yield to thee if so be thou &c. otherwise wilt thou give pledge till thou send?]
\p
\v 18 . Then said he what pledge is it that I shall give thee? And she said thy seal ring and thy string [others Kerchief Handkerchief the Hebrew word signifies properly turned or wrested twisted twine yarn and is taken for strings laces and clothes and Kerchiefs made of such twisted threads ] and thy staff that is in thy hands which he gave her and went into her and she conceived by him.
\p
\v 19 . And she got her up and went her way and put off her vial and she put on the garments of her widowhood.
\p
\v 20 . And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite for to take the pledge out of the woman’s hand but he found her not.
\p
\v 21 . And he asked the people of her place [that is of the place. place where Tamar sat before] saying; where is the Whore that was by the two fountains, [Heb. By Enaim. See above verse 14. On the way? And they said, Here hath been no whore.
\p
\v 22 . And he returned to Judah, and said: I have not found her, and also the people of that place said, here hath been no whore.
\p
\v 23 . Then said Judah, let her take it for herself, lest we perhaps do grow despised. [i.e. lest we being too eager with enquiry for our goods, our committing of whoredom be discovered, which might bring us in disrepute. And it is observable that among the very Heathens and Idolaters, such as were the Adullamites, whoredom was held a vile blemish.] Behold, I have sent this Kid, but thou hast not found her.
\p
\v 24 . And it fell out about three months after; that they told Judah, Saying; Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the whore; and lo, likewise, she is with child of whoredom: then said Judah; Bring her forth [viz. to the City-gate, to be condemned by the Magistrate there, for an adulteress, as being betrothed to my son Selah.] that she may be burnt. [Then, it seems, Adultery, was even in those times, before the law, held for a transgression worthy of death. See above cha. 20. on verse 3. Item verse 7. And 9.]
\p
\v 25 . When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, for to say, By the man, whose these things are, am I with child: and she said, acknowledge (I pray) whose this Seal-ring and these strings, and this staff, are.
\p
\v 26 . And Judah knew them, and said; she is more righteous then I, [his conscience checks him, not only, for not having kept his promise with Tamar, (which is the reason mentioned here in this verse) but likewise that wittingly he committed whoredom, and unwittingly, incest.] therefore that I have not given her to my son Selah: and he acknowledged her thenceforth no more [Heb. He continued not to acknowledge her thenceforth any more [Heb. He continued not to acknowledge her. Of this phrase see above chap. On ver. 1.]
\p
\v 27 . and it came to pass on the time when she was in travel; behold, then there were twins in her belly.
\p
\v 28 . And it happened when she was in delivery, that (one) put forth the hand: and the midwife took it, and she tied a scarlet (thread) [the Hebr. Word properly signifies such stuff, as is twice dip in Scarlet color. See Exod. 25. 4. And Lev. 14. 4. With the Annot.] about his hand, saying; This comes out first. [So she was persuaded he should, and prove the first born.]
\p
\v 29 . But it happened, when he drew his hand in again, behold, then this brother came forth: and she said; How didst thou breakthrough? [i.e. how didst thou thrust forward and pass through before thy brother, to come forth into the world?] upon thee the breach is: [i.e. it is to be ascribed or imputed to thee; or, thou hast made it, for to put thy brother back, and to disappoint him of the prerogative of primogeniture, which he seemed to have gotten already. Oth. How didst thou rend the rent over thee?] and they called his name Perez. [Heb. Perets, i.e. a thorow-breach, or rent.]
\p
\v 30 . And after that his brother came forth, about whose hand the Scarlet (thread) was: and they called his name, Zerah. [i.e. ascent, or rising up, (as that of the Sun) because he was the first that appeared at their coming forth.]
\c 39
\s Joseph is blessed of God in his service with Potiphar; that his Master sets him over all where God is likewise with Joseph, so that he is set over the prisoners, 20.
\p
\v 1 Now Joseph was carried down to Egypt: Potiphar, Pharoahs Courtier, a Captain of the Guard, [see above chap. 37. On verse 36.] an Egyptian, bought him out of the hand of the Israelites, [see above chap. 37. On verse 36.] an Egyptian, bought him out of the hand of the Ismaelites, [see above chap. 37. On verse 25.] who had carried him down thither.
\p
\v 2 . And the LORD was with Joseph; [see above chap. 21. On verse 22. And 26. Verse 24.] so that he was a prosperous man: and he was in his Masters house the Egyptian; [i.e. he ran not away again to his father or elsewhere, but applied himself patiently and faithfully to the low estate whereinto God had put him by his Providence. In the Hebrew, his Masters, in the plural, implying the singular onely, and so likewise in the sequel, and above chap. 24. 10. And 2 Sam. 12. 8.]
\p
\v 3 . Now when his Master saw, that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all what he did to prosper by his hand: [i.e. by his service and attendance, Exod. 4. 13. Lev. 8. 36. Prov. 26. 6, etc.]
\p
\v 4 . Then Joseph found grace in his eyes, [see above ch. 18. 3.] and served him: [i.e. he attended his person. At first he was but a common servant, or drudge: then he came to be a Groom of the Chamber to his Master, and soon after the Steward of all his house] and he put (or set) him over his house, and all he had he put into his hand. [See above chap. 16. Verse 6.]
\p
\v 5 . And it came to pass, that sithence he had set him over his house, and over all that was his, that the LORD blessed the Egyptians house, for Joseph sake: [wicked and meer wordly men are blessed for honest and pious ones living amongst them: [see above cha. 30. 27, 30. Isa. 45. 3, 4.] yea the blessing of the LORD was in all that he had, in the house, and in the fields.
\p
\v 6 . And he left all he had in Josephs hand, so that he took knowledge with him of nothing, but the bread he did eat; [i.e. Potiphar troubled himself, or took care for nothing at all, but eating and drinking, remitting all the household-affairs to Joseph’s care and managing. Some are of opinion, that these words, but the bread he did eat, have regard to the superstition of the Egyptians, who would not eat with the Hebrews. See thereof below, chap. 43. Verse 32.] and Joseph was fair of feature, and fair of face, (or aspect).
\p
\v 7 . And it fell out after these things, that his Masters wife did cast her upon Joseph: [Heb. That she lifted up her eyes to Joseph: the meaning is, she looked upon him with dishonest and lustful eyes. See Mat. 5. 28. And 2 Pet. 2. 14. The contrary practice was in Job, chap. 31. Verse 1.] and she said; Lie with me. [after that doubtless she had used many ways and devices, to entice and allure him to uncleanness.]
\p
\v 8 . But he refused it, and said to his Masters wife: Behold, my Master hath no knowledge with me of what there is in the house; and all what he hath, he hath given (or put) it into my hand.
\p
\v 9 . There is none greater in this house, than myself; [viz. in regard of the power, which Joseph had received from his Master, for the guiding and governing of the house in his stead. Oth. He himself is not greater in this house.] and he hath withheld nothing from me, but thee, therein, that thou art his wife: [i.e. he hath likewise given charge to me, to take care of and provide for thee, in regard of thy bodily sustenance, but in no wise to have any bodily communion with thee. Oth. Therefore that then, etc.] how should I then do this, so great an evil, and sin against God?
\p
\v 10 . And it happened, that when the day by day, [Heb. Day, day. One and the same word twice put down, doth sometimes imply a continuance of time, Exod. 16. 5, 22. Lev. 6. 12. Deut. 2. 27. And 14. 22.] she spoke to him, and he hearkened not after her, (and) to be with her: [for to hear her solicitation; he knowing well enough, that evil communication or reasoning corrupt good manners, 1 Cor. 15. 33.]
\p
\v 11 . So it fell out on such a day, that he came into the house, to do his work: and there was none of the people of the house [i.e. none of the household, or family. So below verse 14. And Mich. 7. 6.] within the household:
\p
\v 12 . And she apprehended him by his garment, [doubtless by some upper garment, as cloak, or coat, & c.] saying; lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and went forth broad.
\p
\v 13 . And it happened, when she saw, that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth .
\p
\v 14 . Then she called the people of her house; [viz. those that were abroad, or in the interim come again, to the end she might pack and prepare her witnesses against the time of her accusing of Joseph before her husband.] and spoke to him, saying; Behold, [it seems, that she held Joseph’s garment in her hand yet, and showed it forth to her people in speaking to them] He [viz. my husband; she names him not otherwise, as making show as if she were much offended with him.] hath brought us in the Hebrew man [thus she calleth Joseph scornfully, and the more to incense the household against him, the Egpytians bearing otherwise, as making show as if she were much offended with him.] hath brought us in the Hebrew man [thus she calleth Joseph scornfully, and the more to incense the household against him, the Egyptians bearing otherwise but small good will to the Hebrews. See below, chap. 43. 32.] for to mock us: [This vile woman saith not here, with me, but with us; as if she would say; if he dare be so bold with me, what villainy and baseness shall not he dare to put upon any of the house?] He came to me, for to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice. [Heb. Great voice.]
\p
\v 15 . And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice, and cried out: then he left his garment with me, and fled, and forth.
\p
\v 16 . And she laid his garment by her, till his Master came into his house.
\p
\v 17 . Then spoke she to him, according to those same words, [viz. which she had used towards the household, repeating the same over again to her husband.] saying; The Hebrew servant, whom thou hast brought us in here, came to me to mock me.
\p
\v 18 . And it came to pass, when I lifted up my voice, and cried; that he left his garment with me and fled forth.
\p
\v 19 . And it came to pass, when his Master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying; according to these same words hath thy servant done unto me; [i.e. just as I told thee, so he did] then his anger kindled. [He believes his wife, without hearing Joseph first. Compare the phrase with above chap. 4. 5, 6. And see the Annot. On ver. 5.]
\p
\v 20 . And Joseph’s Master took him, and delivered him into the prison-house [Heb. To the house of roundness, or the round Tower. This prison is likewise called a pit, or dungeon, below chap. 40. 15. And 41. 14.] to the place where the Kings prisoners were kept in prison: [Hebr. The Kings bound (ones) were bound: understand here such prisoners, as had trespassed against the King himself, or committed some heinous crime, lying there for life and death] thus was he there in the prison-house.
\p
\v 21 . Yet the LORD was with Joseph, and turned (his) kindness towards him: and gave him grace in the eyes, [Heb. Gave his grace, i.e. he made him grace in the eyes, [Heb. Gave his grace, i.e. he made him gracious and acceptable, see above chap. 18. On verse 3.] of the chief of the prison-house.
\p
\v 22 . And the chief of the prison-house gave (or, put) all the prisoners, that were in the prison-house, into Joseph’s hand, and all what they did there, he did. [i.e. whatsoever they used to do, and all that was done, was done by his command and ordering.]
\p
\v 23 . The chief of the prison-house, looked upon nothing at all [Heb. Was not seeing all (i.e. any) thing] that was in his hand, because the LORD was with him: and what he did, the LORD did make to thrive.
\c 40
\s The chief Cup-bearer and Baker of Pharao, are put in prison, and committed to Joseph, v. 1, etc. they dream each one his dream, which Joseph interprets, praying the cup-bearer, being restored to his place, according to his dream, to be mindful of him, 5. Joseph’s interpretation of both the prisoner’s dreams, is made good by the event: but the Cup-bearer forgets Joseph, 20.
\p
\v 1 And it happened after these things, that the Cup-bearer of the King of Egypt, and the Baker, [i.e. the chief, or master of the rest, as appears verse 2.] sinned against their LORD, against the King of Egypt.
\p
\v 2 . So that Pharao grew very wroth with his two Courtiers; [see above chap. 37. On verse 36.] with the chief of the Cup-bearers, and with the chief of the Bakers.
\p
\v 3 . And he delivered them into custody, to the house of the chief of the Guard, [see above chap. 39. On verse 20.] at the place where Joseph was kept prisoner [Heb. Was bound, as also above chap. 39. 20. And below here, ver. 5.]
\p
\v 4 . And the chief of the Guard appointed Joseph with them, to serve them: and they were (some) days in custody, [Oth. Many days, see above chapter 4. On verse 3.]
\p
\v 5 . Now they dreamed both a dream, each his dream, in one night, each according to the interpretation of his dream. [i.e. they were no vain dreams, but each had its peculiar signification, which Joseph, through God’s inspiration declared unto them, and were confirmed afterwards by the event. See below verse 12, 18, 19, 20, & c.] the Cap-bearer, and the Baker, that were the Kings of Egypt [or, belonged to him formerly, were of his retinue and service; but now prisoners.] who were prisoners in the prison-house.
\p
\v 6 . And Joseph came to them in the morning, and he looked on them, and behold they were troubled. [or, dismaid, or, perplexed. The Hebrew word signifies great distemper of the mind, proceeding out of care, fear, anxiety, sadness, perplexity, or great vexation and anger. This now is such a kind of dreaming, which God sends upon men to trouble and perplex them. See below chap. 41. 8. Dan. 2. 1. Mat. 27. 19.]
\p
\v 7 . Then he asked the Courtiers of Pharao, that were with him in the hold [Heb. Custody, keeping] of the house of his Masters, saying; why are your faces ill-disposed [Heb. Evil, i.e. sad, drooping, cast down; thus this word is taken, Neh. 2. 1, 2, 3. Prov. 25. 20.] to day?
\p
\v 8 . And they said to him; we have dreamt a dream, and there is none to interpret the same: [i.e. we are destitute here of a sooth-sayer, wizard, or interpreter of dreams, and we are not permitted to enquire abroad; for they had otherwise abundance of such profest people among them, as appears below chap. 41. Ver. 8.] and Joseph said to them; Are not the interpretations Gods? [Joseph draws them off from those abusive interpreters of dreams, unto God, as from whom immediately such dreams, and their true interpretations are derived.] tell (them) me I pray.
\p
\v 9 . Then the chief of the Cup-bearers told Joseph his dream, and said to him: in my dream, [i.e. as I was dreaming, when I lay in my dream.] behold, [this word is much used in relating of dreams, to show their strangeness and wonderfulness, not only in regard of the Relator, but the Hearer also. See above chap. 37. 7, 9. And below verse 16. And 41. 2, 3. Jud. 7. 13. Dan. 4. 7.] there was a Vine then before my face;
\p
\v 10 . And at the Vine there were three branches; and it was as budding, its blossoms went up, its bunches brought forth ripe grapes. [Heb. Its bunches ripened, matured, or, full cooked the grapes.]
\p
\v 11 . And Pharaos cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, and prest them out into Pharaos Cup. And I gave the cup upon Pharaos hand.
\p
\v 12 . Then said Joseph to him: This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days; [i.e. they betoken three days, as also below, ch. 18. And ch. 41. 26, 27. And Dan. 2. 38. And 4. 22. Mat. 13. 19. Luke 8. 11. And 1 Cor. 10. 4.]
\p
\v 13 . Within three days yet Pharao shall lift up thy head, and restore thee into thy estate, [i.e. in the review, or, survey of his Officers, he shall reckon thee among them; that shall continue, or be restored to their office; phrases not much unlike to this, we find likewise Exod. 30. 12. Num. 1. 2. And 26. 2. Etc. where the lifting up of heads, is as much as to reckon them up, and to sum up, or count such a sort of men.] and thou shalt give Pharao’s cup into his hand, according to the former manner, [the Hebrew word is likewise taken thus, Leviticus 5. 10. And 9. 16. And Num. 15. 24. And 29. 18. 2 Chron. 35. 13, etc] when thou wast his cup-bearer.
\p
\v 14 . Yet remember me with thy self [Heb. With thee] when it shall go well with thee, and show kindness on me, and make mention of me unto Pharao, and help to get me out of this house.
\p
\v 15 . For I have been thievishly stolen [Heb. Being stolen I was stolen] out of the Hebrews Country, i.e. out of the land of Canaan, where the Hebrews at that time so-journed as strangers, and which was promised them of God.] and likewise I have done nothing here, that they put me in this pit, (or dungeon)
\p
\v 16 . When of the Bakers saw, that he had made good interpretation; [Heb. That he had interpretated the good, i.e. to the good and advantage of the Cup-bearer.] then said he to Joseph; I was likewise in my dream; [compare above verse 9. And the Note thereon] and behold three grated [Oth. White, or, wreathed, plaighted, full of holes, like network.] baskets were upon my head;
\p
\v 17 . And in the uppermost basket there was of all [i.e. all manner of] meat, of bakers work; and the fowl did eat them out of the basket from above my head.
\p
\v 18 . Then Joseph answered and said; This is the interpretation of it; the three basket are three days. [See above verse 12.]
\p
\v 19 . Within three days yet Pharao shall lift up thy head from above thee, [Joseph useth here the same words which he had used ver. 13. But in another sense: which appears in the addition of the words from above thee: implying, that the chief of the Bakers, should likewise come into the account, in the survey of the Officers, but so as that his office should be taken from him.] and he shall hang thee, [i.e. cause thee to be hanged, and so verse 22. Oth. Lift up thy head, & c. taking the same a way from thee.] on a tree, and the fowl shall eat thy flesh from above thee.
\p
\v 20 . And it came to pass on the third day, on Pharao’s birthday, [Heb. The day when Pharao was born, ] that he made a feast to all his Servants: [See of the like feast, Mat. 14. 6.] and he lifted up the chief of the cup-bearers, and the head of the chief of the Bakers, in the midst of his servants.
\p
\v 21 . And he made the chief of the Cup-bearers return to his Cup-bearing Office; [Heb. His giving to drink, or cup-bearing.] so that he gave the cup upon Pharao’s hand.
\p
\v 22 . But the chief of the Bakers he hanged up [viz. by his Executioner: what men do by others, that they are said to do themselves, whether it be bad, as above chap. 20. 3. 1 Sam. 22. 21. 2 Sam. 12. 9. And 24. 10. 1 K. 21. 19. Or good, and indifferent, as below chap. 46, 29. 1 Kings 3. 4. And 7. 1, 2. ] as Joseph had interpreted to them.
\p
\v 23 . Yet the chief of the Cup-bearers did not remember Joseph, but forgot him. [viz. with Pharao, and that for two whole years together, as appears by the first verse of the next chapter.]
\c 41
\s Pharao having had two dreams, and finding none among his own people, that could interpret them, it happened that the chief Cup-bearer remembereth Joseph, v. 1, etc. whom Pharao causeth to be brought before him, and tells him his dreams, which Joseph interprets, and gives good counsel withal to Pharao against the death to come, 14. Therefore Pharao appoints him Governour, next to himself over the whole Kingdom, presents him stately, gives him another name, and a wife too, 37. Joseph being now thirty years of age, makes a progress through all Egypt, and lays up provision in the seven good years, 46. Gets two sons, Manasse and Ephraim, 50. The bad years are coming on, wherein Joseph sells off the provision of corn, unto the people, 54.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, at the end of two full years, [Heb. Two years of days, i.e. two complete years. The same phrase is found likewise 2 Sam. 14. 28. And Jer. 28. 3. So also a month of days doth betoken a full month, above chap. 29. 14.] that Pharao dreamed, and behold he stood by the River. [understand the famous river of Nilus: which moistens and makes fruitful the land of Egypt in a most singular manner, by his yearly over-flowing of it; Therefore in regard of the excellency of it, it is called the River, without any other addition, or apposition. See Exod. 1. 22. And 2. 3. And 7. 24, 25. So also is Euphrates called the River, by way of excellency, without the name added to it, above ch. 31. 21.]
\p
\v 2 . And behold , there came up out of the River, seven Cows, fair of aspect, and fat of flesh, and they fed in the grass. [Oth. Brook-land, moist meadow, marshes]
\p
\v 3 . And behold, seven other Cows came up after them, out of the River, ugly of aspect, [Heb. Evil, or bad of etc. i.e. ill-favoured, deformed, mishappen; so also below ver. 4. 20, 21. The fair ones on the contrary, are called good, ver. 22. 26.] and thin (or, lean) of flesh; and they stood by (the other) Cows, at the blank [Heb. Lip] of the River.
\p
\v 4 . And the Cows, ugly of aspect, and thin of flesh, did eaten up the seven Cows, fair of aspect, and fat: then Pharao awaked.
\p
\v 5 . After that, he slept and dreamt (a) second time, and behold, seven cars arose up in one stalk (or, blade) fat and good [i.e. fair, full, plump]
\p
\v 6 . And behold seven thin and by the East-wind blasted (or singed) ears, [the property of the East-wind is, to burn and singe the fruits and grains, especially in those Countries: See Ezech. 17. 10. And 19. 12. Hos. 13. 15.] did shoot forth after them.
\p
\v 7 . And the thin ears swallowed up the seven fat and full ears: [i.e. full of sap and moisture] then Pharao awaked, and behold, it was a dream. To wit, not a natural, but a divine dream, proceeding from God, and not from any natural causes. Oth. This was the dream.]
\p
\v 8 . And it came to pass in the morning, [after he had been roused a while] that his spirit was troubled, [see above ch. 40. On v. 6.] and he sent, and called all the Magicians, [or, Astrologers, Sorcerers, or Sooth-sayers, as commonly they are wrongfully called. Understand such as practiced either meer natural, or superstitious, if not many times Diabolical Arts, to foretell or interpret hidden and abstruse things, and to do several strange seats: of such, see Exod. 7. 11. And 8. 19. & 9. 11. Dan. 2. 2. 10.] of Egypt, and all the wise men, [understand all such, as excelled in any sciences, or a cuteness of wit and Judgement, or much experience. See Exodus 7. 11. Daniel 2. 12.] that were in it: and Pharao told them to Pharao. [them, the dreams namely, though the singular go before; for there were two dreams, or a twofold dream.]
\p
\v 9 . Then the chief of the Cup-bearers spoke unto Pharao, saying; I remember my sins too day, [i.e. those which at such a time I committed against the King.]
\p
\v 10 . Pharao, [i.e. the King; for the name of Pharao was a name common to all the Kings of Egypt; so that Pharao signified as much with the Egyptians, as when we say, The King, or, his Royal Majesty, or as they say in Germany, The Emperour, and Sire in his Servants, and delivered me into custody, at the house of the chief of the Guard, [See above chap. 37. 36.] me and the chief of the Bakers.
\p
\v 11 . And in one night we dreamed a dream, I and he: we dreamed, each according to the interpretation of his dream. [See above chap. 40. On verse 5.]
\p
\v 12 . And there was with us an Hebrew youth, [viz. of about 28. Years, as appears below, v. 46.] a Servant of the chief of the Guard: and we told them unto him, and he interpreted us our dreams: he interpreted them, unto each according to his dream.
\p
\v 13 . And even as he interpreted to us, so it came to pass; [Heb. And it came to pass, even as he interpreted unto us, so it came to pass, Psalm 105. 20.] and he hath restored into my estate, and him he hanged.
\p
\v 14 . Then Pharao sent, and called Joseph, and they made him come hastily [Heb. Run] out of the pit [or, dungeon:] and the cut this hair, [Oth. He caused his hair to be cut. Joseph let his hair grow in prison, in token of sadness. See 2 Sam. 19. 24. Or, after the custom of prisoners; but now he gives way to be trimmed, and to have his apparel changed, not to appear in a ghastly and mournful habit and condition before the King, which was both undecent, and unlawful. See Est. 4. 2.] and they changed his clothes, and he came to Pharao.
\p
\v 15 . And Pharao spoke to Joseph; I have dreamt a dream, and there is none to interpret it; but I heard say of thee, (when) thou hearest a dream, that thou doest interpret it.
\p
\v 16 . And Joseph answered Pharao, saying; it is without me: [Oth. Without me God shall, etc. or, it is not in me, Thus Joseph endeavoureth with discretion, to turn away Pharao’s eyes, which now were sixth on him, from thence to God, from whom the interpretation of dreams is to be had. See above chap. 40. 8. And Dan. 2. 28.] God shall declare Pharao’s welfare. [Heb. Answer Pharao’s peace, i.e. that which shall serve to the serve to the peace and welfare of him and his. See above chap. 37. On verse 14.]
\p
\v 17 . Then Pharao spoke to Joseph; Behold, in my dream I stood at the bank of the River; [Heb. At the lip, etc.]
\p
\v 18 . And behold, there came up out of the River, seven cows, fat of flesh, and fair of feature, and they fed in the grass. [See above verse 2.]
\p
\v 19 . And behold , seven other Cows came up after these, lean and very ugly of shape [Heb. ill, or, bad of shape, and so in the sequel.] slender [Oth. Empty, starveling, rascal] of flesh: I have not seen the like for ugliness in all the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 20 . And those slender and ugly Cows, did eat up the first seven fat Cows.
\p
\v 21 . Which came into their belly, [Heb. into their inmost, or, into the midst of them] but one perceived not, that they were come into their belly; for their look was ugly, as in the beginning: then I awaked.
\p
\v 22 . After that, I saw in my dream, and behold, seven ears rose up in one stalk, full and good. [i.e. fair, and so in the sequel.]
\p
\v 23 . And behold, seven dry, thin, and of the East-wind blasted (or, singed) ears did shoot up after them:
\p
\v 24 . And the seven thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears: and I have told it the Magicians, [see above verse 8.] but there was none that declared it me.
\p
\v 25 . Then said Joseph to Pharao; Pharao’s dream is one; [i.e. of one sort or kind, for matter of interpretation,] that which God is doing, [i.e. that which he shall, or, is about to do. Things to come are often set down in the Present Tense, as now in being, or doing, being as sure with God, as if they were past or done already: as below verse 28. Exod. 9. 14. Jos. 11. 6. Mat. 24. 40. And 26. 28.] he hath made known to Pharao.
\p
\v 26 . The seven fair [Heb. good, see above on ver. 3.] Cows, are seven years; [i.e. signify seven years. See above chap. 40. On verse 12.] the seven fair ears are likewise seven years; the dream is one.
\p
\v 27 . And the seven slender and ugly Cows, which came up after those, are seven years; and the seven slender, of the East-wind blasted ears, shall be seven years of famine. [i.e. types and tokens of seven such years to come, whereby God gives us to understand, that in those years he will send a death into the land.]
\p
\v 28 . This is the word, which I spoke unto Pharao: that which God is doing, he hath showed to Pharao.
\p
\v 29 . Behold, for the seven years to come, there shall be great abundance [Heb. satiety, i.e. store of all manner of things, whereby men may satisfy themselves, and much superfluity besides.] in all the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 30 . But after them, there shall rise up seven years of famine; then all that abundance shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt [for commonly that which is removed from the eye, abides not long in the thoughts of the heart. See ver. 31.] and the famine shall consume the land. [i.e. both men and beasts, that are in the land, so also below ver. 36.]
\p
\v 31 . Also the abundance shall not be perceived in the land, by reason of that famine, [Heb. from the face of that famine] that shall be thereafter; for it shall be very grievous.
\p
\v 32 . And concerning that the same dream is reiterated to Pharao: [it is worth observing, that the Repetition here doth imply and signify the firmness of God’s decree, and Acceleration of the Execution.] it is because the thing is firmly decreed [Oth. For God’s sake, or in God’s behalf] and that God hasteneth to do the same.
\p
\v 33 . Therefore let Pharao look now for an understanding and wise man: and set him over the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 34 . Let Pharao do (so), and appoint over-seers over the land; and take the first part of the land of Egypt [Heb. let him five the land, i.e. let him receive the fifth part of the fruit of the land, to wit, at a reasonable rate, to sell it afterwards again to the subjects in the time of death, at a rate proportionable.] in the seven years of abundance.
\p
\v 35 . And let them gather all food [i.e. all manner of provision the ground affords, which may serve for food] of these approaching good years, and lay up corn, under the hand of Pharao [i.e. by his command, authority, and order. So Exod. 4. 13. And 9. 35. And Num. 7. 8. Etc.] for food in the Cities, and keep it.
\p
\v 36 . Thus shall the food be for store for the land, for seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt: that the land perish not of famine. [Heb. be not cut off, or destroyed]
\p
\v 37 . And this word was good in the eyes of Pharao, and in the eyes of all his servants. [i.e. they were well pleased with this advise. See above chap. 19. On verse 8.]
\p
\v 38 . Then Pharao said to his Servants, should we (be able) to find such a man as this (is) in whom the Spirit of God may be? [i.e. such Wisdom and Providence, as God by his Spirit hath bestowed on this man, in such a singular manner. Thus God wrought and disposed the heart of Pharao, for the executing of his Counsel.]
\p
\v 39 . After that, did Pharao say to Joseph; since God hath made all this known unto thee, there is none (so) understanding and wise, as thy self.
\p
\v 40 . Thou shalt be over my house, [see above chap. 34. On ver. 19.] and on thy command [Heb. on, after, or according to thy mouth. Thus the word mouth is taken for command, Exod. 17. 1. And 38. 21. Num. 3. 16. 39. And chap. 4. 45. And 9. 20. Deut. 17. 10, etc.] all my people shall kiss (the hand;) [in token of reverence and submission. It was the custom then, as it is to this day, in most parts, that the subjects brought the hand to the mouth, or kissed the same, when any great ones spoke unto them, or laid their commands upon them. Compare Job. 31. 27. Hos. 13. 2. Where this phrase is used for an idolatrous exhibition of honour or worship. And thus there is likewise by kissing intimated a willing obedience, as 1 Kings 19. 18. Psalm 2. 12. Oth. At thy mouth shall all my people kiss.] only (in) this Throne shall I be greater than Thou. [Compare this phrase with ch. 36. 9.]
\p
\v 41 . Moreover Pharao spoke to Joseph; Behold, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. [i.e. observe and consider to what dignity and power I have exalted thee]
\p
\v 42 . And Pharao took his ring from off his hand, and put it on Joseph’s hand, [in token of empowering him, to seal all things in his name.] and got him to be arrayed in fine linen, [a sort of linen, or cloth, which was very precious among the Egyptians, being very fine and white; see thereof Exod. 25. 4. And 39. 27, 29. Proverbs 31. 22.] and laid a golden chain on his neck.
\p
\v 43 . And he made him to ride upon the second Chariot which he had; [the second next the first, of the Kings own; in token that he was exalted next to the King above all the Lords of the land, Esth. 10. 3.] and they called before his face, kneel: [some render the word Abrech, tender father; tender, by reason of his youth, and father, for his office sake; even as the Lord’s of the land are called, The fathers of the fatherland. (patres patrie) Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 44 . And Pharao said to Joseph, I am Pharao: [i.e. in regard of the Royal Majesty I am above thee. Oth. Take these words to be an oath, as if he should have said, as true as I am King, or by my Royal Majesty, none shall, & c.] yet without thee none shall lift up his hand, or his foot, in all the Land of Egypt. [i.e. they shall not dare to do or enterprise any thing without thy leave and liking.
\p
\v 45 . And Pharao called Joseph name, Zaphnath Paaneah [i.e. interpreter of secrecy, or hiddenness.] and gave him Asnath, the daughter of Potiphera, the chief (or Governor) [The Hebrew word doth indeed signifieth Priest, but likewise in general the chief or principal or President in Political affairs, and a person of great respect and authority. See 2 Sam. 8. 18. And 9. 4. 1 Chron. 18. 17. Job. 12. 19. Joseph was necessitated by his present employment and engagement to accept of this match; the children thereof being nevertheless accounted by Jacob, as the fathers of two Tribes in Israel, below chap. 48. 16.] of On, [the name of a City in Egypt.] to wife: and Joseph went forth through the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 46 . Joseph now was thirty year old, [Heb. a son of thirty year] when he stood before the face of Pharao King of Egypt: and Joseph went forth from the face of Pharao, and he past throughout all the land of Egypt. [viz. in pursuance of the Kings command, to appoint Officers every where, and to prepare store-houses against the death to come]
\p
\v 47 . And the land brought forth [Heb. made] in the seven years of the abundance, by handfuls. [i.e. as much, as if for one grain, one had gotten whole handfulls.]
\p
\v 48 . And he gathered all the food of the seven years, [i.e. all manner of eatable grains and fruits; and so in the sequel. Understand this of the fifth part, as above verse 34.] and put the food into the Cities: the food of the field of every City, which was round about her, he did put within there. [Heb. Into her midst.]
\p
\v 49 . Thus Joseph brought together very much Corn, as the sand of the Sea, [this phrase implies an exceeding great quantity, past counting, above chap. 22. 17. Jud. 7. 12. 1 Sam. 13. 5.] until they ceased to tell (or, count); for there was no number. [i.e. it was past numbering. So likewise Jud. 6. 5. Job. 21. 33.]
\p
\v 50 . And unto Joseph two sons were born, before a year of the famine came, whom Asnath, the daughter of Potiphera, the Chief, (or, Governour) of On, did bear unto him.
\p
\v 51 . And Joseph called the name of the first-born, Manasse: [Heb. Menasscheh, i.e. making to forget] for, (said he), God hath made me to forget all my toil, and all my fathers house, [ i.e. the vexation and toil and trouble I have been exercised with, as well here in Egypt, as in my father’s house.]
\p
\v 52 . And the name of the second, he called Ephraim: [i.e. double fruit.] for, (said he), God hath made me to grow in the land of my oppression. [i.e. in this very land, wherein I have been much opprest before.]
\p
\v 53 . Then the seven years of abundance, that had been in the land of Egypt, ended.
\p
\v 54 . And the seven years of famine began to come on; even as Joseph had said: and there was famine in all countries [viz. lying round about; such as were Canaan, Syria, Arabia, & c. as below verse 57.] but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. [i.e. all manner of eatable grain, and fruits for the food of man.]
\p
\v 55 . Now when all the land of Egypt suffered famine, [viz. when the particular provision of the inhabitants was spent] the people cried to Pharao for bread: and Pharao said to all Egyptians; go to Joseph, do what he tells you.
\p
\v 56 . And when the famine was over all the land, then Joseph opened all, where there was (somewhat) in, [viz. all the store-houses, where the corn and provision was gathered and laid up.] and sold to the Egyptians: for the famine grew strong in the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 57 . And all Countries, [viz. the neighbouring countries round about, as before verse 54.] came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy: for the famine was strong in all land) came, etc. (veniebant,) i.e. the inhabitants of all the bordering Countries,]
\c 42
\s Jacob hearing, that there was Corn to be had in Egypt, sends all his sons thither, but Benjamin; v. 1, etc. They bow before Joseph, whom they knew not, but he them well enough; he speaks harshly to them, and imprisons them for Spies, 6. Yet at last conditioning, they should bring Benjamin to him, and keeping Simon in custody, he lets them return home with Corn and their money to boot: in the mean time, their sin committed on Joseph, awakes and checks them, 18. By the way homeward, one finds his money in his Sack, 27. At home they tell Jacob what happened to them, and find all their money returned, 29. They labour hard to persuade Jacob, that he would let Benjamin go back with them to Egypt, but he makes great complaint, and cannot resolve on it, 36.
\p
\v 1 When Jacob saw, [i.e. heard and understood, by common fame, and observed by what was bought and brought thence] that there was Corn in Egypt, [or, provision, victual. The Hebrew word comes from a root signifying to break, it being provision and victual, but especially bread, which breaks the force of hunger and famine.] then said Jacob to his sons; why look yee one upon another? [as men destitute of help and advice, who sit musing and plodding, wasting much time, but come to no certain resolution, nor set about the work before them.]
\p
\v 2 . Moreover he said; behold I have heard, that there is Corn in Egypt: go yee down thither, and buy us (corn) thence, that we may live, and not die.
\p
\v 3 . Then Josephs ten brethren went down for to buy Corn out of Egypt.
\p
\v 4 . Yet Benjamin, Josephs brother, Jacob did not send with his brethren: for he said, [viz. by himself, i.e. he thought thus. See abo. Ch. 20. On v. 11.] lest peradventure mischief [i.e. some deadly accident such as befell his brother Joseph before, whom he still supposed to be dead.] meet him.
\p
\v 5 . Thus Israel’s sons came to buy, among those that came there: [Heb. in the midst of the coming, i.e. together with, or, in company along with others, that were coming from the land of Canaan for to buy provision. The reason is presently given in the words following.] for there was famine in the land of Canaan.
\p
\v 6 . Joseph now was Ruler over that land; he sold to all people of the land: and Joseph’s brethren came, and bowed themselves before him: [to show him Civil honour and respect. See above chap. 18. On verse 2. And compare herewith, the former dreams of Joseph, chap. 37. 7, 8.] (with) the faces to the ground.
\p
\v 7 . When Joseph saw his brethren, he knew them; but he showed himself strange towards them, [thereby the better to discover their state and condition, especially that of his father and brother.] and spoke harsh with them; [see below verse 9, 11, 12. This he did, partly to understand the truth the better, how it fared with his father, and his brother Benjamin; partly to rouze them up to an acknowledgement of the sin, they had committed against him.] and said to them; whence come yee? And they said; out of the land of Canaan, to buy food.
\p
\v 8 . And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew him not.
\p
\v 9 . Then Joseph remembered the dreams, which he had dreamt of them; and he said to them, yee are Spies, yee are come to view, where the land is bare. [Heb. the bareness, or, nakedness of the land, i.e. to see where the Country lies most open and naked, or is least provided and fenced, for an enemy to invade the same, or to surprise some places, or to over-run the land to spoil and plunder it.]
\p
\v 10 . And they said to him; No my Lord, but thy servants are come to buy food.
\p
\v 11 . We are all of us the sons of one man, we are honest; thy servants are no Spies.
\p
\v 12 . And he said to them: No; but yee are come to view, where the land is bare.
\p
\v 13 . And they said; we thy servants were twelve brethren, one man’s sons in the land of Canaan: [here now Joseph begins to learn, what he aimed at by all this strict examination.] and behold, the least [Heb. the little (one) i.e. the youngest, viz. Benjamin. Compare above chap. 19. On verse 31.] is this day with our Father: yet the one, he is no (more). [meaning Joseph, whom they held to be dead, as appears below verse 22. And ch. 44. 20.]
\p
\v 14 . Then said Joseph to them: that is it; that I spoke unto you, saying; Ye are Spies. [They having made mention already, of two other brethren, whereof the one should be alive yet; he is the more eager to press his former charge upon them, seeking by that means, to get his brother Benjamin to him.]
\p
\v 15 . Herein shall ye be tried: [i.e. By this I shall see, whether yee speak the truth, and deal uprightly with me, or whether ye are Spies indeed.] (as true as) Pharao liveth; [Heb. Pharao’s life, or, Pharao liveth. This is an imperfect speech, which may be supplied thus; as sure as it is that Pharao lives, so certain is that which I tell you. Compare 1 Sam. 1. 26. Others take these words to be an oath, made after the manner of the Egyptians, by Pharao’s life; so that Joseph, out of human frailty, (as may happen to good men) should have followed them therein.] if yee shall go forth hence.
\p Unless it be, when your least brother shall be come hither. [This now seemeth to be an Oath, made after the manner of the Hebrews, whereupon must be understood then, God do this or that unto me, if yee, etc. See above chap. 14. On verse 23. And compare 1 Sam. 17. 55. 2 Kings 2. 2. Ezech. 33. 11.]
\p
\v 16 . Send one of you to fetch your brother: but be yee prisoners, [Heb. bound, i.e. as for you, ye shall remain my prisoners the while in this place.] and your words shall be tried, whether the truth be with you: and if not, (as true as) Pharao lives, [See the Note on the verse fore-going,] then yee are Spies.
\p
\v 17 . And he put them together [Heb. gathered them] into custody for three days.
\p
\v 18 . And, on the third day, Joseph said to them: do this, then yee shall live: [i.e. do what I shall tell you; then shall yee take care for your lives, and welfare, that ye may not be taken for Spies, and suffer accordingly.] I fear God.
\p
\v 19 . If ye be honest, let one of your brethren [Heb. one brother of you, or, your brother one] be bound in the house of your custody: and go your ways, bring [or, carry] the Corn for the famine of your houses. [Heb. the Corn of the famine of your houses; i.e. that which is needful for the famine of your households and families.]
\p
\v 20 . And bring your least brother unto me, so shall your words be made true, and ye shall not die: and they did so.
\p
\v 21 . Then said they the one to the other; Verily, we are guilty in (regard of) our brother, [Oth. However, howbeit: as if they said; though we seek to hide it, yet we find and feel now, that God comes to call us to an account for it.] whose souls distress we saw, when he entreated us for mercy, but we hearkened not unto him: [this passage is not rehearsed indeed by Moseh, above chap. 37. But here they confess it themselves, that it was thus.] therefore comes this distress comes this distress upon us.
\p
\v 22 . And Ruben answered them, saying; did not I tell it you, when I said; Sin not in this youth, but ye hearkened not: and his blood also, it is sought? [By the blood, is understood the guilt and punishment of his death. See 1 Kings 2. 32, 33, etc. thus, to seek, or, require blood, is to punish and avenge it. See 2 Chron. 24. 22. Ezech. 3. 18. Luke 11. 50. It seems they all thought that Joseph was dead now, though they had made Ruben believe it formerly, when he came to draw him out of the pit and found him not, they having sold him away. See above chap. 37. 29.]
\p
\v 23 . And they knew not, that Joseph heard [i.e. understood what they said; see above chap. 11. On ver. 7.] for there was an interpreter between them. [Joseph made show, as if he did not understand the Hebrew tongue, for to be the less suspected or discovered by his brethren.]
\p
\v 24 . Then he turned himself about from them, and wept: [partly; out of natural affection, being of the same blood and birth with them; and partly for the discourse and debates sake which his brethren had together concerning him.] afterwards, he turned to them again, and spoke to them, and took Simeon, [the eldest but one among the sons of Jacob: whom some conceive to have been the rudest against Joseph, as he had been the principal in the murder of Sichem. Ruben the eldest is spared, for having been less guilty in the case of Joseph, and being the fittest man, to conduct his brethren home again.] and bound him [viz. by his servant or guard, upon his order.] before their eyes.
\p
\v 25 . And Joseph gave charge to fill their sacks [The Hebrew word signifies all manner of vessels, sacks, bags, packs, or the like; wherein something is put in, or packet up.] with Corn, and to return them their money [Heb. Their silverlings, or monies] to every one in his sack, and to give them provision for the way; and they did so to them. [or, thus he did unto them.]
\p
\v 26 . And they laded their Corn upon their asses; and went from thence.
\p
\v 27 . When one (of them) opened his sack, for to give his ass provender in the Inn, he saw his money, for, behold it was in the mouth of the sack.
\p
\v 28 . And he said to his brethren ; My money is returned withal, loe it is in my sack: then their heart failed them, [Heb. Their heart went out, i.e. the vigour of their heart forsook it, as it happens in fainting and swooning. Compare 1 Kings 10. 5. And the Annotation.] and they were frighted, [see above chap. 7. On verse 33.] saying one to another; [Heb. The man to his brother.] What is this (that) God hath done to us? [or, how hath and all the former, lately happened to them, that God was displeased with them.]
\p
\v 29 . And they came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their Father: and they have him to understand all what happened to them [besides what they concealed, not to frighten their father too much.] saying:
\p
\v 30 . That man, the Lord of that land, spoke harsh with us: and he held us [Heb. He gave, delivered, or, put us ] as Spies of the land.
\p
\v 31 . But we said to him; we are honest, we are no Spies.
\p
\v 32 . We were twelve brethren, our father’s sons; the one is no (more) and the least is to day with our father in the land of Canaan.
\p
\v 33 . And that man, the LORD of that land, said to us, Hereby shall I acknowledge, that ye re honest: leave one of your brethren with me, and take for the famine of your houses, [Heb. Take the famine of your houses. See above verse 19.] and go your way.
\p
\v 34 . And bring your least brother with you, then shall I know, that ye are no Spies, but that ye are honest: your brother I shall restore unto you, and ye shall traffique in this land. [See above chap. 34. Verse 10.]
\p
\v 35 . And it came to pass, when they emptied their sacks, behold then every one had the bundle of his money in his sack; and they saw the bundles of their money, they and their father, and they were afraid. [viz. lest they should be charged with theft, or cheating. Compare below chap. 43. 18.]
\p
\v 36 . Then said Jacob their father to them; Ye bereave me of children: Joseph he is not, and Simeon, he is not; [He counts him likewise already lost, fearing he would not easily get free again out of his prison, and might perhaps be in danger of his life there.] now ye will take away Benjamin; all these things are against me.
\p
\v 37 . Then said Ruben to his Father, saying; put to death [This Proposition was altogether unlawful and unnatural, therefore Jacob doth not accept thereof] two of my sons, [viz. two of four, namely below, ch. 46. 9.] if I do not bring him to thee back again. Give (or put) him into my hand, and I shall bring him again to thee.
\p
\v 38 . But he said; My son shall not go down with you: for his brother is dead [as he conceived. See above cha. 37. On verse 33. And 35.] and he is left over alone [viz. of the children of Rachel.] if a mischief [see above v. 4.] should meet him on the way, which ye shall go, yee would make my grey hairs [Heb. My grainess, (canities)] to go down into the grave [see above cha. 37. On v. 35.] with grief.
\c 43
\s Jacob being prest by famine, and his sons importunity, especially the remonstrance of Juda; he gives way at length for Benjamin’s going along with them into Egypt, with presents for the Governour, and double money to satisfy the former mistake, v. 1. Etc. Joseph seeing Benjamin among the rest, causeth them to be brought to his house; whereat they being troubled, and afraid it was about the money they had back in their sacks, they make their application to Joseph’s Steward, who bids them be of good cheer, 16. They prepare and bring in the presents to Joseph, who speaks kindly to them, especially with Benjamin, whereby he is so moved, that he must retire to weep; after which he entertains them with a very solemn Feast, but Benjamin in an especial manner, 23.
\p
\v 1 The famine now grew heavy in that Country: [viz. the land of Canaan, and others thereabout.]
\p
\v 2 . So it happened, when they had eaten up the Provision [Heb. when they ended, or, made an end to eat, i.e. when their provision was near spent] which they had brought out of Egypt, that their father said to them: Turn again, buy us a little food.
\p
\v 3 . Then Juda spoke to him, saying : That man [viz. the Lord of Egypt, as also above chap. 42. 33. And here verse 5, 6, 7, & c.] hath in the highest manner testified unto us, [Hebr. Testifying hath testified] saying; Ye shall not see my face, [i.e. ye shall not be admitted into my presence. See this phrase likewise, 2 Sam. 14. 24, 28, 32. Acts 20. 25, 38.] unless your brother be with you [Benjamin namely]
\p
\v 4 . If thou sendest our brother with us, we will go down, and buy thee food.
\p
\v 5 . But if thou send (him) not, we shall not go down : for that man told us: Ye shall not see my face, unless your brother be with you.
\p
\v 6 . And Israel said; wherefore did ye so ill by me: that ye told that man whether [or, telling that man, that] ye had brother yet?
\p
\v 7 . And they said: That man enquired very narrowly after us [Heb. asking he asked] and after our kindred, saying; lives your father yet? Have ye a brother yet? So we told him according to the same words. [Heb. after the mouth of the same words, i.e. according as those questions did require.] did we know justly, that he would say, bring down your brother?
\p
\v 8 . Then said Juda to Israel his Father; Send the youth with me; then we shall get us up and journey; that we may live, and not die, [viz. of famine] neither we, nor thou, nor our little children.
\p
\v 9 . I will be surety for him; from my hand shalt thou require him: if I do not bring him to thee, and set him before thy face, I shall have sinned against thee all days [i.e. be guilty and blame-worthy all the days of my life. Thus the word, to sin, or be a sinner, is taken below ch. 44. 32. 1 Kings 1. 21.]
\p
\v 10 . For had we not delayed, verily, we might have been returned twice.
\p
\v 11 . Then said Israel their father to them; is thus now? Then do this; [as if he said: If this be the case, or if things be thus conditioned, then let it be done in God’s name] Take of the most commendable [i.e. that which for its worth and goodness is most commended and esteemed. Some hold this to be mearnt of very rare and excellent fruit, which were to be cut off from the trees] of this land, into your vessels, and carry down a present to that man; a little balm, [see of this and some following spiciries, above chap. 37. On verse 25.] and a little honey, spiciries, myrrhe, turpentine, nuts, [Oth. Pine-apple-nuts, or, hazel-nuts.] and almonds.
\p
\v 12 . And take double money [i.e. as much again as formerly, the death being much increased since, above verse 1.] in your hand: and the money which returned in the mouth of your sacks, carry again in your hand; per-adventure it is a failing. [i.e. it may have come to pass by some mistake or other, that the money was returned into your sacks thus.]
\p
\v 13 . Take likewise your brother along: and get you up, return to that man.
\p
\v 14 . And God the Almighty [see above chap. 17. Ver. 1] give you mercy before the face of that man, that he may let your other brother and Benjamin go with you: and if he said: if it must be so, that my children be kept from me, the Lord’s will be done, I remit the issue of this business wholly unto him. See the like kind of expression, Esth. 4. 16. Oth. As I am bereft of children, (viz. of Joseph and Simeon) lo I am bereft. [viz. of Benjamin too)]
\p
\v 15 . And those men took that present, and took double money in their hand, and Benjamin: and they gate them up, and went down to Egypt, and they stood before the face of Joseph.
\p
\v 16 . When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to him, that was over his house; Bring these men home, and slay slaughter-cattle, [Heb. slay slaying, i.e. of such cattle as is used to be slain for man’s food. Compare Prov. 9. 2.] and make it ready: for these men shall dine with me.
\p
\v 17 . The man now did as Joseph had said, and the man brought these men to Joseph’s house.
\p
\v 18 . Then these men were afraid, for being brought to Joseph’s house, [They knew not that they were invited to dinner there, but conceived, they should be secured in the house, and be charged with, or punished for the money carried back.] and said; we are brought in by reason of that money was returned into our sacks at the beginning: [i.e. in our first Journey hither. See above chap. 42. 25.] that he may surprise us [or, rowl, or welter himself over us, i.e. cast an heavy charge upon us to our confusion and ruin, even as a body remains opprest, when an heavy burden lights upon him,] and fall upon us, and ensnare us [it is held, that the Egyptians were wont to punish theft with slavery] together with our asses.
\p
\v 19 . Therefore they drew near to that man, that was over Joseph’s house: [viz. for to excuse themselves, before any charge should be laid against them for that money] and they spoke to him, at the door of the house.
\p
\v 20 . And they said; O my Lord: [The Hebrew phrase here is commonly used by those, who being in any distress, address themselves for advice or relief to a deed come down [Heb. descending, we descended] in the beginning, [see above on verse 18.] for to buy food.
\p
\v 21 . Now it happened, when we came into the Inn, and we opened our sacks, behold every one’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in its weight: [They relate the matter here not just so, nor so distinctly, as the same did happen; for, but one of them had found his money in his sack by the way, and the rest at home, above chap. 42. Verse 27, 35. But it seems, they did it here in his manner, either for brevities sake, or in subtilty.] and we have brought the same again in our hand.
\p
\v 22 . We have likewise brought down other money in our hand, to buy food: we know not who laid our money in our sacks.
\p
\v 23 . And he said; Peace be unto you; [or, peace shall be to you, i.e. your case is safe and good, ye need not fear, be of good cheer.] Your God, and your Father’s God [it should seem that this servant was instructed in the true Religion by Joseph] hath given you a treasure [or, some hidden matter] into your sacks; your money is to come to me: [i.e. I have received your money] and he brought Simon forth unto them.
\p
\v 24 . After that, the man brought these men into Joseph’s house, and he gave water, and they washed their feet: [see above chap. 18. Verse 4.] he gave likewise provender to their asses.
\p
\v 25 . And they prepared the present, until Joseph came at noon: for they had heard, that they should eat bread there. [i.e. stay at dinner, or take their repast there. See above chap. 31. On verse 54.]
\p
\v 26 . Now when Joseph was come home, they brought him the present, which was in their hand, into the house: and they bowed themselves down [see above chap. 37. Verse 7.] before him to the ground.
\p
\v 27 . And he enquired after (their) welfare. [Heb. asked them after the peace, i.e. concerning their welfares; or, how it went with them since. So Exod. 18. 7. Jud. 18. 15. 1 Sam. 25. 5. Of the word peace. See above ch. 29. On verse 6.] the old (man) of whom ye spoke? Doth he live yet?
\p
\v 28 . And they said; it is well with thy servant our Father, he lives yet: and they inclined the head, and bowed themselves down.
\p
\v 29 . And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother’s son, and said; is this your least brother, of whom ye spoke to me? Then he said; God be gracious to thee, my son. [Thus he calls him, out of kindness and affection, after the manner of them, who, being more advanced in age and gravity, or authority, find cause to speak friendly and kindly to those of younger years and meaner condition.]
\p
\v 30 . And Joseph made haste: for his bowels were kindled toward his brother, [the bowels of a man do properly signify his inward parts, such as are the heart, are much moved, and heated, when one hath an object of pity and compassion itself, as proceeding from the inmost of the heart of man, 1 Kings 3. 26. Phil. 2. 5. Col. 3. 12.] and he sought to weep: and he went into a Chamber and wept there.
\p
\v 31 . After that, he wasted his face, and came forth : and he forced himself [viz. from weeping. See cha. 45. Verse 1.] and said; Set up the bread. [i.e. serve in the meat, bring up dinner.]
\p
\v 32 . And they set up before him [Joseph] apart, [in token of his dignity, and for the respect, due to his place.] and for them [Joseph his brethren ] apart; and for the Egyptians, that did eat with him, apart: for the Egyptians may eat no bread with the Hebrews, because the same is an abomination to the Egyptians. [in regard of their idolatrous Religion, whereby they exhibited divine worship to calves, oxen, & c. whom the Hebrews did slay and eat. Compare below, chap. 46. Verse 34. Ex. 8. 26.]
\p
\v 33 . And they sat before his face, [i.e. over against him.] the first-born according to his primogeniture, and the younger according to his youth: [Heb. the little (one) according to his littleness.] of which the men marveled [not only that Joseph showed them so much honour, but especially, that they were placed all, every one according to his age and seniority, which they conceived, was altogether unknown to him] among themselves [Heb. the man to his neighbour.]
\p
\v 34 . And he reached them of the messes, that were before him: but Benjamin’s mess was five times greater, than the messes of Benjamin above the messes of them all: [Heb. he multiplied the messes of Benjamin above the messes of them all, five hands, i.e. by five parts, five times as much.] and they drank, and they were drunk with him [i.e. they were merry and cheerful. The Hebrew word doth not always signify to over-charge one’s self with excess of wine; but sometimes only to be cheered with the drinking of it. See Psalm 104. 15. Cant. 5. 1. Hag. 1. 6. As also the Greek word is taken, John 2. 10.]
\c 44
\s Joseph dismisseth his brethren, having caused every one’s money to be put into his sack again, and his own up into Benjamin’s besides, v. 1. Etc. after that they are pursued and charged with theft by him, whereat being greatly perplexed, they ignorantly make themselves and the guilty one, liable to punishment, 4. The Cup is found in Benjamin’s sack, whereat being much astonished, they return to Joseph, submitting themselves to his punishment: yet Juda speaks much and earnestly in Benjamin’s behalf, assaying to remain in his stead, 12.
\p
\v 1 And he [ Joseph namely] charged him that was over his house, saying; Fill the sacks of these men with food, according as they shall be able to carry, and put each man’s money into the mouth of his sack.
\p
\v 2 . And my cup, [This seems to have been a Cup, high large, and deep, and of great value, having its name, from the roundness and height.] the silver Cup thou shalt put into the mouth of the least his sack, [i.e. Benjamin’s] with the money of his corn, [i.e. that money which he had brought to buy provision withal] and be did according to Joseph’s word, which he had spoken.
\p
\v 3 . In the morning when it grew light, these men were let go, (or dismiss) they and their asses.
\p
\v 4 . They went forth the City, they were not gone far, when Joseph said to him, that was over his house: Get thee up, and pursue after these men, and when thou shalt have overtaken them, thou shalt say to them, wherefore have yee requited evil for good?
\p
\v 5 . Is it not the same [Cup, namely] out of which my Lord drinketh? And whereby he shall surely observe (somewhat) [or whereby he shall surely try or find out, viz. what manner of men ye are. Heb. observing should observe. The Hebrew word doth sometimes indeed signify to observe something by vain and unwarranted arts, thus to discover or foretell secret and hidden things, as Lev. 19. 26. 2 Kings 21. 6. But it likewise often signifies, prudently to observe and find out things, and by certain marks and evidences to trace and discover them, as above chap. 30. 27. 1 Kings 20. 33. And so it is taken here. Oth. Whereof he shall surely be informed, and so verse 15.] ye have done ill, (in) that ye have done.
\p
\v 6 . And he overtook them; and spoke to them the same words. [viz. which Joseph had charged him with.]
\p
\v 7 . And they [i.e. one of them in all their names, therefore it follows, my LORD speak such words? [Heb. after those words] far be it from thy servants, that they should do such a thing. [Heb. from doing after this word, or, thing.]
\p
\v 8 . Behold, the money which we found in the mouth of our sacks, we have brought back again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal silver or gold out of thy Master’ house?
\p
\v 9 . With whom of thy servant’s it shall be found, let him die: and we also shall be slaves to my Lord [i.e. not only die the thief, whoever he be, shall die, but we will all be made slaves besides. See above chap. 43. 17. Thus not being conscious of any guilt, they speak more confidently, than warily, not dreaming, nor suspecting of any trick or deceit that might have been put upon them, as formerly the money was conveyed into their sacks; nor weighing or considering what grief might seize upon their father by such a case.]
\p
\v 10 . And he said; Be this now also thus, [Oth. This is right now likewise, & c.] according to your words: [understand this concerning the search to be made themselves liable to, he did moderate.] with whom it shall be found, the same shall be my slave, but ye shall be guiltless. [i.e. free from punishment, and at liberty to return home unmolested. See Exod. 20. 7. And 34. 7.]
\p
\v 11 . And they made haste; and every one set his sack upon the ground; and every one opened his sack.
\p
\v 12 . And he searched, beginning with the greatest, [This he did of purpose, to hold them the longer in pain about the issue, and to be the less suspected by them; for he knew well enough, where he should find the Cup, having put it up himself.] and ending with the least: and that Cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.
\p
\v 13 . Then they rent their garments [viz. for grief over the trespass which Benjamin seemed to have committed, and for fear as well of that punishment, which Joseph was like to inflict on him, as of the heaviness, which would redound thence upon their father; of rending of garments, see above chap. 37. On verse 29.] and every man laded his ass, and they returned to the City.
\p
\v 14 . And Juda came with his brethren into Joseph’s house, for he was yet there himself: [Joseph namely, waiting for the success and issue of this affair, above verse 5.] and they fell down before his face to the ground.
\p
\v 15 . And Joseph said to them, what deed is this, which ye have done? Know ye not, that such a man as I, should surely observe (that)? [see above on verse 5.]
\p
\v 16 . Then said Juda; what shall we say to my Lord? What shall we speak? And what shall we justify our selves? [Other wherewith shall we justify our selves? The Hebrew Verb here used, (as likewise another coming from the same root) signifies to count, or speak (one) free, and declare him guiltless, after what manner a person arraigned for a certain misdeed, is pronounced clear, and acquitted by the Judge. See this signification, Exod. 23. 7. Deut. 25. 1. Psalm 31. 6. Prov. 17. 15. Isa. 5. 23. Compare Mat. 11. 19. Rom. 3. 20. Gal. 2. 16. And chap. 3. 8. & c.] God hath found the unrighteousness of thy servants; [i.e. he hath observed the same by his Providence, and brought it to light now. Understand this not of the present dead, wherein they knew themselves not guilty, but of some other, for which their conscience checked them, and which God now punished in them.] behold we are my Lord’s bond-slaves, both we, and he, in whose hand [i.e. with whom] the Cup was found.
\p
\v 17 . But he said; far be it from me to do this: the man in whose hand the Cup is found, he shall be my bond-slaves; but, go ye up in peace [i.e. with friendship and concord, without any prejudice and detriment to your persons or goods. Compare above chapter 26. 29, 31. 2 Sam. 3. 21.] to your father.
\p
\v 18 . Then Juda drew near to him, and said; O my Lord, [See above chap. 43. 20.] let thy Servant, I pray, speak one word before the ears of my Lord, and let not thy wrath be kindled against thy Servant; for thou art even as Pharao. [Heb. like thou, like Pharao, i.e. Thou art of as great authority and power as Pharao is, whose person thou dost represent; in which regard I owe thee as much respect and awe, as to the King himself. See this kind of speaking, above chap. 18. 25. Juda calleth his brother Joseph here & in the following verses, his Lord: and ten times he calleth himself, his Father, and all his Brethren, Joseph’s Servants; which he doth indeed of humility and reverence, but withal fulfills thereby the dreams of Joseph, above chap. 37. 7, 9.]
\p
\v 19 . My Lord did ask his Servants, saying; Have ye a Father, or Brother?
\p
\v 20 . Then said we to my Lord; we have an old Father, and a youth [Compare above chap. 37. 3. The word jelled betokens indeed very young children, even such are new-born, as above chap. 21. 8. Exod. 1. 17. And 2. 8. But it is likewise used of reasonably aged persons; as of Joseph, when he was seventeen years old, above chap. 37. Verse 30. Of all the children of Jacob, when Ruben was about fourteen, above chap. 33. 1. And here of Benjamin, being about twenty four.] of old age, [i.e. one that was born in the fathers old age] the least: whose brother is dead, and he is alone left over his mother, and his father loves him.
\p
\v 21 . Then saidest thou to thy Servants; Bring him down to me; that I may cast my eye upon him: [or, set my eye upon me; that I may cast my eye upon him: [or, set my eye upon him, i.e. that I may see him my self, and discover the truth of your sayings: See above chap. 41. V. 15, 16. Sometimes this phrase is used for to show grace and favour, as Jer. 39. 12. And chap. 40. 4.]
\p
\v 22 . And we said to my Lord; That youth shall not be able to forsake his father: [for the father would not give way to it] if he forsake his father, he [viz. the father] shall die.
\p
\v 23 . Then saidest thou to thy Servants; If your least brother come not down with you, ye shall see my face no more. [Heb. not add, or continue to see my face, see above chap. 43. 5.]
\p
\v 24 . And it came to pass, when we went up to thy Servant, my Father, and we related my Lord his words unto him:
\p
\v 25 . And that our Father had said; Return, buy us a little food:
\p
\v 26 . We then said; we shall not dare to go down: if our least brother be with us, then we shall go down; for we shall not be able to see that man’s face, if our least brother be not with us.
\p
\v 27 . Then said thy Servant, my Father, to us; Yee know, that my wife [Viz. Rachel, see below chap. 46. On verse 19] bare me two: [viz. two sons, Joseph and Benjamin.]
\p
\v 28 . And the one is gone forth from me, and I said; indeed, he is assuredly torn; [Heb. tearing torn, here Joseph begins to understand, what his brethren had made Jacob believe concerning himself. Insomuch that to this day he knew not otherwise, but Joseph was torn by wild beast.] and I have not seen him hitherto.
\p
\v 29 . Now, if ye take this also away from my face, and a mischief meet him, then shall ye cause my gray hairs to go down with grief into the grave, [see above chap. 37. Verse 35. And below verse 31.]
\p
\v 30 . Now then, when I come to thy Servant, my Father, and the youth is not with me, (being, that his soul is bound to this his soul). [i.e. being he loves him so entirely and tenderly, even as his own heart: so the like phrase, 1 Sam. 18. 1.]
\p
\v 31 . Then shall it come to pass, when he seeth, that the youth is not there, that he shall die: and thy Servants shall cause the gray hairs of thy Servant, our Father, to go down into the grave with heaviness.
\p
\v 32 . For thy Servant, [i.e. I myself] is Surety for this youth, with my father, [Heb. from by my Father; that is, as some interpret it, when he departed from his Father] saying; If I bring him not again unto thee, then I shall have sinned against my Father all days: [i.e. I shall be esteemed guilty and worthy of punishment, by my Father, all the days of my life, as above chap. 43. 9. See the note there.]
\p
\v 33 . Now then, let thy Servant [i.e. my self] (I pray) remain my Lord’s bond-slave, for this youth; and let the youth go up with his brethren. [Juda shows here a most singular tenderness towards his Father, and no small love to his brother Benjamin.]
\p
\v 34 . For how should I go up to my Father, if the youth were not with me? That I may not se woe shall come upon my Father. [Heb. find him, i.e. surprise, invade, happen to, light upon him. See this phrase, Ex. 18. 8. Deut. 4. 30. Esth. 8. 6. Job 31. 29, etc. All this relation of Juda, did so touch and affect the heart of Joseph, that he was not able to refrain himself any longer from tears, and discovering of himself unto his brethren.]
\c 45
\s Joseph at length discovers himself to his brethren, and comforts them with God’s wonderful Providence; chargeth them to acquaint his Father with all the occurrences, and to bring him into Egypt, v. 1, etc. the like Pharao also himself doth, 16. Joseph dispacheth them with Charets, Provision, and Presents, especially for his Father, and gives them good instructions, 21. Coming home, they relate all to their Father, who at last believes it, and prepares himself with joyfulness for the journey, 25.
\p
\v 1 Then Joseph was not able to constrain himself [viz. from weeping, as formerly he had done, chap. 43. 31.] before all those that stood by him; and he cried, Cause all men [This he doth to preserve his own and his brethren’s honour, and credit, lest they should hear by him, that he was sold, and by his brethren, that they sold him] go forth from me; [Heb. from with, or, beside me, i.e. out of my presence.] and there stood none by him [but only his brethren] when Joseph made himself known to his brethren.
\p
\v 2 . And he did lift up [Heb. give] his voice with weeping; so that the Egyptians heard it, [those, viz. which but newly withdrew themselves, and were not far off yet from the place.] and that Pharao’s house heard it. [i.e. his Courtiers, who presently had the news imparted to them, as below verse 16.]
\p
\v 3 . And Joseph said to his brethren; I am Joseph: doth my Father live yet? And his brothers were not able to answer him; [by reason of the consciousness of their trespass against Joseph, and his present power, and authority, to be avenged upon them, if he pleased.] for they were terrified before his face.
\p
\v 4 . And Joseph said to his brethren; Draw near unto me, I pray; and they drew near: then said he; I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold for Egypt. [See above chap. 37. 28.]
\p
\v 5 . But now, be not dismaid, and let not (anger) [or, sadness, or, spitefulness, or any other evil passion: Compare above chap. 31. 35.] kindle in your eyes, [or, let it vex, nor trouble, nor perplex or displease you. Or, do not show your selves dis-affected in your carriage and behavior.] that ye sold me hither: for God hath sent me before your face [viz. by his wife, good, and Almighty Providence, turning your evil intent to a good end; as he did likewise in after-times, with the proceedings and practices of Saul, 1 Sam. 19. 9. Of Absalom, 2 Sam. 17. 14. Of the enemies of Job, chap. 1. 21. Of the Jews, Acts 2. 23. & c. See 2 Sam. 12. On verse 12.] for the preservation of life [viz. of your own. Oth. For livelihood; as Jud. 6. 4. And 17. 10.]
\p
\v 6 . For there are now two years of famine (past) in the midst of the land; [i.e. throughout the whole land] and there are five years yet (to come), in which there shall be no ploughing, nor reaping, (or, harvest.)
\p
\v 7 . Yet God hath sent me before your face, [Compare above chap. 32. The Annot. On verse 3.] to set you a remainder upon the earth, [i.e. that ye may be preserved in this general calamity, and your posterity may remain after you. Oth. That there might remain somewhat, whereby to sustain ourselves.] and to keep you alive by a great deliverance. [Oth. To, or, for a great deliverance, or escaping, which is called great, in regard of the extraordinary and wonderful work of divine Providence, so clearly showed forth, in compassing the same; as also by reason of the great mercy exhibited hereby to the Israelites, that should be preserved in great number.]
\p
\v 8 . Now then, Ye have not sent me hitherward, but God himself, [i.e. it was not your intent, nor purpose, to make me a Gorvenor of Egypt; but God hath done it, directing your work to your own good] who set me to (be) a Father to Pharao [i.e. his principal Counsellor of State, who should steer and guide his affairs with a Fatherly care, and whom he should regard as a Father.] and a Lord over all his house, and Ruler in all the land of Egypt:
\p
\v 9 . Make haste, and go up to my Father, and say to him, Thus saith thy son Joseph: God hath set (or settled) me a Lord to all the Land of Egypt; come down to me, and delay not. [Heb. stand not, or, do not abide standing.]
\p
\v 10 . And thou shalt dwell in the land of Gosen, [a Country, situated in Egypt, near the land of Canaan, very fruitful, and abounding with pastures, and therefore very commodious for such as abounded and dealt in cattle] thou, and thy sons, and thy sons sons, and thy sheep, and thy oxen, and all that thou hast.
\p
\v 11 . And I will entertain thee there shall be five years of famine yet, that he impoverish not [i.e. perish not through poverty.] thou, and thy house, and all that thou hast.
\p
\v 12 . And behold, your eyes see it, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin; that my mouth speaks to you. [i.e. that I speak unto you now myself, not by an Interpreter, in a strange tongue, but by own tongue in your own language.]
\p
\v 13 . And relate unto my Father all my glory in Egypt, and all what ye have seen, and make haste, and bring my Father down hither.
\p
\v 14 . And he fell upon Benjamin his brother’s neck [Heb. necks. Compare above chap. 33. Verse 4.] and wept: and Benjamin wept on his neck.
\p
\v 15 . And he kissed [See above chap. 29. 11. And 31. 28.] all his brethren, and he wept over them: [viz. while he lay on their necks and kissed them] and after that, his brethren spoke with him. [Seeing now Joseph’s upright and hearty affection, they cheer up, and begin to speak somewhat more freely and familiarly with him.]
\p
\v 16 . When this report [Heb. voice. Thus the same word is taken likewise, Jer. 10. 22. Acts 2. 6. & c.] was heard in Pharao’s house, that they said; Joseph’s brethren are come; it was good in the eyes of Pharao, and in the eyes of his servants. [i.e. they were well pleased with it.]
\p
\v 17 . And Pharao said to Joseph; Tell your brethren; Do this; lad your beasts, and go your way, get you to the land of Canaan:
\p
\v 18 . And take your father, and your households, [Heb. houses, as verse 11.] and come to me; and I will give you to the best of the land of Egypt, [Heb. the good, i.e. the best and most fruitful part of it.] and ye shall eat the fat of this land. [i.e. the most pleasant, and most excellent things, which God produceth out of and upon the earth for the sustenance and comfort of man’s life. Compare Num. 18. 12, 29, 30. Deut. 32. 14. Psalm 147. 14.]
\p
\v 19 . Thou hast indeed the charge [thou, viz. Joseph, i.e. thou hast commission & sufficient authority for it, to see all this performed, in my name.] do this, [this is again in the plural number, and hath respect to Joseph’s brethren.] take you charets out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
\p
\v 20 . And let not your eye spare your household-stuff; [i.e. let it not be grievous to you, to leave somewhat of your household-stuff and implements behind; or, that it may spoil by the way; or, that ye may not be able to put it off, in this time of death, according to its worth and value.] for the best of all the land of Egypt, that shall be yours.
\p
\v 21 . And the sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them charets, according to Pharao’s command [Heb. mouth] also, he gave them provision for the way.
\p
\v 22 . He gave to all of them, to each (man) changing garments: [Heb. change, or exchange of garments; i.e. such as were not for daily and ordinary use; such as great Lord’s and Princes were wont to give and present to them, whom they mearnt to honour or reward, Jud. 19. Vers. 12, 19. 2 Kings 5. 5. (as is still in use in the Oriental Countries, giving vests, on all such occasions) but unto Benjamin he gave three hundred silverlings, [see above chap. 20. On verse 16. (about sixteen pound seventeen shillings six pence,] and five changing garments.
\p
\v 23 . And to his father likewise [Heb. as this, i.e. likewise, or in like manner, or, thus, i.e. as followeth] he sent ten asses, carrying the best of Egypt, and ten she-asses, carrying corn, and bread, and food, (or, meat) [Oth. Opsonium (i.e. all manner of meat besides bread.) ] for his father upon the way.
\p
\v 24 . And he dismissed his brethren, and they went their way: and he said to them; do not disturb your selves by the way. [viz. by falling out and quarelling one with another about your former trespass against me.]
\p
\v 25 . And they went up out of Egypt: and they came into the land of Canaan, to their father Jacob.
\p
\v 26 . Then they related unto him, saying; Joseph lives yet, yea he is Ruler likewise in all the land of Egypt: Then Jacob fainted in his heart; [by a transport of joy and excessive wonderment, seeing he had not heard of him for two or three and twenty years together.] for he believed them not.
\p
\v 27 . But when they had spoken unto him all the words of Joseph, which he had spoken to them, and that he saw the charets, which Joseph had sent to carry him, than their father Jacob’s spirit revived. [i.e. he was so cherished and revived with the singular joy he conceived of all this strange and unexpected relation and reality, that thereby he recovered new vigour and strength of spirit and body.]
\p
\v 28 . And Israel said; it is enough [or, it is much, or, a great matter.] my son Joseph lives yet: I will go and see him ere I die.
\c 46
\s Jacob going down to Egypt with all his family et substance, is strengthened of God at Berseba, by a renewing of the promises, v. 1, etc. he comes into Egypt with all his, whose names are re-counted, 6. He sends Juda before unto Joseph, who goes to meet him to Gosen, where they receive one another with much affection, 28. Joseph communeth with his brethren, what he shall intimate to Pharao, and what they, coming before him, shall have to say, 31.
\p
\v 1 And Israel departed [This happened about the year after the Creation of the world, 2239. Ten years after Isaac’s death, when Joseph was thirty five years of age. See above chap. 35. 1.] with all that he had, of age. See above chap. 35. 1.] with all that he had, and he came to Berseba : [See above chap. 21. On verse 31.] and he offered sacrifices to the God of his Father Isaac. [i.e. to that God, whom his father Isaac did worship and adore; testifying thereby his steadfast faith in the promises of God, and his thankfulness for all his mercies, and praying unto him for his counsel and disrection, help and assistance, in regard of this Journey.]
\p
\v 2 . And God spoke to Israel, in visions of the night, [The visions taken in the general, whereby God in those times used to reveal himself to men, happened sometimes without sleep, by seeing some shape or figure, [which was represented either to the eyes of the body, as above ch. 15. 1, 5, & c. or to the apprehension of the spirit, Zach. 3. 1. Otherwhiles in the sleep, by some kind of dreams, as above chap. 15. Verse 5. And here.] and said; Jacob: and he said; (here) I am. [See above chap. 22. Verse 1. He calls him twice together, to rouze him up to the more ready and accurate attention; as above chap. 22. 11. And 1 Sam. 3. 10.]
\p
\v 3 . And he said; I am that God, thy fathers God: fear not to go down to Egypt, [in regard namely, that thou and thy seed, shall for a time depart now out of that land, which I promised thee and thine, above chap. 28. Verse 13. Into a land, wherein thy grand-father hath conversed heretofore with a great deal of fear and perplexity; above chap. 12. Verse 12.] for I shall set, (or, settle) thee there a great people.
\p
\v 4 . I will go down to Egypt with thee [viz. to guide, conduct, and assist thee; understand this likewise of the return. Compare above chap. 24. 7. Exod. 25. 20. And chap. 32. 34. Observe here once for all, That the going up, or ascending, & c. and going down, or descending, are used in regard of the situation of the Countries, Cities, and places, high or low, going up or down to them accordingly, as above chap. 12. 10. And chap. 13. 1. And chap. 35. 1. Exod. 19. 3. Mat. 20. 18. Lu. 10. 30. Acts 3. 1. Both are said of God, after the manner of men] and I shall make thee to come up again, coming up along: [this was indeed fulfilled in part, as to the dead body of Jacob, below chap. 47. Ver. 29, 30. And chap. 50. 23. But chiefly in his posterity, when Moseh led them forth out of Egypt, and Joshua brought them into the land of Canaan.] and Joseph shall lay his hand upon thy eyes, [i.e. Joseph shall be with thee at thy last departure, and (according to the custom of many nations) shall shut thy eyes after thy decease. Here Jacob. Is ascertained of God, that his dear son Joseph was alive yet indeed, and that he should die in peace in Joseph’s life-time and presence.]
\p
\v 5 . Then Jacob arose from Berseba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, upon the charets which Pharao had sent to carry them.
\p
\v 6 . And they took their cattle, and their substance, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, [understand withal, and in Mesopotamia besides] and they came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:
\p
\v 7 . His sons, and the sons of his sons with him, his daughters, and his sons daughters, [Jacob had but one daughters, and his sons daughters, [Jacob had but one daughter, to wit, Dinah, verse 15. And but one son’s daughter, verse 17. The holy Scripture doth sometimes make use of the plural for the singular: as also above chap. 21. Verse 7. And below here verse 23. And Numb. 26. 8. 1 Chron. 2. 8, 31.] and all his seed he brought with him into Egypt.
\p
\v 8 . And these are the names [This Genealogy is so carefully set down here and elsewhere by Moseh, first to show the wonderful working of God in multiplying the feed of Abraham. Secondly, to distinguish the Tribes, in regard of the Priesthood, the Royal Dignity, and the Division of the land of Canaan. Thirdly, and principally, to trace the coming forth of the Messiah, after that flesh.] of the sons of Israel [i.e. sons, and sons sons; Item the daughter, and grand-daughter.] that came into Egypt: Jacob and his sons; The first-born of Jacob, Ruben:
\p
\v 9 . And the son of Ruben, Hanoch, [Compare the names of this Register, with repetitions thereof Num. 26. And 1 Chron. 6. And 7. And 8. Chap.] and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.
\p
\v 10 . And the sons of Simeon, Jemuel, [called likewise Nemuel, Num. 26. 12.] and Jamin, and Ohad. [who is not recorded among the children of Simeon, neither Num. 26. 12. Nor 1 Chron. 4. 24. It should seem that he and his were all dead before that time] and Jachin, [called likewise Jarib, 1 Chron. 4. 24.] and Zohar: [Otherwise Zerah, Num. 26. 13.] and Saul the son of a Canaanite-woman. [being of an accursed nation, with whom God’s people were forbidden to marry. This is recorded to the disgrace of Simeon; as likewise Juda his case, above chap. 38. And to the honour of the rest, that did not follow these examples.]
\p
\v 11 . And the sons of Levi, Gerson, Kohath, and Merari.
\p
\v 12 . And the sons of Juda; Er, and Onan, and Sela, and Percz, and Zera: yet Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. [See above chap. 38. 7. 10. These indeed are named here, but not to make up the number specified, below verse 15.] and Perez his sons were Hezron and Hamul.
\p
\v 13 . And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Pua, and Job, [Otherwise called Ischuh, Num. 26. 24. This Job is to be distinguished from him, whose life and history is recorded in the book of Job; The names are likewise differently written in the Hebrew] and Simeon.
\p
\v 14 . And the sons of Zebulon, Sered, and Elon, and Jachleel.
\p
\v 15 . These are Lea’s sons, whom she bare to Jacob. In Paddan Aram; [See above chap. 35. 26. Lea her children were all born in Paddan Aram; but the progeny Canaan.] with Dina his daughter: all the souls [i.e. the men or persons. See above chap. 12. On verse 5.] of his sons and of his daughter were thirty and three. [Jacob himself counted in the number, and Er and Onan excluded. See above verse 12.]
\p
\v 16 . And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, [Heb. Tsiphion Oth. Tsephon, Num. 6. 15. And so in the sequel Ezhon, for Etshon, and above verse 10. Zohar, for Tsohar, & c.], and Chaggi, Schuni, and Esho, Eri and Arodi, [Oth. Arod, Numb. 26. 17.] and Areli.
\p
\v 17 . And the sons of Aser, Imna, and Ischva, and Ischvi, and Beria, and Sera their sister: and the sons of Beria; Heber, and Malchiel.
\p
\v 18 . These are the sons of Zilpa, whom Laban had given to his daughter Lea, [viz. for an hand-maid; See above chap. 29. 24.] and she bare unto Jacob, these sixteen souls. [viz. thirteen sons, two grand –sons, and one daughter.]
\p
\v 19 . The sons of Rachel Jacob’s wife; [Thus Rachel is called particularly, forasmuch as Jacob had chosen her, and sought her at Laban her father’s hand, according to God’s Institution. See above chap. 29. 18.] Joseph and Benjamin.
\p
\v 20 . And to Joseph there were born in the land of Egypt, Manasse and Ephraim, whom Asnath bare to him, the daughter of Potiphera, the Governor of On. [See above chap. 41. 50. And 48. 5.]
\p
\v 21 . And the Sons of Benjamin; Bela, Becher, and Asbel, Gera, Naaman, Echi, and Ros, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.
\p
\v 22 . These are Rachels Sons, that were born to Jacob, in all fourteen Souls.
\p
\v 23 . And the Sons of Dan, [i.e. Son. See above on verse 7.] Chusim. [Called likewise Suham, Numb. 26. 42.]
\p
\v 24 . And the Sons of Naftali; Jachzeel, and Guni, and Jeser, and Sillem.
\p
\v 25 . These are the Sons of Bilha, whom Laban had given to his daughter Rachel, and she bare the same to Jacob: in all seven Souls.
\p
\v 26 . All the Souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, [Oth. Belonged to Jacob; or thus, All the Souls of Jacob, that came into Egypt.] sprung forth out of his thigh, [i.e. that were born out of his flesh and blood. See the same phrase Exod. 1. 5. Jud. 8. 30. Which is as much, as to be come forth out of one’s loins. See above chap. 35. 11.] except the wives of the Sons of Jacob, were in all sixty six Souls. [The fore-mentioned four sums, viz. of 33. V. 15. Of 16. V. 18. Of 14. V. 22. And of 7. V. 25. Do make up seventy together. But here are only cast up, those that were born out of Jacob, and came with him into Egypt; so that here must be excepted, first Jacob himself, who was not born out of himself, and Joseph with his two sons, who were not come into Egypt with Jacob.]
\p
\v 27 . And Joseph sons, which were born to him in Egypt, were two Souls: all the Souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were Seventy. [In this sum, now Jacob and Joseph, with his two sons, are comprehended.]
\p
\v 28 . And he sent Juda before his face away to Joseph; for to give direction before his face to Gosen: [to wit, how and where they might best pitch down in the Country] and they came into the land of Gosen: [see above chap. 45. Verse 10.]
\p
\v 29 . Then Joseph made ready his Charet, and went up, to meet his father Israel, to Gosen: and when he showed himself unto him, [it should seem, that Joseph being come near his father, showed himself extraordinary friendly and respectful, that he might be known of him] he fell about his neck. [See above chap. 33. 4. And chap. 45. 14.
\p Luke 15. 20. Acts 20. 37.] and wept along his neck. [Oth. For a time. Heb. yet.]
\p
\v 30 . And Israel said to Joseph; Let me die now, [Heb. this time; The sense is, I am now willing and ready to die.] after that I have seen thy face, that thou art alive yet. [or, because, by reason.]
\p
\v 31 . After that, Joseph said to his brethren, and to his father’s house; I will go up and relate to Pharao, and tell him: My brethren, and my father’s house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me:
\p
\v 32 . And those men are Shepherds; for they are men, that deal with cattle, [Heb. men of Cattle, or, cattle-men, i.e. such as deal and negotiate with cattle. So below ver. 34. And thus men of Ships, 1 Kings 9. 27. i.e. such as live by Shipping, Mariners or See-faring men. Compare likewise above chap. 9. The Annot. On vers. 20] and they have brought their sheep, and their oxen, and all that they have, with thm.
\p
\v 33 . When it shall happen now, that Pharao shal call you, and say, what is your employment?
\p
\v 34 . Then ye shall say, Thy servants are men, that from our youth up have dealt with cattle; both we, and our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Gosen; for every (omnis) Shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians. [See above chap. 43. 32. This contemptible occupation, hath, through God’s Providence and guidance, procured the Israelites a threefold advantage, 1. That they got a very good fat pasture-Country for their beasts: 2. That they were kept all together in a body, and so might live quietly and peaceably among selves. 3. That being separated from the idolatrous Egyptians, they might with the more freedom exercise the pure worship of God.]
\c 47
\s Joseph acquainteth Pharao with his fathers arrival, and presenteth five of his brethren before him, v. 1, etc. who, after some enquiry, enstateth them in the land of Gosen, 3. Joseph brings his father likewise before Pharao, who asketh him concerning his age, and is all his house in Gosen, 11. The Egyptians having spent all their money for Corn, they sell away their cattle, by reason of the famine, and after that both body and land to Pharao, for Corn, 13. (the Priests excepted, 22, 26.) the land is left to the people to till and husband the same, giving Pharao the fifth part of the Crop, 23. Jacobs life in Egypt, and full age, 27. He takes an oath of Joseph, touching his burial, 29.
\p
\v 1 Then came Joseph, and related unto Pharao and said; My father, and my brethren, and their sheep, and their oxen, with all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan: and behold, they are in the land of Gosen.
\p
\v 2 . And he took some of his brethren; [Heb. the end, or, the extremity, or, the uttermost; that is, as some do understand it, some of the youngest, and some of the eldest. Oth. Of the most presentable, those of the best presence; Compare Jud. 18. 2. 1 Kings 12. 31. Isa. 56. 11. Ezek. 33. 2.] (to wit,) five men, and he put them before Pharao’s face.
\p
\v 3 . Then said Pharao to his [viz. Josephs] brethren; what is your employment? And they said to Pharao; Thy Servants are Shepherds, both we, and our fathers. [Heb. Shepherd, or, Herdsman, (for the Hebrew word is sometimes taken in a larger sense; see Amos 7. Verse 15.) in the singular number, implying thus much: we are every one of us a Shepherd.]
\p
\v 4 . Further said they unto Pharao; we are come to dwell as strangers (or, to sojourn) in this land: [as if they should have said, They were come there, not to desire or enjoy the right of the Citizens, or Native inhabitants of the Country; but only as strangers, to procure some harbor and shelter there for a time, in regard of the grievous famine in their own Country, until they should have opportunity to return thither again.] for there is no pasture for the sheep, which thy Servants have, because the famine is grievous in the land of Canaan; and now let thy Servants (we pray) dwell in the land of Gosen.]
\p
\v 5 . Then Pharao spoke to Joseph, saying; Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee.
\p
\v 6 . The land of Egypt is before thy face [See above 13. On verse 9.] cause thy father, and thy brethren, to dwell in the best of the land: let them dwell in the land of Gosen: and if thou know that there be able men among them, [Heb. men of strength, or, valour. The Hebrew word generally signifies power or ability; and it is used of temporal means, Psalm 49. 7. Ezech. 28. 5. Of strength of body, Ezra 4. 23. Of understanding, faithfulness, and steadfastness in any Government, Exod. 18. 21, and 25. Of valour and experience in war, Deut. 3. 18. Jud. 11. 3. And 1 Sam. 18. 17. Item, of care, diligence, and expert readiness in household affairs, Ruth 3. 11. Prov. 31. 10.] Set them to (be) Cattle-masters, over that which I have.
\p
\v 7 . And Joseph brought his father Jacob along, and put him before Pharao’s face: and Jacob blessed Pharao. [After a peculiar manner, as a Patriarch, giving thanks to the King in his greatness, for all the honour and friendship showed to himself and his, and wishing him all prosperity from God. Compare 1 Sam. 13. 10. And 2 Sam. 8. 10. As also below verse 10.]
\p
\v 8 . And Pharao said to Jacob; How many are the days of the years of thy life? [i.e. how old art thou? See above chap. 25. 7.]
\p
\v 9 .And Jacob said to Pharao; The days of the years of my strangerships, [i.e. wherein I have often been constrained to travel and wander to and fro like a stranger: See above chap. 17. On verse 8.] are, an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have been the days of my life, [i.e. it hath been full of labour and toil, trouble and vexation, more than my fore-fathers had in theirs.] et they have not reached to the days of the years of the lives of my fathers in the days of their strangerships. [for his father Isaac had lived an hundred and eighty years, above chap. 35. 28. His grand-father Abraham an hundred seventy five, above chap. 25. 7. His great grand-father Thara two hundred and five years, above chap. 11. 32. Jacob died at the age of an hundred fourty seven.]
\p
\v 10 . And Jacob blessed Pharao: and went forth from Pharao’s face.
\p
\v 11 . And Joseph appointed Jacob and his brethren habitations, and he gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best (part) of the land, in the land of Rameses; [being a part of the land of Gosen, wherein, as some do hold, the City of Rameses was situated. Compare Exo. 1. 11. See also Exod. 12. 37.] so as Pharao had commanded.
\p
\v 12 . And Joseph entertained his father, and his brethren, and all the house of his father’s, [according to his promise made, above chap. 45. 11. And repeated below, ch. 50. Verse 21.] with bread, unto the mouth of the little (ones?) [or, according to the mouth of the little ones, or, the little child, i.e. according to the necessity of the number of their children. Oth. According to the condition or manner of little children; i.e. even as children are used to be fed, who must have bread and meat put in their mouths, without any labour or desert of theirs.]
\p
\v 13 . And there was no bread in all the land; [i.e. There was an excessive want all manner of sustenance. This great necessity was most among the common people, there being no bread to be had for money. Of the Word Bread, see above chap. 3. 19.] for the famine was grievous; so that the land of Egypt, and the land of Canaan raged, because of that famine. [Understand this of the Inhabitants of those Countries, who were so opprest by that famine, that they became very troublesome, and distracted as it were, ready to make general uproars. See below verse 18, 19.]
\p
\v 14 . Then Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the Corn which they bought, and Joseph brought that money into Pharao’s house.
\p
\v 15 . Now when all the money out of the land of Egypt, and out of the land of Canaan was spent, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, saying; Give us bread; for why should we die in thy presence? [i.e. why wilt thou suffer us to be famished, and perish before thy eyes, now we have no money left us? Thou mightiest help us yet, if thou wouldest.]
\p
\v 16 . And Joseph said; Give your cattle, and I shall give it you for your Cattle, if the money fail.
\p
\v 17 . Then brought they their Cattle to Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread for horse, and for the Cattle of the Sheep, [hence it appears, as also by verse 6. Above, that through the Shepherd’s were an abomination to the Egyptians, they nevertheless kept cattle, for other uses.] and for the cattle of the oxen, and for asses: and he fed them [Heb. gently led them] with bread that year, for all their cattle.
\p
\v 18 . When that year was ended, then they came to him in the Second year [not, of the famine, but the second after the precedent, wherein they had trucked their beasts for corn: this second year was the seventh and last of the famine.] and said to him; we shall not hide it before my Lord, the money being spent, and the possession of beasts (come) to my Lord, [viz. being past over to the face of my Lord, [i.e. that my Lord, [viz. being past over to thee for corn] that there is nothing left over, before the face of my Lord, [i.e. that my Lord can see about us, and that he can require or receive at our hands: or, that we should be able to produce, for to buy corn withal. But our body and our land.
\p
\v 19 . Wherefore shall we die before thy eyes, both we, and our land? [understand here by the dying of the land, the lying waste and desolate of it, as is declared in the later end of the verse. Oth. We and our land are (yet) viz. remaining, buy us, etc.] buy us and our land for bread: so shall we and our land be subject to Pharao’s service, [Heb. be Pharao’s servants, or slaves, bond-men] and give seed [viz. to sow] that we may live andnot die, and that the land become not desolate.
\p
\v 20 . So Joseph bought the whole land of Egypt for Pharao, for the Egyptrians sold every one his field, because the famine was grown strong upon them: thus the land became Pharao’s own. [The land indeed did formerly appertain to Pharao, by right of the Supreme command or Government, but now he was made the Proprietor of it.]
\p
\v 21 . And as for the people, he transported the same [Heb. he made them pass over] in the Cities, [The meaning is, he made the people throughout all the land to change the places of their abode and habitations, out of the one City and quarter of the land, where their goods and estates lay, into another, where Pharao was pleased to appoint and assign them; that it might effectually appear, they had no claim left to any propriety, but that whole land, from one end to the other, was become the Kings own.] from the uttermost of the borders of Egypt, to the other uttermost of it. [i.e. from the one uttermost border, to the other.]
\p
\v 22 . Only the land of the Priests he bought not: [By the Priests understand such persons as were employed about the public (Heathen) worship, and the wisdom (or philosophy) of the Egyptians; who, forasmuch as they had their maintenance by the King, needed not to sell their land. Some render the word rendered Priests here, civil officers, or, commanders. The Hebrew word signifying the same likewise, though but seldom, see above chap. 41. 45.] for the Priests had an appointed part from Pharaoh; and they did eat their appointed part, which Pharaoh had given them; therefore they did not sell their land.
\p
\v 23 . Then said Joseph to the people; Behold, I have bought you and your land this day for Pharaoh: loe, there is seed for you, to sow the land withal. [Hence it appears, that this happened in the last year of the famine. Compare Annot. Above on verse 19.]
\p
\v 24 . Yet with the revenue it shall be, that ye shall give Pharaoh the fifth part: and the four parts [Heb. hands, i.e. parts, as above chap. 43. 34.] shall be for you, for the sowing of the ground, and for your food, and of those that are in your houses, and for to eat for your little ones.
\p
\v 25 . And they said; Thou hast preserved our lives, [Heb. made us live, i.e. kept us alive; so above chap. 6. Verse 19. And chap. 45. 7. The Egyptians declare, that they are very well contented with the condition of tilling Pharaoh’s grounds, now agreed on; and they held themselves much graced and favored by it, besides] let us but find grace in my Lord’s eyes, [See of this manner of speaking, above chap. 18. On verse 3.] and we shall be Pharaoh’s servants. [i.e. his bond-men.]
\p
\v 26 . Then Joseph set (or, settled) this for a law [or, ordinance, statue, right, usance, custom, ] until this day, [i.e. which is kept in ure and practice still among them hitherto] over the land of Egypt that Pharaoh should have the fifth part [that is the land should be all the kings own with the fifth part of revenue or crop thereof]save that not only the priest become Pharaoh’s.
\p
\v 27 . So Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt in the land of Gosen and they put them to be possessors therein and they became fruitful and multiplied much .
\p
\v 28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years so that the days of jacob the years of his life were an hundred forty and seven years.
\p
\v 29 Now when the days of Israel drew near that he should die he called his son Joseph and said to him if I have found grace now in thy eyes then I pray lay thy hand under my thigh [see above chapter 24.] and shew kindness and faithfulness unto me an d bury me not in Egypt I pray [hereby he strengthened himself in his faith in Gods promises and his example exhorts all his constancy and steadfastness in the same the like did Joseph below chapter 50 verse 21,25.]
\p
\v 30 But let me lie by my fathers for thou shalt carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their grave [to wit in the grave of Abraham and Isaac in the land of Canaan in the cave of Machpela in Hebron see above chapter 23.19 and 25.8 and 35.29 ] and he said I will do according to thy word.
\p
\v 31 And he said [Jacob namely ] swear unto me and he [Joseph ] and Israel bowed himself [viz. before the LORD that is he called upon God giving him thanks for the strengthening of his faith which he had obtained by Joseph his promise and oath ] at the beds heads [sitting up in the bed by reason of his infirmity which disabled him to rise and to pray kneeling or standing.]
\c 48
\s Jacob being sick Joseph comes and visits him verse 1 &c. to whom he represents Gods promises and adopteth his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim as his own and as the father of the two distant tribes in Israel 5 in the laying on of the hands Jacob purposely prefers the young viz. Ephraim before the elder Manasseh 13 notwithstanding Josephs interpellation17 blessing then thus together with their father Joseph and prophesying of their return into the land of Canaan 21 he giveth Joseph a piece of the land apart 22.
\p
\v 1 Now it happened after they told Joseph behold thy father is sick and they took his two sons with him ] Manasseh and Ephraim.
\p
\v 2 . And they told Jacob and said behold thy son Joseph comes to thee so Israel strengthen himself and sate up in the bed.
\p
\v 3 Then said Jacob to Joseph: God the almighty [see above chapter 17 on verse 1] appeared to me at Luz[otherwise called bethel see above chapter 28.19 and 36.6] in the land of Canaan and he blessed me [that is there renued and confirmed unto me the blessing promised to my father and grand father which is to go on still and t be delivered from hand to hand to our posterities.]
\p
\v 4 . And he said to me behold I will make thee fruitful and multiply thee and set and settle thee on a heap of nations and I will give that land [viz. the land of Canaan ] to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession [Heb. A possession of eternity that is during during all the time of the law as to the earthly Canaan but for times without end in regardof the heavenly see above chapter 13.15 and 17.7,13 with the annotate.]
\p
\v 5 . Now then thy two sons which were born unto thee are mine [ that is my will and meaning is that in the sharing of my goods and the land of Canaan each of them shall be accounted an immediate co heir a peculiar tribe as if they were begotten by myself an dnot by thee Joshua 14.4 an d16.1 and 17.17 thus Joseph who was to have otherwise but a single share of the inheritance as the rest of his brethren obtained a double portion here which appertained to Reuben as the first born see above chapter 29.32 but it was taken from him and transferred to Joseph 1Chronicles 5 verse 1, for the reason mentioned below chapter 49 veres3,4] Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine [Ephraim is already preferred here see the reason below verse 19as Reuben and Simeon .
\p
\v 6 . But thy generation which thou shalt beget after them [that is the children whom thou maist get hereafter besides Manasseh and Ephraim] shall be thine [that is they shall counted thy off-springs or proper issues and my grand-children by thee]they shall be called after the name of thy brethren in their inheritance [that is they shall be comprehended in the division of the land with either of these two brethren in their inheritance [that is they shall be comprehended in the land with of the two brethren not to make peculiar tribes by themselves by themselves as these two shall be called after or by over a name is to be dominated by the same see Deuteronomy 28 verse 10 Amos 9.12 and compare verse16.]
\p
\v 7 . Now when I came form Paddan [others Paddan Aram see above chapter 25.20 and 35.9] Rachel died by me [others over me as if should say in bosom within my arms others before me that in my presence before my eyes ] in he land of Canaan upon the way when there was yet a little tract of land [see above chapter 35 on verse 16] to come to Ephrat [see above chapter 35 on verse 16& 19 ] and I buried her there by the way of Ephrat which is Bethlehem.
\p
\v 8 . And Israel saw the sons of Joseph and said whose are these? [Jacobs sight was grown dim verse 10 so that casting his eyes upon his sons of Joseph he could not exactly discern and know who they were.]
\p
\v 9 . And Joseph said to his father they are my sons whom god hath given me and he said bring them to me and I pray [Heb. Take them that is take them and bring them the word to take frequently used thus see above chapter 12 verse 15] that I may bless them [that is I may declare unto them the promises of God how he will bless them and confirm it to them [that is I may declare unto them the promises of God how he will bless them and confirm it to them with the laying of the hands upon them according to the manner of the patriarchs blessing see above chapter 27 on verse 4.]
\p
\v 10 . Howbeit Israel’s eyes were heavy [that is dull and dim not able to discern distinctly ] of age he could not see[that is not well as verse 8] and he made them approach to him then he kissed them[see above chapter 27 on verse 26and embraced them [see above chapter 29 verse 13 and chapter 33.4.]
\p
\v 11 . And Israel said to Joseph I have not thought to have seen your face but behold God hath made me be likewise see thy seed.
\p
\v 12 . Then Joseph made them go forth from his knees [viz. from Jacobs knees between which he held the youths embracing them but Joseph meant to place them orderly before him one by one that so that they may receive his blessing in the accustomed manner ] and he bowed his face before him down to the ground [shewing civil respect to his father an dreturning him thanks and honor for the affection testified to him and his.]
\p
\v 13 . And Joseph took them both Ephraim in his right hand over against Israel’s left hand and Manasseh in his left hand over against Israel’s right hand and he made them approach to him.
\p
\v 14 . But Israel stretched forth his right hand and laid [Heb. Set Put ] it on Ephraim head though he was the least [that is the younger] and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head he guided his hands understandingly [Heb. He made his hands wise that is he did it not by haphazard or by mistake but of good forgoing knowledge as a prophet performing the will of God without regard to the primogeniture the laying on of the hands here first mentioned in the scripture was usual at this time and afterwards first in blessing as here and Matthew 19.15 secondly in sacrifices Leviticus 1.4 see the annotate there thirdly the judging condemning and punishing Leviticus 24.14 fourthly in consecrating and ordaining for offices Numbers 8.20 Deuteronomy 34.9 Acts 6.6 1Timothy 4.14 fifthly in doing of miracles Mark 6.5 Luke 4.40 Acts 28.8 &c.] for Manasseh was the first born[others howbeit Manasseh &c.]
\p
\v 15 . He blessed Joseph [viz. in his children as appears verse 16] and said the God before whose face my fathers Abraham and Isaac have walked that God which had fed me since I was to this day.
\p
\v 16 . That angel which delivered me from all evil [Jacob requesting of this angel the same thing he sues to God for verse 15 therefore this cannot be understood of the created angel but must be meant of the son of God see above chapter 22.11 ] he bless these youths and let my name be called in them and my fathers Abraham and Isaacs name ]that is let them be accounted of my progeny and called Abrahams , Isaacs and my own children this happened so for they were ever after held and esteemed among the twelve tribes of Israel as Jacobs own immediate issue compare above the annotate on verse 6] and let them multiply as fishes in the multitude of the midst of the land.
\p
\v 17 . When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon Ephraim’s head it was evil in his eyes [that is it displeased him see above chapter 21 on verse 11] and he took hold of his fathers hand to bring the same off from Ephraim’s head upon the hand of Manasseh.
\p
\v 18 . And Joseph said to his father not so my father for this is the first born lay the right hand on his head.
\p
\v 19 . But his father refused it and said I know it my son I know it he shall likewise be a people and he shall likewise wax great but yet his least brother shall be greater than he [when the Israelites were first numbered in the wilderness Ephraim was first brought in and had eight thousand three hundred men more than Manasseh as is to be seen Numbers 1.32,33,35 and 2.19,21] and his seed shall be a full multitude of nations [Heb. Fullness.]
\p
\v 20 . Thus he blessed them on that day saying in thee [ others after thee that is by example as he said the Israelites blessing or wishing posterity one to another they shall take thee for an example or pattern as manner of blessing Ruth 4.11 and of cursing Jeremiah 29.22] shall Israel [ that is y posterity the Israelites ] bless saying God set thee like Ephraim and like Manasseh and he placed Ephraim before Manasseh.
\p
\v 21 . then said Israel to Joseph behold I die [that is I am near and ready to die the present tense or time being used for the future or that near at hand compare above chapter 19.13 and 20.3 and John 14.2 ] but God shall be with you and he shall bring you again into the land of your fathers [that is into the land of Canaan.]
\p
\v 22 . And I have given thee one piece of land [the Hebrew word doth properly signify a shoulder or back as above chapter 9.23and afterwards by likeness a piece part or portionof land somewhat high or elevated as here but Jacob as a prophet aims likewise at the name of the city of Sichem which lay in the land by the hill side see above chapter 12.6 and fell afterwards to the tribe of Ephraim Joshua 0.7 wherein Josephs bones were likewise buried Joshua 24.32as in the land which his father had prophetically assigned and bestowed upon him John 4.5 understanding not only the piece of land which he had brought for an hundred pieces of money above chapter 33.19 but likewise all the land of the territory of the city of Sichem which Simeon and Levi took by force of arms and plundered above chapter 34.25,26] above thy brethren [viz. in regard of the primogeniture Deuteronomy 21.17 which Reuben had forfeited and was developed upon Joseph 1Chronicles 5.1 as to the double portion of inheritance he being the first born by the worthier wife ] which I took with my sword and with my bow [viz. when after the massacre of he Sichemites I was fain to stand upon my guards for fear of the neighboring Canaanites not to be surprised by them now God having blessed my care and worth fullness by sending a terror upon all inhabitants round about I kept that piece of land which now through Gods blessing I hold and account of as my own as hereafter also it shall appertain to thy posterity in this use and possession or otherwise which I shall take by the sword and bow of my posterity ] out of the land of the Amorites [Heb. The Amorites he put down the name of one of the nations of the land of Canaan which was very powerful and very considerable one as appears Amos 2.9 so likewise above chapter 15 verse 16 and Joshua 10.5.]
\c 49
\s Jacob calleth his sons to bless them before his death verse 1 &c. rebuking first the heinous acts of Reuben Simeon and Levi 3 then he falls upon the extolling of the glory of Judah prophesying of the time of Christ his birth after the flesh out of him together with the kingdom and the calling of the gentiles 8 of Zebulon 13. Issaschar 14 Dan 16 Gad 19Aser 20 Naphtali 21 Joseph’s peculiar blessing 22 of Benjamin 27 at last Jacob gives charge concerning his burial place 29 he dieth 33.
\p
\v 1 After that Jacob calleth his sons he said assemble yourselves and is hall declare unto you that which shall betide you in the following days [Heb. In the aftermost last or sequel of days that is in the times to come to wit from about two hundred year hence all along until the coming of the kingdom of Messiah.]
\p
\v 2 . Come together and hearken ye sons of Jacob and hearken unto your father Israel.
\p
\v 3 . Reuben thou art my first born my vigor [that is a child begotten in the principal vigor of my age] and beginning of the power [viz. in begetting of children thus the first born are called Deuteronomy 21.17 Psalms 78.51] the most eminent [Heb. Eminency] in exaltation the most eminent in strength.
\p
\v 4 . Swift descent or fall ebbe [Heb. Swiftness] as of waters [viz. in the defiling of his fathers bed even as the water suddenly gusheth down from some eminent place into the lower so hast thou through thy base lust accompanied with great Levity and presumption precipitated thyself into a most abominable villainy and vileness] thou shalt be most eminent for thou hast mounted thy fathers Gouch [that is thou hast defiled thy fathers bed with incest ] then thou defildest it he hath got up into my bed[this Jacob spake up turning himself away to his other sons .]
\p
\v 5 . Simeon and Levi are brethren [to wit not only by nature but likewise in manners and conditions wicked practices which they shewed sufficiently by wicked exploit against the Sichemites above chapter 34] their dealings [or employments or according to some their swords ]are instruments of violence.
\p
\v 6 . Let not my soul come into their secret counsel let not my honor [honor is here as much as soul before it being the worthiest and the most honorable part of man thus the word honor may be likewise taken psalms 16.9 and 30.13 and 57.9 others tongue wherewith a man is bound to honor God and to spread forth his praise also by the word honor there may be understood a mans good name ] but united with their assembly for in their wrath they have slain man [Heb. The man understand the Sichemites see above chapter 34 .25,26] and in their willfulness they have removed the oxen [Heb. The ox understand hereby likewise all manner of other beast and cattle which is plundering of the city of Sichem they despoiled the inhabitants of the Hebrews do frequently use the singular instead of the plural number above chapter 32.5 and 1Chronicles 10.1 compared with 1Samuel 31.1.]
\p
\v 7 . Accursed be their wrath [to be accursed is to be subject and liable to all manner of bodily and spiritual temporal and eternal punishment or to be subject to any of these as above chapter 3.14 and 4.11 and 5.29 Deuteronomy 28.16,17 Matthew 25.41 understand here the temporal punishment ] for it is fierce and their fury for it is hard I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel [Jacob speaks here in the name of God as a prophet and his prophesy was fulfilled accordingly in the posterity for the tribe of Simeon in the land of Canaan was intermixed with the tribe of Judah Joshua 19.1 and the tribe of Levi dispersed among all the tribes of Israel.
\p
\v 8 . Judah thou art he be thy brethren shall praise thee thy hand shall be upon the neck of thy enemies [that is thou shalt pursue and suppress them compare Psalms 18.41] before thee thy fathers sons shall bow down before themselves [hereby the intimates that his posterity his posterity shall be exalted to the sovereignty the second part of the right progative of the primogeniture.]
\p
\v 9 . Judah is a lion whelp thou art mounted up my son from the prey he croucheth he coucheth down like a lion on like an old lion [all this is spoken by a way of similitude to betoken and to shew forth the temporal dominion and power of the posterity of Judah Jude 1.2 and 1Samuel 17.51 and 2Samuel 8.12,13 and 1Kings 9 verse 20 &c. and the everlasting of the Messiah that was to issue from Judah Matthew 28.18 Luke 1.32,43 Ephesians 1.20,21] who shall rouse him ?[as if he had said his enemies shall stand in that fear of him without their apparent ruin and destruction.]

Joseph being returned into Egypt is humbly sought unto by his brethren for forgiveness 14 his age and off-spring to the to the third and forth generation 22 he encourageth and takes an oath of his brethren touching the carrying away his bones and thereupon he dies and is embalmed 24.
\p
\v 1 Then Joseph fell upon his fathers face and he wept over him and kissed him [and no doubt likewise shut his eyes according as God hath promised unto Jacob chapter 46.4.]
\p
\v 2 . And Joseph commanded his servants the Physicians that they should embalm his father [that is the dead corpse of his father this embalming was a very ancient custom of those eastern nations whereby they bestowed and filled the exenterated corpse with fragrant herbs and odoriferous spiceries and anointed it all over within and without with anointments made of the same which custom the gentile kept up out of superstition but the Israelites retained it with a sanctified remembrance as a testimony of the future immorality and the incorruptibility of our bodies see 2Chronicles 16.14 and 21.19 Mark 16.1 John 19.14] and the Physician embalms Israel.
\p
\v 3 . and forty days were fulfilled on him [viz. on Jacobs embalming to the end that by this continued application the virtue and efficacy of those precious herbs and drugs and ointments might so much be better diffuse themselves penetrate and incorporate through all the part of subject in hand ] for thus the days of those that are embalmed are fulfilled and the Egyptian bewailed him Aaron and Moseh which dured but thirty days Numbers 20.29 Deuteronomy 34.8though some conceive that in these seventy days the foresaid forty for embalming are to be comprehended in which sense the bewailing itself should have lasted but thirty days.
\p
\v 4 . Now when the days of the bewailing were past Joseph spake to the house of Pharaoh.[ understand the prince and counselors and friends of Pharaoh who were daily about his person for Joseph being in mourning himself he might not come in kings presence according to the custom of Egypt and other countries compare Esther 4.2 ] saying if now I have found grace in your eyes [see above chapter 18 on verse 2] speak I pray before the ears of Pharaoh saying .
\p
\v 5 . My father had made me swear saying behold I die[see above chapter 48 verse 21 and here below verse 24] in my grave which I have digged me in the land of Canaan [so did others likewise while they were alive yet cause their graves to be made ready against their dying time see 2Chronicles 16.14 Isaiah 22.16 Matthew 27.60] there thou shalt bury me now then let me go up I pray that I may bury my father then shall I come again.
\p
\v 6 . And pharaoh said go up and bury thy father according as he had made thee swear.
\p
\v 7 . And Joseph went up for to bury his father and there went with him all [ that is a great many or the most part or all such as were not presently employed and could be spread from home compare Matthew 3.5] Pharaoh’s servants [that is courtier gentlemen attendants see above chapter20 on verse 8] the most ancient [that is the counselors and senators and statesmen]of his house [that is court family see above chapter 34 on verse 19 ] and all the most ancient of the land of Egypt [that is the principal men the governors chief officers and over vulnerable person of the land.]
\p
\v 8 . Besides the whole house of Joseph [that is all his family retinue servants and attendants compare the annotate on the verse foregoing and above chapter 7 on verse 1]and his brethren and the house of his father only their little children and their sheep and their oxen [that is their cattle both great and small and see above chapter 12 on verse 16] they left in the land of Gosen.
\p
\v 9 . And with him they went up as Charets as horsemen and it was a very heavy host [that is a great and numerous company thus we read of a heavy people numbers 20.20 an d1Kings 3.9 which 2Chronicles 1.10 is explained a great people see likewise 1Kings 10.2 and 2Kings 6.14.]
\p
\v 10 . now when they came to the plain of the thorn bush [understand here a plain champion field or country lying bare and open overgrown or perhaps hedged in with thorns or about which there grew a great quantity of thorn bushes the same word that is here rendered the thorn bush we find likewise Judges 9.14 and Psalms 58.10 others retain the Hebrew word Atad as the proper name of this place ] that is which is on yonside [ viz. in regard of the place where Moseh was when he wrote this ] of the Jordan [see abovechapter13 on verse 10] where they kept a great and very heavy lamentation there very great and heavy] and he made his father a mourning there of seven days [that is Joseph appointed seven days of sitting and accommodating all things requisite for the solemnity of the mourning and funeral of his father see Ecclesiastes 22.13.]
\p
\v 11 . When the inhabitants [Hebrews the inhabitants so by and by the Canaanites ] of the country the Canaanites saw this mourning in the plain of the thorn bush then said they this is an heavy mourning of the Egyptian and the mourning Egyptian or mourning Egypt.] which is by the foord of Jordan [see above verse 10.]
\p
\v 12 . And his sons did unto him [viz. Jacob ] according as he had commanded them see above chapter 49.29.]
\p
\v 13 . For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of tehfield of Machpela [see above chapter 49.30 ] which Abraham had bought together with the field for an hereditary burying place of Ephron the Hethite over against Mamre[see above chapter 43 on verse 30.]
\p
\v 14 . After that Joseph retuned into Egypt he and his brother and all that were gone up with him for to bury his father after that he had buried his father.
\p
\v 15 . When Josephs brethren saw that their father was dead they said peradventure Joseph will hate us and he shall assuredly requisite [Heb. Requiting requite or return] us all the evil we did him [Heb. Requited or returned him to wit for all those that are humble and submissive request and friendly entreaties where by when he was in our hands he besought us to spare him we rejecting them all see above chapter 42.21 and so below verse 17.]
\p
\v 16 . Therefore they sent to Joseph [Heb. They charged to him that is they dispatched some persons to him whom they charged to acquaint Joseph with their apprehension and desires ] saying thy father hath given in charge before his death saying [they desire a full pardon of Josephs hands using four main arguments to enforce the grant thereof first that their father say they desired it before his death secondly because they were brethren thirdly they were sorry for and contested their sins fourthly because they were all of one religion.]
\p
\v 17 . Thus shall ye say to Joseph forgive now I pray the trespass of thy brethren and their sins for they have done evil against thee but now I pray forgive the trespass of the servants of God for thy father [serving the same God with the whom hath commanded us to forgive one another’s trespass as we desire him to forgive ours see of the attribute here given to God above chapter 26 on verse 22,24 and chapter 31 on verse 42] and Joseph wept as they spake to him [doubtless because they spake in a very feeling term of a matter which he could not hear but be sensible of it the rather that he perceived thereby their apprehension and revenge and punishment and their instructing of his goodness.]
\p
\v 18 . After that his brethren also came [viz. after they heard the report of their messengers whom they had sent to Joseph above verse 16] and fell down before him and said behold we are servants to thee.
\p
\v 19 . And Joseph said unto them fear not for I am in the place of God? [that is am I God that I should have power to do you any hurt or ill since God is pleased to do you good and preserve you by me?]
\p
\v 20 . Ye indeed ye thought evil against me yet God thought that for Good to do as it is at this day [that is as is now apparent and manifest before all world] to save a great people alive .
\p
\v 21 . Now fear not I shall maintain ye your little children thus he comforted them and spake according to their heart [see above chapter 34 on verse 3.]
\p
\v 22 . Joseph then dwelt in Egypt he and his fathers house and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.
\p
\v 23 . And Joseph saw the children of Ephraim of the third generation [Heb. Children of the third that is of the third generation that is children of children’s children see of the like blessing Job 42.15 and Psalms 128.6 here begins the fulfilling of Jacobs prophesies above chapter48.19] also the sons of Machir Manasseh’s where born on Josephs knees [that is Joseph took pleasure in their infancy to let them sit upon his lap and dandle them after the manner of sporting with children compare above chapter 30.3.]
\p
\v 24 . And Joseph said to his brethren I am dying [see above verse 5] but God shall assuredly visit you [Heb. Visiting visit you that is for certain viz. in mercy to do you good and to make good his promise unto you see above chapter 21 on verse1 and here the next verse ] and he shall make you to go up out of his land into the land which he hath sworn to Abraham Isaac and Jacob.
\p
\v 25 . and Joseph made the sons of Israel swear saying God shall visit you assuredly then shall ye carry up my bones from hence [this he chargeth upon them not out of any superstition but out of assurance of his faith whereby he was sure that his posterity should possess the land of Canaan and that the same was to them all a type and pledge of the heavenly Canaan desiring for these reason that his bones might at last be transported thither see Hebrews 11.22.]
\p
\v 26 . And Joseph died being an hundred and ten years old [Heb. A son of hundred and ten years ] and they embalmed him [see above on verse 2] and they laid him into a chest [wherein his dead body was kept until due time it might be carried into the land of Canaan which happened within an hundred and fifty and five years after when the children of Israel went forth out of Egypt ] in Egypt.
