\mt2 The Second Book Of Moseh, Called
\mt EXODUS
\s The agreement of this book
\p The Greeks cal this book Exodus, i.e. a going forth, or coming forth; which is name most interpreters of the Bible do return and make use of, it agreeing so well with the principle matter therein contained; for, after the holy Ghost hath shewed in the beginning of this Book the great increase of the children of Israel in Egypt, and how Pharao sought to surprise them; he goes on describing the birth of Meseh, with his wonderful preservation and education; and how God did call and send both him and his brother Aaron, for to lead forth, and delivered his people of Israel out of the house bondage in Egypt, which Pharao, (being and abiding hardened of God) refusing to assent unto, God visited the land of Egypt with ten grievous plagues, and after then he led forth his people by Meseh, with great wealth, and by a stretched out hand , our of Egypt after they had eaten the Paschal Lamb; leading them through the Red Sea, (wherein Pharao, pursuing them, was drowned with all his host) into the wilderness, and guiding them, in and through the same with a pillar of cloud, and a pillar of fire; giving them Manna for their food, and Quails for their appetite: and water of the Rock , for their drink. In this Wilderness they were put to it fight with the Amalekites, whom they overcome and subdue. In this Wilderness Jethro comes to Meseh, and gives him good instructions, which he followeth : In this wilderness God likewise gave unto the people of Israel the Ten Commandments, through Moseh, upon Mount Sinai, having written them with his own finger upon two Table of stone: besides may other laws, statutes, rites, and ordinances. Also God commanded Moseh to make a Tabernacle, with the Ark, and other holy furnisher, and offices thereunto belonging. Moreover there is related in this book the Israelites Idolatry with the Golden Calf, for which transgression God was ready to destroy them, but that, Moseh his intercession prevailing him to spare them. Moseh desireth to see the face of God. Afetr that, God reweth his Covenant with the Israelites by Moseh rehearseth gifts and presents, which the people brought for the making of the Tabernacle, even more then enough for all things requisite thereunto. And after that, all was made ready, according to the command and pattern; which God shewd’d Moseh in the Mount, the Tabernacle was set up, anointed, and filled with the glory of God.
\p This book conatins an Historical Relation of what did happen to the Israelites, in the space of an hundred fourty and two years, after the computation of some.
\c 1
\s The names and number of the children of Israel, that were come into Egypt, and their multiplication, v.1 etc how Pharoa went about to suppresse them, but in vain, 14 Pharoa commands that Midwives, to kill all the male – children, as soon as they were born, 16 but they do save them alive, 17. for which God blesseth them, 21. Pharao command all the male – infants to be drowned, 22
\p
\v 1 These now are the Names of the Sons o Israel =, that came into Egypt with Jacob; thye came in (there) each with his house. [i.e. with his family or household. Heb. Man and his house came.]
\p
\v 2 . Ruben, Simeon, Levi and Juda.
\p
\v 3 . Issashar, Zebulon, and Benjamin: [Benjamin was the youngest of all sons of Jacob; and yet he is placed here before the sons of the Concubines, (or, By wives).]
\p
\v 4 . Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Aser.
\p
\v 5 . All the souls now, [Heb. All (or very) soul, i.e. all the persons. See Gen 46. on verse 26.] Were seventy souls: [See Gen 46. on verse 27.] yet Joseph was in Egypt. [Joseph and his two sons, were likewise indeed come forth out of Egypt. [Joseph and his two sons were likewise indeed come forth out of Jacob, but they were in Egypt before Jacob came there.]
\p
\v 6 Now when Joseph was dead, and all his Brethren, and all that Generation, [I.e. all the people of that age, or time, wherein Joseph and his Brethren were alive yet; and thus the word Generation is taken for the time of a mans life; see Gen 15. on verse 16.]
\p
\v 7 . Then the children of Israel became fruitful, and grew abundanctly in a great number, and they multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty: [Heb, might in much much] so that the land was filled with them.
\p
\v 8 . After that, there stood up a new King over Egypt, who had not lnow Joseph.
\p
\v 9 The same said to this people of the children of Israel are many, yea mighter then we.
\p
\v 10 . Come on, let us deal wisely against them, [Oth let us out – wit them]that they do not multiply, and it happen, when any war fall out, that they join them selves to our enemies, [Heb. Haters] and fight against us, and go up out of the land.
\p
\v 11 And they set over the same Rulers of Task [i.e. Such as required and exacted of very one his appoint days – work] to oppresse the same with their burthens: [viz. which they had imposed and laid upon them] for they were building [Oth they (viz. the children of Israel) builded] unto Pharao Cities of Treasure, [Oth. Ammunition] Pitom and Raames. [This City must be distinguished from the land of Rameses, Gen 47.11.]
\p
\v 12 But the more they oppressed them, the more they multiplied, and the more they grew: [Heb. Even as they had oppresse it ( viz the people) so it multiplie, and so it grew , or, brake forth .see Gen 28. on verse 14.] that they were vexed by reason of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 13 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel serve with hardship. [Therefore Egypt is justly called an house of boundage, Exod. 20.2. and an Iron face, Deut. 4.20.]
\p
\v 14 So that they made them (their) life bitter with hard service, in clay, and in bricks, ( or tile – stones) and with all (manner of 0 service in the field with their service, which they made them serve. [Oth which they did serve under them] with hardship.
\p
\v 15 Besides that, the King of Egypt spake uunto the Mid – wives of the Hebrew (women) [Oth to the Hebrew Mid wive] (the name of the one whereof was Siphra, and the name of the other Pua); [These two were the principal, for doubtless among so numerous a people, there were many more]
\p
\v 16 And said; when help the Hebrew women in labour, and see them upon the stools: if it be a son, then kill him, [see the reason above verse 9.10.] but if it be a daughter, let her live.
\p
\v 17 Yet the Mid wives feared God, and did not as the King of Egypt had spoken to them, but they saved the male – infants alive.
\p
\v 18 Then the Kimg of Egypt called the Mid – wives, and said unto them, wherefore have ye done this thing? That ye did save the male infants alive?
\p
\v 19 And the Mid – wives said to Pharao: Because the Hebrew women are not the Egyptians women, for they are strong; [Heb. Alive, or lively] before the Mid wife comes to thew, they have brought forth, (or, born)
\p
\v 20 Therefore God did the Mid – wives good: [not for their lying, but their fearing God, and saving their children alive; see the next verse] and that people multiplied, and become very mighty.
\p
\v 21 And it come to passé, because the Mid – wives feared God, that he build their houses. [Heb. made, i.e. God did so bless them that they saw a fair posterity and offspring. This may be referred unto the Israelites, or to the midwives, or to both together.]
\p
\v 22 Then Pharao commanded all his people, saying: All the sons [Heb. every son, etc.] that are born, [viz. by the Hebew women.] ye shall cast into the River, but save all the daughters [Hebr. every daughter] alive.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 AND a man [whose name was Amram, the son of Kehath, the son of Levi, Exodus 6.6,18. Num. 26.59.] of the house of Levi [i.e. Of the Family and Tribe of Levi] went, and took [viz. to wife, i.e. Married] a daughter of Levi. [ born to Levi himself, called Jochebed, Num.26.59. Kehats sister, Amram, her own husbands aunt, that is , his fathers sister , Exod.6.20. such marriages were forbidden afterwards, Levit.18.12.]
\p
\v 2 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: when she saw, that he was fair, [Heb. Good, see Gen.6. on verse 2.] then she hid him three months.
\p
\v 3 Yet when she was able to hide him no longer, [for the Israelites did live intermixed with and among the Egyptians, Exod.3.22. and the Kings command was strict, and the transgressing of it dangerous, Exod.1.22. Heb.11.23.] then she took for him a coffer, [or, chest, box] of bull-rushes [of which the Egyptians were wont to make light boats, Isa.18.2.] and limited it with lime, and with pitch, and she put the lad in there, and put it in the bull-rushes, at the bank of the river. [Heb.lip; this the mother did, that the childe might the sooner be heard and seen and found.]
\p
\v 4 And his sister [By name Mirriam, Exod.15.20. Num.26.59.] put her self afar off, to know what should be done with him.
\p
\v 5 And Pharao's daughter went down to wash her self in the river, and her damsels walked by the rivers side ; [Heb.hand] when she saw the coffer in the midst of the bull-rushes, she sent her maid servant there for to fetch it. [Heb. and took it.]
\p
\v 6 When she opened it, she saw that lad, [Heb. and she saw him, the lad, (or, male-infant)] and behold, the lad wept : and she was moved with compassion over the same, and shee said, This is one of the Hebrewes male-infants.
\p
\v 7 Then said his sister to Pharao's daughter, Shall I goe and call a nurse [Heb. a suckling woman] of the Hebrew women to thee, to suckle that lad?
\p
\v 8 And the daughter of Pharao said unto her, go; and the young maid went, and called the lads mother.
\p
\v 9 Then Pharaos daughter said unto her, Take this lad, and suckle it me, I will give (thee) thy wages ; and the woman took the lad, and suckled it.
\p
\v 10 And when the lad was grown up, she brought him to Pharao's daughter, and he became a son to her : [i.e. And she took him for her son : caising him to be brought up in all the wisdome of the Egyptians, Acts 7.21.] and she called his name Moseh,[i.e. drawn forth, viz. out of the water.] and said ; for I have drawn him out of the water.
\p
\v 11 And it came to passe in those days, when Moseh was grown up, [ Moseh was at this time forty years of age ; mighty in words and deeds, Acts 7.21.] that he went forth to his brethren, and viewed their burthens : and he saw that an Egyptian man smote an Hebrew man, of his brethren. [i.e. kins-men, or countrey-men.]
\p
\v 12 And he looked hitherwards, and he saw that there was no body, he smote [or, slew] the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. [ This Moseh did, to make his brethren understand, that God would deliver them through his hand ; but they understood it not, Acts 7.25.]
\p
\v 13 The second day he went forth away, and behold, the two Hebrew men were striving together : and he said to the unrighteous; [i.e. to the wrong-doer, or to him that was in the wrong .] why dost thou smite thy neighbour?
\p
\v 14 Then he said, who hath set thee Chief (or, President) [Heb. a man, a Prince, i.e a Princely; or principal man] and Judge over us? Sayest thou (this) to kill me, as thou hast killed the Egyptian? then Moseh was afraid, and said, verily, this matter, (or fact, businesse) is made known.
\p
\v 15 Now when Pharao heard this matter,[i.e. the killing of the Egyptian by Moseh.] he sought to put Moseh to death: but Moseh fled before the face of Pharao, and dwelt in the land of Midian, [Acts 7.29. Madian. See Gen. 25. verse 2.] and he sate by a well of water.
\p
\v 16 And the Prist [Oth. The Prince or Ruler, President. See of the Hebrew word Cohen, Gen.41.45. his name was Jethro, Exo.3.10. and Hobab, Num.10.29.] in Midian had seven daughters, which came to draw (water), and filled the troughs to water their fathers flock.
\p
\v 17 Then the herdsmen came and drove them away: howbeit Moseh stood up and delivered them, and watered their flocks.
\p
\v 18 And when they came to their father [i.e. grandfather; so the word is taken, 2 Kings 14.3. and 16.2.and 18.3.] Rehuel, [This was a Midianite, Hobabs or Jethro's father,Num.10.29.] he said ; wherefore are ye return'd so soon to day? Heb. why have ye hastened to come to day?]
\p
\v 19 Then they said , An Egyptian man delivered us out of the hand of the herdsmen, and he likewise drew us (water) abundantly, [Heb. drawing he drew] and watered the flock.
\p
\v 20 And he said to his daughter, [i.e. grand-daughters, as appears by Num.10.29. See the Annot. On 1 Chronicles 1.50.] where is he now? Why did ye let the man goe thus? [viz.it being so late alreadie] call him, that he may eat bread. [i.e. that he may take his repast with us.See Gen.35.54.]
\p
\v 21 And Moseh agreed to dwell with the man : and hee gave Moseh his daughter [ his grand-daughter, the daughter of his son Jethro,Exodus 3.1.] Zippora.
\p
\v 22 Who bare him a sonne, and he called his name Gersom : for he said ; I am become a stranger, in a strange Countrey ; [After these words there are divers others in our old Translation, not extant in the Hebrew text here, but inserted out of the Greek Translation, and extant elsewhere in the Hebrew text,viz.Exodus 18.4. whence they were borrowed.]
\p
\v 23 And it happened after many of these dayes, [viz.About forty years after, Exodus 7.7. Acts 7.30. Moseh lived forty years in Pharao's Court, forty years he was a stranger and Shepherd in Midian, and forty years he spent with the Israelites in the wildernesse.] when the king of Egypt was dead,[ and with him all the rest that sought mosehs life, Exod.4.19. Whereby Moseh got liberty to return into Egypt.] that the children of Israel sighed and cryed over the service; and their cry over their service came up to God.
\p
\v 24 And God heard their groans, and God remembred his covenant [See Genesis 8. on verse 1.] with [i.e. made, or establisht with] Abraham, and with Isaac, and with Jacob.
\p
\v 25 And God looked on the children of Israel, and god knew them [i.e. he took notice of and pity on them to help and deliver them.]
\c 3
\s Moseh feeding Jethros flock, v.1, etc. God appeareth unto him in a burning brambling bush, 2. and commissions him to deliver Israel,9. The Name of God is made known to him, 14.What Moseh was to say to the children of Israel, 15. and to Pharao likewise, 18. prediction of Pharao's obstinacy, 19. and the plagues of Egypt, 20. and the going forth of the Israelites with great riches, 21.
\p
\v 1 AND Moseh kept the flock of Jethro his father in law the Priest of Midian. [Above chap.2. 16,18. it is said, That Rebuel was Priest oc Chief in Midian ; now here is said of his son Jethro, who doubtless, after his death, succeeded him. Of the word here rendred Priest, see Gen.41. On verse 45.] and he led the flock behinde the wildernesse, and he came to the Mount of God, [ thus called by reason of this divine apparition, and the LORDS giving his laws upon the same to Moseh, Exodus 18.5. and 19.3. and 1 Kings 19.8.] to Horeb. [Otherwise called Sinai, Exod.19.1. Acts 7.30.]
\p
\v 2 And the Angel of the LORD [This was the ORD himself, as appears, verse 4. and 6. Deut. 33.16. Compare Gen.16. On verse 7.] appeared unto him in a flame of a fire, out of the midst of a bramble bush : and he saw, and behold, the bramble bush burned in the fire, and the bramble bush was not consumed
\p
\v 3 And Moseh said ; I will now turn [ Heb. turn off] my self thitherward, and view that great Vision, [or, the great apparition, which was shewed forth there, not to the apprehension if the spirit, but to the outward sense of his bodily eyes.] why the bramble bush is not burned.
\p
\v 4 Then the LORD saw, that he turn'd himself thitherwards, for to view ; and God called to him out of the midst of the bramble bush, and said; Moseh, Moseh : and he said, Loe (here) I am.
\p
\v 5 And he said; Draw not near here : pull off thy shoes from off thy feet, [This served to excite Moseh to an holy humility ; as it did Josuah in another place, Jos.5.15.] for the place whereon thou standest, is holy land. (or, ground) [Heb. is earth of holinesse, viz. Made holy through the presence and apparition of God, without which it was but like other ground.]
\p
\v 6 Moreover he said; I am the God of thy father, the God of abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob ; and Moseh hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God. [See the like examples of fear, 1 Kings 19.13. Isa.6.2,5. See also Job13.20. Luke 5.8. proceeding from consideration of his own unworthiness and God transcendent Majesty.]
\p
\v 7 And the LORD said; I have very well seen [Heb. Seeing I have seen] the oppression of my people, which is in Egypt : and have heard their cry, by reason of their Drivers ; for their pains are known to me.
\p
\v 8 Therefore I am come down [See Gen.11.7. and 18.21. and 35.13.] to deliver it out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to carry them up out of this land, to a good and large land, [see Gen.13. 14,15.] to a land flowing with milk and honey : [understand and comprehend hereby all manner of temporal blessings.This affluence and abundance is often testified of the land of promise as Exodus 13.5. and 33.3. Leviticus 20.24. Deuter.6.3.] to that place of the Canaanites, and the Hethites, and the Pherezites, and the Hevites, and the Jebusites. [The Hebrew hath all these names in the singular number.]
\p
\v 9 And now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel, is come unto me ; and I have likewise seen the oppression,wherewith the Egyptians do oppress them.
\p
\v 10 Therefore come now, and I shall send thee to Pharao : that thou mayest carry forth my people the children of Israel, out of Egypt.
\p
\v 11 Then said Moseh to God ; Who am I, that I should go to Pharao, and that I should carry forth the children of Israel, out of Egypt?
\p
\v 12 Then he said ; I shall assuredly be with thee ; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee [ viz. This apparition of mine ; or, that which here follows immediately in the text.] when thou hast led forth this people out of Egypt , then ye shall serve God [i.e. offer up sacrifice, as appears verse 18. see the fulfilling thereof , Exod.19.] upon this mountain.
\p
\v 13 Then said Moseh to God ; Behold, when I come to the children of Israel, and say to them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you : and they tell me ; what is his name? What shall I say then?
\p
\v 14 And God said to Moseh; I shall be (hee) that i shall be. Also he said ; Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel, I SHALL BEE hath sent me unto you. [Oth. Read here, I am that I am, or, I shall be that I was ; and afterwards, I AM hath sent me, etc. The Hebrew words here and their severall significations wee agreeing with the Name JEHOVAH, which implieth, that God here sending Moseh, is etrnal in his being, faithful in his promises, and Almighty in the performance thereof. Compare Rev.1. 4, 8. and 16.15. Heb.13.8.]
\p
\v 15 Then God said farther to Moseh ; Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel ; The LORD God [ See Genesis 2. on verse 4.] of your Fathers, the god of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you : that is my Name everlastingly ; and that is my Memorial, from Generation to Generation. [Heb. to Generation of Generation. As if God had said, By this name all Generations shall remember me : See Psalm 102. 13. and 135. 13. Oth. This is my memorial forever, at all times, at all times.]
\p
\v 16 Goe, and assemble the eldest of Israel [Hereby are understood the Governours and Teachers of the people : these declared unto the people, what they understood by Moseh : See Exodus 12.3,21. and 19.3.] and say to them, The LORD your father's God hath appeared to me, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying ; I have faithfully visited you, [Hebrew, visiting I have visited you. See Genesis 21. on verse 1.] and that which is done unto you in Egypt.
\p
\v 17 Therefore I have said, I will carry you forth out of the oppression of Egypt, to the land of the Canaanites, [Hebrew, the Canaanite,etc.] and the Hethites, and the Amorites, and the Pherezites, and the Hevites, and the Jebusites : the land flowing with milk and honey.
\p
\v 18 And they shall hear thy voice, and thou shalt goe, thou and the eldest of Israel, unto the King of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him : The LORD, the God of the Hebrews hath met us,[i.e. appeared to us without our expectation ; and spake unto us, commanding us, what now we are presenting and requesting.] therefore let us go now (we pray) the way of three dayes (or, a three dayes journey) into the wildernesse [ to wit, unto Mount Horeb, verse 12. which without lets and impediments by the way, was but a three dayes journey distant from Egypt.] that wee may sacrifice to the LORD our God.
\p
\v 19 Yet I know, that the King of Egypt will not let you goe : no not by a strong hand. [ not for divers great and heavy plagues. See Exod.14.31.]
\p
\v 20 For i will stretch out [Heb. send, send forth] my hand, [i.e. my strong and smarting pladues.] and smite Egypt with all my wonders, [Hereby he understands the ten plagues, wherewith he was resolved to smite Egypt.] which i shall do in the midst of them : after that, [i.e. after the last, or tenth plague, viz. The slaying of the first-born.] he shall let you goe.
\p
\v 21 And i will give this people grace in the eyes of the Egyptians : [i.e. favour among them. See Gen.18. 3. so that they shall be willing and ready to lend unto the Israelites, before their going forth, whatsoever they shall desire at their hands.] and it shall come to passe, when ye shall go forth, ye shall not go forth empty. [ according to Gods promise, Gen.15.14. Of the fulfilling whereof see below chap.12.35,36.]
\p
\v 22 But (each) woman shall ask of her neighbour, and the hostesse of her house, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garnents : them ye shall lay (or, put) upon your sons, and upon your daughters, and shall bereave the Egyptians. [This was no theft, nor sin : God having commanded the act, which is the owner Paramount of all, and likewise intended thereby to recompence his people by this means, their heavy labour hitherto.]
\c 4
\s Moseh is encouraged by the changing of his staff into a Serpent, v.1. etc. and by the leprosie of his hand, 6. as also by the turning of the water into bloud, 9. Moseh pretends difficulty to go to Pharao, 10. provoking God to anger thereby, who appoints Aaron to be his spokesman, 14. Jethro gives leave to Moseh to return to Egypt, 18. The LORD tells Moseh, what is he to doe and speak to Pharao, 21. The LORD is ready to slay Moseh by the way, 24. Zippora circumciseth her son, 25. God sends Aaron to meet Moseh, 27. They both declare their charge unto the Israelites, 29. and are believed, 31.
\p
\v 1 Then Moseh answered, and said ; But, loe, They [viz. the Israelites,] will not believe me, nor hear my voice; for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee.
\p
\v 2 And the LORD said unto him, what is there in thy hand? And he said ; A staff [verse 20. it is called, the staff of God, because, that through Gods power, great things were done by the same.]
\p
\v 3 And he said ; thrw it on the ground : and he threw it on the ground ; then it became [Exod.7.15. It is said, it was changed into] a Serpent : [Exod.7.10. It is called a Dragon.] and Moseh fled from it [viz. for fear.]
\p
\v 4 Then said the LORD to Moseh, Stretch forth thy hand, and lay hand on her by her tail.Then he stretched forth his hand, and apprehended her, and she became a staff in his hand, [Heb. palm.]
\p
\v 5 That they may believe, that the LORD, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to thee.
\p
\v 6 And the LORD said further to him, Now put thy hand into thy bosom : and he put his hand into his bosom. After that, he drew it forth, and behold , his hand was leprous, (as) white as snow.
\p
\v 7 And he said, Put thy hand again into thy bosom ; and he put his hand again into his bosom ; after that, he drew it forth out of his bosom, and behold, it was again as his (other) flesh.
\p
\v 8 And it shall come to passe, if they believe thee not, nor hearken to the voice of the first token, [i.e. to the word, confirmed by the first token.Here a voice is attributed to the token, ( as Gen.4.10. to the blood) God speaking as it were, and making his minde known unto men by such tokens.] they will believe the word of the last token.
\p
\v 9 And it wall come to passe, if likewise they believe not these two tokens, nor hearken to thy voice ; then take of the waters of the river, and pour them out on the dry (ground :) then shall the waters which thou shalt take forth out of the river, the same shall become blood upon the dry (ground.)
\p
\v 10 Then said Moseh to the LORD, Ah, [see of the Hebrew particle here used, Gen. 43.10.] Lord, I am no man of language, [Heb. no man of word, i.e.I am no well-spoken man ; I want utterance.] neither of yesterday, nor eve yesterday, nor since the time, thou hast spoken to thy servant : for I am heavie of mouth, and heavie of tongue. [Moseh despaired altogether of the amendment of his tongue, since he found no improvement thereof, whiles God was instructing him for his embassie. Psal.94.9.]
\p
\v 11 And the LORD said to him , Who hath made [Heb. set or put] the mouth to man? Or, who hath made th dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blinde? Am not I the same, the LORD?
\p
\v 12 And now go (thy way) and I shall be with thy mouth, and shall teach thee, what thou shalt speak, [viz. by my Spirit ; as Christ likewise promised the same to his Apostles, Mat.10.19,20. Mark 13.11. and Luke 12.11,12.]
\p
\v 13 Yet he said,Ah Lord! Send by the hand [i.e.service, as Exod.9.35. Psal.77.21. Hag.1.1. Mal.1. Acts 7.35.] ( of him whom) thou wilt send. [Heb. send ( I pray) by the hand thou shalt send : i.e. send such a one , whom thou knowest fitter to be sent, then I am, for such a message or employment.]
\p
\v 14 Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moseh ; and he said , Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know, that he shall speak very well. [Heb. that speaking he shall speak ; i.e. That he is well-spoken, that he can and will speak to good purpose.] and behold, likewise, he shall go forth to meet thee. [ oth. he goeth forth] when he seeth thee, he shall rejoyce in his heart
\p
\v 15 Thou thn shalt speak unto him, and put the words [viz. those which I have, or yet shall speak unto thee] into his mouth : [ i.e. Thou shalt clearly instruct, and strictly charge him, faithfully to declare my words, where it shall be requisite. See Isai.51.16. Deut.2.30.Jer.1.9. & 5.14.] and I shall be with thy mouth, and with his mouth : and I shall teach you what ye shall do.
\p
\v 16 And he shall speak for thee unto the people ; and it shall come to passe, that heshall be a mouth unto thee, [i.e. he shall be thy spokes-man or interpreter : otherw. In stead of the mouth] and thou shalt be a God to him. [i.e. thou shalt have the direction of all, and enjoyn, and command him in my Name, what he shall say : and he shall hear and obey thee, as my self. Comp. Bel. Chap.7.1.]
\p
\v 17 Take then his staff into thy hand, whereby thou shalt do those tokens. [Whereof mention will be made, Ch.7,8,9,10,11.]
\p
\v 18 Then Moseh went, and returned to Jethro to his father in law, and said to him, Let me go, I pray, that I may return to my brethren, that are in Egypt, and see, whether they are alive yet.Jethro said to Moseh, Go in peace.
\p
\v 19 Also the LORD said to Moseh [or, had said] in Midian, Go, return into Egypt : for all the men are dead, which sought thy soul. [i.e. thy life. See Gen. 19.17. that is, those which sought to put thee to death. See the like phrase, 1 Samuel 22.23. and 1 King. 19.14. Psal.54.5. Mat.2.20.]
\p
\v 20 So Moseh took his wife, and his sons, and carried them up an asse, and returned into the land of Egypt : and Moseh took the staff of God in to his hand. [The same staff namely , which God had bidden him to take along, v.17. And by the means whereof God would work tokens, Exod.17.9. This staff is likewise called, the staff of God, to shew, that the power of working miracles, was not in the staff, nor in Moseh, but onely in God.]
\p
\v 21 And the LORD said to Moseh, Because thou goest to return into Egypt, look to it, that thou do all the wonders before Pharao, which I have put into thy hand : [ i.e. which I am resolved and about to perform, through thy service, and my power] yet I shall stupifie his heart , [oth. stiffen, harden it, and delivering him over to his own evil will and affections, to that of his own malice, and through the devils instigation, he shall take occasion and motives from these very wonders, to withstand my Commandments but so much the more.The like phrase see bel. Chap.10.1. and Deut.2.20. Josh.11.20.] that he shall not let the people go.
\p
\v 22 Then shalt thou say to Pharao, Thus saith the LORD, My Son, my first-born, is Israel : i.e the people or posterity of Israel ; who are called Gods first-born son, for being chosen the first, of grace,out of all nations, to be the people and children of God; and being acceptable therefore unto God, as the first-born are unto their parents.]
\p
\v 23 And I have said to thee, [oth. I tell thee] Let my son go, that he may serve me ; but thou hast refused to let him go : behold, I shall slay thy son, thy first-born.
\p
\v 24 And it came to passe upon the way, [viz. toward Egypt] in the inne, that the LORD came against him, and sought to slay him. [ for having neglected the circumcising of his son. See Gen.17.14.]
\p
\v 25 Then Zippora took a stone- (knife) [ oth. A sharp stone] and circumcised the fore-skin of her son ; and threw it before his feet, [oth . made it (the resected fore-skin namely) touch his (viz. Moseh his) feet. Others take it, as if Zippora had thrown her son before her husbands feet] and said, Verily, thou art a bloody husband to me. [Heb. a bridegroom of bloods, (sanguinum, in plural.) Understand these words, as if Zippora should have said to her husband, I was fain to ransom thy life with the blood of my son, whom now I circumcised : and thus thou art become, in a manner, a new bridegroom unto me.]
\p
\v 26 An he [ viz.God, or, the Angel that was about to slay Moseh] ceased from him. Then said she, Blood-bridegroom, [Heb. a bridegroom of bloods] because of the circumcisions. [ It seems she was not pleased with the circumcision of her sons.]
\p
\v 27 The LORD said likewise to Aaron, Go meet Moseh in the wildernesse. And he went and met him, at the mount of God, [called Horeb ab. Chap.3.1.] and he kissed him.
\p
\v 28 And Moseh made known unto Aaron, all the words of the LORD, that had sent him ; and all the tokens, which he had commanded him.
\p
\v 29 Then Moseh and Aaron went, and they gathered all the eldest of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 30 And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moseh : and he did the tokens before the eyes of the people.
\p
\v 31 And the people believed, and heard, that the LORD visited the children of Israel, and that he saw their oppresion, [viz. with compassion, as Exod.3.7.] and they enclined their heads, and worshipped.
\c 5
\s Moseh and Aaron declare unto Pharaoh, what God had charged them to deliver unto him, v.1, & c. He withstands and checks them, 4.The Israelites burdens are increased, 5. They murmur against Moseh and Aaron, 20. Moseh complains of it to God, 22. God promiseth to deliver them, 24.
\p
\v 1 And after that, Moseh and Aaron went, and said to Pharao, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may keep me a feast in the wilderness.
\p
\v 2 But Pharao said, Who is the LORD, whose voice I should obey, for to let Israel go? I do not know the LORD, neither shall I let Israel go.
\p
\v 3 Then they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met us ; therefore let us go ( we pray) the way of three days into the wildernesse, and to sacrifice unto the LORD our God, hath he do not seize on us with pestilence, or with the sword.
\p
\v 4 Then the King of Egypt said unto them, Thou Moseh and Aaron, wherefore withdraw ye the people from their works ? Go (your ways) to your burthens.
\p
\v 5 Moreover, Pharao said, Behold the people of the land [he speaketh of the people of Israel in the land of Egypt] is (too) many already ; and should ye make them to rest from their burdens? [By these words Pharao gives to understand, wherefore he laid such heavie burdens upon the Israelites, namely, to exhaust and waste all their vigour, and thus to hinder and impair their propagation.]
\p
\v 6 Therefore Pharao commanded on that same day the exactors among the people, [these were Egyptians, v.14. That were set over the Israelite-officers] and the officers of the same, [these were Israelites, v.14. Under the command of the foresaid Egyptians exactors] saying,
\p
\v 7 Ye shall henceforward give these people no straw more [Heb.ye shall not adde to give, & c.] for the making of bricks, ( or, tile-stones) [Heb. to brick bricks, or tile tile-stones] as yeserday and eve yesterday : let them go themselves, and gather straw for themselves.
\p
\v 8 And ye shall impose them the number [or, sum, measure] of the bricks, which they made yesterday and eve yesterday ; ye shall not lessen the same : for they go (or,grow) idle ; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go, let us sacrifice to our God.
\p
\v 9 Let the service be maade heavie upon these men, that they may have (enough) of it to do, and gape (or gad) not about , on lying words, [Heb. words of lying, or, falshood.This wicked king calls the words of God, lying words : or else, he would be understood, they were lyes, what Moseh and Aaron spake of being sent by God.]
\p
\v 10 Then the exactors of the people, and their officers, went forth, and spake to the people , saying, Thus saith Pharao, I shall give you no straw.
\p
\v 11 Go ye (your selves) fetch you straw, where ye finde it : yet of your service nothing shall be lessened. [Heb. no word, i.e. no thing.]
\p
\v 12 Then the people scattered themselves in all the land of Egypt, to gather stubble in stead of straw.
\p
\v 13 And the exactors pressed on, saying, Complete your works, (each) days work upon its day, as when there was straw.
\p
\v 14 And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharao's exactors had put over them, were beaten, and told, [Heb. saying] Wherefore have ye not completed your set work (or, your task) in making of bricks, as formerly , [Heb. as yesterday, eve yesterday] so also yesterday and to day?
\p
\v 15 Therefore the officers of the children of Israel went, and cried to Pharao, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?
\p
\v 16 Thy servants have no straw given them, and they say to us, [they, viz. the exactors] Make the bricks : [ oth. The bricks, they tell us, Ye shall make] and behold, thy servants are beaten ; yet the fault is thy peoples, [ viz. the Egyptians, delivering no straw to us, and nevertheless requiring the ordinary task and days work at our hands. Otherwise, And thy people, to wit, the Israelites, must be blamed ,or faulty.]
\p
\v 17 Then he said, Ye are idle, idle are ye ; therefore ye say, Let us go, let us sacrifice unto the LORD.
\p
\v 18 Go to now then, (labour) yet no straw shall be given you, ye shall deliver the number of bricks.
\p
\v 19 . Then the officers of the children of Israel saw that it stood (or, went) ill with, [Heb, that they were in the evil] being they were told, ye shall not lessen your bricks from the task on its day. [as ab.v.13. Oth (deliver) the days work, (or task) on this day]
\p
\v 20 And they met Moseh and Aaron, who stood over gain if they went forth from Pharao;
\p
\v 21 And said unto them, THE LORD look upon you, [i.e. the LORD take notice of this, and consider what ye have brought upon us. See Gen. 31. on v. 42.] and judge (it) [See Gen 15.v14.v.5.] because ye have made our savour to stink before Pharao, and before his servants, [Hebbefore the eyes of the Pharao, and before the eyes of his servants] giving a sword into their hands, to slay us, [viz. by having made us hateful to Pharao. See Gen 34.30]
\p
\v 22 . Then Moseh returned to the LORD, [i.e. he belooked himself to a certain retired place, where, by prayer and hearty sighs, he might pour our and present his own and the people distress and extremity unto the LORD] and said, Lord, why host thou done evil to this people? Wherefore hast thou sent me now?
\p
\v 23 For since the time that I went in to Pharao, for to speak in thy Name, [i.e. in thy behalf, on thy command: so Ezr.5.1. Psal. 118.26 Job.5.43.] he hath dealt ill with this people: and thou hast in no wise delivered thy people. [Heb. Delivering not delivered.]
\p
\v 24 . Then [the LORD said to Moseh, Now thou shalt see, what I will do to Pharao: for he shall let them go, through a mighty hand, [i.e. through my own power, by meer force and compulsion: see the fulfilling thereof, Exod.12. and 13 Chap.] yea, through a mighty hand shall be drive them out of his land.
\c 6
\s God encourgeth Moseh by repeating of his Name unto him, and the covenant made with the father, v.1, &c. He promiseth again to deleiver his people, 7. But they will not hearthen unto Moseh, 9 God sends Moseh again, 25 together with Moseh his unwillingness, 29.
\p
\v 1 Further God spake to Moseh, and said to him, I am the LORD. [See Gen. 24.]
\p
\v 2 . And I have appeared to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, AS God Almighty, [Heb. In God the Almighty: oth, with (or, by) (the Name of) God Almighty; i.e. such a one as is able and sufficient to do good, and to perform all his promises, Gen.17.1.] yet by my Name LORD have I not been known unto them. [God implieth here, that this Name of hid, JEHOVAH, and that which the same imports and signifies, was not so fully known unto them, as it should be made known hence forward to their posterity, by the real fulfilling of his of his promises, and especially by the wonderful deliverance of them out of Egypt, and bringing them at length into the land of promise. Otherwise God called himself JEHOVAH long before, and that Name confirmed his promises, as is to be seen, Gen 2.7,7,8,9. and 15.7. and 28.12,&c.]
\p
\v 3 . And I have likewise set up my covenant with them, that I should give them the land of Canaan, the land of their ships, wherein they were strangers.
\p
\v 4 . And I have heard also they were groaning [or, moan, complaint] of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians hold in bondage, [or, make to serve, enslave] and remember my concernt. [this is spoken after the manner of me, as Gen 8.1.]
\p
\v 5 Therefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will lead you forth from under the burrthens of the Egyptians, and I will rescue you out of their bondage, and will deliver you, through a stretch – out arm, [i.e. through a very great and extraordinary power spoke after the manner of men] and through great judgments: [i.e. executing great and terrible punishment upon the Egyptians, to the manifestation of my just and righteous judgments.]
\p
\v 6 . And will accept you for my people, [i.e. such a one as shall know and serve me, and by me enjoy all manner of temporal and spiritual mercies and benefits, to their everlasting salvation.] and I will be a God unto you: and ye shall acknowledge [oth. Funde, or knew, or, get experience] that I am the LORD your God, leading you forth, from under the burthens of the Egyptians
\p
\v 7 . And I will bring you into that land, over which I have lifted my hand, [i.e. made an oath: see Gen 14.22. and Isai.62.8.] that I would give in to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob: and I will give it you for an inheritance. I the LORD. [Oth. I am the LORD: as if God said I am both able and ready to give you what I have promised. See ab. V.1.
\p
\v 8 And Moseh spake thus unto the children of Israel: yet they hearkened not to Moseh, because of the distress of the spirit, and because of the hard bondage. [The Israelites were so dismayed, and kept under, that they would rather continne under the Egyptian slavery, then desire Moseh to proceed for that their deliverance; fearing worse yet would come upon them. See Exod 14.12. & Job 21.4.]
\p
\v 9 . Moreover, the LORD spake unto Moseh, saying
\p
\v 10 . Go on, speak to Pharoa the king of Egypt, to let the children of Israel go forth out of his land.
\p
\v 11 . Yet Moseh spake before the LORD, saying, Behold the children of Israel have not hearkened to me, how then should Phroa hear me? Beside, I am uncirumised of lips; [i.e. I am not well – spoken. Hence Moseh would inser, that God ought not to send him to Pharoa, but one that was more able and eloquent.See ab. Chap 4.10.The like complaint Isaiah like wise made. Chap.6.5. and Jeremia, chapter 1.6]
\p
\v 12 Howbeit the LORD spake to Moseh and to Aaron, and gave them charge to the children of Israel, and to Pharao the king of Egypt, for the lead the children of Israel out of Egypt.
\p
\v 13 Thse are the heads [i.e. the chiesest, or principal] of (each) house, their father: the sons of Ruben, the first – born of Israel, are heanoch and Pollu, Hezron and Charmi: these are the families [or, generations] of Ruben.
\p
\v 14 . And the sons of Simeon: Iemuel, and Iamin, and Ohad, and Iachin, and Zohar, AND Saul, the son of a Canaanite – (woman these are Simeons families.
\p
\v 15 These are the sons of Levi, according to their births: Gerson, and Kehath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.
\p
\v 16 The sons of Gerson, Libni and Simei, according to their families.
\p
\v 17 . And the sons of Kehat, Amram, and Izhar, and Izhar, andHebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kehat, were an hundred thirty and three years.
\p
\v 18 And the sons of Merar, Mahali, and Musi; these are the families of Levi,after their births.
\p
\v 19 . And Amram took him Iochebed his aunt [the daughter of Levi, Exod. 21. Num. 26.59. The sister of Amrams father] to wise; and she bare him Aaron and Moseh; and the years of the life of Amram,were an hundred thirty and seven years.
\p
\v 20 . And the sons of Izhar of Izhar, Karah, [this si the same Korah, that rebelled against Moseh. Num. 16.1
\p ] and Nepheg, and Zichri.
\p
\v 21 . And the sons of Uzziel, [he Is called Aaron’s uncle, Lev 10.4.] Misael and Sithri.
\p
\v 22 And Aaron took his to wise Eliseba, [this woman was of the tribe of Judah, prince Nahessions sister, Num 1.7. and 2.3. and 1 Chron.2.10.] the daughter of Amminadab, Nehessions sister; and she bare him Nadab and Abihu, [both these are joined here together, being both of them consumed together by fire, Lev.10.1] Elezar, [who succeeded his father in the high – priests office, Num. 20.25.] and Ithamer.
\p
\v 23 . And the sons of Korah, were Assir, and Elkana, and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korhites.
\p
\v 24 And Elezar, Aarons son. Took him to wise one of the daughters of Puthiel; and bare him Pinehas [of whom; see Num 24.7.] these are the heads [i.e.chiefest] o the fathers of the Levites, according to their families.
\p
\v 25 This is Aaron and Moseh, unto whom the LORD said, Lead the children of Israel forth of Egypt, according to their hosts. [God would have Moseh to lead forth the people, not in a consumed tumultuary manner but according to the order of their present abodes and habitations: they were not as yet divided according to their tribes.
\p
\v 26 . Thse are they, which spake to Pharao, the king of Egypt, that they might lead forth the children of Israel out of Egypt. This is Moseh and Aaron.
\p
\v 27 . And it came to pass on that day, when the LORD spake to Moseh in the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 28 . Then the LORD spake to Moseh, saying I am the LORD; speak to Pharao the king of Egypt, all that I speak unto thee.
\p
\v 29 . Then said Moseh before the face of the LORD, Behold, I am uncircumcised of lips, how then shall Pharaoh earthen to me?
\c 7
\s Moseh and Aaron are encouraged of God to go to Pharao, v.1, &c. whose heart is hardened, 3. Moseh and Aaron their age, when they were sent to Pharao,7. Aaron ‘s staff is turned into dragon, 10. The Margicians do the like, 11. Pharao remains obdurate, 14. Moseh is sent again to him, 15. The water of Egypt are turned into blood, 19. whereof the fishes die, 21. The Magicians do the like, 22.
\p
\v 1 Then the LORD said to Moseh , Behold, I have set thee a god [ see ab. chapter 4.16.] over Pharao, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. [that is, (here) thy interpreter, or spokes – men. Exod.4.16. it is said, He shall be a mouth unto thee.]
\p
\v 2 . Thou shalt speak [viz. to Aaron] all that I shall command thee; and Aaron thy brother shall speak to Pharao, that he dismiss the children of Israel out of his land.
\p
\v 3 . Yet I shall harden pharao’s heart, [see Exod. 4. on v.21.] and I shall multiply in the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 4 . Pharao now shall not hearken to you; and shall lay [Heb. Give] my hand [i.e. my plagues and punishments: see the like phrase, Exod.9.3. Judg.2.15. and 1 Sam 12. 15. Lam3.3.] on Egypt, [ or upon the Egyptians] and carry my hosts, my people, the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt, through great judgments. [I.e. punishments. See ab. Ch.6.5.]
\p
\v 5 . Then the Egyptians shall know, that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth my hand over Egypt, and lead forth the children of Israel out of the midst of them.
\p
\v 6 Then Mozes and Aaron did: as the Lord had commanded them, thus did they.
\p
\v 7 . And Moseh was eighty years old. And Aaron was eighty and three years old, [heb. A son of eighty, a son of eighty three, &c.] when they spake to Pharao.
\p
\v 8 . And the LORD spake to Moseh and to Aaron, saying,
\p
\v 9 . When Pharao shall speak to you, saying Do wondertoken for you, [Heb. Give a wonder for you; viz. for to shew that ye are sent to me of God] then shalt thou say to Aaron, take thy staff, [Exod.4.20. it is called, the staff of God; and Exod 4.2. Moseh his staff: but here, and v.12. Aaron’s staff; the same being now in Aaron’s hand] and throw (it) down before Pharao’s face, it shall become a dragon.
\p
\v 10 . Then Moseh and Aaron went in to Pharaoah, and did thus, as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron threw his staff down before Pharoh’s face, and before the face of his servants; and it become a dragon.
\p
\v 11 Pharao now called likewise –(men) and the juggler, [i.e. them who by the devils arts and flights used to bewitch men’s eyes, that they thought they saw that, which indeed was not; and were counted wise – men , and highly esteemed by the Egyptians] and the Egyptian Magicians [see Gen; 41.8. the chiefesr of these, Paul calls by their names, 2 Tim. 3.8. Jannes and Jambres] did likewise so [viz. in outwards semblance, but not in true reality] with their enchantments.
\p
\v 12 For every one threw his staff down, and they become dragons: but Aaron’s staff [i.e. the dragon, into which his staff was turned] swallowed up their state.
\p
\v 13 Yet Pharaoh’s heart wa stupefied, [see Exod 4.21.] so that was turned not unto them, according as the LORD had spoken.
\p
\v 14 Then the LORD said unto Moseh, and Pharaoh’s hearts is heavy: [so that it cannot rouse or raise it self up to obedience] he refuseth to let the people g.
\p
\v 15 Got to Pharaoh in the morning; behold, he will go forth towards the water; put thy self over against him, at the bank of the river: and the staff, that was turned into a serpent, thou shalt take in thy hand,
\p
\v 16 And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD, the Hebrews God, hath sent me to there, saying, [i.e. for to denounce unto thee] Let my people go, that they (may) serve me in the wilderness: yet behold, thou hast not hearkened unto me hitherto.
\p
\v 17 Thus saith the LORD, Thereby thou shalt know, that I am the LORD: behold, I shall smite with this staff, that is in my hand [it was Aaron that smote with the staff, as is plainly experts bel. V.19 but God commanded the doing of it Moseh, See the like, Mat .20.32. compared with Mark 10.49. and Mark 15.45. with Mat 27.58.] upon the water that is in this river, and it shall be changed into blood.
\p
\v 18 And the fish in the river shall die, so the river shall stink: and the Egyptians shall be wearing (or, turmoil’s, cumbered) to drink the water of the river. [Hereby it appears, that not the Israelites; but the Egyptians onely were in want of good water; who would take very wearisome pains, with digging and running for good water all about the river, as verse.24.]
\p
\v 19 Moreover, the LORD said to Moseh, say unto Aaron, take thy staff, and put forth thy hand over the waters of the Egyptians, over their streams, over their rivers, and over every gathering of their waters, that they may become blood: and let there be blood in all the land of Egypt, both in wood – and in fore – (vessels) [Heb. In words and in stones]
\p
\v 20 Moseh now and Aaron did thus, according as the LORD had commanded: and the [viz. Aaron] lifted up the staff, and smote the water that was in the rivers, before the eys of Pharaoh, and before the eyes of his servants; and all the water in the river was changed into blood.
\p
\v 21 And the fish that was in the river, died; [This plague was so much the greater, be cause the Egyptians and people dwelling in those parts, fed much on fish, and traded and maintained themselves with them: see Num 11.5. for they abstained from the flesh of divers beasts, out of the superstition, Exod, 8.26.] and the river stunk Egyptians, whose daily was water, and had had not other, but what they fetched out of the great river Nile, and the outlets thereof, falling no ran in that country, as is to be gather by Deut 11.10,11] so that the Egyptians could not drink the water of e.g the rivers; and there was blood in all the land of Egypt. [viz. not onely in the grate river, but likewise in all other waters throughout the land.]
\p
\v 22 Yet the Egyptian magicians did (likewise) thus by their enchanting; [see ab. V. 11. the water which they turned into blood, they got by digging about the river, v.24. or, they fetched it out of the land of gosen, out of the house of the Israelites, dwelling here and there intermixed with the Egyptians] so that Pharaoh’s heart grew obdurate, and he hearkened not to them, according as the LORD had spoken.
\p
\v 23 And Pharaoh turned himself about, and went to his house: and he set his heart not thereon neither. [i..e. he needed it no further; he took it not to heart at all. See the like phrase, Exod 9.21 and 1 Sam 4.20. & 2 Sam .18.3 and Prov22.17.]
\p
\v 24 Yet all the Egyptians digged round about the river, for to drink water: for they were not able to drink of the water of the river.
\p
\v 25 Thus seven days were fulfilled, [Heb. And the week of days was filled: so log this plague continued] after that the LORD had smitten the river.
\c 8
\s God threatens Pharaohs to plague him with frogs, if he would not let Israel go, v.1, &c. Aaron stretched forth his band, and there came frogs over all the land of Egypt, 5. The magicians do the like, 7 Pharaoh calls Moseh frogs, that he will let Israel go, 8. But he performs it not, 15. The third plague comes over Egypt, the dust being turned into lice, 16 which the magicians are not able to initiate, 18 yet Pharaohs remains harden, 19. The fourth plague comes, to wit, a mixture of all sorts of insects, 21. Israel thereof in Gosen, 22. Pharaoh seems ready to let the people go, 25. Moseh prays to God, and he takes these insets away, 29. Pharaoh remains harden, 32.
\p
\v 1 After that, the LORD said to Moseh, Go in to Pharao, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\p
\v 2 . And if thou refuse to let them go, then shall I smite [I.e. plague, afflict] all thy border [i.e. the whole land, from one end to the other] with frog;
\p
\v 3 That the river shall crawl of frogs, [or, shall abundantly bring for to frogs: understand likewise all other waters and pools here, as v.5.] they shall get up, and came into thy house and into thy head – chamber, yet upon thy bed; also upon thy houses of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy ovens, and into thy kneading thought. (Or, dowe lumps) [In that manner namely shall they come everywhere, that no doors, locks or bolts; no gates, walls or fences, shall be able to free either self or servants from the trouble of them.]
\p
\v 4 And the frogs shall come up[, upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants. [By this particular naming of Pharaoh, and his people and servants, Moseh shews plainly, that the Israelites were free, and not molested with this plague. See v.21.&22.]
\p
\v 5 Further said the LORD to Moseh, [viz. after that Moseh had done what God commanded him, v.1. and Pharaoh had refused to give ear to it] Say to Aaron, stretch forth thy hand with thy staff over the stream, and over the rivers, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up over land of Egypt.
\p
\v 6 And Aaron stretched forth his hand over the waters of Egypt, and there came up frogs, [Heb, and the frog came up; and so like elsewhere] and covered the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 7 Then the magicians did also likewise [see ab. Ch.7. v.11] with their enchantings; and they made frogs to come up over the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 8 And Pharaoh called Moseh and Aaron, and said, solvently to the LORD, [Gen 25. on verse. 21. The plagues and the sensible smarting make Pharao to know God now, whom before he would not know. See Exod . 5.2. and Sar. 6.2,3. &c] that he take away the frogs from we and from my people, [the Magicians could indeed seemingly imitate Gods plagues, v.7. But they were not able to remove or affwage the] then shall let the people go, that they may sacrifice to the LORD.
\p
\v 9 Yet Moseh said to Pharao, have the honour upon me; against hen shall I pray servently for thee and for thy people, for to destroy these frogs from thee and from thy house, that they remain onely in the river? [ As if Moseh should say, I will do thee the honour and, suffer that thou appoint me the time, wherein in the LORD, upon my prayer and intercession, shall deliver thee and thine from this plague of the frogs. See the like expression, Judge . 7.2 Isa. 10.15]
\p
\v 10 Then he said, [viz. Pharao] Against tomorrow. And he said [viz. Moseh] Be it according to thy word, that thou mayest know, that there is none like unto the LORD our God:
\p
\v 11 Then the frogs shall withdraw from thee from thee and from thy house, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall onely remain in the river.
\p
\v 12 Them Moseh and Aaron went forth from Pharoah and Moses called to the LORD because of the frogs, which he had laid on Pharoa [i.e. which God had brought as a punishment upon Pharoah, and his, by Moseh]
\p
\v 13 And the LORD did according to the word of Moseh, and the frogs died, out of the house, out of the entries, [or, out house, out – court. The meaning is, that the frogs dying in the houses, rooms, court – yards, etc, they were swept and shevel'd thence] and out of the fields.
\p
\v 14 And they gathered together by heaps, [they viz, the Egyptians. Heb heaps, heps] and the land stank.
\p
\v 15 Now when Pharao saw, that there was breathing, [i.e. that the plague was asswaged, oth room] he aggravated his heart, (or, made it heavte) [i.e. he remained hardned in his wicked and refractory purpose: see oh. 7 14 and Sai 26.10.] that he hearkened not unto them, according as the LORD his spoken.
\p
\v 16 Moreover the LORD said to Moseh, say to Aaron, stretch out thy staff, and smite the dust of the earth, that it become like in all the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 17 And they did so; for Aaron stretched hos head forth with his staff, and smote the dust of the earth, and the dust of the earth become live, in all the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 18 The Magicians did likewise so [i.e. They smote the dust on the ground, as Aaron had done, but in vain] by their enchanting, that they might bring forth lice; [or, that they might cause lice to come forth] yet they could not; so the liee were on the men, and an the cattel.
\p
\v 19 Then the Magicians said to Pharao, This is the immediate power and work of God; Compare Luke 11.20 with Matt. 12.28. see the like manner of speaking, Jud2.15. And 1Sam 6.3,9. Acts 13.11.] howbeit Pharaos heart was stiffening (or hardening), so that he hearkened not unto them, according as the LORD had speken.
\p
\v 20 Moreover, the LORD said to Moseh; Get thee up early to narrow, and put thy self before Pharaos face ; behold, he shall goe forth unto the water,and tell him; Thus saith the LORD; let my people goe, that they may serve me:
\p
\v 21 For is thou do not let my people goe, lo, then shall I send a mixture of inserts [Suc as are all manner of flies, gnats, wasps, hornets, beetles, caterpillars, pis-mires, spiders, snails, mice and such like vermin, which which destroys and waste grass, and fruits, and corns in the fields, gardens, medows, and houses] upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into your houses; so that the houses of the Egyptians shall filled up with mixture, and the earth likeise, upon which they are, [they, viz. the Egyptians, he would imply, that this vermine should be every where where the Egyptians were, and no where else, as appears by the verse 22.]
\p
\v 22 And in that day I will separate the land of Gosen, wherein my people dwelleth, [Hbr, stand upon] that there be no mixture of the insects there, [viz, although the Magicians shall doe and assay their utmost to compasse it] that thou mayest know, I am the LORD in the midst of this land. [or of the earth, i.e. that I am Lord and Master in Egypt, though Pharao imagineth there is none other but himself. See above chapter 5.2.]
\p
\v 23 And I shall set deliverance, betwixt my people, and betwixt thy people, [viz. which shall make a difference betwixt the one and the other.] this token shall happen against tomorrow.
\p
\v 24 And the LORD did so , and there came an heavy mixture of insects into Pharaos house, and into houses of servants, and over all the land of Egypt; the land was spoiled [i.e. all that the land brought forth] by this mixture.
\p
\v 25 Then Pharao called Moseh and Aaron, and said; Goe and sacrifice unto your God in this land. [understand; but not in the wilderness, as ye would have it See chap 5. verse 1.]
\p
\v 26 Moseh then said: it is not right so to do; for we should possibly offer the Egyptians abomination unto the LORD our God, [to wit, oxen, cowes, calves, bullocks whom the Egyptians exhibit divine honours unto, and slay none of them for sacrifice. See Gen 43. 32. and 46.34.] behold, if we should sacrifice the Egyptians abominations, would they not stone us?
\p
\v 27 Let us go the way of three days into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God according as he shall tell us. [They knew not, what they were to scarifiece or slay, until they should be come into the wilderness, see below chapter 10.26.]
\p
\v 28 Then said Pharao; I shall let go, that ye may sacrifice unto the LORD your God in the wilderness, onely (s as) that going ye in no wise goe too far off: [Hebr. Going far, ye goe not far] servantly for me [to wit, That the plague might be taken from me; see above verse 8. and Acts 8.24.]
\p
\v 29 Moseh now said, Behold I goe from thee, and shall pray servently unto the LORD, that this mixture of insects withdraw from Pharao, from his servant, and from his people (by) tomorrow: onely, let Pharo deal no more deceitfully, [to wit, as he had done before, when the plague of the frogs tormented him verse 15] not letting people to go sacrifie unto the LORD.
\p
\v 30 Then Moseh went forth from Pharaoh, and prayed servently unto the LORD.
\p
\v 31 And the LORD did according to the word of Moseh, and the mixture of insects retired from Pharao, from his servants , and from his people, there remained not one over.
\p
\v 32 Yet Pharao aggravated (or harden) his heart also at that time:and he did not let the people go.
\c 9
\s God threatens to smite the cattle with a grievous pestilence, which is the fifth plague, verse 1. yet he spares the Israelites, 4. Pharaoh remains obstinate, 7. The sixth plague, to wit, boils over men and beast, 8, so that the Magicians were not able to stand before Moses, 12, and yet Pharaoh remains hardened, 12. God threatens him with more grievous plagues yet, 13. The seventh plague, to wit, hail and fire, 18, only the land of Goshen is spared, 26. Pharaoh confesses his sin, and Moses prays for him, 27. The plague ceases, 33. Pharaoh remains hardened, 34.
\p
\v 1 After that the LORD said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and speak to him: Thus says the LORD the God of the Hebrews: Let my people go, that they may serve [i.e. offer sacrifice unto] me.
\p
\v 2 For if you refuse to let them go, and that you forcibly retain them yet;
\p
\v 3 Behold, the hand of the LORD [i.e. the extraordinary immediate power of God, without the intervention of any human operation. See above, chapter 8 verse 19.] shall be over your cattle that is in the field, over the horses, over the asses, over the camels, over the oxen, and over the small cattle; by a very grievous pestilence.
\p
\v 4 And the LORD shall make a separation between the cattle of the Israelites and between the cattle of the Egyptians, that nothing shall die of all that is (belonging to) the children of Israel.
\p
\v 5 And the LORD appointed a certain time, saying, Tomorrow shall the LORD do this thing in this land.
\p
\v 6 And the LORD did this thing the next day, and all the cattle of the Egyptians [i.e. all sorts of them, some of every sort, or, all the beasts that were in the field, verse 3; for there remained some over, as appears below, verse 19 and 25 and chapter 10.5] died; but of the cattle of the children of the Israelites died not one.
\p
\v 7 And Pharaoh sent thither, and behold, of the cattle of Israel there died not one; yet the heart of Pharaoh was aggravated, and he did not let the people go.
\p
\v 8 Then said the LORD to Moses and to Aaron, Take you your fists full [Heb. the fullness of your fists] of ashes out of the oven, and let Moses throw the same towards heaven before Pharaos eyes.
\p
\v 9 And it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and it shall become boils on men and on cattle, breaking [or, budding, blossoming] out with small blains, in all the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 10 And they took ashes out of the oven, and stood before Pharao's face, and Moses threw them towards heaven; then they were breaking out boils with small blains, on men and on cattle.
\p
\v 11 So that the Magicians were not able to stand before Moses, because of the boils [Hebr., from, or before the face of the boil. See this manner of speaking, Isa. 17 on verse 9.] for there were boils upon the Magicians and upon all the Egyptians.
\p
\v 12 Yet the LORD did obdurace (or, stupefy) the heart of Pharaoh, that he hearkened not to them, according as the LORD had spoken to Moses.
\p
\v 13 Then the LORD said to Moses, Get thee up early tomorrow, and put yourself before Pharao's face, and tell him: Thus says the LORD, the Hebrews' God: Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\p
\v 14 For this time I shall send all my plagues [i.e. All those that I have determined to send over you, until you shall let my people go] into your heart, [meaning that those which he should send after this would not trouble, or pass his skin onely, but pierce and strike through his heart.] and over thy servants, and over thy people, and that thou mayest know, that there is none like me in all the earth.
\p
\v 15 For now I have stretched forth my hand [ Heb. sent forth , viz. By pestilence among the cattel , verse 3,6.] to smite thee and thy people with the pestilence ; and that thou shouldest be destroyed fro
\p m the earth. [i.e. I should have smitten thee too with the same pestilence, as thou didst well deserve ; but for another reason mentioned verse 16. I have spared thee yet.]
\p
\v 16 But verily, therefore I raised thee. [Thus wee read it , Heb.9. Verse 7. Hebr. Therefore I made thee to stand] to shew forth my power (on) thee, and that my Name may be spoken of upon all the earth.
\p
\v 17 Doest thou yet lift up thy self against my people, that thou wilt not let them go ?
\p
\v 18 Behold, to morrow about this time, I will cause a very grievous hail th rain [This miracle was so much the more wonderful in Egypt, where no rain nor hail used to fall.] (as) the like never was in Egypt from that day off, that it was founded hitherto.
\p
\v 19 And now send, gather [Of the Hebrew word used here, see Jer.4.6.] thy cattel, and all that thou hast upon the field : all men and beast that shall be found in the field, and not be gathered in the house, when this hail shall fall upon them, they shall die.
\p
\v 20 Whoso feared the word of the LORD among Pharao's servants, the same made his servants and his cattel to flee into the houses.
\p
\v 21 But he that set not his heart on the word of the LORD ; [ i.e. He that did not regard the Word of the LORD , nor laid it to heart. See above chapter 7.23.] the same left his servants and his cattel, in the fields.
\p
\v 22 Then said the LORD to Moseh : Stretch forth thy hand toward Heaven, and there shall be an hail in all the land of Egypt : over the men, and over the cattel, and all over the herb of the field in the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 23 Then Moseh stretched his staff towards Heaven, and the LORD gave thunder [The Hebrew word doth properly signifie voices, and it is used likewise for thunder , sounds,noises.] And the fire shot toward the earth [Heb. walked, or went to and fro] towards the earth ; understand here the fire of the blixon, or lightning which was intermixed with the hail.
\p
\v 24 And there was hail, and fire comprehended [ or comprehending-grasping it self] in the midst of the hail ; [the hail,consisting of water, intermingled it self with the fire ; so that this was one miracle in another ] it was very grievous, the like never was in all the land of Egypt, since it was a people. [i.e. since any people lived or dwelt in Egypt.]
\p
\v 25 And the hail smote in all the land of Egypt all which was in the field from the men unto the beast ; the hail likewise smote all the herb of the field, and brake all the trees of the field. [ i.e. The greater part, or, all sorts of them ; for below chap.10.5. It appears, that there were some left still, that were not consumed by this plague.]
\p
\v 26 Onely, in the land of Gosen, where the children of Israel were, there was no hail.
\p
\v 27 Then Pharao sent, and he called Moseh and Aaron, and said to them ; I have sinned this time : [Pharao making shew here of confessing his sin, in a hypocritical manner, faith, (this time) as if he had not sinned often or before] the LORD is righteous, I, on the contrary and my people are wicked.
\p
\v 28 Pray fervently unto the LORD ; ( for it is enough) [Oth. for it is too much that there should be (more) thundering of God and hail,] that there may be no more thunder of God [i.e. coming down from God ; or, such great and terrible thunder-claps and lightnings.] no hail, then I shall let you goe, and yet shall stay no longer. [Heb. and ye shall not add, ( or continue) to stand.]
\p
\v 29 Then said Moseh to him, when I shall be gone forth the City, I will spread forth my hands before the LORD : the thunder shall cease, and the hail shall bee no more, that thou mayest know, that the earth is the LORDS : Oth. that this land is the LORDS. As being the Creatour, Governour, and Maintainer thereof, Deut.10.14,15. Ps.24.1. and 135.6. and 1 Cor.10.26.]
\p
\v 30 Neverthelesse, as for thee and thy servants, I know, that ye will not yet fear before the face of the LORD : [ This was found true and manifested afterwards, below verse 35.]
\p
\v 31 The flax now, and the barley were smitten ; [viz.by the hail] for the barley was in the ears, or blade] and the flax was in the blade. [Heb. was blade.]
\p
\v 32 But the wheat and the spelt (or, white wheat) ( a sort of grain somewhat like to wheat, more white and dry then Ry ) were not smitten ; [viz. by the hail ] for they were covered. [Heb. dark, or, obscure, meaning they had gotten neither blades nor ears yet.]
\p
\v 33 So Moseh went forth the City from Pharao, and spread his hands unto the LORD : and the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain was no (more) poured out upon the earth.
\p
\v 34 When Pharao saw, that the rain and hail, and the thunder ceased, he sinned yet further : and he aggravated his heart, he and his servants.
\p
\v 35 Thus Pharaos heart was stupified, that he did not let the children of Israel goe, according as the LORD had spoken by Moseh. [Heb. by the hand of Moseh, i.e. By the ministery of Moseh, as being the Instrument, which God made use of. See of this manner of speaking, Exodus 35.29. Levit.4.13. and 2 Sam. 11.14. 2 Kings 17.13. Hag.1.1. and Malachi 1.1. and elsewhere.]
\c 10
\s God gives Moseh to understand, why he hardned he heaerts of Pharao and his servants, v.1, etc. And threatens them with Grasshoppers, 4. Pharaos servants perswade him to let the Israelites goe, 7. He makes shew of yielding to it, 8. but alters his minde, 10. the light plague, to wit, the Grasshoppers, comes over Egypt, 12. Pharao confesseth his sins, 16. entreateth Moseh to pray for him, 17. which Moseh doth, 18. and the Grasshoppers are taken away, 19 Pharao remains hardned, 20. The ninth plague, to wit, darknesse comes over Egypt, 21. Pharao would let Israel goe, but without cattel, 24. Moseh would not leave a claw behinde, 25. Pharao remains hardned, 27. and chargeth Moseh on pain of death never to appear in his fight any more, 28. which also come to passe, 29.
\p
\v 1 After that, the LORD said unto Moseh : Go into Pharao, for I have aggravated his heart, (as) also the heart of his servants, that I might set these my tokens in the midst of him. [i.e. of his kingdome, or, of him, i.e. before them. Otherw. before him.]
\p
\v 2 And that he might relate before the ears of your children, and childrens children, what I have performed in Egypt, and my tokens, which I have set amongst them ; that ye may know I am the LORD.
\p
\v 3 So Moseh and Aaron went to Pharao, and said to him : Thus saith the LORD ; How long doest thou refuse to humble thy self before my face? Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\p
\v 4 For if thou refuse to let my people goe ; behold, tomorrow I shall bring Grasshoppers into thy border [i.e. into thy land, countrey, kingdome, as chap.8. Verse 2.
\p
\v 5 And they shall cover the sight of the land, [Heb. the eye, i.e. All the land, which at other times lies open to the view of the beholder] so that one shall not be able to see the earth : and they shall eat up the remnant of that which escaped [ i.e. The wheat and spelt, as above ch.9.32.] that which was left over of the hail ; also they shall eat up all the trees [i.e. all the fruits and leaves of them.] which come forth unto you out of the field.
\p
\v 6 And they shall fill up thy houses , and the houses of all thy servants, and all the Egyptians houses, which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers fathers ever saw, from that day off, that they were upon the earth, unto this day ; and he turned about, and went forth from Pharao.
\p
\v 7 And the servants of Pharao said to him, [ understand this of his Nobles, Grandees, his Counsellors, and Courtiers.]How long shall this (man) be a snare to us? [ i.e. Our ruine and destruction, viz. By these many plagues, he brings upon us.] let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God : doest not thou know yet that Egypt is spoiled. (or, wasted) ? [ viz. Unlesse thou dismisse them spedily.]
\p
\v 8 Then Moseh and Aaron wer brought again to Pharao, and he said to them. Go serve the LORD your God : Who and who are they that shall go? [ Here Pharao limits his grant already, allowing not all but some onely to go, whom he would have named and specified unto him.]
\p
\v 9 And Moseh said ; we will go with our young and with our old (folks), with our sons and with our daughters, with our sheep, and with our oxen we shall go ; for we have a feast of the LORD. [ on which we shall have occasion to slay some of our cattel.]
\p
\v 10 Then he said to them ; The LORD be with you so as I shall let you and your little children to go : [ implying,That he would upon no terms yield to it, that they should go together with their children.] look to it ; for there is evil before your face. [as if he had said, Take hid , lest some mischief and disaster befall you, if you forbear not to be thus troublesome unto me.]
\p
\v 11 Not so ; Go ye now , ye men, and serve the LORD, for that is it ye sought : [This King is not ashamed to lie, or to pevert the words of Moseh and Aaron] and they drave them out from Pharao's face.
\p
\v 12 Then the LORD said to Moseh ; Stretch forth thy hand over the land of Egypt, for the Grasshoppers, that they may come up over the land of Egypt : and eat up all the herb of the field, all what the hail left over.
\p
\v 13 Then Moseh did stretch forth his hand, over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an East-wind [ which bloweth very fiercely in these parts, so that great ships are often broken by it : see Exod.14.21. Num.11.31 Psalm 48.4.] into that land, that whole day, and that whole night : it happened in the morning, that the East-wind brought up the Grasshoppers.
\p
\v 14 And the Grasshoppers came up over all the land of Egypt, and let them down in all the borders of the Egyptians [ i.e. all the land over, in all the parts and quarters thereof] very grievous, [ in regard of the vast maltitude covering all the ground, and the excessive dammage which they did] there were never such Grasshoppers before, as these, nor shall there ever be such after these.
\p
\v 15 for they covered the sight [See above verse 5.] of the whole land, so that the land was darkned, and they did eat up all the herb of the land, and all the friuts of the Trees, which the hail had left over : and there remained no green (thing) on trees, nor on the herbs of the fields, in all the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 16 Then Pharao hastned, for to call Moseh and Aaron : and said I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you. [viz.Against the LORD by my disobedience ; and against you, by my last uncivil dismissing and expelling of you.]
\p
\v 17 And now (I pray) forgive me my sin, onely this time, [As if he should say, if ever I trespass again in this kind, pry no more for me.] and pray fervently to the LORD your God, that he take but this death from me. [ this death, i.e. This deadly plague, which consumes and destroys all, and will make us to farnish and perish utterly. So it is said, 2 Kings 4.40. Death is in the pot, i.edeadly herbs.]
\p
\v 18 And he went forth from Pharao, and pray'd fervently unto the LORD.
\p
\v 19 Then the LORD turned a very strong West-wind, which took up the Grasshoppers, and cast them into the Red Sea. [Or, apprehended, comprehended, concluded them : i.e. God did so cast and confine them there, that there they must perish, and were not able to return, or get out again. This same sea Pharao himself was drown'd in afterwards, Exod.14.] there was not one Grasshopper left over in all the borders of Egypt.
\p
\v 20 Yet the LORD stupified Pharaos heart, that he did not let the children of Israel go.
\p
\v 21 Then the LORD said to Moseh ; Stretch forth thy hand towards heaven, and there shall darknesse come over the land of Egypt, that one shall feel the darknesse. [ i.e. the air, which shall be so thick, that it will exclude all light whatsoever.]
\p
\v 22 When Moseh stretched forth his hand towards heaven, there was a thick darknesse [Heb. Obscurity of darknesse ] in all the land of Egypt, (for) three days. [Moseh could not well tell how long this darkness lasted, in regard that the day-light held its ordinary course still among the Israelites, as follows.]
\p
\v 23 They saw not the one the other, [Heb. the man his brother : there was no Sun , nor Moon, nor Star-light.] also there stood none up from his place, in three dayes ; but with all the children of Israel it was light , [to wit, in the day-time, when it used otherwise to be light.] in their dwellings. [Understand this only of the land of Gosen : or likewise, as some conjecture, of all the places where Israelites dwelt.]
\p
\v 24 then [viz.when the three days darkness was past ] Pharao called Moseh, and said ; go (your ways) serve the LORD ; only your sheep and your oxen shall abide fast : your little ones also shall go with you. [understand hereby the women also, whose help and tendance the little ones could not be without.]
\p
\v 25 Yet Moseh said ; Thou shalt likewise give into our hands [i.e. give way to take along with us] slay offerings (or, sacrifices) and burnt- offerings, that we may do them to the LORD our God.
\p
\v 26 And our cattel shall likewise go with us, there shall not a claw remain behinde : for of that we shall take, for to serve the LORD our God : for we know not wherewith we shall serve the LORD our God, [ i.e. What sort and number of cattel we shall be ordered to sacrifice to our God] till we come there.
\p
\v 27 Yet the LORD hardned Pharao's heart, and he would not let them go.
\p
\v 28 But Pharao said unto him ; Get thee from mee ; Take heed thou see my face no more : for on that day, in which thou shalt see my face, thou shalt die. [ i.e. I will be thy death, or cause thee to be put to death.]
\p
\v 29 Then Moseh said , Thou hast spoken aright ; [This is no testimony that Pharao spake well and righteously, but Moseh gives him to understand hereby, that it should come to pass thus, as Pharao had spoken, as touching his return, and seeing Pharao's face, Moseh knowing before, what God had determined over him ] I shall see thy face no more.
\c 11
\s
\p God commands the Israelites to ask or borrow gold and silver vessels from their neighbours , v.1,etc. Moseh threateneth Pharao with the death of all the first-born , 4. and foretelleth , that with the Israelites, all should be well and quiet, 7. Pharao remaineth hardned, 9.
\p
\v 1 For the LORD had spoken to Moseh, [ Before Pharao had driven away Moseh from him with threats, before chap.10.20. and this was the reason, that Moseh gave Pharao such a resolute answer , ibid. verse 29.] I shall bring one plague yet [see below verse 4. and 5.] over Pharao and over Egypt ; after that, he shall let you go hence : when he shall let (you) go ; then he shall drive you out hence hastily. [ Heb. thrusting out he shall thrust you out. See the fulfilling hereof, Exod.12.31,32,33.]
\p
\v 2 Speak now before the ears of the people, [ viz. Of Isrel] that every man ask [ i.e. Borrow] of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbouresse , silver vessels, nd golden vessels. [see Exo.3.22.]
\p
\v 3 And the LORD gave the people grace [i.e. favour ; see of this phrase, Gen.39.21.] in the eyes of the Egyptians : also the man Moseh was very great in Egypt, [i.e. in very great repute ; that was the reason, that Pharao durst not meddle with Moseh, fearing it might cause an Insurrection among the people.] before the eyes of Pharao's servants, and before the eyes of the people. [ viz. of Egypt.]
\p
\v 4 Moreover, Moseh said, [viz. to Pharao, before he parted from him last, verse 8. for this is the prosecution of Moseh his reply, above chap.10. verse 29.] Thus the LORD hath said ; viz. When he sent me to thee this last time.] about midnight I will go forth, through the midst of Egypt.
\p
\v 5 And all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die : [ that which God here threatneth, he afterwards executeth by his Angel, Exod.12. 23.] from the first-born of Pharao, that should sit upon his throne [i.e. that should suceed him in the kingdome ; as 1 Kings 2. 24. and 1 Chronicles 28.5.] unto the first-born of the maid-servant, that is behinde the mill : [ understand the hand-mills, where those that grinded,had both the mill-stones, (or grinding -stones) before their whole body, steering and turning the same about with their hands. See Exodus 12.29. Judg. 15.21. Isa. 47.1,2.] and all the first-born of the cattel.
\p
\v 6 And there shall be a great cry in all the land of Egypt, the like never was, and the like never shall be.[Both among the parents, whose children shall die thus, and among the children, who hearing and seeing it, shall be afraid of the like turn themselves, as it useth to happen in such dreadful plague-times.]
\p
\v 7 But with all the children of Israel, not a dog shall stir his tongue ; [i.e. it shall be so still and quiet among them , that the very dogs, who are rouzed by the least noise, shall not so much as bark once.See the like expression, Jos.10. 21.] from the men, unto the beasts ; [i.e. neither against men, nor against the beasts.] that ye may know, that the LORD makes a seperation betwixt the Egyptians, and betwixt the Israelites.
\p
\v 8 Then shall all these thy servants come down to me, [viz.being sent unto me from thee] and encline (or bowe) themselves before me,Saying ; Go forth (now), thou and all the people, that follows thy footsteps ; [Heb. which is at thy feet, i.e. which follow thee, or are guided and gorvened by thee, obeying thy commands. See the like phrase, Judg. 8.5. 1 Kings 20.10. 2 Kings 3.9.] and after that I shall go forth : [ understand with all, and all the people of Israel with me, together with all we have, and that we shall be pleased to take along with us.] and he went forth from Pharao in heat of anger. [Moseh is zealous for the glory of God : otherwise he was a very meek man, Num. 12.3.]
\p
\v 9 The LORD then had spoken to Moseh ; [ Exod.3.19. and cha.10.1. and elsewhere ] Pharao shall not hearken to you, that my wonders [i.e. wonderful plagues] may be multiplyed in Egypt.
\p
\v 10 And Moseh and Aaron did all these wonders before the face of Pharao ; yet the LORD hardned Pharaos heart, that he did not let the children of Israel go forth out of his land. [but being forced thereunto.See Exod. 3.19. and chapter 6. verse 1.]
\c 12
\s God commands the Israelites, that the month, wherein they went forth out of Egypt, should be the first month of the year with them, v.1, etc. they are enjoyned to choose out a spotlesse lamb for the passeover , 3. how they were to eat the same, 11. and unleavened bread for seven days, 15. and to sprinkle the posts of their doors with the blood of the lamb, 22. All the first-born of Egypt are slain, 29.Pharao drives the children of Israel out of the land, 31. they rob the Egyptians, 35. they come to Succoth, strong fix hundred thousand men, 37. how long they dwelt in Egypt, 40. the manner of eating the Paschal lamb, and who might eat it, 43. All the children of Israel do, according as the LORD commanded them, 50.
\p
\v 1 The LORD now had spoken to Moseh and to Aaron, in the land of Egypt, [viz. before Moseh departed out of Pharaos presence, Exod. 11.4. either before the three days darkness, chap.10.21. Or after above 11.1.] saying ;
\p
\v 2 This same month, [Called Abib by the Hebrews, Exod. 13.4. otherwise called Nisan, Neb.2.1. Esth.8.7.] shall be unto the head of the months ; [ i.e. the beginning, thus Ezek.40. verse 1. the head of the year, i.e. its beginning.] it shall be unto you the first of the months of the year. [this is to bee understood of Church or Ecclesiastical affairs ; for in civil matters, the year begin with the seventh month : See Ex. 34,22. and Lev. 25.9.]
\p
\v 3 Speak un to the whole congregation of Israel saying ; On the tenth of this month, every one take a lamb [lamb, or, kid, verse 5. this lamb was a figure,type, pointing at Christ the true Lamb of God, John 1.29. and 1 Cor.5.7.] according to the houses of the fathers, [i.e. according to the families which are named according to the fathers ] a lamb for an house.
\p
\v 4 But if an house be too little for an lamb,[i.e. if there be too few to eat it all up on that eve] then let him [viz. the house father, or matter of the family] and his neighbour the next to his house, take it, according to the number of the souls : [ i.e. persons ; see Gen. 12.5.] every one as he is able to eat ; [Hebr. the man according to the mouth of his eating.] ye shall make eating according to the lamb. [i.e. ratably and proportionably to the lamb, and the persons that are to eat thereof, having a care,that there may not be too few, nor too many for it.]
\p
\v 5 Ye shall have a perfect lamb, [Such a one Christ was to be , 1 Pet. 1.19.] a male, of a year old, [heb. the son of a year, i.e. a lamb of one year.] ye shall take it from the sheep, or from the hee-goats.
\p
\v 6 And ye shall have it in custody, [i.e. ye shall set it apart, seperated from the flock, for four days, from the tenth day to the fourteenth day of this month ; and all the congregation of the assembly of Israel shall slay it, betwixt two Eves. [i.e. betwixt the beginning an d the ending of the evening, that is, betwixt our three a clock after noon, and sunset : about the same time our Saviour jesus Christ, the true Pascal Lamb , was likewise put to death ; Mat. 27.46,50.]
\p
\v 7 And they shall take of that blood, [viz. of the said Lamb slain] and strike it [Hebr. Give it,or, do it, viz. with a bunch of hyslop, as it is verse 22. of this ceremony there is no mension made elsewhere,as neither of some other here following, but they were onely to be observed in this first passeover.] on both the side postes, and on the upper door – posts of the houses, where they shall eat it.
\p
\v 8 And they shall eat that flesh in the same night : roasted at the fire, with unleavened bread, (loaves).[ The Israelites did eat the Pascal lamb with unleavened bread, in remembrance ,that they carried their unleavened dough in haste out of the land of Egypt, below ve.34.] they shall eat it wiyh bitter sauce. [Oth. bitter herbs. Heb. with bitternesses, or bitter (things) ].
\p
\v 9 Ye shall eat nothing raw of it [or, not being sufficiently or thorough roasted] nor in any wise boiled in water : Heb. boiling , boiled, (or, cooking,cooked) in water] but roasted at the fire, his head eith his legs ,and with his purtenance. (or, entrails.)
\p
\v 10 Neither shall ye let ought to remain over till tomorrow : but that which doth remain over till the morrow,he shall then (up) with fire. [that it may not be put to any other use, whether for Idolatry, or common food.]
\p
\v 11 Thus now ye shall eat it : [viz. At this time ; for afterwards these things, (or circumstances) were no more observed, no not by Christ himself, nor by his Apostles ; see above verse 7.] Your loins shall be girt up,your shoes on your feet and your staff in hand ; [This betokens readiness in travel, or, haste and earnestness in any business one is about,as 2 Kings 4.29. and 9.1. Jer.1.17. Luke 12.35,39.] and ye shall eat it in haste, it is the LORDS passeover. (or, Pascha) [Heb. Pesach, signifying, a passing through, or passing by, or skipping over, because the destroying Angel past by, or skipt over, the houses of Israelites, verse 13. and 23. and 27. The Lamb is called Pesach here, that is, a passing by, as being the token thereof, see of this sacramental phrase, Gen.17.10. and the proper phrase,below here, verse 13. and chap.13.9.]
\p
\v 12 For I shall passe this night through the land of Egypt [ That which God did by the destroying Angel, he attributeth here unto himself.] and smite all the first-born [viz. of the Egyptians] in the land of Egypt, from the men, unto the beasts : and I shall excercise judgements on all the Gods of the Egyptians, I the LORD.[As if God had said, I shall make it appear that their Idoll-gods are vain and helplese.]
\p
\v 13 And that blood [ wherewith ye sprinkled the postes of your doors,verse 7.] shall be a token unto you, [ to put you in minde of my promise for the strenghthening of your faith.] on the houses, wherein ye are, when I see the blood I shall passe you by: and there shall be no plague among you for destruction, when I shall smite the land of Egypt. [i.e. the first-born in the land of Egypt.]
\p
\v 14 And this day shall be unto you for a Remembrance, (or, Memorial) [viz. of the received mercy, when I delivered you out of Egypt.]and ye shall solemnize it for the LORD for a feast : ye shall solemnize it among your Generations, for an everlasting institution.[ viz. until the coming of the Messiah,who is the end and fulfilling of the Law ; see Genesis 13.15. and chap.17.7,13.]
\p
\v 15 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened (bread), [this time was to begin after the day of the passeover, it being a peculiar feast.] but on the first day ye shall put away [Heb. cause to cease] the leaven out of your houses : for he that eateth the leavened from the first day until the seventh day that same soul [i.e. man, or person] shall be destroyed out of Israel. [see Gen.17.v.14.]
\p
\v 16 And on the first day there shall be an holy congregation : also ye shall have an holy congregation. [Hebr. Congregation of holinesse, and so, both before and after] on the seventh day : there shall be no work done in the same ; but that which shall be eaten of every soul, the same only may be prepared of you. [ this was not allowed to be done upon the Sabbath day, Exod.16.23,29. and chap.35.2,3.]
\p
\v 17 Observe you therefore the unleaved (bread) [or,cakes, according to the custome of the Jews.] because that on the self-same day I shall have led your hosts forth out of the land of Egypt: therefore ye shall keep this day, among your generations, for an everlasting institution.
\p
\v 18 In the first (month), or the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, shall ye eat unleavened bread: until the one and twentieth day of the month, in the evening.
\p
\v 19 That for seven days along there be found no leaven in your houses : [See above verse 15. and 1 Cor.5.8.] for whosoever shall eat the leavened, the same his soul shall be destroyed out of the congregation of Israel, whether he be a [Heb.i., at, or among the ] stranger, or an inborn of the land.
\p
\v 20 Ye shall eat nothing that is leavened, [neither bread, nor cakes, nor any thing else] in all your habitations ye shall eat unleavened (bread) (or loaves).
\p
\v 21 Then Moseh called all the Eldest of Israel, and said to them ; Choose out [Heb. draw out , to wit, out of the flock or fold] and take you lambs [or, small cattel, viz. Either of sheep or goats] for your families, and slay the passeover. [i.e the lamb which was a token of the passeover (Pascha) or passing through or by of the destroying Angel.]
\p
\v 22 Take then a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that shall be in a bason, [ of the hyssop, see 1 Kings 4. on verse 33. this is one of the ceremonies which was to be observed only at the first Passeover ; see above on ver.7. And strike on the upper door-poste, and on both the side-postes [Heb. make (it) touch, etc.] of that blood which shall be in the bason : but as for you, non shall go forth out of the door of his house, until to morrow.
\p
\v 23 For the LORD shall passe through, for to smite the Egyptians ; [Oth. Egypt, understand the first-born of the Egyptians] yet when he shall see the blood on the upper door-poste and on the two side -postes, then the LORD shall passe by the door,[ or , skip by the door,] and not suffer the destroyer [i.e. that destroying Angel] to come within your houses, for to smite.
\p
\v 24 Therefore observe this thing [Save only the ceremonies that were peculiar to the first Passeover . Se ab. V,.7. 11,12.] for an institution for you and for your children for ever. [understand until Christ.See above v. 14.]
\p
\v 25 And it shall come to passe, when ye come into that land , which the LORD shall give unto you, according as he hath spoken, [i.e. the land of Canaan.In the wilderness they kept the Passeover but once, Num.9.5.] that ye shall keep this service. [i.e. this part of Gods worship and service. See also verse 26. as appears verse 27.
\p
\v 26 And it shall come to passe, when your children shall say to you ; what service have ye there? [Heb. what (is) (i.e. signifies) this service unto you?]
\p
\v 27 Then ye shall say ; this is a Passeover- sacrifice [ viz.this Paschal lamb] unto the LORD, who past by before the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and freed our houses.Then the people bowed themselves down and worshipped.
\p
\v 28 And the children of Israel went and did it ; according as the LORD had commanded Moseh and Aaron, so did they.
\p
\v 29 And it came to passe at asidnight, that the LORD smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, [this God did to punish and requite the wrong which Pharao and his subjects committed on Israel, Gods first-born, Exod.4.22,23.] from the first-born of Pharao, that was to sit upon his Throne, unto the first-born of the prisoner,[Compare this with chap.11.verse 5.] that was in the prison. [Heb. in the house of the pit, or, dungeon] and all the first-born of the beast.
\p
\v 30 And Pharao rose up in the night , he and all his servants, and all the Egyptians, and there was a great cry in Egypt : fo there was no house, wherein there was not one dead.
\p
\v 31 .Then he caled Moseh and Aaron in the night [Moseh and Aaron came unt Pharao this time, but the Kings Deputies were sain come unto them, and submissivley to beseech them, that they would go forth, as it appeareth by Exod. 10.29. and chapter 11. verse 8.] and said; Get you up, Go forth from amidst of my people, both ye, and the children of Israel: and go (your way), serve the LORD according as ye have spoken. [to wit, without any of these conditions, or exceptions, which the King formerly stood upon.]
\p
\v 32 Take also with you, your sheep and your oxen [i.e. all your cattel, small and great] so as ye have spoken; and go (your ways), and blesse me likewise. [i.e. pray unto God for me, to deliver me of this great plague, This Pharao likewise desireth Ex.8.8& 9.28 and 10.16, 17. it seems Pharon was convinced in his heart, that he had abominably prevaticate against the LORD, sinning thus obstinately against his own conscience.]
\p
\v 33 And the Egyptian, solicited the people much, hastening to drive them out of the land; for they said; we are all dead (men) [see Gen. 20.3.]
\p
\v 34 And the people took the people up their dough, before it was leavend: their dough – lamps, bound up in their clothes , upon their shulders.
\p
\v 35 Now the children of Israel had according to the word of Moseh, and had asked [i.e. borrowed] the Egyptians, silver vessel,a nd golden vessels, and garments.
\p
\v 36 Withal the LORD had given the people grace in the eyes of the Egyptians, that they did (satisfie) their desire; and they robbed the Egyptians. [thus was that fulfilled which God foretold to Abraham, Gen 15.14. and to the Israelites afterwards, Exod. 3.22.]
\p
\v 37 Thus the children of Israel journeyed out of Rameses [see Gen. 47. verse 11] to Succoth; [a place so called from the Huts the children of Israel make there, at their coming thithes, of boughs; and this was their first stage, or, resting – place after their coming forth out of Egypt. Comapre Lev. 23.43. This Syccoth is to be distinguished from an other, spoken of, Gen. 33. 17] about six hunderd thousand of foot, men only, [among which mighty number, there was not one sick or seeble person, Ps. 105. 37] besides the little children. [and the women, without whose help the children would not have been able to subsist. As also, Exod 10.24.]
\p
\v 38 And much mist people [ viz. Egyptians and others being moved and excited byy all these wonders and tokens they had seen, to go along withthe Israelites, though afterwards they fainted, Num. 11. 4,5.] went up with them likewise; and sheep and oxen, very [Heb. heavy] cattle.
\p
\v 39 And they baked [viz. when they were come to Succoth] of the dough which they had brought forth out of Egypt, unleavened cakes, for it was not leavened; and they being driven me out of Egypt [as the LORD had foretold it, Exod 11.1.] so that they could not tarry , nor make provision ready for them.
\p
\v 40 The time now of the inhabiting which the children of Isreal inhabited in Egypt, is for hundred year, and thirty year. [see Gen 15.13.]
\p
\v 41 And it came to passe, at the end of the four hundred and thirty years; that it happened on that same day, that all the hosts of the LORD wnet forth out of the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 42 This night shall be observed to the LORD most ligently, for having led them forth out of the land of Egypt; [Otherw. this is the night which the LORD observed, to lead them forth out of the land of Egypt Heb. thsi is a night of observations to the LORD, etc] This is the night of the LORD that ought to be observed most diligently, of all the children of Israel , among their gnerations.
\p
\v 43 Moreover , the LORD said to Moseh and Aaron; This is the institution of the passover; no stranger son shall eat thereof. [viz. unless he be circumcissed, as is to be gathered by verse 44. and 48.]
\p
\v 44 yet every servant out being, bought for money, after that ye have circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof. [viz. being formerly well instructed in, and having embrassed the true Religion.]
\p
\v 45 No further [ understanding such a foreiner here, as dwelleth in the land, whereof he is not native, or inhabites with another] nor hireling shall eat thereof [viz. unless he be circumcised.]
\p
\v 46 In one house it shall he eaten [i.e. each lamb shall he eaten in its proper house or family eating up their own lamd, as was said above verse 3.] ye shall not carry (ought) of the flesh forth out of the house; and shall break no bone of it. [this reflects on Christ the true Paschal Lamb, who had no bone broken, John 19. 33, 36.]
\p
\v 47 Th whole congregation of Israel shall do it [i.e. Prepare and eat Passover, as the LORD commanded it; he that neglected it, was cut off, Number 9.13.]
\p
\v 48 Now when a stranger sojourned with you, and shall keep [Heb. do] the Passover to the LORD, let all that is male be circumcised by (or with) him, and then let him come to it for to keep it: and he shall be as an inborn of the land; [i.e. he shall enjoy the same right and benefit, which the Natives do] but none uncircumcised shall eat thereof.
\p
\v 49 One (manner) law be to the in – born and the stranger, that sojourned as stranger in the midst of you.
\p
\v 50 . And all the children of Israel did it; according as the LORD had commanded Moseh and Aaron; so did they.
\p
\v 51 And it happened on the self – same day, that the LORD led forth the children of Isreal out of the land of Egypt, y (or according to ) their hosts.
\c 13
\s God commands all the first – born to be hallowed or consecrated, v.1. etc. That the day of the going forth out of Egypt, shall ahd in remebrance, 3. that the feast of unleavened bread shall be kept in the land of Canaan, 6. and that they shall tell their children the reason thereof, 8. that the firstling of the beasts shall be set apart for the LORD, 12. that they shall make memorials, 16. which way God did lead them along with them out of Egypt, 19. Israel incampeth at Etham, 20 God conducteth them which a pillar of cloud and a pillar of fire, 21.
\p
\v 1 Then the LORD spake unto Moseh, saying;
\p
\v 2 Hallow me all the first – orn [viz, of male i.e. command the people, that they do separate or appropriate them to my peculiar holy service. See Lev 8. 10] opening any womb [Heb. the opening of all (or every) womb] among the children of Israel, of men and of the beast; the same is mine, [therefore namely, that i did spare your first – born, when i destroyed all the first born of Egypt. See below verse 15.]
\p
\v 3 Moreover, Moseh sadi unto the poeple ; Remember that same day , wherein ye went forth out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for the LORD hath carried you forth hence, by a strong hand, [Hebr. In the power of the hand] therefore that which it leavened shall not be eaten.
\p
\v 4 . This day go forth in the month of Abid [This month falls part in March, and partly in April, when in Spring – time day and nights are of a equall lenght. The Hebrew word Abid doth sigifie a green ear, whereof this month is denominated, because the corn sowed in the ground, had green ears about that time, and in those Countries.]
\p
\v 5 And shall come to passe, when the LORD shall have brought thee into the land of Canaanites, and the Herbites, and the Amorites, and the Hevites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey , [see Exod 3.8.] then shalt thou keep [Heb. serve] this service [mentioned in the verse following] in this month.
\p
\v 6 Seven days shall thou eat unleavened (bread) loaves, nd on the seveth day, there shall be a feast to the LORD.
\p
\v 7 Seven days unleavened (bread) loaves shall be eaten; and the leavenef shall not be seen with you; yea there shall be no leaven seen with you in all your borders
\p
\v 8 And thou shalt make known to thy son [i.e. children ] on that same day, saying; (this is) for that which the LORD had done unto me, when i went forth out of Egypt.
\p
\v 9 And it shall be for a token upon thy hand, and for a memorial betwixt thy eyes, that the law of the LORD may be in thy month; because the LORD did carry thee forth with strong hand uts of Egypt
\p
\v 10 Therefore keep this instruction, at the appointed time, [ see above chap 12. verse. 6] from year [Hebfrom days to days. Thus are likewise taken for a year, Lev 25. 29. Amos 4.4.].
\p
\v 11 It shall come to passe also, when th LORD shall have brought thee into the land of the Canaanites, [understand withak here all the rest of the nations, named above verse 5. and Gen 15.19,20, 21.] according as hath sworn to thee and thy father; and he shall have given it unto thee.
\p
\v 12 Then shalt cause to passe over unto the LORD [viz from thy self unto the LORD, that thou claim no more propertiy therein, but remain the LORDS own] what openeth the womb, [Hebr. All oepning of the womb, above verse 2.] also whatever openeth (the womb) of the fruit [He, propagation, or, encrease] of the beast thou shalt have; the males shall be the LORDS.
\p
\v 13 Yet whatsoever openeth (the womb) of th sheepasse, [Hreby understand likewise al l other beast, that were unsit for sacrifice the same thou shalt redeem with a lamb ; understand either a kid or lamb, as above ch. 12. verse 5.] now, if thou redeem it not, thou shalt break the neck of it: [to the end, that what once is appropriate to the LORD, may not be used for other ends and services] but all the first – born of man among thy sons, hou shalt redeem [ viz. With shekles of the sanctuary, Numb 18.16.]
\p
\v 14 When it shall come to passe, that thy son shalla ask thee tomorrow, [see above chapter 6. verse 10.] saying What is that? [i.e. what signifies that] then shalt sa y unto him: The LORD hath carried us forth out of Egypt, out of th house of bondage with strong hand.
\p
\v 15 For it came to passe, when Pharao hardned himself to let us go, tha the LORD slew all the first – born in the land of Egypt, from the first – bron of man, to the first – born of the beast: therefore do i sacrifice ( or slay) unto the LORD, the males of whatsoever openeth he womb, yet all the first – born of my sons i do redeem
\p
\v 16 And it shall be for a token upon thy hand, and for frontlets betwixt thy eyes: [it should seem they were some written schedules of remembrance, which were fastned to the fore – head, to have the law of the LORD in remembrance: [see Deut 6. verse 8] for the LORD hath carried us forth out of Egypt by a strong hand.
\p
\v 17 And it happened, when Pharao let the people go, that God led them not (up) the way of the Philistines land, although that was the nearer; [viz. to come into the land of Canaan] for God said [viz. by himse, see Gen. 8.21.] that the poeple do not, [viz. by himself , see Gen. 8.21.] that the people do not, [or left peradventure, spoken after the manner of men.] repent, [viz. of having abandoned the land of Egypt] when they shall see the combat, and return to Egypt.
\p
\v 18 But God led peple about, thorugh the way of he desert of the Red Sea; [understand the wilderness of the Ethem, verse 20. and Num. 33.8] Now the Children of Israel went (or, marched) forth out of Egypt by fives. [Heb. fived, i.e. fives, five a breast, or, in five bodies, or bridges: Oth armed, or cuirassed, as Josh. 1.14 and 4.12., Judge 7.11.]
\p
\v 19 And Moseh took Joseph, bones with him; for he had adjured the children of Israel the children of Israel with an heavy oath, [Heb. adjuring, i.e. sworn them vereu seriously and strictly] saying; God shall assurred visit you, [Heb. visiting you] carry my bones then up with you from hence
\p
\v 20 Thou they journeyed out of Succoth, and they camped in the Etham, at the end of the wildrenesse.
\p
\v 21 And the LORD went before their face, [ch.14. 19. he is called the Angel of God. This was the eternall Son of God, 1 Cor. 10. 9.] by day, in a cloud – pillar [Psalm 15. 39. it is said, that this pillar was spread forth as a covering, so that it shaded the Israelites against the heat of the Sun] to lead them upon them upon the way, and by the night in a fire – pillar, to light them; that they might advance day and night.
\p
\v 22 He removed not the cloud – pillar by day, nor the fire – pillar by night, from the face of the people.
\c 14
\s God shews the Israelites the way which they are to go, v 1, etc. Pharao pursues them, 5. They are mightily frighted hearing,and murmure, 10. Moseh comeforteth and encourageth them, 13. The Angel of the LORD shews them the way by the cloud - pillar, 19. Moseh dividdes the Sea asunder, 21 The children of Israel passe in dry foot, 22. The Egyptian follow after them, 23. God commandeth Moseh to stretch forth his hand again over the sea, 26. which returns and drowns Pharao with all his host, 27. so that there remained not one of them over, 28.
\p
\v 1 Then the LORD spake to Moseh, saying:
\p
\v 2 Speak to the children of Israel, that the return and camp themselves before Pihachiroth, [Oth. Before the mouth of Chiroth, i.e. before the streight, or entry, or entry among the bills of Chiroth] betwixt Migdol, [the nam of a City of Egypt, Jer. 44.1.] and betwixt the seas: before Baal Zephon, over aganst which ye shall camp your selves at the sea.
\p
\v 3 Then Pharao shall say of the children of Israel, [viz When he shall hear, that ye are returned back, and lie camped in a very inconvinient place] They are entangled in the land; the wilderness hath shut them in. [Hebr. The wilderness hath shut up over them.]
\p
\v 4 And i will stupifie the heart of Pharao, that he pursue after them, and i shall be glorified upon Pharao and all his hosts: [God acquires himself honour and glory, as well in punishment of the wicked, as in shewing mercy to is chosen. 28. 22. Rom. 9. 22. 23.] so that the Egyptians shall know, [viz. as well those that shall now perish in the Sea, as those that shlla remain alive at home] that i am the LORD; and there did so [i.e. they marched back, according as the LORD commanded.]
\p
\v 5 Now when the King of Egypt was told, that the people sled; then the heart of Pharao and of his servants was altered against he people, and said , Why have we done that, that we Israel go, that they not serve us, [ Heb from serving us.]
\p
\v 6 And he made ready charet: and took his people with him.
\p
\v 7 And took, six hundred choice charets, yea all the charets of Egypt; [which could be gotten in haste] and the Captian over them all. [the Hebr word rendred Captian is deducted from another significate three, or third, so that some do understand here, those of the third sort, or order and rank, with the King.]
\p
\v 8 For the LORD stapified the heart of Pharao the King of Egypt, that he pursued after the children of Israel ; yet the children of Israel were gone forth by an high hand: [i.e. through the power of God, compare Exod 13.16. Oth openly, couragiously, in good order, see Exod 13.18 and in the sight of the Egyptians, Num.33.3.]
\p
\v 9 And the Egyptians pursuade after them, and overtook them, where they ahd camped themselves by the Sea, all the horse of Pharao (and) charets, and horsemen, and his host: besides Pihacharoth, before Baal Zephon.
\p
\v 10 When Pharao was come neer, the Egyptians marched after them [Oth. Egypt went, or journeyed on, i.e. the Egyptians] and they were sore afraid: then the children of Israel cryed unto the LORD.
\p
\v 11 And they said to Moseh; Hast thou therefore taken us away, because there were no graves in Egypt, that we should die here in this wilderness? Wherefore hast thou done that to us, that thou hast carried us forth out of Egypt .
\p
\v 12 Is not thi sthe word, which we spake unto thee in Egypt, saying; keeep off us (or let us alone) and let us serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, then to die in the wilderness.
\p
\v 13 Yet Moseh said to the people, Fear not, stand firm [i.e. waver and stagger not your hearts] and behold the salvation of the LORD, which he shall do (or, shew) unto you: [the victory which God shall work for you. See Gen. 49. 18.] for the Egyptians, whom ye saw this day, [Oth as ye have seen them today] ye shall not see them again in eternity. (or for ever)
\p
\v 14 The LORD shall fight for you, and shall be still, [As if he should say, Ye shall be mercy passive, and do nothing at all towards the sbduing of your enemies, neither in words, nor deeds, the LORD shall fight and defeat themself. Or, it may imply, be ye but quiet, and forbear to murmure against God and me]
\p
\v 15 Then said the LORD to Mmoseh, why doest thou cry unto me? Tell the children of Israel, that they march on.
\p
\v 16 And thou, lift up thy staff, and stretch forth thy band over the sea, and cleave it, that the children of Israel may goe through the midst of the Sea, on the dry (ground)
\p
\v 17 And i, beholdd i shall [oTH As touching me, behold, i shall] stupifie the heart of the Egyptians, o go in after them [viz into the Sea] and i shall be glorified upon Pharao, and upon all his host, upon charets, and upon his horsemen.
\p
\v 18 And the Egyptians shall know, that i am the LORD, when i shall be glorified upon Pharao, upon his charets, and upon his horsemen.
\p
\v 19 And the Angel of God [Exod 13.21. he is called the LORD] that went before the host of Israel, withdrew, and went behind them: the cloud – pillar like – wise withdrew from their face, and stood behinde them.
\p
\v 20 And it come betwixt the camp of the Egyptions, and betwixt the camp of Israel, and the cloud was, both darkeness, and ligthned the night: [darkness to the Egyptians, coming after and lighting the Israelists, that went before] so that the one did approach to the other all that night.
\p
\v 21 When Moses stretch'd forth his hand over the Sea, then the LORD made Sea to passe, by a strong East – wind, all that night, and made the Sea dry, [Heb. set the Sea to drought] and the waves were clest.
\p
\v 22 And the children of Israel went in, into the midst of the Sea, on the dry (ground) : and the water were a wall them, on thei right and on their left hand. [The children of Israel were in a readier way before, and could have gone a more convienient one, then by the Red Sea, but that God was pleased to make them take this way, that so he might drown Pharao in the same with all his host, and make his own power and judgements known]
\p
\v 23 And the Egyptians persued after them, and went in after them, all Pharaos horses, his charets, and his horsemen, into the midst of the Sea.
\p
\v 24 And it come to passe in that morning – watch, that the LORD, [the Prophet David relates this with many circmstances, Psalm 77. 18,19. testifying, that he LORD shew'd himslef with the lightings and thunder, and rain, against the Egyptions] in the pillar of fier and cloud, [this pillar was fiery and light before, but cloudy and dark behinde.] looked upon the camp of the Egyptians:[i.e. Cause his power to be seen in extra – ordinary manner, ou of the pillar of fire wherein he was.] and he terrified [or, troubled, discomfited, disordered] the camp of the Egyptians.
\p
\v 25 And he thrust of the wheels of their charets, [Heb. of hi] and made them [Hebr. Him, or, it i.e. each one, or the camp] to draw heavily the Egyptians said, let us [Heb. the Egyptians said, let one] flee from the face of Israel, for the LORD fights for them against the Egyptians. [Here is that fulfilled which was foretold, ab. v.18.]
\p
\v 26 And the LORD said to Moseh: stretch forth thy hand over the Sea: that the waters may return over the Egyptians; over their charets, and over their horsemen, [this the LORD did by a mighty wind, Exodud 15. 10]
\p
\v 27 Them Moseh stretched forth his hand over the Sea, and the Sea returned against the approach of the morning. Heb. against the face (or, return) of the morning, i.e. against day – break] unto his own force, [i.e. unto his unusual course for before it was bound up] and the Egyptians fled against it: [viz. against the Sea, i.e. which way soever they turned themselves to see, the Sea came still against them] and the LORDover threw [Hebr. Shook, cast , or, flung them out] the Egyptians into the midst of the Sea. [this was rightoeusjudgement of God upon the Egyptians, who had cast and flung the poor infants of the Israelits into the water to drown and perish there, without remorce]
\p
\v 28 For when the waters returned, [viz By falling off and recoiling from that height and heap they were run up to before] they covered the charet and the horsemen of all the host of Pharao, that had followed them [ viz. the Israelites] into the Sea: there was not one of them leftover.
\p
\v 29 But the children of Israel went upon the dry (ground) in the midst of the Sea: and the waters were a wall to them, on their right and on their left hand.
\p
\v 30 Thus the LORD delivered Israel on that day, out of the hand of the Egyptians: and Israel sow the Egyptians dead [oth. dying ] on the shore of the Sea. [Heb. lip.]
\p
\v 31 Also Israel saw the great hand [i.e. the mighty and glorious work of the LORD, as Psalm 109.27.] which the LORD had shewed [Heb. done.] upon the Egyptians : and the people feared the LORD, and believed in the LORD, and Moseh and his servant. [i.e. they believed the word which Moseh did speak unto them in the name of the LORD, as Exod. 19.9. and 2 Chr. 20.20. the phrase rendred here, believing in and believing on is one and the same in the Hebrew Text; the difference expressed is taken from the nature of the thing.]
\c 15
\s The song of Praise sung by Moseh and the chlidren of Israel upon there deliverance, and Pharoas drowning in the Sea, v.1., etc Miriam and the rest of the women of Israel answer there unto, like wise praising the LORD for his deliverance, 20. In the wilderness they come to Sur, were they finde no good water to drink, 22. at Maoh they meet with bitter water, 23. The people murmure, 24. A tree is shewed to Moseh to sweeten the water with, 25. The LORD gives laws to them, and makes fatherly promises to them, 26At Elim they find twelve wells of water, and seventy palm trees, 27.
\p
\v 1 Then Moseh and the children of Israel sang this Song unto the LORD, and the spake, saying: I will sing unto the LORD, for he is highly exalted [ Heb. exalting exalted] the horse and his rider, he hath thrown into the Sea.
\p
\v 2 The LORD is my power and song; [i.e. the matter and the subject of my song; or, he that hath given me cause to sing praises to him] and he hath been a salvation to me [see above chap 14. verse 13] this is my God, therefore i will make him a present habitation: [or barely, an habitation. Oth. I will grorify him] he is my fathers God, therefore i will exalt him.
\p
\v 3 The LORD is a man of war: LORD in his Name. [ See Gen.2.4. And Exod. 3.15. and chap 6.2]
\p
\v 4 He hath trown Pharoas sharets and his host into the Sea. And the choice of his captians are drowned in the reed Sea [i.e. the Red sea.]
\p
\v 5 The abysses (depths) have covered them; [i.e. the high waters which stood raised up like unto high walls, are fallen down upon them, Exod. 14.22.] they sunk into the dephts like a stone.
\p
\v 6 O LORD, thy rght hand hath been made glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath broken the enemie:
\p
\v 7 And through thy great exellence, [Heb. through the greatnesse of thy highnesse. ] thy hats over thrown them that rose up against thee. [i.e. them, that rose up against thy people: for that which is done against the people of God, God accounts of as done against him self. See Zach. 2.8. Matth. 25.45. Acts 9.4.] Thou hast sent forth thy burning wrath, which hath consumed them as stubble. [this is an abrupt speech, and may be supplyed or completed thus. Which hath consumed them, as the stubble is consumed by the fire.]
\p
\v 8 And through the blast of thy nose [A description of the wind: See Exod. 14.21.] the waters have been heaped up, the streams have stood up right like a heap: the abysses were grown stiff [or, propt up] in the heart of the Sea. [i.e. in the greatest depth, or, the midst of the Sea: as Psalm 18.16. and 46.3. and Ezech. 28.2. Compare. Deut. 4.11.]
\p
\v 9 The Enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil: [This useth to e done wi th a great deal of rejoicing, Isa 9.2. Pharao andhis man promised themselves and easie and full victory , but it failed them.] My soul shall be filled of them; [ i.e. as some like wise do render it, my last shall be satisfied upon them. See Job. 16. on verse 10.] I will draw forth my sword, [Heb I will empty or, (void) my sword] my hand shall destroy them. [or, bring them back into (my) possession, or make them poor.]
\p
\v 10 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the Sea covered them; they sunk down like lead in mighty waters.
\p
\v 11 O LORD, who is like thee among the Gods? who is like thee, glorified in holinesse [i.e. adorned and surrounded with incomparable holiness.] terrible in songs of praises, [he that ought to be worshiped hourned and praised with a great measure of filial fear, reverence, and awfulnesse] doing wounders?
\p
\v 12 Thou didst stretch forth thy right hand, the earth swallowed them up. [i.e. the bottome of the Sea.]
\p
\v 13 Thou didst through thy kindness lead this people, that thou hast redeemed; thou carriedst the softly through thy strength, to the present Habitations of thy Holinesse. [understand the land of Canaan; were God would g
\p ive unto his people, his holy woship . See Psalm 78.v. 52,53,54.]
\p
\v 14 The Nation had it, they shall tremble: [See the fulfilling, Num 22.3,6. nd Josh 2.10,11. and 5.1. Psalm 68.3.] Woe hath seised the inhabitants of Palestina.
\p
\v 15 Then the Princes of Edom shall be abashed, quaking shall seise the mighty ones of the Moabites: all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.
\p
\v 16 Terrour and fear shall fall upon them ; through the greatness of their arm they shall become dumb , like a stone : untill thy people , LORD , passe through , until thy people passe through , which thou hast purchased .
\p
\v 17 Them thou shalt introduce , and plant them upon the Mount of thine Inheritance [ i.e. In the Mountaneous Countrey , such as Canaan is , Deut.11.11. Othrs understand here Mount Moria, whereon the Temple was built afterwards.] at the place, which thou hast made , O LORD, thine habitation : the Sanctuary , which thy hands consecrated , O LORD.
\p
\v 18 The LORD shall reign in eternity and evermore. [ i.e. Both here and hereafter , world without end,
\p
\v 19 For Pharao's horse , with his charet , with his horsemen , came into the Sea , and the LORD hath made the waters [ which just before stood up like mighty walls on both sides, chap.14.22.] to return over them : but the children of Israel went on dry (ground) in the midst of the Sea .
\p
\v 20 And Miriam and the Prophetes , Aarons sister , [ She was likewise sister to Moseh , but having lived a long time with Aaron , during Moseh his absence , she is therefore called , ( as she was most taken notice to be ) Aarons sister.] took a Timbrel into her hand ; and all the women went forth, after her, with timbrels and with dancings .[Oth. with flutes , or, pipes.]
\p
\v 21 Then Miriam [Together with other women ] answered them ; [ viz. the men, who sung before , as above verse 1. the women singing the same thing over again after the men .] Sing unto the LORD ; for he is highly exalted , [ as above verse 1. ] the horse and his rider he hath thrown into Sea .
\p
\v 22 After this Moseh made the Israelites to march on from the Reed Sea off; and they went forth into the wilderness of Sur, [ the Name of a Desart , betwixt Egypt and Arabia . See Gen .16. verse 7.] and they went three days in the wilderness , and found no water .
\p
\v 23 Then they came to Marah , [ when Moseh came to this place with the Israelites, the name of it was not Marah yet , but it got that name then first, from the bitterness of the water there , Marah signifying bitterness as the Text itself sheweth ] yet they were not able to drink the water of Marah , for it was bitter ; therefore the name of it was called Marah .
\p
\v 24 Then the people murmured against Moseh , [ To murmur , is to conceive evil thoughts of God , his words, and works , in the heart , and to speak unworthily thereof with the tongue .] saying ; what shall we drink ?
\p
\v 25 Then he cryed unto the LORD shewed him a Tree ( or piece of wood ) which he threw into that water , then the water became sweet : [ This water became sweet for the use and service of the Israelites , for a time only , and remained not always sweet ; as appears Plinies Natural History , lib.6. Chap.29. making mention of those bitter waters in his time. See 2 Kings 2.21. ] There [ viz. God ] set ( the people) [ viz. of Israel ] and Institution and Right, and there he proved the same ;
\p
\v 26 And said ; if so be , that thou wilt earnstly hearken [ Heb. hearing hear .]to the voice of the LORD thy God, and do what is right in his eyes, and incline thine ears to his Commandements , and keep all his Institutions ; then shall I lay none of the diseases upon thee , which I laid upon the land of Egypt , for I am the LORD thy healer, ( or, Physician ) [ i.e. I am he that is able to heal and help thee in body and soul , and to keep and preserve thee from all hurt and misery present and to come .]
\p
\v 27 Then they came to Elim , and there were twelve water-fountains , and seventy palm-trees : and they camped themselves there by the waters.
\c 16
\s The children of Israel come into the wilderness of Sin , v.1,etc. They murmure for having no bread , 2. god doth promise and give them bread from Heaven, 4. and quails too, 8. Manna is not found on the Sabbath day , 25.whence Manna had the name ; the form of it, 31.a gomer for it is laid up for posterity , 32. how long this Manna continued , 35. what a Gomer is , 36.
\p
\v 1 When they were gone from Elim, the whole Congregation of the children of Israel came into the wilderness of Sin, which is betwixt Elim and betwixt Zinai : [ before they went from Elim towards Sin , they had been once again at the Red Sea , of which Journey Moseh makes no mention here , but recordeth it , Numb.33.10, 11. Sin is the name of a wildernesse in Arabia the stony , where was the eighth camping or leaguer-place of the Israelites, Numb.33.10,11. Mount Zinai is otherwise called Horeb, the same whereon Moseh received the Law.] on the fifteenth day of the second month after that they were gone forth out of the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 2 And all the Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moseh, and against Aaron in the wilderness.
\p
\v 3 And the children of Israel said to them : O that [ Heb.who shall give that : Compare Deut.5. Verse 29.] we had died in the land of Egypt , by the hand of the LORD, when we sate by the flesh-pots , when we did eat bread to satiety ( ad faturitatem ) for ye have led us forth into this wilderness to kill this whole Assembly with famine.
\p
\v 4 Then said the LORD to Moseh Behold, I will rain bread for you, [ i.e. something ( called Manna) whereof the Israelites afterwards made bread ] out of heaven, [ i.e. it shall fall down from Heaven in the manner of a rain ] and the people shall go forth , and gather each day (a) measure on his day, [Hebr. word, or thing which signifieth here such a quantity or proportion , as was needful one mans daily sustenance .] that I may prove them , whether they go in my Law, or not.
\p
\v 5 And it shall come to pass on the sixt day [ viz. the day before the Sabbath ; then the Israelites were to prepare and ready their meat for the Sabbath day , on which they were allowed no manner of work , not so much as the kindling of a fire , as may be seen , Exod. 35.3.] that they shall make ready what they shall have brought in : the same shall be double [ see below ver. 22.] above what they shall gather daily. [Hebr. day, day, as Gen. 39.10.]
\p
\v 6 Then said Moseh and Aaron to all the children of Israel : in the evening , [See verse 13.] then shall ye know, that the LORD hath led you forth out of the land of Egypt . [ not we , of our own device , and purpose , as the people ever and anon upbraided them : See verse 3. and above chap.14.11.]
\p
\v 7 And to morrow ye shall see the Glory of the LORD, because he hath heard your murmurings against the LORD : for what are we , that ye murmure against us ?
\p
\v 8 Moreover , said Moseh , when the LORD shall give you flesh in the evening , and in the morning bread unto satiety , it shall be , because the LORD hath heard your murmurings , which ye murmure against him : for what are we ? your murmurings are not against us , but against the LORD. [ Meaning, it was not against them alone ; or, not so much against them, as against the LORD . See the like phrases , Ge.32.28. and 1 Samuel 8.7. John 12.44.]
\p
\v 9 After that, Moseh said unto Aaron ; Say to the whole Congregation of the children of Israel ; Draw near before the face of the LORD, [ i.e. assemble together before the cloudy pillar , in and by which the LORD did manifest his glorious presence , verse 10 .] for he hath heard your murmurings .
\p
\v 10 And it came to pass , when Aaron spake to the whole Congregation of the children of Israel , and that they turned themselves toward the wilderness , then behold , the Glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud .
\p
\v 11 Also the LORD spake unto Moseh ,saying ;
\p
\v 12 i have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel : speak to them, saying Betwixt the two evenings , [see Exod. 12.6.] ye shall eat flesh ; and in the morning ye shall be satisfied with bread ; and ye shall know , [ finding it verified by your own experience .] that I am the LORD your God .
\p
\v 13 And it came to pass in the evening , [ viz. of that day]that there came up quails , [ Heb. the quail : So Exod.8.verse 6. the frog, for frogs .] and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay round about the camp. [ Heb. there was a laying of dew.]
\p
\v 14 Now when the dew that lay , was gone up, [ viz. Into the air , evaporating through the heat of the Sun : The Manna lay covered and hidden under the dew , which went upwards with the rising of the Sun. See Numb.11.9.] behold , then there was over the wilderness [ Heb. upon the face of the wilderness :] a small [ Heb. thin] round thing , small as the hoar -frost upon the earth.
\p
\v 15 When the children of Israel saw it, they said the one to the other , [ Heb. the man to his brother .] it is MAN ; [ i.e. it is food , or gift prepared and appointed for us . Oth. What is this ? ] fo they knew not what it was : Moseh then said unto them ; this is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.
\p
\v 16 This is the Word, which the LORD commanded ; gather of it every one , according as he [ and his whole family] may eat : [ Heb. according to the mouth of his food , i.e. according to what his own and families sustenance requireth .] a Gomer for an head , [ Heb.pate or brain, i.e. person ] after the number of your souls ; every one shall take for those that are in his Tent . [ These words declare the fore-going , in this verse.]
\p
\v 17 And the children of israel did so, and gathered the one much , the other little . [Heb. multiplying , and deminishing .]
\p
\v 18 Yetwhen they measured it with the Gomer, [See below, verse 35] he that had gathered much, had nothing ever, and he that gathered little, had no lack: [That senes is, very one broughte home what he gathered, and then the father, or head of the family measured it out, and gave every one Gomer, or due there and proportion, so that none got more than his due and ordinary allowence] every one gathered us with as he coud eat. [Heb. according to the mouth of his eating, or food, as verse 16]
\p
\v 19 And Moseh said to them; Let no man leave (ought) of it t the morning.
\p
\v 20 Yet they hearkened to Moseh, but some men left of it to the morning [This thy did, some out of the fruitlesse, care, and difference, and others it may be out, of curiosity, to try and see whether the Manna would keep so long] then there grew worms in it, and it become stinking; for with Moseh was very wroth with them.
\p
\v 21 Thus now gathered every morning, [Heb. in the morning, in the morning] every one according as he could eat, for when Sun grew hot, it welted. [viz that which remained lying on the ground; so here is rendred the reason , why they gathered it always in the morning]
\p
\v 22 And it happened on the sixth da, that they gathared double bread, tw Gomer for one: and all the chief of the Congregation came, and acquainted Moseh with all it. [for they doubted whether the people did well or ill, Moseh having commanded, that there should be gathered but a Gomer a piece.]
\p
\v 23 The he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath spoken; Tomorrow is the rest, the holy Sabbath of the LORD; That which ye shouln bake, [viz. against tommorrow] bake that, and boil, what ye should boil, and all that which remaineth over, [viz. on the sixth day, the moity of the double Gomer which they had gathered; the monity of the double Gomer which they had gathered on the sixth day, remained over] lay it up for you in custody tomorrow.
\p
\v 24 And they laid the same up, until tomorrow, as Moseh had commened, andit stank not, [As it happened before, when they had laid it up, against Moseh his command. See above, verse 20] nor was there any worn in it.
\p
\v 25 Then said Moseh, Eat that to day [Moseh here teacheth the people, what they ought to do, not only on that day, but from week to week, on every Sabbath day, as long as it should rain Manna] for to day is the Sabbath of the LORD: [Moseh spake the word of this verse and next, on that evening, when the Sabbath began, or was entering, which we, according to our custome, use t call Saturday – everning; for the Sabbath day began with the evining of the sixth day, and ended with the eveining of the seventh ] ye shall find none in the filed to day.
\p
\v 26 Six days ye shall gather it: but on the seventh day in the Sabaath, on the same, there shall be none.
\p
\v 27 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that some of the people went forth togather (Manna) [Thses believed neither God himself, nor Moseh his servant] yet they found nothing .
\p
\v 28 Then the LORD said to Moseh: [i.e. He commended him say unto the people] How long do ye refuse to keep my commendments, and my Laws? [one kind of transgression, is set down here as the transgression of Commandements}
\p
\v 29 Behold , therefore , because the LORD hath given you the Sabbath , he gives you the sixt day two days bread : Let everyone remain in his place , that none go forth but of his place on the seventh day .[viz. for to gather Manna ; or to do any other work , Lev.23.3.they are charged to repair to the holy Assembly, and Act 1. 12. mention is made of a Sabbath-days Journey.]
\p
\v 30 So the people rested on the seventh day.
\p
\v 31 And the house of Israel , called its name MAN : and it was like Coriander -seen, [ viz. For shape and bignesse , but it was white like Bedolah , or crystal , Numb.11.7. ] white, and the taste of it , was like honey cakes . [viz.being taken up from the ground , undresled ; but when it was caked , it tasted like fresh oil , Numb.11.8.]
\p
\v 32 Moreover, Moseh said , This is the Word , which the LORD commanded : Fill a Gomer thereof , to keep [ viz. in the Tabernacle , which shall be set up] for your Generations ( or, posterity ) that they may see the bread which I have given you to eat in this wilderness, when I led you forth out of the Land of Egypt.
\p
\v 33 Moseh likewise said to Aaron , Take a pot [ Heb. 9.4. it is called the golden vessel . Oth. Dish, plate] and put a Gomer full [ Heb. fulness of a Gomer ] of Man into it : and set it before the face of the LORD , [ whobmanifested his presence above the Ark of the Covenant .] to be kepe for your Generations .
\p
\v 34 According as the LORD commanded Moseh, so Aaron set it (up) before the Testimony [ Understand before the Ark of the Covenant, wherein the Tables of the Law of God were kept : See Exod.25.16, 21. which are called the Testimony , because they witnessed or testified the will of God . The Ark was indeed first commanded to be made upon Mount Sinai, ( after the giving of the Law ) but Moseh here contracteth the matter , for to conclude the History of the Manna therewith .] to be kept .
\p
\v 35 And the children of Israel did eat Man fourty year , until they came into the inhabited countrey : [This is said in opposition to the wildernesse , wherein they lived all this while ] they did eat Man , until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.
\p
\v 36 Now a Gomer is the tenth (part) of an Epha : [ This is a measure of dry wares , containing as much as four hundred thirty two hen-egge-shells ; so that the Gomer , as some conceive , was twice as large as the Choenix , Rev. 6.6. being a corn or grain -measure, holding as much as would serve to feed a man a day See Lev.5.11. And 19.36. Deut.25.14, etc.]
\c 17
\s The people murmureth at Raphidim for water, v.1,etc. Moseh crying unto the LORD , getteth water out of the stone at Horeb, 4. the place is called Massa and Meriba , 7. Amalek fighteth against Israel , 8. as long as Moseh prayeth with his hands lifted up, Israel prevaileth ,11.God commandeth the destruction of Amalek, 14. Moseh buildeth an Altar , which is called, the LORD is my Banner , 15.
\p
\v 1 After that , the whole Congregation of the children of Israel went , according to their Journeys out of the wilderness of Sin [ Their Journeys were these ; from Sin, to Dophka, to Alus ; from Alus , to Raphidim, Numb.33.12,13,14.Moseh doth not make mention in this Chapter of all the Journeys , and resting-places of the people ; but only of those , in which there happened something extraordinary.] upon the Commandement of the LORD ; [Heb. upon, or, after the mouth of , etc.] and they camped themselves at Raphidim : [ this is a place in the wildernesse , by Mount Horeb ; this was the first camping , or leaguer-place.] now there was no place for the people to drink .
\p
\v 2 Then the people contended with Moseh , and said ; Give us water ye [viz. ye Moseh and Aaron ] that we may drink: then Moseh said to them ; what contend ye with me ? why do ye tempt the LORD ? [ viz. by your unbelief; for they doubted still whether the LORD was among them, verse 7. which they would have him make to appear by Miracles . This is to tempt God , Ps.78.18,19. Mat.16.1.
\p
\v 3 Now when the people thirsted after water , then the people [understand not all , but some ill-disposed ones among them] murmured against Moseh , and said ; Why hast thou made us to go out of Egypt , to make me , and my children , and my cattel die of thirst ?
\p
\v 4 Then Moseh cryed unto the LORD , saying; What shall I do to this people? There wants not much , but they will stone me . [ Heb. yet a little , and they will stone me : the like he was threatned with, Numb. 14.10.]
\p
\v 5 Then the LORD said to Moseh : Go ( thy ways ) before the face of the people , [viz. unto Mount Horeb.]and take with thee of the eldest of Israel , [ that they be witness of what shall happen there.] and take thy staff into thy hand , wherewith thou smotest the River , [i.e. wherewith thou didst command Aaron to smite the same .] and go (thy ways.)
\p
\v 6 Behold, I shall stand there before thy face , upon the Rock in Horeb, and thou shalt smite upon the Rock , then water shall issue , that the people may drink . Now Moseh did thus , before the eyes of the eldest of Israel .
\p
\v 7 And he called the name of that place Massa , [ i.e. tempting, or Temptation ] and Meriba,[i.e. Strife,contention . See of another Meriba , Num.20.13.] because of the contentionof the children of Israel , and because they had tempted the LORD , saying ; Is the LORD in the midst of us , or not ?
\p
\v 8 Then came Amalek [i.e. the Amalekites , the posterity of Esau, jacobs brother ,Gen.36.15,16. That which is related here , happened when Moseh was marching with the Israelites towards Horeb. See Deut.25.17,18.] came and fought against Israel [i.e. the Israelites .] in Raphidim.
\p
\v 9 Then Moseh said to Joshua : Chuse us out men , and go forth, fight against Amalek : to morrow I will stand upon the height (or top) [ Heb.head] of the hill ; and the staff of God [ i.e. that staff , whereby God wrought so many and great wonders .] shall be in my hand .
\p
\v 10 Joshua now did as Moseh had said unto him, fighting against Amalek ; yet Moseh, Aaron ,and Hur, [This Hur is to be distinguished from Hur the father of Bezaleel, and the son of Caleb , 1 Chron.2.19.] did climb (or, get) up, on the top of the hill .
\p
\v 11 And it came to pass , when Moseh held up his hand , and that Israel prevailed ; but while he let down his hand , Amalek prevailed .
\p
\v 12 Yet moseh his hands were heavy , therefore they took a stone , and laid the same underneath him , that he sate thereon , and Aaron and Hur under-propped his hands , the one on this , and the other on the other (side) . [Heb. hence one , and thence one .] So his hands were sure , till the Sun went down .
\p
\v 13 So that Joshua discomfited [or, weakned ,infeebled , broke] Amalek and his people , [ It seems, that by Amalek here is to be understood the King , or, chief leader of the Amalekites , and by his people , their camp or army : others understand by Amalek the Amalekites , and by his people , other Nations, that were come into their assistance .] by the edge of the sword .[Heb. the mouth of .]
\p
\v 14 Then said the LORD to Moseh ; Write this for a Remembrance in a Book, [ viz. Wherein thou shalt describe the History of the Israelites .] and lay it (up) in the ears of Joshua : [ i.e. repeat it often ,imrint it well in thy successours apprehension , by his ears .] that I will wholly extirpate [ Hebr. extirpating extirpate] the remembrance of Amalek , from under Heaven . [i.e.every where, as far as the Heaven doth extend itself .]
\p
\v 15 And moseh builded and Altar , and he called its name ; The LORD is my Banner . [ Heb. Jehovah Nissi. Thus Moseh called his Altar , in remembrance of the victory over Amalek.]
\p
\v 16 And he said, Because the hand is upon the throne of the LORD, the war of the LORD shall be against Amalek, from generation to generation .[Understand by the Hand here , the Hand of God , i.e. his great and mighty power , which he stretcheth forth from Heaven ( that being his Throne ) for the Protection of his people , and the suppression of his enemies . By the Throne there may likewise be understood the Church of God.Some interpret it of Gods swearing an oath.Others read it , because the hand (viz. of Amalek) is against the throne of the LORD, i.e. was against him , and his people ; the place is somewhat obscure.]
\c 18
\s Jethro brings Moseh his wife and two sons , v.1, etc.Moseh relates unto Jethro , what great things the LORD had done for Israel ,7. Jethro blesseth God , and offers sacrifice unto him ,10. He counselleth Moseh, to set up Judges , for the judging of small matters ,13. Moseh followeth his counsel , 24. Jethro returneth to his own Countrey,27.
\p
\v 1 Then Jethro, the Priest of Midian , Moseh his father in Law, heard all what God had done to Moseh and to Israel: that the LORD had carried Israel forth out of Egypt.
\p
\v 2 So jethro Moseh his father in law , took Zippora mosehs wife ( after that he had sent her back .) [Heb.after her sending back.]
\p
\v 3 With her [viz. Zippora's ] two sons , whereof the ones name was Gersom , ( for he said , [viz. Moseh, when he gave the childe that name .] I have been a stranger in a strange Countrey .) [ to wit, in Midian .]
\p
\v 4 And the same of the other was Eliezer , for (said he) The God of my father hath been my help , and hath delivered me from the sword of Pharao .
\p
\v 5 Now when Jethro , Moseh his father in law came to Moseh, with his sons and his wife, into the wilderness , at the Mount of God , [ This was Mount Horeb , whereonGod gave the law Moseh .] where he had camped himself .
\p
\v 6 Then said he to Moseh : [ i.e. He sent word to him by some Messenger before his arrival .] I , thy father in law came unto thee , with thy wife, and both her sons with her.
\p
\v 7 Then moseh went forth , to meet his father in law , and he bowed himself, and kissed him , and they asked the one the other [ Heb. the man his neighbour ,or, companion ] of the welfare : [heb. peace . See Gen.37.14.] and they went to the Tent .[to wit, that of Moseh.]
\p
\v 8 And Moseh related to his father in law , all that the LORD had done to Pharao , and to the Egyptians, for Israels sake . all the toilthat had met [ Heb.found ] them upon that way , and that the LORD had delivered them.
\p
\v 9 Now jethro rejoiced over all the good, which the LORD had done to Israel ; that he had delivered them out of the hannd of the Egyptians.
\p
\v 10 And Jethro said ; Blessed be the LORD , that redeemed you out of the land of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of Pharao; that redeemed this people from under the hand of the Egyptians .
\p
\v 11 Now I know ,that the LORD is greater, then all the gods : [ Understand here the Idols of the Heathen nations, called Gods by name , but being none in deed .] for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly, [ the sense of these words is, That when the Egyptians conceived , that through the help of their Gods , they would soon suppresse and destroy the people of God , they were by God precipitated into the Red Sea, to the scorn and shame of all their Idol-Gods, in whom they trusted .] he was above them .[i.e.he prevailed against, subdued and destroyed them .]
\p
\v 12 Then Jethro ,Moseh his father in law , took burnt-offering , and slay-offerings to God , [ i.e. to offer them up in sacrifice to God .] and Aaron came , and all the chief of Israel, for to eat bread with Moseh his father in law [to eat bread doth here signifie , to be at a festivall meal together .] before the face of God . [ i.e. in the fear of the LORD : having the LORD before their eyes , or, before the Majesty of God appearing in the cloudy pillar .Compare Deut.12.7. and 27.7.]
\p
\v 13 Yet it happened on the next day , that moseh sate to judge the people : and the people stood before Moseh , from the morning to the evening .
\p
\v 14 When Moseh his father in law saw all that he did to the people ; [i.e. How did he carry and demean himself towards them ] he said; what thing is this , that thou doest to the people ? Why doest thou sit thy self alone , [ without any assessors , and assistants in Judgement .] and all the people stands before thee from the morning to the evening ?
\p
\v 15 Then said Moseh to his father in law : because the people comes to me , to ask counsel of God . [Oth. to seek God , i.e. they enquire , what doth agree with the will and command or law of God ; see 1 Sam.9.9.]
\p
\v 16 When they have a cause , then they come to me , to judge between the man and his neighbour :and that I may make known (unto them) Gods institutions and his law .
\p
\v 17 Yet moseh his father in law , said to him : the thing is not good which thou doest . [ To wit, in that manner , that thou doest all alone thus .]
\p
\v 18 Thou wilt wholly decay [this is a phrase comparatively taken from flowers , leaves , or herbs ; see Deut.1.9,12.Jethro's meaning is ,That Moseh wore himself out , hearing and judging all bussinesse of the people himself : the people likewise was tired and ill satisfied , with warisome attendance , before they could be admitted and heard. Oth. wear away, fall away, faint .Hebr.thou shalt withering wither .] both thou, and this people , [ Heb. also thou, also this, etc.] that is with thee : for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou alone art not able to do it.
\p
\v 19 Here now my voice , i will counsel thee , and God shall be with thee : be thou for the people with God , and bring thou the things before God . [As if he should say , it is enough , that thou be employed in great and weighty affairs , wherein Gods own advice or decision must be had , whereof we read , Numb.15.33,4. And 27.5,6. other smaller matters may be dispatched by others.]
\p
\v 20 And declare unto them the institutions and the laws; and make known unto them the way wherein they are to walk, and the work which they are to do.
\p
\v 21 Yet look thou about all the people , for valiant men , [ Oth. strong , able , couragious men ; see Gen.47.6.] fearing God, true men , [ Heb. men of truth , or faithfulness :] hating covetousness : [ unto these qualifications required in Governours of Nations ,Cities, and Countries , Moseh addes some others yet, Exod.2.6. Deut 1.16. and 16.18. see likewise , 2 Chro.19.7. and Isa.33.15.] set them over them, Chief of thousands , chief of hundreds , chief of fifties, chief of tens :
\p
\v 22 That they may judge this people at all times ; yet so, that they bring all great matters to thee , but that they judge all small matters : thus ease thy self , and let them bear with thee.
\p
\v 23 If thou do this thing , and God command it thee, then shalt thou be able to subsist ; then shall likewise all this people come to their place in peace . [viz. Into the land of Canaan , or each one to his own home , getting their businesse dispatched , without that tedious attendance from morning to night .Thus a mans house is called his place, Judg.7.7. and 9.55. and 19.28,29.]
\p
\v 24 Moseh now hearkened to the voice of his father in law : and he did all that he had said .[ viz. After that God had commanded him the same , Numb.11.16. and having likewise propounded it unto the people , Deut.1.14.]
\p
\v 25 And Moseh chose out valiant men, out of all Israel ,and made them heads over the people : [ What Instruction and charge Moseh gave unto these men ,see Deut. 1.16,17.] Chieftains of thousands , Chieftains of hundreds , Chieftains of fifties , and Chieftains of tens .
\p
\v 26 That they should judge the people at all times ; bringing the hard matters to Moseh , but judging themselves every small matter.
\p
\v 27 Then Moseh let his father in law depart ; and he went to his Countrey.[viz.Into Midian .]
\c 19
\s The Israelites came into the desart of Sinai, in the third month after their coming forth out of Egypt ,v.1,etc. Moseh went up to God upon that mount,3. There God enjoineth him what to say unto the people ,3. The people promise to obey the words of God , which Moseh reports again unto the LORD,8. The people is hallowed against the third day ,10. they must not approach the mount ,12.The dreadful and terrible presence of God upon the mount ,16. God speaks with Moseh ,19. the people,21. Yea and the Priests too are again forbidden to approach the mount , until they were hallowed ,22. Moseh and Aaron only are commanded to go up to the LORD , 24.which also they do,25.
\p
\v 1 In the third month [or, (new moon ) called Sivan by the Hebrews , falling partly , in our May,and partly in June . This was four hundred and thirty years after the Covenant established with Abraham , Gen.15. and 17.] after the going forth of the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt : on that same day [viz. when they broke up from Raphidim , which was the first day of the month ; ( Compare Ezek.46.1,6.) fourty seven days after the Passeover , or coming forth out of Egypt .] they came into the wilderness of Sinai . [ This is a Mountain in Arabia , Gal.4.25. Lying in a wildernesse, Acts 7.30,38.]
\p
\v 2 For they went from Raphidim , and came into the wilderness of Sinai , and they camped themselves in the wilderness : now Israel camped themselves there , over against that Mount . [viz.Sinai.]
\p
\v 3 And Moseh went up to God , [i.e. To the pillar of cloud upon the Mount ] and the LORD called unto him from the Mount , [i.e. from the top of it , moseh being yet in a lower part thereof ] Saying; thus shalt thou speak to the house of Jacob , and declare unto the children of Israel .
\p
\v 4 Ye have seen, what I have done to the Egyptians ; how I have born you upon Eagles wings, [Implying, that like unto an Eagle , bearing her young ones upon her back , so God had carried them both speedily and safely out of Egypt .See Deut. 32.11.] and brought you to me .[ i.e. to the place of my presence , and conveniency of serving me .]
\p
\v 5 Now then if ye will carefully obey [Heb.obeying obey ] my voice, and keep my Covenant , ye shall be my perculiar (people) out of all nations ; for all the earth is mine . [viz. with all that is therein contained .]
\p
\v 6 And ye shall be unto me a Priestly Kingdome , [Heb. a Kingdome of Priests , i.e. a Kingdome consisting of Priests and Kings .] and an holy people , [i.e. dedicated to the service of God .] These are the words , which thou shalt speak to the children of Israel.
\p
\v 7 And Moseh came , [viz. down from the mount unto the people , and put before their faces all these words [or, things, matters ] which the LORD had commanded him .
\p
\v 8 Then all the people answered with one accord , and said ; All that the LORD hath spoken we will do : and Moseh brought the words of the people back unto the LORD.
\p
\v 9 And the LORD said to Moseh ; Behold , I shall come unto thee in a thick cloud, [Heb. in the thickness of the cloud ] that the people may hear when I speak with thee , and that likewise evermore [ i.e. all their lifetime ] they may believe thee : [ see above chap.14.31.] for moseh had declared the words of the people unto the LORD.
\p
\v 10 Also the LORD said to Moseh ,Go unto the people , and hallow (or, sanctifie ) them , [i.e. command them , and look thou and the eldest of the people carefully to it, that they do holily prepare themselves for the receiving of my Commandments : see further , Lev.11.on verse 45. ] today and tomorrow , and let them wash their clothes ,
\p
\v 11 And be ready against the third day ; for on the third day, [ This was the fiftieth day after the Passeover, which therefore is called Pentecost by the Greeks , i.e. the fiftieth day .] the LORD shall come down [appearing in the pillar of cloud, verse 9. and 16. ] before the eyes of all the people upon mount Sinai .
\p
\v 12 And set bounds to the people round about , Saying ; Beware of ascending the mount , and touching his end : [or, pale, border.] every one [or, every thing ] that toucheth the mount , shall assuredly be put to death . [ Heb. dying to be made to die .]
\p
\v 13 No hand shall touch him , but he [ man or beast , that shall have touched the mount ] shall surely be stoned , or surely short through , [ implying , that if he be near, he shall be stoned , but if farther off , he shall be shot.] whether it be a man , or a beast , he shall not live : when the rams-horn [ there was no rams-horn but there was heard a Sound , like unto that of rams-horn .] goeth slowly, [i.e. sound a long unison , as is usual in the end of Musick-song .] then they shall go up on the mount . [remaining nevertheless upon the foot or lower part of it , verse 17. to wit , that they might the better hear the promulgation or proclamation of the Law.]
\p
\v 14 then Moseh went down from the mount unto the people ; and he hallowed the people : [ i.e. he commanded , that they should sanctifie themselves, as verse 10.] and they washed their clothes :
\p
\v 15 And he said to the people : Be ye ready against the third day ; [ Heb. after three days ] and approach not to the wise .
\p
\v 16 And it came to pass on the third day , when it was morning , that upon the mount there were thunders and lightnings , etc an heavy cloud , and the sound of a very strong Trumpet , [see above verse 13.] so that all the people that were in the camp , were terrified .
\p
\v 17 And Moseh led the people forth out of the camp to meet God ; and they stood at the nethermost (part) of the mount .[ yet so as they touched not the mount it self , nor transgressed the bounds , verse 12.]
\p
\v 18 And all the mout of sinai smoaked , because the LORD came down upon the same in fire ; and the smoak thereof went up, as the smoak of a furnace, and all the mountain trembled much .
\p
\v 19 When the sound of the Trumpet was going , and grew very strong : Moseh spake, and god answered him with a voice .[or, in a voice , i.e. in a softer way then by thunder , and the terrible noise of the Trumpet . This God did to encourage Moseh , who at first , was much terrified and frighted , Heb. 12.21.]
\p
\v 20 When the LORD was come down upon mount Sinai , upon the top [Heb. head] of the mount : then the LORD called Moseh up, on the top of the mount, and Moseh ascended.
\p
\v 21 And the LORD said to Moseh , Go down , Testifie unto this people , [i.e. Charge them most strictly and seriously ] that they break not through to the LORD, [viz. passing the bounds which are set them .]for to gaze , and many of them fall . [i.e . be put to death by the LORD , according to the threatning , above verse 12. See phrase , Gen.14.10. 1 Cor.10.8. Etc.]
\p
\v 22 And let the Priests also , [ Understand here the first-born, whom God had hallowed unto himself , and whom before the seperating of the Tribe of Levi, for the Priesthood , used to administer that office in their families , Exod. 13.2. and 24. verse 5. in his stead he afterwards chose the Tribe of Levi , Numb.8.14., etc.] who draw near uto the LORD , [ see Lev.10.3.] sanctifie themselves ; that the LORD break not forth against them.
\p
\v 23 Then said unto the LORD : The people shall not be able to get up on the mount ; for thou hast testified unto us, Saying ; Set bounds to the mount , and hallow it . [ i.e. Let the people know , that they are to hold this mount holy , by reason of my presence , and that therefore they ought to forbear approaching the same .]
\p
\v 24 The LORD then said unto him , Go (thy way ) , descend, [ viz. to acquaint the people with my inhibition , after which thou and Aaron shall return up to me .] then thou and Aaron with thee shall get up : yet let not the Priests and the people break thorow , for to get up to the LORD , lest he break out against them.
\p
\v 25 Then Moseh descended to the people , and told it them . [To wit, that which the LORD had commanded him.]
\c 20
\s God gives Moseh the ten Commandments upon mount Sinai , v.1,etc. With thunder , lightnings , sound of Trumpet , etc. wherewith the people are terrified , 18. moseh chears them up, 20. Gods forbids them all Idolatry most earnestly ,23. what kinde of Altar God would have built unto himself ,24.
\p
\v 1 Then [viz. after that Moseh and Aaron were gone up the mount . See above chap.19.24. ] God spake all these words , [i.e. these following ten Commandments ] saying ;
\p
\v 2 I am the LORD thy God , that led thee forth out of the land of Egypt , and out of the house of bondage : [Heb. out of the house of the servants , or, bond-men, slaves .]
\p
\v 3 Thou shalt have no other Gods before my face .[Oth. no other God ,etc.]
\p
\v 4 Thou shalt not make no carved Image, nor any likeness to thy self [ To this Law is not repugnant , that Moseh , on gods command , caused by Cherubims , Exod.25.18. and after the brazen Serpent , Numb.21.8, & c. to be made ; the same being not at all made to exhibit any devine worship unto them ] (of that ) which is above in Heaven , [as Sun,Moon, Stars,Fowls, Deut. 4.19. understand likewise hereby the Angels , Col.2.18.] nor (of that) which is beneath upon the earth , [as men, four footed beasts , and creepings, Deut.4.16,17. Isa.44.13. Ezek. 23.14.] nor (of that) which is in the waters under the earth , [ as fishes , snakes ,serpents,dragons , crocodiles ,tortoises ,& c. See Deut.4.18. and Isa. 41.29.]
\p
\v 5 Thou shalt not bow down thy self before them , nor serve them ; [ viz. Neither the Idols themselves , nor me by them , as Exod. 32.4,6. they pretended to do by the golden calf ; and afterwards the ten Tribes , by the two golden calves , 1 Kings 12.28.] For I the LORD thy God am a jealous God , [ God is called the husband of his people , Jer.2.2. Hos.2.19. Idolatry is called Whoredome and adultery, Deut.31.16. Judg. 2.17. Jer.3.9,20. therefore the wrath and displeasure of God for that sin,is called Jealousie.] that visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children [i.e. their posterity , to wit, such as walking in their fathers footsteps ; do commit the sin of Idolatry likewise .] on the third and on the fourth (member) [or, generation ]of them that hate me.
\p
\v 6 And do (or, shew) compassion on thousands of them that love me , and keep my Commandments.
\p
\v 7 Thou shalt not vainly use the Name of the LORD thy God ; [ Heb. take up for vanity the Name , etc. See Psalm 15.3. and 16.4. and 50.16.] for the LORD shall not hold guiltless [or, clean, pure] him that doth vainly use his Name .
\p
\v 8 Remember the Sabbath day, that thou hallow the same [i.e. Seperate that day from thy usual and common emploiment , or daily labour , such as belongs to thy temporal life ; and bestow the same in serving God with holy works , tending more eminently to the glory of God , and thy own spiritual life and everlasting welfare.]
\p
\v 9 Six days thou shalt labour , and do all thy work :
\p
\v 10 But the Seventh day is the Sabbath of the LORD thy God : (then) thou shalt do no work , thou , nor thy son , nor thy daughter , (nor) thy man-servant , nor thy maid-servant , nor thy cattel, [ as , Oxen, Asses, Horses , Camels, Elephants , & c.] nor thy stranger , that is in thy gates :
\p
\v 11 For in six days the LORD made the Heaven and Earth, the Sea and all that therein is ,and he rested the Seventh day ; therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day , and hallowed the same .[See Gen.2.3.]
\p
\v 12 Honour thy Father and thy Mother , that thy days may be lengthened, [Oth.that may lengthen thy days : they, to wit , thy father and thy mother , by their prayer, or blessing , which prevail much with God , as on the contrary their curse is seldome in vain .] in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
\p
\v 13 Thou shalt not kill.
\p
\v 14 Thou shalt not commit adultery .[Or, break wedlock.]
\p
\v 15 Thou shalt not steal.
\p
\v 16 Thou shalt speak [ Oth. answer ] no false witness against thy neighbour .[By the word neighbour here are to be understood all men , all mankind , as Gen.11.3. Esth.1.19. Prov.18.17. See Luke 10.29,30. not thy very enemy excepted.]
\p
\v 17 Thou shalt not covet (or, desire ) thy neighbours house , [ Compare , Deut.5.21.] thou shalt not covet thy neighbours wife , nor his man-servant , nor his maid-servant , nor his oxe , nor his asse , nor ought that is thy neighbours.
\p
\v 18 And all the people saw the thunderings and the lightnings , [ Properly , lamps , torches , i.e. lightnings ] and the sound of the trumpet , and the smoaking mountain : when the people saw that , they withdrew, [viz. from the mount ] and stood afar off.
\p
\v 19 And they said to Moseh : Speak thou with us, and we will hearken : and let not God speak with us lest we die.
\p
\v 20 And Moseh said to the people ; Fear not, for God is come to prove you , [viz. to know whether you will obey his Commandements , as you promised to do, above chap.19.8. See Gen.22.1. ] and that his fear ( or,dread) may be before your face , that ye sin not .
\p
\v 21 And the people stood afar off : But Moseh drew near the darkness where God was.
\p
\v 22 Then the LORD said to Moseh : thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel : Ye have seen that I have spoken with you from Heaven , [ viz. upon mount Sinai. See Deut.4.36. and Nehem.9.13.]
\p
\v 23 Ye shall make no silver Gods besides me, neither shall ye make you golden Gods.
\p
\v 24 Make me an Altar of earth , and offer thereupon thy burnt-offerings , [See Gen.8.20.] and thy thank offerings, [see Lev.3.1.] thy sheep , and thy oxen : in every place , where I shall set up the remembrance of my Name , [Heb. where I shall cause my Name to be remembred .] will I come unto thee [viz. to manifest my love and favour to thee.] and will bless thee.
\p
\v 25 But if thou wilt make me an Altar of stone , [Afterwards the Altar was made of Sittim-wood , Exod.27.1. And after thatof Copper , 1 Kings 8.64.] thou shalt not build the same of hewen (stone) ; if thou lift thy graving tool over it , thou wilt un-hollow (or prophane ) it.
\p
\v 26 Neither shalt thou ascend with steps unto my Altar , [ And yet this Altar was to be three cubits high, Exod.27.1. And Salomons Altar was ten cubits high , 2 Chron.4.1. there were no steps indeed made to ascend,but the ground was raised , so that the Priests went up to the Altar higher and higher, insensibly as it were , as upon a raised bank , or natural small hill , where they might be seen of every one present ] that they shame ( or nakedness ) be not uncovered before it . [ viz. before the Altar . Afterwards the Priests were ordered by God to wear linnen drawers , Exod. 28.42,43.]
\c 21
\s Laws concerning bond-men , or slaves , v.1, etc. Servants bored through the ear ,5. Ordinances for bond-women ,7. of murderes,12. of men-stealers ,16. of them that curse their parents,17. of strikers,18.of them that hurt a woman with childe ,22. of a master of a family , that strikes out an eye or tooth of his man-or maid-servant,26.of a pushing oxe , by digging a pit ,33.
\p
\v 1 These now are the Rights (or, Ordinances ) [ i.e. Civil Constitutions and Orders , according to which the Judges were to judge the people of God .]which thou shalt put before them .[viz. before the people of Israel , but especially the Magistrates .]
\p
\v 2 When thou shalt buy an Hebrew servant , [Man or maid , as appears by Deut. 15.12. and Jer. 34.9.Observe , that none might buy an Hebrew servant in israel, but such as sold themselves , or their children for poverty , Deut. 15.12. Lev.25.39. Or that the Magistrate sold any for theft committed , when there could be made no restitution or recompense , Exod.22.3.] the same shall serve six years : but in the seventh year he shall go out free, for nothing .
\p
\v 3 If he shall be come in with his body, [i.e.In his person only , without a wife ] he shall go out with his body : if he was a married man , [ Heb. a wifes Lord . See Gen. 14.13.] his wife shall go out with him .
\p
\v 4 If his Master have given him a wife , [viz. A Heathen , or,forein slave ,or , bond woman , for onely such might be kept in bondage , Lev. 25.44. but with an Hebrew woman they could not deal , as appears by verse 7. ] and she shall have born him sons or daughters , the wife and her children shall be her Masters , and he shall go out with his body . [for the children born of a bond-woman , were likewise subject to bondage , as appears ,Gen.21.10. Gal. 4.24,25, etc.]
\p
\v 5 But if the servant shall roundly say , (or, declare ) [Heb. saying shall say] I love my Master ,my wife , and my children ; I will not go out free.
\p
\v 6 then his Master shall bring him to the Gods , [i.e.Before the Magistrates , Judges , Governours , as Psalm 82.1,6. and elsewhere .] after that , he shall bring him to the door, [viz, of his masters house .] or to the post : and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl , [shewing thereby,that he was made fast , and tied unseperably thenceforward to serve & obey the master of that house.] and he shall serve him forever . [See Deut.15.16.]
\p
\v 7 Now if any shall have sold his daughter [ Heb. if a man ,etc. understand this of an Hebrew ] for a bond-woman : he shall not go out as the bond-men go out .[of whom see before , verse 6.]
\p
\v 8 If she be ill-pleasing [Heb. if she be evil] in the eyes of her Master , that he hath not betrothed her to himself] he shall cause her to be redeemed : to sell her to a strange people,he shall not be able , because he dealt unfaithfully with her .
\p
\v 9 But if he betroth her to his son , heshall do with her, according to the right of daughters .[i.e. He shall give her a dowry , or matrimonial goods , such as fathers were wont to give unto their daughters , Exodus 22.16.]
\p
\v 10 If he take an other for himself , he shall not withdraw from this, her food , [Heb. her flesh ,i.e. her food, or alimony] her covering , nor her marriage-duty.[see 1 Cor.7.3. oth. matrimonial co-habitation.]
\p
\v 11 And if he do (or,perform) not these three (things) unto her , [viz. whereof the former ver.spake] then he shall go out for nothing, without money .
\p
\v 12 Whoso striketh any , that he dieth, the same shall surely be put to death . [Heb. dying be made to die .]
\p
\v 13 Yet he that lay not in wait for (him) , [viz. with malicious intent and purpose, seeking and watching opportunity to do him mischief .] but god made him to meet his hand ; I shall appoint thee a place , whither he may flee .[of the Cities of refuge, whither such, as committed a murther at unawares , might betake and save themselves ; see Numb.35.11. Deuteronomy 19.2. Jos.20.2.]
\p
\v 14 But if any have dealt wilfully against his neighbour , to slay him craftily ; then thou shalt take him before mine Altar , [ i.e. although he should have taken sanctuary at my own Altar, to save himself , thou shalt not spare , nor scruple to take him thence : see 1 Kings 2.25.] that he may die .[ viz. by course of law, and according to the sentence of the Magistrate.]
\p
\v 15 So he that striketh his father or his mother , shall surely be put to death .
\p
\v 16 Moreover, whoso stealeth a man ,[ Deut.24.7. it is a son of Israel , i.e. any israelite .] whether he have sold him , or, that he be found in his hand , he shall surely be put to death.
\p
\v 17 Whoso likewise curseth his father , or his mother , he shall surely be put to death .
\p
\v 18 And if men strive together , and the one strike the other , [Heb. a man (i.e. any one) strike his neighbour ] with a stone , or with a fist : and he die not , but keepeth his bed :
\p
\v 19 If he rise again , and go in the street with his staff , he that struck him , shall be guiltless , [ i.e. he shall not be punished by death ] only he shall give that which he neglected , [Hebr. his sitting , i.e. all the damage he sustained , by being dis-enabled to go about his labour or emploiment ; the meaning is , he shall give him satisfaction , for having been kept for so long from following his business , and earning his daily bread and livelihood .] and he shall get him perfectly healed . [ Heb. recovering recover ,or, healing heal.]
\p
\v 20 also when any striketh his man-servant, or his maid-servant, with a stick , [ This meant of such a servant , as he bought with his money , wherefore also in the next verse the same is called his money ; with an Hebrew servant , the condition differed much , as you may see , Lev.25.38,39,40.] that he die under his hand; [viz. while he is beating of him ] the same shall surely be avenged . [viz. by the Magistrate, who is Gods avenger , Rom.13.4.]
\p
\v 21 Nevertheless if he keep up [Heb. if he stands] a day, or two days , he shall not be avenged , for it is his money . [ i.e. His master bought him with his own money, and therefore he is his own , which makes it probable , that he intended not to kill but only to chastise him . Oth.as he is his money , i.e.being such a servant , as was bought with his own money .]
\p
\v 22 Now when (any ) men strive , and strike a woman with a childe ; [ Whether both together , or one or either of them do it.] that the fruit [ Heb. her children ] go off from her , yet (it) be no mortal mischief, [understand neither to the mother , nor to the childe , but both be saved alive ] shall surely be punished , [Heb. punishing be punished ] even as the husband of the woman layeth upon him , and he shall give it by the Judges . [i.e. according to the sentence of the Judges.
\p
\v 23 But if there shall be mortal mischief [viz. Either to another, or childe] thou shalt give soul for soul: [i.e life for life]
\p
\v 24 Eye for eye; tooth for tooth; hand for hand; foot for foot:
\p
\v 25 Burning for burning; wound for wound; sore for sore
\p
\v 26 Also when any strikes his man – servants eye, or his maid – servants eye, and spoileth; he shall let him go free for his eye. [i.e. He shall set him at liberty from his bondage]
\p
\v 27 And if he strike out his man – servants tooth; or his maid – servans tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooto. [The like is to be understood of the maiming, laming, or spoiling of other members and part of the body]
\p
\v 28 And when an oxe doth push a man or women [Under the name of an oxe ought to be understood likewise, bulls, cows, heifers, bullocks, goats, rams, horses, asses, and other beasts, which may hurt a body by their horns, teeth, heels, claws , &c] that he die, God avengeth the blood of man upon the very beasts, see Gen 9.5.] and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the master of the oxe shall be gultless. [viz. if so be that he knew not the pushing condition of his oxe.]
\p
\v 29 But if the oxe were pushing before, [Heb. from yester – (day), 10 v 36 and elsewhere] and it was testified to his master, and he had not guarded, and his master shall likewise be put to death [not having hindred, or prevented the death of his neighbor, as well he might have done.]
\p
\v 30 If (a) ransome be laid upon him, [viz By the Judges, they having narrowly examined all the circumstances, and finding cause to save his life, and to sine him] he shall give for the redemption of his soul, according to all that shall laid upon him,
\p
\v 31 Whether he had pushed a son, or pushed a daughter, it shall be done to him, according to that right.
\p
\v 32 If the oxe push a man – servant, or a maid servant: he [ the owner of the oxe] shall give unto his master [i.e. that mans, or maids master] thirty silverlings. [See Gen. 20.16]
\p
\v 33 And when any one openeth a pit, or, when any one diggeth a pit, and he covers it not; and an oxe or asse [understand likewise any other beast that fell into the pit] yet he dead (beast) shall be his [viz. the master or ownerof th pit]
\p
\v 34 the master of the pit shall recompence it, he shall return the money to its master; [viz. So such as the Judge, or Umpire shall estimate the beast that fell into the pit]yet the dead (beast) shall be his. [viz. the master or owner of the pit]
\p
\v 35 Now when any ones oxe doth hurt his neighbours oxe, that he dieth, the living oxe shall be sold, and the money thereof divided half and half, and the dead shall likewise be divided half and half.
\p
\v 36 Or, was it know, that the same oxe was pushing formarl, and his master hath not guarded him, then he shall by all means recompence] for oxe, yet dead (one) shall be his. [to wit, his whose oxe did kill thhe other]
\c 22
\s Of theft, v.1, etc. Of the hurt any ones beast doth in another mans ground, 5. of hurt coming by fire, 6. of hurt coming to goods, committed to ones trust, or keeping, 7. of hurt befalling things borrowed,14. Of a maid seduced to commit whoredome, 16. of sorcery, or whitchcraft, 18. of uncleanness with beasts, 19. of Idolatry, 20. that none shall hurt strangers, widdows, and orphans, 21. of usury, 25. of pawning clothes, 26.honouring Magistrates, 28. of the first-fruits, 29. of eating flesh torn by beasts, 31.
\p
\v 1 When any one stealeth an oxe, or small cattel, and slayeth it, the same shall give back five oxen for one oxe, and four sheep for (one of the ) small cattel.
\p
\v 2 If a thief be found in digging thorow, [As Mat.24.53. Heb. in the digging thorow, or, with a thorow-digging, (under-mining Instrument)] and he (come to) be beaten, that he die, it shall be no blood-guiltiness to him [Heb. it shall be no bloods (in the plural, Sanguines) to him. To him, viz. that killed the thief : it shall not be imputed to him, he shall not answer, nor suffer for it , as if he had committed a murther.Thus the word Bloods (sanguines) is taken, Numb. 35.27. and elsewhere.]
\p
\v 3 If the Sun be risen over him, [viz.Over the thief while he is beaten] then it shall be blood-giiltiness to him : [viz. that killed him : The meaning is, If it be bright day, or the Sun be fully up once, when the thief is breaking in ; whoso kills him then,his blood must be shed again] he shall perfectly restore it : [Heb. restoring restore ; He, viz. the thief mentioned, verse 1. whose case is prosecuted here ] if he have nothing, he shall be sold for his thievery.
\p
\v 4 If the theft be surely found, [Heb. being found be found] alive in his hand ; [i.e. with him, whether it be in his house, or stable , or ground, before he have slain or sold it ] be it oxe, or asse] or small cattel ; he shall restore it double.
\p
\v 5 When any causeth a field or vineyard to be eaten up , [Understand this likewise of gardens, orchards, nurceries, meadows, and the like] and he drive his beast (into it ), that it may feed in another mans (field ), he shall make restitution of the best of his (own) field, and of the best of his vineyard.
\p
\v 6 When a fire cometh out , and seiseth [ Heb. findeth ] the thorns, [or, straw, or hay, or some such like combustible matter] so that the corn-stack, or the standing corn, or the field,, shall be consumed : he that set it on fire, shall restore it compleately.
\p
\v 7 When any one giveth his neighbour money, or vessels [ i.e. any kinde of houshold-stuff] in custody, (or,to keep), and it ( cometh to ) stoln out of that mans house ; if the thief be found, he shall restore it double.
\p
\v 8 If the thief be not found, the matter of the house shall be brought to the Gods, [ i.e. The Magistrates, as Exod.21.6. ] whether we have not laid his hand on his neighbours goods. [understand, to search and try it ]
\p
\v 9 In all cases of wrong, about an oxe, about an asse, about small cattel, about clothes, about every lost (thing) which any one saith ( or, claimeth) to be his : [oth. who saith that it is that , or, he is it] the case of both [ plaintiff and defendant] shall come before the Gods .he whom the Gods do sentence, (or, convince), he shall restore it double to his neighbour.
\p
\v 10 When any one giveth an asse, or an oxe, or small cattel, or any beast in custody to his neighbour ; [viz. for money] and it (cometh to ) die, or to be hurt , or driven away , that none seeth it ; [ to witnesse the fact.]
\p
\v 11 The the oath of the LORD [ i.e. The oath whereby God is called upon as witnesse] shall be betwixt them both , whether he have not laid his hands on his neighbours goods : and the master thereof shall accept of (the same) , [i.e. content himself, and rest satisfied with that oath] and he [viz. the keeper, that had the goods in custody] shall not restore it .
\p
\v 12 But if it be surely stoln by him,[Heb. stealing stoln] he shall restore it to its matter.
\p
\v 13 If it be surely torn, let him bring it [i.e.something, or part of that which is torn , as Amos 3.12.] for witness : then he shall not restore what is torn.
\p
\v 14 And when any one , desireth something of his neighbour , [ understand , and that his neighbour lets him have it , or lends it him] and it (comes ) be hurt , or dieth, its master not being by, he shall restore it compleately. [Heb. he shall restoring restore it ; i.e. pay it and make it good .]
\p
\v 15 If his master were by it , he shall not restore it : if it were hired , it came for its hire. [i.e. he that hired it ought to be free , paying the conditioned hire.]
\p
\v 16 Now, when any one enticeth a maid , that is not betrothed, and he lie with her , [To lie with a betrothed one was death , Deut.22.23.] he shall without delay give her a dowry, for to be his wife.
\p
\v 17 If her father utterly refuse [ Heb. refusing refuse] to give her unto him, then he shall give money, [Heb.weigh, according to the custome of those days , weighing their paiments one to another ]ccording to a dowry of Virgins . [this was fifty silverlings, or shekels of silver , Deut. 22.29. about twelve Rix-dollars, and an half. ( two pound sixteen shillings three pence.) ]
\p
\v 18 The Witch thou shalt not suffer to live. [Nor the man that practiseth witchcraft, Deut. 18.10. ]
\p
\v 19 Whosoever lieth with a beast , he shall surely be put to death . [ Lev. 20.15. God commands that beast likewise to be put to death.]
\p
\v 20 He that sacrifiseth to the Gods, [ Under the tearm of offering sacrifice , there must be understood likewise all manner of other service and worship, Deut. 17.3. ] besides the LORD alone , the same shall be excommunicated, ( or,anathematized). [ i.e. he shall be held accursed, and he shall be destroyed, or rooted out .]
\p
\v 21 Neither shalt thou over-burthen the stranger, nor oppress him : for ye have been strangers in the land of Egypt .
\p
\v 22 Ye shall afflict no widdow, nor fatherless.
\p
\v 23 If thou afflict them any way , [ Heb. afflicting afflict them] and if they cry unto me in any kinde , [ or, earnestly ; Heb. crying cry] I shall surely hear [Heb. hearing hear, ( exaudiendo exaudiam) ] their cry. [ oth. his cry.]
\p
\v 24 And my anger shall be kindled and I shall slay you with the sword : and your wies shall become widdows , and your children fatherless .
\p
\v 25 If thou lend money to my people that are poor with thee , thou shalt not be towards the same, as an usurer : thou shalt lay no usury [The Hebrew word Neschech hath its signification from biting ; usury biting , consuming and devouring poor people ] upon the same .
\p
\v 26 If in any sort thou take in pawn [ Heb. if taking in pawn thou take in pawn ] the garment [ understand likewise the coering ] of thy neighbour ; [ under stand withal , if he be so poor , that he have but one garment to put on or cover himself with, as appears verse 27 . and Deut. 24.12,13.] thou shalt restore it to him, before, [or, against, the while] the Sun goeth down .[Heb. goeth in ; viz. Into her bed-chamber as it were, as David expresseth it , Psalm 19.6.]
\p
\v 27 For that only is his covering, it is his garment over his skin : wherein should he lie? it shall come to pass then, when he crieth to me, that I shall hear it, for I am gracious.
\p
\v 28 Thou shalt not curse the Gods : [ See Exod.21.6. and understand hereby the Heards and Governours as well as Ecclesiastical as Civil of that time : as appears by the words of Paul, Acts 23.3.] and the chief in thy people, thou shalt not revile.
\p
\v 29 Thy fulness [i.e. Thy fully-ripe fruits, or the fruits being full and ripe, as Numb. 18.27.] and thy tears [thus the wine and oil is called , because of their trickling and running forth, being prest] thou shalt not put off : [understand ; but thou shalt pay, or offer them to me in due time ] The first-born of thy sons thou shalt give unto me. [or, redeem with five shekels of silver, which were to be given to the Priests of the LORD, Numb.18.16.]
\p
\v 30 The like shalt thou do with thine oxe, (and) with thy sheep : seven days thou shall be with their mother , (or, dam) on the eighth day thou shalt give them unto mee.
\p
\v 31 Ye now shall be holy (folks) unto me : [Heb. Men of holiness ; i.e. a people leading a more holy, and pious life then all other people and nations ] thorefore ye shall eat no flesh, that is torn in the field, [Lev.17.15. there are added hereunto, such beasts as die of themselves.] ye shall cast it o the Dog.

\s Of false report and witness, v.1, etc. Right must not be wrested , 2. Men ought to do good to their enemies, 4. Judges may take no bribes, 8. nor oppress the strangers , 9. of the seventh year, which was to be a year of rest, 10. Of the Sabbath-day, 12.The name of other Gods should not be named, 13. Of the three high feasts in the year, 14. No sacrifice was to be offered with leavened bread , 18. God promiseth the people, that an Angel should go before them, whom they were to obey, 20. the honouring of strange Gods forbidden, 23. God promiseth to bless them that serve him , 25. The Hornets should expel the enemies of the Israelites, 28. The Borders and Limits of the land of the Israelites, 31. they are forbidden to make a Covenant with the Heathen, or their Gods, 32. or to let them inhabit among them, 33.
\p
\v 1 Thou shalt take up [Oth. Receive, carry forth, spread] no false report : [Heb. no report of lying, or, no hearing of falshood] nor set thy hand with the wicked , [ i.e. be not of their company, join not with them, to help them carry on their wicked enterprise] for to be a witness for violence, [Heb. of violence.]
\p
\v 2 Thou shalt not follow the maltitude [ Heb. many ; oth. the mighty, the great, or powerful] for evil things : and thou shalt not speak in a striving cause , (or, controversie ) enclining after the maltitude, to bow ( or, wrest) ( the right )
\p
\v 3 Neither shalt thou advance [Heb. glorifie, honour ] the mean (one), in his controversie .
\p
\v 4 When thou meetest thine enemies oxe, or his straying asse, thou shalt by all means bring the same back to him. [ Heb. bringing back, bring back.]
\p
\v 5 When thou seest thy haters asse to lie under his burthen, shouldest thou be negligent then, for to neglect thy own for him? [Oth. thou shalt forbear to let him the same there , and forsaking shalt forsake it with him, i.e. no sooner then he himself forsaketh the same ] thou shalt by all means forsake it with him. [Heb.forsaking thou shalt forsake. Oth. thou shalt by all means get it up (or, raise it ) with him . Compare Nehem. 3.8. and 4.2. The meaning is , As he that hateth thee must neglect his other business, to rescue his asse , so thou shalt likewise neglect thy own , to help it up again , together with him .]
\p
\v 6 Thou shalt no wrest the right of thy poor, [viz. Sitting as Judge of the people, in Judgement ] in his controversie.
\p
\v 7 Be far from false matters : [ or, words ] and the guiltless and righteous thou shalt not put to death, [ i.e. not sentence, cast, or condemn him to die , fo the speech here is to Magistrates ] for I will not justifie the wicked . [viz. a wicked and unjust Judge, that pronounceth an unrighteous Judgement over a guiltless person.]
\p
\v 8 Also thou shalt take no gift ; [ viz. From persons, pleading in Judgement , or having any cause before the Judge] for the gift blindeth the seeing , and perverteth the cause [ or, words ] of the righteous .
\p
\v 9 Neither shalt thou oppress the stranger : for yee know the minde (or,soul) of the stranger . [ Oth. yee know, how a strangers heart stands affected] having been strangers your selves in the land of Egypt .
\p
\v 10 Also thou shalt sowe thy land six years , and gather its in-come ;( or, revenue .)
\p
\v 11 But in the seventh thou shalt let it rest and lie still, [i.e.Remain untill'd, unmanured . Compare Jer.17.4.] that the poor of thy people may eat , [that namely, which shall grow in the seventh year of it self, Lev.25.5,6. understand, that they may eat , together with thee and thine , in regard that such a years of provision was to grow, without any humane labour , by Gods especial blessing .] See Lev. 25.6,7.] and the remainder thereof the beasts of the field may eat ; thus thou shalt (likewise) do with thy vineyard , ( and ) with thy Olive-trees.
\p
\v 12 Six days thou shalt do thy works , but on the Seventh day thou shalt rest, that thy oxe and thy asse may rest, and that the son of thy maid-servant ,[ i.e. the servant of thy bond-woman ] and the stranger, may draw breath .
\p
\v 13 In all that I have said unto you , ye shall be upon your guard : and the Name of other Gods ye shall not mention : it shall not be heard out of your mouths . [ neither in oaths , nor to any such like purpose .]
\p
\v 14 Three times in the year shalt thou keep me (a) Feast .
\p
\v 15 The Feast of the unleavened (breads) shalt thou keep, [ The Feast of the Passeover , and the Feast of the unleavened bread, is one and the same indeed , only there is this difference betwixt them, that that day only is called the Passeover, in which the Paschal Lamb was eaten, the other seven days were called the days of unleavened bread .] seven days shalt thou eat unleavened (bread) , ( as I commanded thee) at the appointed time , in the moneth of Abib ; [See Exod.12.2. and 13.4.] for in the same thou didst go forth out of Egypt, yet one shall not [ this is only spoken to men , as appears verse 17. and Deut.16.16.] appear empty before my face . [ i.e. without some gift , or offering .]
\p
\v 16 And the Feast of the Harvest , [Understand the Wheat-harvest here . This feast was afterwards by the Grecians called Pentecost , falling fifty days after the Passeover , Lev. 23.15.,16. Deut.16.9. Acts 2.1. During the time of this Feast, God gave ten Commandements , Exod.19. and after he sent the holy Ghost , at the ame time of the year , upon his Apostles , Acts 2.] of the first-fruots of thy labour [ i.e. of thy fruit or corn, for the enjoying whereof thou didst labour , and till and husband the ground ; and which God hath bestowed upon thee by thy labour ;] which thou shalt have sowed in the field ; and the feast of the gathering in, at the going out of the year , when thou shalt have gathered in thy labour out of the field. [ This Feast came in the seventh month of the year ; to wit, in September, beginning on the fifteenth of that month, and lasting seven days . It is otherwise called , The Feast of the Tabernacles , or Leave-huts , Lev.23.34. Deut.16.13.]
\p
\v 17 Thrice a year [viz. On the foresaid three solemn and festival times] all thy males [ unless they have some lawful impediment , as sickness, dotage, and other the like infirmities or disabilities ] shall appear before the face of the Lord, LORD. [ which afterwards was the Temple at Jerusalem, 1 Kings 14.21.]
\p
\v 18 Thou shalt not suffer the blood of my Sacrifice with any leavened (bread). [ i.e. having any leavened bread at home in your houses , Exod. 12.15.] nor shall the fat of my feast [ i.e. of the sacrifice of my feast, viz. of the lamb that was to be sacrificed then ] be kept till the morning.
\p
\v 19 The firstlings of the first-fruits [Heb. the beginning of the first-fruit] of thy land , thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God : [ i.e. into the Tabernacle at first , 1 Chron.9.29. and afterwards into the Temple at Jerusalem. See Deut.26.1,2, etc.] Thou shalt not cook (or, dress, boil) the kid in his mothers milk
\p
\v 20 Behold I send an Angel before thy face , [Ex. 13.21. The same is called the LORD, viz. Christ, whom the Israelites provoked in the wilderness, 1 Cor. 10.9. He is called an Angel, that is to say, a messenger, because he is sent by the Father ] for to guard thee upon this way, and for to bring thee to the place which I have prepared .[ viz. into the land of Canaan .]
\p
\v 21 Take hid before his face , [ i.e. By reason of his presence with you] and be obedient to his voice, and exasperate him not : for he shall not forgive your transgressions ; for my Name is in the inmost of him .[i.e. he is true God together with me, being likewise called JEHOVAH. See Jer. 23.6. John 10.30,38. and 2 Cor. 5.19. and Heb.1.8. Item , compare John 14. 10.]
\p
\v 22 But if thou diligently obey [Heb. hearing hear ] his voice, and do all that I shall speak ; then I will be thine enemies enemie , and thine adversaries adversarie.
\p
\v 23 For my Angel shall go before thy face, and he shall bring thee in , to the Amorites , [i.e. into the land of the Amorites, & c.] and Hethites , and Pheresites , and Canaanites , Hevites, and Jebusites : and I will destroy them.
\p
\v 24 Thou shalt not bow down before their Gods , nor serve them ; also thou shalt not do after their works , but thou shalt wholly break them down, [ Hebr. breaking down break down] and utterly bruise [ Heb. bruising bruise] their standing images :
\p
\v 25 And thou shalt serve the LORD thy God , then he will bless thy bread and thy water : and I will keep off sicknesses out of the midst from thee.
\p
\v 26 There shall be no miscarrying nor barren (female) in thy land : I will fulfill the number of thy days : [Those namely, which are according to the course of nature , thou art to live ; whereas the wicked man shall not live out half his days , Psalm 55.24.]
\p
\v 27 I will send my terrour [ i.e. A very great one ; or, a terrour, which I my self shall bring upon them : See examples hereof , Gen.35.5. 1 Samuel 14.15. and 2 Chron. 20.29.] before thy face, and make all the people , to whom ye come , faint-hearted ; and I will cause all thine enemies to turn the neck [ i.e. their back] to thee . [Heb. I will give all thine enemies the neck to thee-wards.]
\p
\v 28 I will likewise send hornets before thy face : the same shall expel the Hevites , the Canaanites , and Hethites , [ Understand likewise , the rest of those Nations mentioned before , verse 23.] from before thy face.
\p
\v 29 I will not expel them from thy face in one year, that the land be not laid waste, [i.e. destitute of inhabitants ] and the wilde beasts be not multiplyed above thee.
\p
\v 30 I will drive them out from thy face by degrees : till thou be grown, and inherit the land .
\p
\v 31 And i will set thy borders , from the sea Zuph to the sea of the Philistines , and from the wilderness, [ understand the wilderness of Sin, in the way to Egypt ] unto the River : [ viz. of Euphrates] for I will give the inhabitant of that land into your hand , that thou mayest drive them out before thy face .
\p
\v 32 Thou shalt make no Covenant with them, nor with their Gods .
\p
\v 33 They shall not dwell in thy land , that they do not make thee sin against me : if thou serve their Gods , it will assuredly be a snare unto thee.
\c 24
\s God commandeth Moseh, Aaron, Nadab and Abibu, to come to him upon the mount , v.1,etc. The people promise obedience to the Laws of the LORD , 3. Moseh buildeth an Altar, and twelve pillars, 4. He sprinkleth the Altar with the blood of the sacrifices , 6. Moseh and the elders of the people see the LORD, 9. God promiseth to give Moseh the two Tables of stone , 12. Aaron and Hur are to take care in the mean time of the people , 14. God appeareth upon the mount as a consuming fire , 16 . Moseh remains fourty days and fourty nights upon the mount , 18.
\p
\v 1 After that , He [viz. God] said to Moseh ; Ascend [viz. After that thou shalt have acquainted the people with the above-rehearsed Commandements ] unto the LORD, [ i.e. to me ] thou and Aaron , Nadab and Abihu, [the two eldest sons of Aaron, which were afterwards devoured by the fire of the LORD, Lev.10.1,2. for offering strange fire to the LORD] and seventy of the Eldest of Israel, and bow your selves down afar off.
\p
\v 2 And let Moseh alone draw near to the LORD ; but let not them draw near : neither let the people climb up with him, [ viz.With Moseh or, with the elders ; the people was to remain below at the foot of the hill. The elders went about half way up, and saw the glory of God in some sort , more evidently, verse 9,10. but Moseh went up to the very top of the mount into the dark cloud , verse 18.
\p
\v 3 When Moseh came [ viz. Down from the hill, into the camp] and related unto the people all the words of the LORD,and all the rites : then all the people answered with one voice ; and they said ; All these words, which the LORD hath spoken , we will do.[This the people spake , not knowing the impossibility of keeping the Law , which is sick through the flesh, Rom.8.3.]
\p
\v 4 Now Moseh described all the words of the LORD,[viz.after that he had made them to the people by word of mouth, verse 3.] and rose up early in the morning, and he built an Altar , [viz.for a Memorial, or in remembrance of the Covenant made there betwixt God and the people , as Gen.31.45.] beneath at the mount [i.e. at the foot of the mount ] and twelve pillars , [ to put them in minde of the Covenant ] according to the twelve Tribes of Israel.
\p
\v 5 And he sent the young men of the children of Israel, [i.e. The first-born who were the Priests and Offerers , until the Levites ( who came to supply the place of the first-born, Numb.3.41.) were ordained for the Priestly function. The Hebrew word rendred young-men (or, youth) here, doth not always signifie such as are young of years , but often likewise such as are fit and able to do good an d special services , whether it be in Ecclesiastical, Civil , or Military affairs , or for their parents or friends ] and offered thank-offerings unto the LORD of young oxen . [ and likewise other beasts , Heb.9.19.]
\p
\v 6 And Moseh took the moiety of the blood [viz. of the beasts there slain to be sacrificed ] and put it into basons, and the moiety of the blood he sprinkled upon the Altar . [ and upon the book also, Heb.9.19.]
\p
\v 7 And he took the book of the Covenant . [See verse 4.] and he read it before the ears of the people : and they said ; All that the LORD hath spoken , we will do and obey .
\p
\v 8 Then Moseh took that blood , [ To wit, the other moiety of the blood ] and sprinkled it upon the people : and he said ; Behold ( this is ) the blood of the Covenant , which the LORD hath made with you, over all these words. [viz. which are written in the book of the Covenant .]
\p
\v 9 Moseh now and Aaron went upwards, (as) also Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the eldest of Israel.
\p
\v 10 And they saw the God of Israel, [To wit, some tokens of the presence of God , verse 15 , 16. for no man ever saw God in his Essence , Exod.33.20. And 1 Tim.6.16. and under his feet like a work [ i.e. structure, fabrick oth. like the work of a pavement] of Saphir-stones ; and as the likeness [ Heb. of the body] of Heaven,in (its) brightness.
\p
\v 11 Yet did he not stretch forth his hand [i.e. He did destroy none of them that were come up on the mount at this time , as he had threatned above, chap.19. verse 12. for that now they were come up by his particular command , verse 1. and 9.] to the seperated of the children of Israel :[understand the eldest of the people, of whom mention is made, verse 1. and 9. oth. Princes , Chieftains ] but they did eat and drink after they had seen God ; [i.e.they remained alive , and in good health and temper, testifying the same by their eating and drinking .]
\p
\v 12 Then the LORD said to Moseh ; Come to me upon the mount ; and be (or,stay) there : and I will give thee Tables of stone, and the Law and the Commandements , which I have written, for to instruct them.
\p
\v 13 Then Moseh arose , with Joshua his servant ; and Moseh went up, on the mount of God . [to wit, upon mount Sinai]
\p
\v 14 And he said to the eldest , [viz. When he was ready to go forth out of the camp, and to ascend the mount] Tarry ye us here ; until we return unto you : and behold, Aaron and Hur are with you ; He that hath any business , [ Heb. he that is master of words ,or, businesses] let him come to them.
\p
\v 15 When Moseh was gone up to the mount ; a cloud did cover the mount. [This was a token of the presence of God , although it happened not without some terrour and affrightment : 2 Chro. 6.1. Heb. 12. 18. See likewise Exod. 19.9.]
\p
\v 16 And the glory of the LORD dwelt upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered him six days ; [Either the LORD, Moseh, or the Mount] and on the seventh day he called Moseh out of the midst of the cloud [viz. Moseh all alone : so that Moseh had not Joshua himself with him , when God spake unto him .]
\p
\v 17 And the regard of the glory of the LORD, was as a consuming fire , [ This served to terrifie the transgressours of the Law , Deut.4.24.] upon the top [Heb.head] of that mount, in the eyes of the children of Israel
\p
\v 18 And Moseh went into the midst of the cloud , after that he had gone up into the mount ; and Moseh was upon that mount fourty days and fourty nights . [viz. without eating and drinking , Exod.34.28. Deut.9. 9,18.]
\c 25
\s The LORD bids Moseh to take up a free-will heave-offering to set up a Sanctuary, v. 1, etc. God chargeth him, how and whereof to make the Ark, 10. as also the cover of expiation , with the Cherubims , 17. The Table for the shew-bread, and other utensils, 23. The golden Candlestick with its employments, 31. All was to be made answerable to the pattern which Moseh had seen upon the mount , 40.
\p
\v 1 Then the LORD spake unto Moseh, saying ;
\p
\v 2 Speak to the children of Israel , that they take [ i.e. Take and give, or offer ] me [ i.e. for my service and worship] an heave-offering : [ i.e an offering , which they used to elevate at the giving , or presenting thereof : Heb. an elevating, or lifting up , or seperating , severing ; it being a gift seperated, or set apart from the rest , and consecrated to the LORD] from every man whose heart shall freely move him , shall ye take my heave-offering . [Ye, viz.Thou Moseh and the rest of the men , whom I commanded, above ch.24.1. to come up on the mount .]
\p
\v 3 This now is the heave-offering , which ye shall take from them ; [ viz. for the making and setting up of the Tabernacle , and what belongs to it ]gold, and silver, and copper.
\p
\v 4 As also , sky-colour , and purple, and scarlet , [ Hereby are understood certain stuffs of these colours , as silks, cotton, wool,flax, and the like] and fine linnen, and goats-(hair). [whereof there was made a cover or vail to be spread over all the Tabernacle , Exod.26.7,13.]
\p
\v 5 And red-died rams-skins, and badgers-skins, [ Of these the uppermost , or out-most cover of the Tabernacle was made, Exod. 26.14.] and Sittim-wood. [ it is conceived, that this is a kinde of Cedar-wood, not subject to Corruption. See Isa. 41.19. and Iocl 3.18.]
\p
\v 6 Oyl for the Candlestick, [For the use of the lights that were to burn thereon . verse 37. ] spices for the annointing oyl , [wherewith the holy things, the Tabernacle, and the things pertaining to it , were to be anointed, as also the Priests themselves ] and for perfuming sweet smelling spices . [oth. Precious herbs for perfumes.]
\p
\v 7 Sardonyx-stones , [Exod.28.4.] and filling stones , [ i.e. Such as being in their ouches filled them up, Heb. stones of fulfilling , or, in- fillings , up-fillings ] for the ephod, [ this is rendred by some body-coat, it being the principal and most sumptuous Priestly upper garment , unto which was fastned the breast-plate , with the Urim and Thummim ] and for the breast-plate . [This was made of silk , gold, and precious stones , and covered the breast of the High Priest.]
\p
\v 8 And they shall make me a Sanctuary, [ i.e. An holy habitation , commonly called the Tabernacle , which was the place , where the publique worship of God was to be celebrated then , as afterwards in the Temple of Salomon ] that I may dwell in the midst of them.
\p
\v 9 According to all that I shall shew thee for a pattern of this Tabernacle, and for a type of all the furniture thereof , even so shall ye make the same.
\p
\v 10 Thus shall they [ viz. The artificers , or work men ] make an Ark of Sittim-wood : two ells ( or, cubits) and an half [See Gen. 6.15.] shall be the length of it, and an ell and an half the breadth thereof , and an ell and an half the height thereof .
\p
\v 11 And thou shalt over-lay it with fine gold ; within and without shalt thou over-lay it : and thou shalt make a golden garland , [ or, border , list, crown ] round about the same . [viz .the Ark.]
\p
\v 12 And cast for it , [ viz. for the Ark ] four golden rings, and set them [ Heb. give them ] and the four corners of it ; so that there may be two rings on the one side of the same , and two rings on the other side of it .
\p
\v 13 And make hand – bars into the rings , [ Oth. bearing- or , supporting -slaves] of Sittim-wood, and over-lay them with gold .
\p
\v 14 And put the hand-bars into the rings, which are at the side of the Ark ; [ There were two rings on the one side of the Ark, and two rings on the other side, throngh which the hand -bars were to be put ] that they may bear the Ark therewith. [ They, viz. the Levites , who, and none else were to carry the same upon their shoulders, Numb. 7.9. 2 Chron.35.3. See likewise 1 Chron.13. 7, 10, 11. and 15. 12, 15.]
\p
\v 15 The bearing – bars shall be in the rings of the Ark, they shall not be drawn out .
\p
\v 16 After that shalt thou lay into the Ark the Testimouy, which I shall give thee [viz. The two stone Tables where the ten Commandments were written upon ; being an express testimony of the will of God , whence the Ark was called , the Ark of the Testimony ,below verse 22. and elsewhere frequently.]
\p
\v 17 Thou shalt likewise make an expiation- cover of pure gold . two ells and an half shall be the length thereof, and an ell and an half its breadth .
\p
\v 18 Thou shalt also make two Cherubims of gold ; of massy ( gold) shalt thou make them, out of both the ends of the Expiation-cover . [ As if he should have said ; The Cherubims shall be coming forth at both ends of the cover, as if they were growing forth thence ; so that the Cherubims and the Cover were to be all of a piece , without being ill-laid, or sother'd together.]
\p
\v 19 And make thee one Cherub , out of the one end on this side , and the other Cherub out of the (other) end on yon side : Ye shall make the Cherubims out of the Expiation-Cover , out of both the ends thereof .
\p
\v 20 And the Cherubims shall spread forth both their wings on high , covering with their wings the Expiation-cover : and their faces shall be over against one another ; [ Heb. the man to his brother ]the faces of the Cherubims shall be towards the Expiation-Cover.
\p
\v 21 And thou shalt put the Expiation-Cover above upon the Ark , after that thou shalt have laid the Testimony ,[i.e. the Tables of the Covenant } which I shall give thee, into the Ark. [To the end that the Ark should not be opened afterwards, the LORD commands, that the Testimony should be put into the Ark, verse 16.]
\p
\v 22 And there I will come unto thee , and I will speak with thee from above the Expiation-Cover , from between the two Cherubims , ( which shall be upon the Ark of the Testimony ) all that I shall command thee to the children of Israel.
\p
\v 23 Thou shalt likewise make a Table of Sittim-wood : [ This Table stood in the holy place , that is to say , within the tabernacle before the Vail ] two ells shall be the length of it , and one ell the breadth of it ; and one ell and an half shall be the height thereof .
\p
\v 24 And thou shalt over-lay it with pure gold ; also thou shalt make a golden garland , ( or, fringe ) at it , round about it .
\p
\v 25 Thou shalt likewise make a list at it [ viz. At the said Table ; Heb. to it ] round about , an hand breadth : and thou shalt make a golden garland , round about the list thereof .
\p
\v 26 Also thou shalt make four golden rings on it ; and thou shalt set the four rings on the four corners , which shall be at the four feet thereof .
\p
\v 27 The rings shall be over against the list , for places [Heb. for houses ] for the hand -barres to bear the Table.
\p
\v 28 These hand-bars now thou shalt make of Sittim-wood, and thou shalt over-lay them with gold : and the Table shall be born thereby .
\p
\v 29 Thou shalt likewise make the dishes [ Which were twelve in number according to the twelve (leoaves) Levit.24.5.] thereof, [ viz. of the Table ] and its perfuming-vessels , [ the Hebrew word signifieth all manner of hollownesses or concavities, or vessels which are hollow , as the palm of the hand : these vessels served to put in perfumes . See Lev. 24.7.] and the plates thereof [ understand, covers , covering plates , as they are called, Numb.4.7. Heb. plates of covering , or, sprinklings] and the pots thereof , [oth. besoms , serving to keep the Table clean ] ( wherewith it shall be covered) [ the Table namely, which was to be beset or deckt with all these vessels ] or pure gold shalt thou make them .
\p
\v 30 And thou shalt always lay the shew-bread before my face upon this Table . [These bread-loaves were to lie a week upon this Table , and to be changed every Sabbath-day, Lev. 24.8. Heb. Bread of the face ; as lying exposed there before the face of the LORD.]
\p
\v 31 Thou shalt likewise make a candlestick of pure gold : of massie work shall this Candlestick be made , [ i.e.It shall neither be cast, nor pieced and sothered together, but it shall be beaten with hammer out of one piece or lump . This Candlestick weighed a talent , verse 39. ] his shaft and his reeds : [ i.e. arms, or branches ; and so likewise in the sequel ] his bowles , his knops, and his flowers, shall be out of him. [ See the first Annot. On this verse .]
\p
\v 32 And six reeds shall issue out of his side ; three reeds of the Candlestick out of his one side , and three reeds of Candlestick out of his other side.
\p
\v 33 In the one reed there shall be three bowles, ( like) almond-nuts , [ i.e. in the shape and form of almonds ] a knop and a flower : and three bowles ( like) almond-nuts in another reed ; a knop and a flower : thus shall the six reeds be , issuing forth out of the Candlestick, [i.e.they shall all six of them be alike the one to the other , as is declared , verse 35.]
\p
\v 34 But on the Candlestick it self [ i.e. on the shaft, stem, or body of it ] there shall be four bowles , ( like) almond-nuts, with his knops , and with his flowers .
\p
\v 35 And there shall be a knop under two reeds ( issuing forth ) out of the same ; [The Parenthesis put into the Text here , is taken from the latter end of this verse ] also a knop under two reeds , ( issuing forth) out of the same , [ Candlestick namely] yet a knop under two reeds ( issuing forth) out of the same: (thus shall it be) with the six reeds , issuing forth out of the Candlestick.
\p
\v 36 Their knops and their reeds shall be out of him : it shall be altogether a single massie work of pure gold .
\p
\v 37 Thou shalt make him seven lamps likewise , [Hebr. thou shalt likewise make his seven lamps ] and they shall kindle [ Heb. cause to ascend ] his lamps, and make them to light (or shine) on his sides . [ or, over against him . Heb. on the side of his faces .]
\p
\v 38 His snuffers , and his extinguishers shall be of pure gold .
\p
\v 39 Out of a Talent [ or, hundred weight : undderstand the hundred weight of the Sanctuary, containing one hundred and twenty five pound of gold, for an hundred weight weighed three thousand shekels, ( as may be gathered, by Exodus 38.25, 26.) which makes up the aforesaid summe . ( Howbeit others conceive it did weigh but one hundred and twenty pounds) The civil hundred weight , is thought to have weighed about the moiety.] of pure gold shall they make the same , with all this furniture .
\p
\v 40 Look to it then , [ Exod, 39.43. it is said, that Moseh observed all this very strictly and accurately] that thou make it, according to their type , [i.e. the pattern , model and fashion , or likeness and resemblance ] which is shewed thee upon the mount .
\c 26
\s God commandeth Moseh to make the Tabernacle of ten Curtains , v.1, etc . and a Deck over the same of eleven Curtains , made of Goats-hair , of rams-skins , and of badgers-skins ,7.The Tabernacle was to be made of Sittim-wood , 26. The Vail , of artificial work, betwixt of the holy place , and the most hooy, 31. The Cover at the door of the Tent , 36.
\p
\v 1 The Tabernacle now thou shalt make of ten Curtains : [ This Tabernacle or Habitation was made for to be the Receptacle of the Ark , the golden Table with the shew-bread and the golden Candlestick] of fine twinned linnen , and sky colour , and purple , and scarlet [ see 38. 28.] (with ) Cherubims of the artificial work [otherw. the most understanding work . Heb. the work of an artificer ]shalt thou make them.
\p
\v 2 The length of one Curtain shall be twenty eight ells , and the bredth of a Curtain four ells : all these Curtains shall have one measure .
\p
\v 3 There shall be five Curtains joined together , the one to the other , [ Heb. the woman to her her sister : so likewise verse 5,6. ] again there shall be five Curtains joined together, the one to the other .
\p
\v 4 And thou shalt make sky-coloured loops, at the edge [ or, border, self-edge. Heb. lip : as also below , verse 10.] on the uttermost, in the joining : so shalt thou do likewise on the utmost edge of the Curtain , on the second joining . [ This must be understood of the two utmost Curtains , which by their loops made both the fives to be coupled together .]
\p
\v 5 Fifty loops shalt thou make on the one Curtain , and fifty loops shalt thou make on the one Curtain, that is on the second joining : these loops shall take hold the one of the other , together.
\p
\v 6 Thou shalt likewise make fifty golden taches , and shalt join the Curtains together , the one to the other, with these taches , that it may be one Tabernacle
\p
\v 7 Also thou shalt make Curtains out of Goats-(hair) [ Heb. Curtains of she -goats ] for a Tent over the Tabernacle ; [ i.e. for a cover or deck over it , as verse 9, 11, 12, 13. This was the second Cover over the Tabernacle, serving to fence the same against winds and rain ] of eleven Curtains shalt thou make the same .
\p
\v 8 The length of one Curtain [ i.e. Of everyone of them ] shall be thirty ells , [ these Curtains were two ells longer then the other spoken of above , verse 2.] and the breadth of one Curtain four ells ; these eleven Curtains shall have one measure .
\p
\v 9 And thou shalt join five of these curtains together apart , [viz.by their loops ] and six of these Curtains apart ; and the sixt of these Curtains thou shalt double, [ i.e. fold it , or turn itabout by the middle , or the one half ] right before upon the Tent . [ Heb. right before upon the face of the Tent .]
\p
\v 10 And thou shalt make fifty loops at the edge [ Heb. lip. Oth. Self-edge] of the one Curtain ,the uttermost in the joining : and fifty loops , at the edge of the Curtain , which (is) the second joining together .
\p
\v 11 Thou shalt likewise make fifty copper taches ; and thou shalt put the taches into the loops , and thou shalt join the Tent together, that it may be one .
\p
\v 12 Now the remainder , that shoots over the Curtains of the Tent , half of the Curtain [ Understand this of the last or eleventh Curtain ] that shoots over , shall hang over at the hindmost parts of the Tabernacle . [ where the most holy place was , and the Ark of the Covenant stood .]
\p
\v 13 And one ell of this , and one ell of yon-side of that which shall remain over the length of the Curtains of the Tent , shall hang over at the sides of the Tabernacle , on this and yon-(side) to cover the same .
\p
\v 14 Thou shalt likewise make a Cover for the Tent of red-died rams-skins : and over that a Cover of badgers- skins. These Covers served only to cover the roof or uppermost part of the Tabernacle .
\p
\v 15 Thou shalt likewise make standing planks for the Tabernacle of Sittim-wood .
\p
\v 16 The length of a plank , shall be ten ells ; and one ell and an half shall be the breadth of each plank.
\p
\v 17 Two Tenons [Heb. hands ] one plank shall have , set (in) as steps in a ladder [ Other . set ladder-wise, i.e. at an even distance asunder , after the manner of the steps of a ladder ] the one by the other. [Heb. the woman by her sister ]Thus thou shalt make it with all the planks of the Tabernacle .
\p
\v 18 And the planks for the Tabernacle thou shalt make ( thus ) : Twenty planks to the Sotth-side South-wards.
\p
\v 19 Thou shalt likewise make fourty silver feet under the twenty planks : [ These were the feet or supporters of the planks , whereon they stood , each one weighing a Talent of silver , Exod. 38.27.] two feet under one plankon his two tenons ; and two feet under another plank on his two tenons .
\p
\v 20 There shall be likewise twenty planks [Each plank being one cubit and an half in breadth, verse 16.whence it appears , that the length of the whole Tabernacle was thirty cubits] on the other side [Heb. rib] of the Tabernacle , on the North-corner .
\p
\v 21 With their fourty silver feet : two feet under one plank, and two feet under another plank.
\p
\v 22 Yet on the sides of the Tabernacle toward the West , [ See Gen. 12. verse 8. Heb. Sea-ward , or toward the Sea-side ] thou shalt make six planks . [ These six planks were nine cubits broad , each plank being one cubit and an half broad : and they were all joined together, to make the Tabernacle close and tight behinde .
\p
\v 23 Thou shalt likewise make two planks , for the corner- planks of the Tabernacle , on both sides.
\p
\v 24 And they shall be joined from beneath , (as) twins ; The meaning is , they shall be made alike fast to the planks of the sides, and to the farther end of the Tabernacle , coupling or fastning them together in this manner ] they shall likewise be joined together (as) [ Heb. perfect ] twins at the upper end of the same , with a ring : thus shall it be with the two (planks) , they shall be for two corner-planks .
\p
\v 25 Thus shall the eight planks be with their silver feet , being sixteen feet : two feet under a plank ; again two feet under a plank.
\p
\v 26 Thou shalt likewise make bars ; [ Oth. ribs, rafters ,lattices] five on the planks of the one side of the Tabernacle :
\p
\v 27 And five bars on the planks of the other side of the Tabernacle : as also five bars on the planks of the side of the Tabernacle , on both the sides West-ward. [ or, West-ward, ( looking ) to both sides .]
\p
\v 28 And the middlemost bar shall be in the midst on the planks , shooting through , from the one end to the other end .
\p
\v 29 And thou shalt over-lay the planks with gold , and their rings ( the places for the bars) [ Heb. houses for, & c. i.e. serving for the bars to be put through and rest in them ] thou shalt make of gold :the bars thou shalt likewise over-lay with gold .
\p
\v 30 Then thou shalt set up the Tabernacle [ When all the parts of the Tabernacle were fitted and perfected , then there remained nothing but to bring it in a frame together, aad rear up the Tabernacle , as it was to stand ] according to its manner , which hath been shewed thee on the Mount.
\p
\v 31 After that , thou shalt make a Vail [ This Vail was instead of a seperation, or partition – wall, betwixt the Holy place, and the most Holy, or Holy of Holies , into which only the High Priest might enter once a year ; and this is the Vail, which the Apostle , Heb. 9.3.doth call the second Vail . There was another Vail , at the door or entrance of the Tabernacle . See likewise Lev.4.6.] of sky-colour , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twinned linnen ; they [ or he, viz. Bezaleel, or the master workman ] shall make it of the most artificial work with Cherubims . [See Gen. 3.24.]
\p
\v 32 And shalt hang [Heb. give , and so ver. 33.] it on four pillars [ i.e. on the hooks which shall be fastned to the pillars ] of Sittim-(wood) over-laid with gold ; their books shall be of gold ; standing on four silver feet .
\p
\v 33 And thou shalt hang the Vail under the hooks , [ whereof see verse 6.] and thou shalt bring the Ark of the Testimony [ See above ch.25.16.] thither , within the Vail; and this Vail shall make a seperation unto you , betwixt the Holy, and betwixt the Holy of Holies .[ Heb. holiness , (and ) Holiness of Holiness, and so in the next verse . The Vail was perculiarly made for this end, to keep men out , and hinder their going in , yea, and very looking into the most holy place , where the Ark was , Exod.40.3. See likewise Heb. 6.8.]
\p
\v 34 And thou shalt put the Expiation – cover upon the Ark of the Testimony , in the Holy of Holies .
\p
\v 35 The Tables now [ Understand the table whereon the Shew-bread was to lie ] thu shalt set without the Vail, [viz. into the holy place , where the Priests administred ] and the Candlestick over against the Table , on the one side of the Tabernacle , South-wards ; but the Table thou shalt set on the North-side .
\p
\v 36 Thou shalt likewise make a cover at the door of the Tent , [ This was at the entrance of the door , yea it was in a manner the door it self at the entry of the Tabernacle , before it , where the Priests went daily in and out , to serve and administer within the holy place ; but the people might not enter therein , Heb.9.2,6.] of the skie colour , and purple, and skarlet , and fine twined linnen,embroidred work.
\p
\v 37 And for this cover , thou shalt make five pillars of Sittim-(wood ), and over-lay them with gold , [not that they were to be over-laid with gold all over but only the Chapiters and the fillets thereof , Exod.36.38.] their hooks shall be of gold : and thou shalt cast five copper feet for them.
\c 27
\s The Copper (or, brazen) Altar for burnt- offering with its furniture , v.1, etc. the Court of the Tabernacle , 9. the measure of the Court, 18. oyl for the lamps of the Candlestickk, which the Priests daily lighted, 20.
\p
\v 1 Thou shalt likewise make an Altar of Sittim-wood : five ells shall be the length , and five ells the breadth , ( this Altar shall be four square ) [ viz. For its length and breadth, but the height of it was but three cubits ] and three ells the height thereof .
\p
\v 2 And thou shalt make his horns [These horns served not only for an ornament to the Altar , but likewise as it seemeth , to keep things laid upon it , from falling down] on his four corners ; his horns shall be out of him (self ;) [ i.e.out of the same piece , not pieced , nor joined together ; this phrase occurs often in this Relation ] and thou shalt over-lay him with copper . [ this Altar was so covered with copper all over , both without and within , that there was no wood to be seen about it , for to be and remain the more free and safe from the fire upon it.]
\p
\v 3 Thou shalt likewise make pots for him, for to receive his ashes ; also his shovels [or, spades , oth. Besoms ] and his sprinkling basons , [therein to receive the bloud of the burnt offerings , and to make the sprinklings with it] and his flesh-hooks , [or, forks, instruments with teeth , fit for to take up the flesh out of the pots , as 1 Samuel 2.13, 14.] and his chafing-dishes : all his furniture thou shalt make a copper . [ Heb. to , ( or, for) all his vessels thou shalt make (or, prepare ) copper.]
\p
\v 4 Thou shalt make him a grate of copper net-work, [This was a broad copper plate, with many small holes in it , for the bloud , and the ashes and small coals , or the like , to pass easily through ; and this was the hearth of the Altar , whereon the fire was laid to burn ]and on that net thou shalt make four copper rings , at his four ends .
\p
\v 5 And thou shalt lay it on under the circumference of the Altar from beneath : so that the net be to the midst of the Altar.
\p
\v 6 Thou shalt likewise make hand -bars for the Altar ; hand-bars of Sittim-wood : and thou shalt over-lay them with copper.
\p
\v 7 And the hand-bars shall be put into the rings : so that the hand-bars be on both sides of the Altar, when they carry him .
\p
\v 8 Thou shalt make him hollow of planks , according as he [ viz. The LORD] hath shewed thee upon the Mount, so they shall do. [viz. Master-workmen, or, artificers.]
\p
\v 9 Thou shalt likewise make the Court of the Tabernacle : [ This was an open place to which the people daily resorted , to offer sacrifice , and to exercise the publique worship , Psalm 100. 4. and 116. 17,18,19. ] at the South corner South-wards , there shall be hangings at the Court , of fine twined linnen ; the length of one side shall be an hundred ells .
\p
\v 10 Also his [ viz. the Courts ] twenty pillars [These pillars served to fasten the hangings there with silver hooks ; as also for ornament . Exod. 38.17, 19. it is said that their Heads or Chapiters were silvered over .] and the twenty feet thereof , shall be of copper : the books of these pillars and their fillets shall be of silver .
\p
\v 11 So the hangings of the North-corner , shall likewise be an hundred ells (long) : and the twenty pillars thereof , and twenty feet thereof , of copper : e hooks of the pillars and fillets thereof shall be of silver .
\p
\v 12 And in the breadth of the Court , on the West-corner, [ Heb. at the Sea-side , or, on the side of the Sea ; see Gen. 12.8. ] there shall be hangings of fifty ells : their pillars , ten ; and their feet, ten.
\p
\v 13 In the like manner the breadth of the Court on the East-corner East-wards , shall be of fifty ells .
\p
\v 14 So that there shall be fifteen ells of the hangings , on ( the one ) side, [ Heb. shoulder : understand here , and in the next verse the sides of the Court ] their pillars three , and their feet three.
\p
\v 15 And fifteen els of the hangings on the other side ; their pillars three , and their feet three .
\p
\v 16 In the gate now of the Court there shall be a corner of twenty els, skie-colour , and purple and scarlet , and fine twined linnen , embroidered work : their pillars four , and their feet four .
\p
\v 17 All the pillars of the Court shall be compassed round about with their fillets : their hooks shall be silver , but their feet shall be copper .
\p
\v 18 The length of the Court shall be an hundred ells , and the breadth throughout fifty , [ heb. fifty and fifty, i.e. fifty on each side .] and the height five ells , [ half the height of the Tabernacle , Exod. 26.16. ] of five twined linnen : but their [ viz. the pillars ] feet shall be copper .
\p
\v 19 As for all the furniture of the Tabernacle in all the service of it : yea all the pins thereof [ or nailes , serving to fasten and close the whole frame , and all the parts thereof compleately together .] and all the pins of the Court shall be of copper.
\p
\v 20 Now thou shalt charge the children of Israel, that they bring thee [Heb. take thee . i.e. take and bring .See Gen.12. v. 15.] pure oyl of Olives , beaten, for the Candlestick , [ whereon there were seven burning lamps or lights , Exod.25.37.] to light (or, kindle) the lamps continually.
\p
\v 21 In the Tent of the Congregation from without the vail , which is before the Testimony [ i.e. before the Ark of the Testimony .] Aaron and his Sonnes shall prepare the same , from the evening to the morning before the face of the LORD : This shall be a perpetuall institution for their Generations , because of the children of Israel.
\c 28
\s Aaron and his Sons are ordained for the High-Priests office , v.1. etc. their holy attire, 2. the Ephod , 6. the curious girdle , 8.two Sardonix stones , on which the names of the sons of Israel were engraven , 9. The breast-plate woth twelve precious stones in it, whereon the names of the twelve Sonnes of Israel were engraven 15. golden chains at the breast-plate , 22. and golden rings on them , 23. The Urim and Thummim , 30. The cloak of the Ephod , 31. the golden plate whereon was engraven , THE HOLINES OF THE LORD , 36 the Coat full of eyes ; the Hat , the Girdle , the Coat of Aarons Sons , their Girdles and Caps , and their linnen drawers , 39, etc. These garments Aaron and his Sonnes were to put on , when they served in the Holy place. 41.
\p
\v 1 After that [ viz. When the Tabernacle and furniture thereof shall be made ready and accomplished ] thou shalt cause Aaron thy brother, and his Sonnes, to draw near unto thee , out of the midst of the children of Israel , for to administer the Priestly office unto me : namely, Aaron , Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, the Sonnes of Aaron .
\p
\v 2 And thou shalt make holy Garments for thy brother Aaron : [ i.e. such Garments as he shall put on and wear , when he goeth about to administer his Priestly office in the Sanctuary . Heb. cloathes of holiness.] for Glory and for Ornament .
\p
\v 3 Thou shalt speak likewise to all that are wise of heart, [ See Job 9.4.] whom I have filled with spirit of wisdome ; that they make garments for Aaron to sanctifie him, that he may administer the Priestly office unto me .
\p
\v 4 These now are the Garments which they shall make : A breast-plate ( or, stomacher ) and an Ephod, [ or body-coat , wast-coat , see above chapter 25.7.] and a cloak [ or , upper-vest , upper-garment , whereon the bels hung , see verse 32.] and a Coat full of eyes , [ understand curiously wrought with imbellishments , in fashion of eyes . This is held to be the under-coat , being longer then the former and upper , termed cloak here .] a hat , [ this was a cover which was as it were wound round about the head , after the manner of the Turkish Turbands or Tulibands ; it was the head-cover and ornament for Kings and Priests .] and girdle : then theyn shall make holy garments , for thy brother Aaron and his Sonnes , to administer the Priestly office unto me.
\p
\v 5 They [ viz. the wise men , or skilfull artificers , spoken of verse 3.] shall likewise take that gold ; [ which the children of Israel shall have freely brought in , whereof mention is made above chapter 25. ] and sky-colour , and purple , scarlet, and fine linnen.
\p
\v 6 And shall make the Ephod of gold , [ The golden Ephod was onely to be worn by the High Priest ; but there were likewise Ephods made of linnen , which other Priests and other people also did wear . See 1 Samuel 22. 18. and chapter 2.18. and 2 Sam. 6.14.] skie-colour, and purple , scarlet, and fine twined linnen , and most artificial work.
\p
\v 7 It shall have two joyning shoulder- bands on both ends thereof , whereby it may be joyned together.
\p
\v 8 And the artificial girdle of his Ephod [ viz. Whereby the Ephod was to be girded about . Whether this Ephod did hang from the shoulder both before and behind down to the loins , and under this girdle ; or else , whether it hung onely back-ward , down to the girdle , or upon , or over it : or, whether being open before and behinde , and fastned to the shoulders , it hung from the loins down to the feet ; Opinions do much vary : Yet the later is embraced by the most learned Hebrew Rabbies ] which is upon him , shall be like its work , of the same , [ stuffe, viz. Whereof the Ephod is made . Oth.out of it , i.e. of the very same piece ] of gold , sky- colour, and purple , and scarlet , and fine-twined linnen.
\p
\v 9 And thou shalt take two sardonix-stones , and engrave the names of the Sons of Israel theron.
\p
\v 10 Six of their names upon the one stone ; and the six remaining names upon the other stone . According to their births .
\p
\v 11 According to (the) Engravers work, as the seals are graven , [ Heb. the graving of a seal ] so shalt thou engrave these two stones , [ i.e. as neatly and compleately as may be done by the art man ]with the names of the Sons of Israel : thou shalt make them to be compassed about in the ouches of gold . [ thus the concavities , or hollow places are called , in rings , or jewels , wherein precious stones use to be set for to e seen .]
\p
\v 12 And thou shalt set two stones on the shoulder-bands of the Ephod, being stones for Remembrance , to the children of Israel : and Aaron shall bear their names on both his shoulders , for remembrance before the face of the LORD. [The sense of these words is , that Aaron standing before God with these stones upon his shoulders , it would make God , as it were , still minde-full of the children of Israel.]
\p
\v 13 thou shalt likewise make ouches of gold .
\p
\v 14 And two small chains of pure gold ; a-like-ending thou shalt make them , [ i.e. of a like size and length ; and so below , verse 22.] turned work , [ oth.wreathed, or wrested work ] and the turned (or wreathed) chains thou shalt fasten to the ouches .
\p
\v 15 Thou shalt likewise make a Breast-plate of Judgememt, [ Thus called, because the High Priest put it on , when there fell out any thing of great weight and concernment ,which withal was very doubtful and difficult , for to ask Gods advice and direction in the same ] of most artificial work , like the work of the Ephod shalt thou make it ; of gold , sky-colour , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linnen shalt thou make the same.
\p
\v 16 It shall be four -square , and doubled : a span shall be its length , and a span its breadth .
\p
\v 17 And thou shalt fill filling stones therein ; four rowes of stones : one rowe [ i.e. The first, as Gen. ch.1.5. And chapter 22,11.] of a Sardis , [ about the interpreting of names of these stones the most Learned Translators differ much ; we followed the most and chiefest , both ancient and modern ] a Topaz, and Carbuncle ; this is the first row .
\p
\v 18 And the second Row, of an Emerald , a Saphir , and a Diamond .
\p
\v 19 And the third Row , of Hiacinth , Agat and Amethist .
\p
\v 20 And the fourth row of a Turkois , and a Sardonix , and a Jasper . [ The Hebrew names of all these twelve stones stand thus ; 1. row. Odem , Pitda , Bareketh . 2. row. Nopheth, Sappir , Jahalem. 3. row. Leschem , Schebo, Achlamah. 4. row. Tarschish , Schoham , Jaspe ] they shall be encompassed with gold in their fillings . [ i.e. in the ouches wherein they shall be set. Compare above chapter 25. on verse 7. ]
\p
\v 21 and these stones shall be with the twelve names of the sons of Israel, by their names ; they shall be engraven like seals , each one with his name ; they shall be for the twelve Tribes .
\p
\v 22 Thou shalt likewise make for the breast-plate little chains alike-ending of turned ( or, wreathed ) work, of pure gold .
\p
\v 23 Thou shalt likewise make two golden rings on the breast-plate , and thou shalt set the two rings on the two ends of the breast-plate.
\p
\v 24 Then thou shalt put the two turned golden ( chains ) into the two rings , on the ends of the breast-plate .
\p
\v 25 But the two end of the two turned (chains ) [Hebr. of both the turnings , or , wreathings , wreaths ] thou shalt put the two ouches , and thou shalt set them on the shoulder-bands of the Ephod , right upon the fore-most side [ Heb. face] of the same.
\p
\v 26 Thou shalt make two golden rings yet , and shalt set them on the two ends of the breast-plate ; inwardly on the edge [ Heb. lip] thereof, which shall be at the side of the Ephod .
\p
\v 27 Yet shalt thou make two golden rings , which thou shalt set on the two shoulder-bands of the Ephod , beneath , of the fore-most side , over against its jointure [ or, joining together ] above the artificial girdle of the Ephod.
\p
\v 28 And they shall tie the breast-plate with its rings to the rings of the Ephod upwards ; with a sky – colour string , that it may be upon the rtificial girdle of the Ephod : and the breast-plate shall not be seperated from the Ephod .
\p
\v 29 Thus Aaron shall bear the names of the sons of Israel on the breast-plate of Judgement , upon his heart , wherein he is to go into the holy (place) , for ( a) remembrance before the face of the LORD continually.
\p
\v 30 Thou shalt likewise set the Urim and Thummim [ these words might be rendred , lights and perfections : God was pleased with them to impart his clear and perfect answers to the high Priest : Nevertheless what they were , is uncertain . We read no where , that god commanded Moseh to make the same, muvh less how and whereof they were made . Compare Lev.8.8.] into the breast-plate , that they may be upon the heart of Aaron , where he is to go in before the face of the LORD : thus Aaron shall bear that Judgement of the children of Israel upon his heart continually, before the face of the LORD.
\p
\v 31 Thou shalt likewise make the cloak of the Ephod , [ To wit the cloak, or coat , which was to be worn under the Ephod] altogether of sky-colour .
\p
\v 32 And the top-hole of it, [ i.e. The open place above , whereby it was to pass the Priests head , to hang or sit on his shoulder . Heb. the mouth of its head ] shall be in the midst thereof : this hole shall have a seam round about of woven work: as the hole of a coat of male shall it be thereon , that it may not be rent . [ it, viz. the hole, others make it relate to the Ephod.]
\p
\v 33 And on its seams thou shalt make pome-granates , of sky-colour, and of purple, and of scarlet , on its seams round about : and golden bells round about betwixt them . [ Oth. in the midst of them .]
\p
\v 34 That there be a golden bell, after that a pomegranate ; ( again ) a golden bell and pomegranat : on the seams of the cloak round about .
\p
\v 35 And Aaron shall have the same on for to serve : that his sound may be heard , [ Understand the sound or noise of his bells ] when he goeth into the Holy ( place) before the face of the LORD , and when he goeth forth , that he die not. [ to wit, being smitten by the LORD .]
\p
\v 36 moreover thou shalt make a plate [ Heb. a flower , which is fair in the eye ] of pure gold , and thou shalt engrave thereon , as they grave the seals ; { heb. with the graving of a seal ] THE HOLINES OF THE LORD. [ oth. Holines to the LORD.]
\p
\v 37 And thou shalt fasten the same with a sky-colour string , so that it be on the hat ; [See above verse 4.] it shall be on the foremost part of the hat .
\p
\v 38 And it shall be on the fore-head of Aaron , that Aaron may bear [ i.e. bearing , remove , or take away ] the unrighteousness of the holy things , which the children of Israel shall have hallowed , in all the gifts of their hallowed things ; [ here Aaron is a type of Christ , who by his own Holiness hath taken away the sins of his people , which they do frequently commit , even in their most holy acts and services , John 1. 29. and 2 Cor.5.19. and 1 John 2.1.] and it shall be upon his head continually ; [understand whensoever the high Priest was to wear his hat , serving and adminstring his office] for to make them acceptable before the face of the LORD.
\p
\v 39 Thou shalt likewise make a coat full of eye-lets , of fine linnen ; also the hat thou shalt make of fine linnen ; but the girdle thou shalt make of embroidered work.
\p
\v 40 Unto the sons of Aaron , thou shalt likewise make coats , [ viz. Of fine linnen , as those of the high Priest were , Exod. 39.27. understand this likewise of their hats, caps, or bonnets which were not much different from the high Priests] and thou shalt make them girdles ; thou shalt make them caps also [ or, raised caps , which were bound to , or wound about the head , Lev.8.13.] for glory and ornament .
\p
\v 41 And thou shalt draw them on to thy brother Aaron , and his sons also ; [ Heb. with him ] and thou shalt annoint them , [ viz. with the holy oyl, which God commanded to be made . See Exod. 30.23. and 29.7. ]and fill their hand , [ see Lev. 8.33.] and hallow them, that they administer unto me the Priests office .
\p
\v 42 Make them likewise linnen drawers , to cover the flesh of the shame ; [ or , nakedness ] they shall be from the loins to the thighs.
\p
\v 43 Aaron now and his sons shall have them on , [ Heb. And they shall be upon Aaron and upon his sons ] when they go into the Tent of the Congregation ; or when they shall step to the Altar , for to serve in the holy (place) , that they may bear no iniquity [ i.e. no punishment of , or for iniquity , See Lev. 5.1.] and die : ( This ) shall be an everlasting Institution to him , and to his seed after him.
\c 29
\s Of the consecration of Aaron and his sons , v.1.etc. how the bullock of the sin-offering was to be offered , 10. and the one ram of the burnt-offerings , 15. also the other ram for the hallowing of the Priests , 19. Aaron and his sons did eat the flesh of the ram , wherewith they were consecrated , 32. The Altar was to be expiated for the space of seven days , 36. Two Lambs were daily to be offered for burnt-offering , 38. God promiseth to hallow the Tabernacle , and Aaron likewise with his sons , 44. and to dwell in the midst of the children of Israel , 45.
\p
\v 1 This now is the thing, which thou shalt do for to hallow them , that they may administer ( or serve ) the Priests office unto me : Take one bullock , a young one , and two perfect Rams : [ See Exod. 12.5.]
\p
\v 2 And unleavened bread , and unleavened cakes , mixed with oil , and unleavened waifers , rubbed over with oil : [ Understand here , oil of olives ] of wheat-flower shalt thou make the same .
\p
\v 3 And thou shalt put them into one basket , and shalt bring them on [ Or, offer them ] in the basket with the bullock, and with the two rams .
\p
\v 4 Then shalt thou make Aaron and his sons to approach to the door of the Tent of the Congregation : and tho shalt wash them with water . [ viz. of the holy Laver , Exod.30.18.]
\p
\v 5 After that thou shalt take the garments, [ To wit, the holy or hallowed garments , spoken of before , chapter 28. ] and put on Aaron the coat and cloak of the Ephod , and the ephod and the breast-plate : and thou shalt gird him about, with the artificial girdle of the Ephod .
\p
\v 6 And thou shalt set the hat upon his head : the crown of holiness thou shalt set on the hat . [ The Hebrew word rendred Crown here , viz. Nezer , doth properly signifie seperation, setting apart. This crown is called thus , because the same was a token of seperating Aaron from all other men ; and therefore the Crown of Kings is called Nezer, 2 Sam.1.10. And Psalm 89.40. Here it is the ornament of the high Priest , to shew his dignity , exod.28.36. Lev. 8.9. it doth appear, that the Plate were mentioned , and this Crown , are one and the same thing .]
\p
\v 7 And thou shalt take the anointing oil , whereof see below, Exod. 30.23. ] and pour it upon his head : [ that it may run down by his beard , Psalm 133.2.] thus shalt thou anoint him
\p
\v 8 Then thou shalt cause his sons to approach, and thou shalt make them put on the coats .
\p
\v 9 And thou shalt gird them with the girdle , ( namely) Aaron and his sons , and thou shalt binde them on the caps, that they may have the Priesthood , for an everlasting institution . [ i.e. until the Messiah his coming : for then Aarons service together with all the ceremonies were finished ] Moreover thou shalt fill the hand of Aaron , and the hand of his sons . [See Lev. 7. on 37. and Lev. 8. from verse 22. to 35.]
\p
\v 10 and thou shalt bring the bullock near before the Tent of the Cogregation : and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands [ Heb. lean with their hands] upon the bullocks head .
\p
\v 11 and thou shalt slay the bullock before the face of the LORD , [ See Lev. 1. verse 3. ] before [ or, by] the door of the Tent of the Congregation .
\p
\v 12 Thus thou shalt take of the bloud of the bullock, and with the fingure do (it) upon the horns of the Altar, and all the bloud [ i.e. all the rest of the bloud , also below , verse 10.] thou shalt pour forth on the bottomes of the Altar . [ where there was a sink or hole , through which it ran away .]
\p
\v 13 Thou shalt likewise take all the fat which covers the bowels , and the cawl over the liver , and both the kidneys , and the fat which is thereon : and thou shalt kindle the same ( or, make it to smoak) upon the Altar .
\p
\v 14 But the flesh of the bullock , and his skin , and his dung , thou shalt burn with fire , without the Camp : it is a sin-offering .
\p
\v 15 Then thou shalt take the one ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their bands on the rams head :
\p
\v 16 And thou shalt slay the ram : and thou shalt take his bloud , and sprinkle round about the Altar.
\p
\v 17 And thou shalt divide that ram into his parts , [ or, cut him into his pieces , viz. after that his skin shall be fleaed off, Lev.1.6.] and thou shalt wash his intrals , and his legs, and lay (them) upon his parts, and upon his head
\p
\v 18 Thus shalt thou kindle the whole ram upon the Altar : it is a burnt – offering to the LORD, for a pleasant smell ; it is a fire-offering to the LORD.[ It is a sacrifice , which is wholly to be consumed by fire, see Lev.1.9.]
\p
\v 19 After that , thou shalt take the other ram : and Aaron and his sons shalllay their hands upon the rams head .
\p
\v 20 And thou shalt slay the ram , and take of his bloud , and do (it) upon the (right ) ear-tip of Aaron , and upon the right ear-tips of his sons ; (as) also upon the thumb of their right hand , and upon the great toe of their right foot ; and that bloud [ see above verse 12.] thou shalt sprinkle upon the Altar round about (it).
\p
\v 21 Then thou shalt take of the bloud that is upon the Altar , and of the anointing oil, [described ; Exod.30.22.] and thou shalt sprinkle upon Aaron , and upon his garments , and upon his sons , and upon the garments of his sons with him ; that he may be hallowed , and his garments , likewise his sons , and his sons garments with him .
\p
\v 22 After that thou shalt take the fat from the ram, together with the tail ; also the fat which covereth the entrails, and the cawl of the liver , [i.e. that which is upon, or over the liver , as above, verse 13.] and both the kidneys , with the fat that is on them , and the right shoulder ; for it is a ram of the fill-offerings . [ Heb. of the fillings , replenishings , and so in the sequel ; see Lev. 7.37.]
\p
\v 23 And one loaf of bread , and one cake of oiled bread , [ i.e. tempered with oil ] and one waifer ; out of the basket of unleavened ( bread) which shall be before the face of the LORD.
\p
\v 24 And lay them all upon the hands of Aaron , and upon the hands of his sons : and wave them for (a) wave- offering [ see Lev.7.30.] before the face of the LORD.
\p
\v 25 After that take them off their band , and kindle them upon the Altar . [ Or, beside , by the Altar.] upon the burnt-offering , for a pleasant smell before the face of the LORD ; it is a fire-offering to the LORD. [see above, verse 18.]
\p
\v 26 And take the breast of the ram of the fill-offerings , which is Aarons , [ i.e. shall serve for his consecration ] and wave it for a wave-offering before the face of the LORD : and it shall be for a part to thee . [viz. for Moseh. See Lev. 8.29.]
\p
\v 27 And thou shalt hallow the breast of the wave offering , [ See Lev.7. On verse 30.] and the shoulder of the heave-offerings , [ see Exodus 25.2.] which shall be waved , and which is heaved up, of the ram of the fill-offering , of that which is Aarons , and of that which is of his sons.
\p
\v 28 And it shall be Aarons and his sons , for an everlasting institution ; because of the children of Israel, [ i.e. that which shall be offered ( in this kinde ) by the children of Israel , shall belong to Aaron and his sons ] for it is a heave-offering : and the heave -offering because of the children of Israel, shall be of their thank-offerings ; their heave-offering shall be for the LORD.
\p
\v 29 Now the holy garments [ Whatever it is used for the service of God , is called holy] which shall have been Aarons , shall be his sons [ understand one of his sons , to wit , his, who shall be high Priest unto him ] after him, [ i.e. after his decease and death] that they may be anointed therein , and that their hand may be filled [ i.e. that that they may be consecrated , as verse 22.] in the same .
\p
\v 30 Seven days shall be of his sons , that shall be Priest after him, [ viz. high Priest ] put them on in his stead : [ understand that the successour was to wear these garments seven days , one after the other ; ther being so many days required for his Consecration. See v. 35.] who shall go into the Tent of the Congregation for to serve in the holy (place).
\p
\v 31 Thou shalt take the rams of the fillings , and thou shalt boil his flesh in the holy place , [ to wit, at the door of the Tent of the Congregation , as it is set down verse 32. and Lev. 8. 31. here everyone might come in, and those that offered the sacrifice , did eat their part .]
\p
\v 32 Aaron now and his sons shall eat this rams flesh , and the bread that shall be in the basket , at the door of the Tent of the Congregation .
\p
\v 33 And they shall eat those things wherewith the expiation shall be made, for to fill their hand , ( and ) to hallow them ; but a stranger [ viz. any one that is not of the progeny or poeterity of Aaron ; the Levites themselves were not allowed to eat thereof. See Lev. 10.14.] shall not eat the same ; for they are holy . [ i.e. holy food, consecrated to God . Heb. Holiness.]
\p
\v 34 And if there shall remain ( ought) over the flesh of the fill-offerings , or of this bread , until the morning ; then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire : it shall not be eaten , [ The Priests themselves might not eat of such remainders ] for it is holy.
\p
\v 35 Thus then thou shalt do to Aaron to his sons , according to all that I commanded thee ; seven days shalt thou fill their hand .
\p
\v 36 Thou shalt likewise prepare a bullock of sin-offering a day, for the propitiation , and thou shalt un-sin ( or, expiate , cleanse , mundifie ) the Altar , or thou shalt make expiation for the Altar , with the sin-offering ; see further , Lev.8. On verse 15.] by making the expiation over the same : and thou shalt anoint it for to hallow it .
\p
\v 37 Seven days shalt thou make expiation for the Altar, and shalt hallow it , [ viz. with the holy oil ] then shall the Altar be a Holiness of Holinesses, [ as being not only hallowed it self , but hallowing likewise the gifts offered on it ; and in this regard the Altar was greater then the Sacrifice , as Christ testifieth , Matth. 23. 19.] all that [oth. all who , or whosoever , and so below , chapter 30. on verse 29.] toucheth the Altar, shall be holy .[ to wit , Ceremonially.]
\p
\v 38 This now is it that thou shalt prepare upon the Altar ; two lambs a day which are a year old , continually.
\p
\v 39 The one lamb thou shalt prepare ; [ viz. for to be offered or sacrificed ] but the other lamb thou shalt prepare betwixt the two evenings .[See Exodus 12 verse 6.]
\p
\v 40 With a tenth part of [ viz. of an Epha, i.ewith a Gomer : see Exod. 16.36.] meal-flower, mixt with a fourth part of a Hin [ as much as eighteen Hen-egg-shells do contain ] of beaten oil , see above chap.27.20.] and for drink-offering , a fourth part of a Hinof wine for the one lamb .
\p
\v 41 The other lamb now thou shalt prepare betwixt two evenings ; thou shalt do therewith as with the morning meat- offering , and as with the drink-offering of the same , for a pleasant smell, it is a fire-offering to the LORD.
\p
\v 42 It shall be a continual fire-offering with your generations , at the door of the Tent of the Congregation , [ Here stood the Altar for burnt offerings , Exod.40.29.] before the face of the LORD : there I shall come ( together) with you, to speak with you there.
\p
\v 43 And there i shall come ( together) to the children of Israel ; that they [ Heb. he, i.e. every one of them ; or, the people of Israel ] may be hallowed through my glory .
\p
\v 44 And I will hallow the Tent of the Congregation , [To wit, by my glorious presence and apparition ] together with the Altar : I will likewise hallow Aaron and his sons , that they may administer the Priests office unto me .
\p
\v 45 And I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel : and i will be a God unto them.
\p
\v 46 And they shall know that I am the LORD their god, that hath carried them forth out of the land of Egypt , that I might dwell in the midst of them : I am the LORD their God.

\p
\v 1 Thou shalt likewise make an Incense -Altar ( for ) Incense : [ For fo kindle daily Incense upon it . This Altar stood in the fore-most part of the Tabernacle , before the vail .It was indeed perculiarly made for the Incense ; yet sometimes there was also expiation made upon it with bloud , as appears, below verse 10. and Lev.4.7. ] of Sittim-wood shalt thou make it.
\p
\v 2 An ell shall be the length of it , and an ell its breadth ( it shall be four square ) but two ells the height thereof : out of the same shall be his horns .
\p
\v 3 And thou shalt over-lay it with pure gold, [Numb.4.11. It is called the golden Altar , but Ezek.41.22. the wooden Altar ] its roof and the walls [ i.e. the sides ; for as by the roof is understood the cover or upper-plank of the Altar , where the Incense was set , so by the walls here must be understood the sides of this Altar ] thereof round about , as also its horns ; and thou shalt make it a golden garland round about .
\p
\v 4 Thou shalt likewise make two golden rings thereon , underneath its garland ; on the two sides thereof shalt thou make the same , on both sides thereof ; and they shall be places for the hand-bars ; [ i.e. to put them through those rings ; to wit, when the Tabernacle was to be removed , or brought to another place , Num.4.5,11,15.] that they may carry it [ viz.the Altar ] thereby.
\p
\v 5 The bearing-bars now thou shalt make of Sittim-wood ; and thou shalt over-lay them with gold .
\p
\v 6 And thou shalt set it before the Vail , that shall be before the Ark of the Testimony , [This Vail was a partition betwixt the place where the Priests officiated and the Holy of Holies where the Ark stood ] before the expiation-cover , which shall be above the Testimony , whether I shall come together with thee .
\p
\v 7 And Aaron shall kindle [ Heb. cause to smoak ] sweet-smelling spiceries , every morning , [ Heb. in the morning , in the morning ] when he shall have well prepared the Lamps , he shall kindle the same .
\p
\v 8 And when Aaron shall kindle the Lamps betwixt the two evenings , he shall kindle that : [ viz. the Incense ] it shall be a continual Incense , [ or, perfuming , smoaking ] before the face of the LORD with your Generations.
\p
\v 9 Ye shall kindle no strange Incense [ i.e. brought from any place else, or prepared otherwise then is appointed , verse 34,35, and 36.] upon the same ; neither burnt-offering , nor meat-offering : [ for the burnt-offering or meat-offering , the Altar was ordained ; whereof mention was made , Exod. 27.1.] also ye shall pour no drink-offering thereon .
\p
\v 10 And Aaron shall once a year [ viz. on the tenth day of the seventh moneth , which is therefore called the day of expiation , Lev.23.27.] make expiation [ or, the expiation ] over the horns of the same , with the bloud of the sin-offering of the expiations : [ i.e. of the sin-offering whereby the expiation is made ] once in the year shall he make expiation thereupon by ( or in ) your Generations : it is the Holiness of Holinesses to the LORD.
\p
\v 11 Moreover the LORD spake to Moseh , saying ;
\p
\v 12 When thou shalt take up the sum [ Heb. the head] of the children of Israel , according to the numbred ( among ) them ; [ i.e. according to those which of them are to be numbred ] then everyone shall give [ viz. once for all, not yearly, or every year ] the expiation [ i.e. the price whereby every one saved his life ] of his soul [ i.e. of his life, or of his person , and so in the sequel ] to the LORD, when thou shalt sell them ; that there may be no plague among them, when thou shalt tell them .
\p
\v 13 This they shall give every one that passeth over to the numbred [ viz. from them which are to be numbred , unto those which are numbred ] the moity of a shekel , according to the shekel of the Sanctuary , [ of the value whereof , see Gen. 20.16.] ( this sikel is twenty Gera ) [ se Lev.2.7.25.] the moity of a shekel is an heave-offering to the LORD.
\p
\v 14 Every one that passeth over to the numbred , from twenty year old [ Heb. a son of twenty year ; i.e. entring into his twentieth year : what sum this numbring of men did mount unto, see Exod. 38.25,26.] and upwards , shall give the heave-offering of the LORD.
\p
\v 15 The rich shall not enlarge , and the poor shall not deminish of the moity of the shekel, when ye give the heave-offering of the LORD , to make expiation for your souls.
\p
\v 16 Then thou shalt take the money of the expiations from the children of Israel , and shall lay it (up) for the Service of the Tent of the Congregation , [ Or , for the work, or, furniture , etc.see below, chapter 38.27,28.] and it shall be for (a ) remembrance to the children of Israel , before the face of the LORD , to make expiation for your souls .
\p
\v 17 And the LORD spake to Moseh, saying ;
\p
\v 18 Thou shalt likewise make a copper laver , [ This was made of the womens looking-glasses, Exod. 38.8.] with its copper foot , for to wash : and thou shalt set it betwixt the Tent of the Congregation , and betwixt the Altar, [ viz. the Altar of burnt-offerings , mentioned above chap.27.] and thou shalt put water into it .
\p
\v 19 that Aaron and his sons may wash themselves out of it , their hands and their feet .
\p
\v 20 When they are to go into the Tent of the Congregation , they shall wash themselves with water , that they die not : [ i.e. lest God put them to death, as afterwards he did the sons of Aaron , Lev.10.1,2.] or when they approach to the Altar , for to serve , kindling the fire-offering to the LORD.
\p
\v 21 Then shall they wash their hands and their feet , that they die not : and this shall be an everlasting institution to him [ viz. to Aaron ] and his seed, by their generations .
\p
\v 22 Moreover the LORD spake to Moseh, saying ;
\p
\v 23 Take thee now the principallest spiceries, [ Hebr. Head-spiceries ; i.e. of the very best and principal sorts, so also Cant. 4.14. Ezek. 27.22.] the purest myrrhe [ Heb. myrrhe of freedome , i.e. upright , and unsophisticated ; free and clear of all impurity . It is a gum, flowing forth out of the myrrhe-tree, the most excellent of all other gums ] five hundred (shekels ) [ i.e. the weight of so many ] and spice-cynamon half so much, [Heb. the moity of that , viz. of the five hundred shekels ] ( namely) two hundred and fifty (shekels ) also spice-calmus two hundred and fifty ( shekels).
\p
\v 24 Likewise Cassia, five hundred , according to the shekel of the Sanctuary : and oil of Olive trees of Hin. [See Lev. 19.36.]
\p
\v 25 And make thereof an oil of holy ointment , an ointment very artificially made , according to Apothecaries work : [ Oth. Oil-preparers , ointment-makers , see 1 Chron.19.30.] it shall be an oil of holy anointing .
\p
\v 26 And with the same thou shalt anoint the Tent of the Congregation , and the Ark of the Testimony.
\p
\v 27 And the Table with all the furniture thereof , and the Candlestick with his furniture , and the Incense Altar :
\p
\v 28 And the Altar of the burnt-offering , with all his furniture , and the laver with its foot.
\p
\v 29 thou shalt so hallow them [ viz. by or with the oil spoken of before , verse 23,24,25.]that they may be the Holiness of Holinesses : all that toucheth them shall be holy.
\p
\v 30 Thou shalt likewise anoint Aaron and his sons : and thou shalt hallow them, [viz. by anointing them the holy oil] for to administer unto me the Priests office.
\p
\v 31 And thou shalt speak to the children of Israel , saying : This shall be an oil of holy anointing unto one by your generations .
\p
\v 32 It shall be poured on no mans flesh ; [ To wit, besides the bodies of Aaron , and his sons , and their posterity ] thou shalt likewise make none the like, according to the making thereof : it is Holiness , it shall be Holiness unto you .
\p
\v 33 That man that shall make such an ointment at this , or that puts of it upon any strange (thing) [Oth. any stranger] the same shall be destroyed out of his people .
\p
\v 34 Moreover the LORD said to Moseh, Take unto thee the sweet smelling spices, Juice and Myrrhe, [ Or, Balm-drop] and Onycha, [ a sort of spices used in perfumings ] and Galban ; (these sweet smelling spices , and pure frankincense : let each be apart . [ Heb. that alone be alone ; i.e.every ingredient , is to be beaten apart without being intermixt with any other liquid matter , and being pure thus , to be mixed together afterwards into one mass.]
\p
\v 35 And thou shalt make [Moseh namely , who made the first] an incense of ointment thereof , according to the work of the Apothecary , mixed, [ Oth. salted, or tempered] pure, holy.
\p
\v 36 And of the same thou shalt beat very small pouder , and thereof thou shalt lay before the Testimony [ i.e. upon the Incense-Altar, that stood before the Ark of the Testimony ] whither I shall come upon thee : it shall be Holiness of Holinesses unto you.
\p
\v 37 Yet according to the making of this Incense, which thou shalt have made, you shall make none of yourselves , it shall be Holiness to you , [ viz. to both Priest and people ] for the LORD. [i.e . for the service of the LORD.]
\p
\v 38 The man that shall make the like for to smell thereon , [ i.e. to have and keep it for his own private use in perfuming ] he shall be destroyed out of his people.
\c 31
\s Bezaleel and Aholiah are called by God for the making of the Tabernacle , the whole frame and furniture of it , v.1, etc. the hallowing of the Sabbath day is commanded again , 12. Moseh receiveth the two Tables of the Law , 18.
\p
\v 1 After that the LORD spake unto Moseh, saying :
\p
\v 2 Behold, I have called by Name, Bezaliel the son of Uri, the son of Hur , of the Tribe of Judah. [i.e.i hav chosen this man before the rest, and fitted him for this emploiment : as below, chapter 35.30.]
\p
\v 3 And I have replenished him with the Spirit of God ,with wisdome, and with understanding , and with knowledge, [i.e. with the gifts of the Spirit of God , such as are related here ; whereby it plainly doth appear , that skill in honest handicrafts and manufacturers , is a special gift of God]
\p
\v 4 For to devise understanding labour : [ Heb. devisings] to work in gold , and in silver, and in copper .
\p
\v 5 And in artificial stone-cutting , [Understanding this of precious stones ] for to set them , [ heb. to fill ] and in artificial wood-cutting ; for to work in all (or every) handi-craft.
\p
\v 6 And I, behold, i have joined to him [ Heb. given with (or by) him ]aholiah the son of Abisamach , of the Tribe of Dan , and into the heart of every one that is wise of heart , i have iven wisdome , [ i.e. understanding and ability in the art which they profess and practise ] and they shall make all that I commanded thee.
\p
\v 7 (Namely) the Tent of the Congregation , and the Ark of the Testimony , and the expiation-cover , that shall be thereupon : and all the furniture of the Tent.
\p
\v 8 And the Table with the furniture thereof , and the pure Candlestick, [ That is, which is to be made of pure gold : see Exod. 25.31.] with all his furniture , and the Incense-Altar.
\p
\v 9 Also the burnt offering-Altar ,with all his furniture ; and the laver with its foot.
\p
\v 10 And the officiating garments , and the holy garments , [ Understand by them , not only the Priests habits and cloaths , but also the Tapestry and Hangings of the Tabernacle , whereof mention is made , above ch.26. And below, chap.36. Item, the coverings wherewith they used to cover the Table ,the Ark, the Altar, and other holy furniture, and utensils, winding and wrapping them about , when the Camp broke up, and the Tent was to be removed : see Num.4,5,9,11,12.] of Aaron the Priest , [i.e. the high Priest] and the garments of his sons , for to administer the Priestly office. [ i.e. those which they put on , and wore whiles they were administring the Priestly office .]
\p
\v 11 Likewise the anointing oil, and the Incense of sweet smelling spices for the Sanctuary : according to all that i commanded thee shall they make it .
\p
\v 12 Further the Lord spake unto Moseh, saying ;
\p
\v 13 Speak now unto the children of Israel , saying ; However, ye shall keep my Sabbaths : [ instituted for my service . The meaning here is , That although the business of the Tabernacle was was to be dispatched and compleated out of hand , nevertheless ye shall not labour about it on the sabbath day] for this is a token betwixt me and betwixt you , in your generations : that men may know that i am the LORD that sanctifieth you.
\p
\v 14 Keep the Sabbath then , because it is holy to you , [Heb. Holiness ] he that prophaneth it shall surely be put to death ; for every one that doth any work upon the same, that soul [i.e. person] shall be destroyed [ see Gen. 17.v.14.] out of the midst of her people .
\p
\v 15 Six days shall men do the work , but on the Seventh day is the Sabbath of Rest , a Holiness of the LORD : he that labour on the Sabbath day , shall surely be put to death .
\p
\v 16 Let the children of Israel then keep the Sabbath ; observing the Sabbath in their generations for an everlasting Covenant . [See Gen.17.v.7.]
\p
\v 17 It shall be betwixt me , and betwixt the children of Israel , a token in eternity ; [ Compare Gen.17.11.]because the LORD in six days made Heaven and Earth , and on the Seventh day he rested , see Gen.2.2.] and refreshed himself , [ God, being a spirit , grows never weary ; threfore this is but comparison taken from men , who after long and much pains taking , use to breath and refresh themselves, by rest .]
\p
\v 18 And he [viz. the LORD] gave unto Moseh, when he had made an end of speaking with him on Mount Sinai, the two Tables of the Testimony , [ i.e. the Law , wherein god testifieth how he will be honoured , served , and worshipped by the people ] Tables of stone inscribed by the fingure of God . [ The fingure of God doth here signifie the power and work of God . Compare above chap.8. Verse 19. Luke 11.20. compared with Matth.12.28. and elsewhere.]
\c 32
\s The people causeth Aaron to make a golden calf , v.1, etc. Unto which they offer sacrifice , 6. God makes this known to Moseh , and threatneth to destroy them , 7.Moseh prays for them, 11. and perwades God to have mercy on them , 14. Moseh cometh down from the Mount with two stone Tables , 15.which he breaks in pieces, hearing and seeing the idolatry of the people , 19. He burns the calf into powder , 20. Aarons excuse , 22. Moseh causeth many of those that committed this Idolatry , to be put to death by the Levites , 25. Moseh prayeth to the LORD , either to pardon Israel this sin , or to blot him out of his book, 32. God spares the people for the present , but punisheth them afterwards , 34.
\p
\v 1 When the people saw , that Moseh delayed to come down from the Mount , then the people gathered themselves [ Understand here a great part of, but not all the people ; for those are not to be counted of the number here , who afterwards on Mosehs command , did put the Idolaters to death , verse 26. see 1 Cor. 10.7.] to Aaron , [Oth.against] and they said to him , Arise , make us Gods , [ i.e. a visible Token , image of the invisible God, as verse 4. ] that may go before our face ; for this Moseh , that Man , that carried us forth out of Egypt , we know not what happened to him .
\p
\v 2 Aaron now said unto them , pluck off the golden pendants , ( ear-ornaments ) which are in the ears of your wives , or your sons , and of your daughters , and bring them to me . [ It is probable , Aaron did conceive , the Israelites would rather have forborn the golden calf , then to deliver up their precious jewels in this manner ; but he was much deceived .]
\p
\v 3 Then all the people pluekt off their golden pendants , which were in their ears , and they brought them to Aaron .
\p
\v 4 And he took them out of their hand , and he cast it [ viz. the calf ] with a graver , [ or, pen ; as Isa . 8.1. the meaning seems to be , that Aaron first projected or drew the figure and shape of a calf , by pe, or pencil, or graver upon some other matter , to hold it forth unto the people , and to ask them how they liked it ] And he made a molten out of it: [Heb he made it calfof founding. Oth. A molten oxe. The idol Apis is worshiped by the Egyptians, in he shape an exe, or a calf; and this it should seem the Israelists here imitated] Then they said, There are thys Gods, Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 5 . When Aaron saw that, [Viz. that the people was ready to yeild divine worship to the calf] he built an Atar for the same: and Aaron proclaimed, and sais ; tommorrow (ther) shall be a feast to the LORD. [Aaron here he makes use of the Name of the true God, as intending to serve him by his calf, and yet all what Idolatry in God account]
\p
\v 6 And they rose early in the next, and affered burnt – offering, and brought thank – offering to it;[ Viz. to the Alter newly set up, i.e they offered and sacrificed to the calf] and the people sate them down to eat and to drink; after that , they rose up for to play. [See on ver. 19]
\p
\v 7 Then the LORD sapke unto Moseh; Go, get thee down for thy people [God doth disdain to call the Israelites his people any more, having made themselves a calf for their God] whom thou shalt carried forth out of Egypt, hath spoiled (or, corrupted)it. [oth. Hath corrupted it self, or, have corrupted themselves, i.e. they have by their Idolatry undone and brought destruction upon themselves.]
\p
\v 8 . And they are soon departed [Viz. immediately after the Covenant made with them; Exod 19 and 24 chap] from the way which i had commanded them; they made themselves a molten calf; [Aaron made it, or caused it to be made, verse 4. at the instance, or at the commanded of the people, verse 1.] and they have bowed themselves down before the same, and have made sacrifies to it, [Viz. to the calf, and not to me, whatever they pretend to the contray, as if they did it to the LORD, verse] and said; these are thy Gods, Israel, which carried thee up out of the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 9 Morevover the LORD said to Moseh: i have seen this same people, and behold it is a stiff – necked people. [i.e. wilful, obstinate, unruly, that will not bow nor bend his neck to the laws and will of the LORD . It ia a comparison taken from such beast, as use to stretch forth or keep up their neck so stiff, that they will not bend nor bow to him that would lay on he yoak upon the, or rule and govern them with bit OR BRIDLE. See Deut. 10.16. Prov 29.1. Acts 7.51.]
\p
\v 10 And now permit me, [And hinder me not by thy intercession, for the prayer of the faithful prevaileth much with God, Jam. 5.16.] that my wrath may kindle against them, and consume them; then shall i make the great people.
\p
\v 11 Yet Moseh adored the face of the LORD his God: and he said, O LORD; why should wrath kinde against thy people, which thou hast carried for th out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a strong hand?
\p
\v 12 Why should the Egyptians speak , saying , In evil [i.e. with a subtil and ill intent. Oth for evil, or mischief, i.e. to their ruine and destruction] hath he carriedd them forth, that he might put them to death on the mountains, and that he might destroy them the face of the earth , [i.e. from reamining any longer upon the earth] turn off the servency of thy wrath, and let it repent thee over the evil of thy people. [moseh prayeth here, that Gd would rent, i.e. that he would he woould not let the eveil, i.e. the punishment which they had deserved, and he treatned, to light upon them. See Gen. 6. verse6.]
\p
\v 13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel thy servants, [i.e. remember the promise which thou hast made to Abraham, &c.] to whom thou hast sworm by thy self, [God having none grater to swear by , he sweareth by himself , Heb 6.13.,17.] and hast spoken unto them, i will multiply your seeda s the first star of Heaven; [see Gen 15.5.] and this whole land, whereof i spake [i.e. promised] i will give unto your seed, that they shalt possess it hereditary for ever.
\p
\v 14 Then it repented the LORD over the evil which he had spoken to do unot his people. [I.e. he did not destroy the people, according as he had threatned, but contented himself with the flaying three thousand onely of them]
\p
\v 15 And Moseh turned him (self) about, and went down the Mount, with two Tables of the Testimony in his hand: these Tables were inscribed on both their sides, they were inscribed upon the other side. [Heb from hence from thence.]
\p
\v 16 And these Tables were Gods work, the writing also was God writing it self, graven in the Tables.
\p
\v 17 Now when JOSHUA [who remained upon the mount with Moseh, Exod 24.13. heard the voice of the people. When it shouted; he said to Moseh, There a shout of war in the Camp.
\p
\v 18 But he [viz. Moseh] said; it is no voice of the cry victory , it is n voice neither of the cry of defeat: [Heb it is no voice of the cry of the strength , and it is no voice of the crying of weakness] i hear a voice of singing bu turns.
\p
\v 19 And it came to pass, when he drew near to the Camp, an saw the Clf, and the dance; [Understand such dance to the manner of the Heathern] that wrath incensed Moseh, and tha he threw the Tables out of his hands, and brake the same [viz. before the peoplee eyes] beneath at the Mountain.
\p
\v 20 And he took that Calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire [i.e. he melted the Claf, and reduced it into a lump again] and ground it till it was small, and sacttered it upon the water, and made the children of Israel to drink it, [that thereby they might learn to understand the vanity of sucH Gods, that could be swallowed u thus, as also to minde the Israelite s, that they had deserved to drink up the curse and wrath of God. See Numb 5.18.]
\p
\v 21 And Moseh said to Aaron What hath this people done to thee, that thou hast brought such a great sin over (or, upon) the same.
\p
\v 22 Then Aaron said, Let not the anger of my Lord kinde; thou knowest this people , that is (lieth) in evil.
\p
\v 23 They then said to me, Make us Gods, that may go before our face; for this Moseh, that man which carried u upon out of Egypt , we know not happened to him:
\p
\v 24 Then i said to them, whoso hath gold, let him pluck it off, and i cast it into the fire, and there came this calf forth. [Aaron doth not consess his own sin so uprightly and plainly, as he had done the peoples transgression he speaketh of the Calf here, as it had been made and produced, rather by accident, then by acident, then by his design and forecast; but above verse 4. the matter is described far otherwise, See Deut.9.20. Aaron excuse here, is much like to Adams Gens.3.]
\p
\v 25 When Moseh saw, that the people was made bare, (or script) [Not so much of their ornaments, as of Gods protection, being now as so many naked and disarmed men, who might easily in that case be surprised and destroyed by their Enemies. Compare this with Gen.3.10. Rev 3.18. and 16. 15.] (for Aaron had made them bare) [this making and exposing the people bare thus is ascribed unto Aaron, for that he not only gave his content to the wicked desire of the people, but likewise further and advanced it] to (an) under value among those that might have risen against them.
\p
\v 26 Then Moseh stayed in the gate of the Camp , [The Camp was surrounded with a Tench, or Phillisadoe, or some such way, and had its gates here there. Otherwise gates were also the places of Judicature, as Gen 34.20. Deut 17.5. Ruth 4.1,11.] and said, Whoso belongeth to the LORD, let him (come) to me: [or to me who is the LORDS. Moseh speaking in zeal and bast and leaving outt words of circumstance. See the like, Gen 13.9. and 23.13 etc] then (there) gathered themselves unto him all the sons of Levi [i.e. almost dolatry , even Aaron himself. See vers. 29. and Deut. 9.20 and chap 33.9. Oth and they which gathered themselves unto him, were all (of the) children of Levi, who having staid at home, and remained in their Tents, committed no Idolatry inworshipping the Calf]
\p
\v 27 And he said unto them; Thus saith the LORD. The God of Israel, [viz. the true God of Israel, not the Claf, whereof they said, above ver. 5. Thses are thy Gods, Israel] Evry one put his sword upon his thigh go through, and turn again from gate in the Camp, and every one kills his brother, every one his friend, and every one his neighbour [.e. Let every one of you slay the next man he meets with, sparing no relation, of either brother, friend, or neighbour.]
\p
\v 28 And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moseh; and ther fell [viz. by the edge of the sword] of the people on that day, about three thousand men.
\p
\v 29 For Moseh had said; [Here is shewed, what it was that made the Levits so stout and so undaunted, that they spared not their next and every friends; namely, because they had understood by Moseh, that they should do God an acceptable service, and that thereby they should acquire and receive and receive a special blessing at Gods hands] Fill your hands to day unto the LORD; [i.e hallow or consecrate to day unto the LORD; that is so say, perform his holy service unto him. See Lev.7. Ro say, perform this holy service unto him. See Lev 7. 37. God doth witness here, that the executing of Justice and punishment upon the evil doers, is as acceptable him of the Levites Moseh repeateth, Deut 33.9.] for every one shall be against his son, and against his brother and this, that he [viz. the LORD] my give to day a blessing over you.
\p
\v 30 And it came to pass the next day [viz. after the flaying of these three thousand men] that Moseh said to the people, Ye have sinned a great sin; yet now i will go up to the LORD, peradventure i shall make an expiation for your sin.
\p
\v 31 So Moseh returned to the LORD, [Moseh stayed again fourty days upon the Mount, without food, paying for people to the LORD, Deut 9.18.] and said Ah, this people hath sinned a great sin, that they made themselves golden Gods[ Oth. A God of gold , i.e. the golden Calf.]
\p
\v 32 Now then if thou wilt forgive their sins [Understanding then it is well. Compare this abrupt manner of speaking, with Luke 13.9] but if not, then blot me out of thy book, which thou, which thou hast written. [Being once gain: But Moseh shweth by these words his award zeal for the glory of God, and his great love to the people of Israel. Compare herewith he zeal of Paul, Rom 9.3. The book of God , and great love to the people of Israel. Compare herewith the Zeal of Paul. , Rom 9.3. The book of God is otherwise called the Book of Life, being that therein stand recorded all those whom God hath ordained for eternal life, Phil 4.3. yet this is spoken of God after the manner of men: for by this Book there is nothing else to be understood, but his eternal Counsel, and unalterable Decree of Elecion.]
\p
\v 33 Then the LORD said to Moseh; Him i should blot out of my Book, that sinneth against me. [Understand hereby, if so be that any one might be blotted out thence. Oth, him i shall, or, will bot out]
\p
\v 34 Yet go (thy way) now, lead people , whither i told thee, [Viz towards the Land of Canaan] Behold , my Angel shall go before thy face; [thus God threatneth in his wrath, to give over this people to Moseh, and to an Angle; whereof their see farther, chap 33. on verse 2.] yet on the other day of my visit, shall i visist [see Gen 21. verse 1.] their sin [especially this sin of Idolatry committed with the golden Calf] upon them.
\p
\v 35 Thus the LORD plagued this people;[ Other smote, etc. by the sword of the Levites, verse 28] for having made that Calf, which Aaron made, [i.e. for that they had solicited and pressed Aaron thus make then his Calf. That which one doth by onother, is all ones if he did it himself; though in the meen time, he be not guiltness, that suffers himself to be made by an instrument.]
\c 33
\s The LORD refuseth to go with the people, as he had promised formerly, v.i, etc. the people mourned over it, and layeth by their ornament 4. Moseh causeth the Tebernacle to be brought forth without the Camp, 7. He goeth into to it, God speaks with him in it, 9. He prayeth the LORD, to shew him his way, 12. and that he would be pleased to go with the people, 15. which God doth promise again unto him, 17. He desireth to see the glory of God, 18. God promiseth to proclaim his Name abroad, 19. But his face be seen by no man, 20.
\p
\v 1 Morevover the LORD spake to Moseh, Go, get thee hence, thou and the people with thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land which i have sworn to Abraham, Isaac ,and Jaco[i.e. Promised unto theem oth; whence alos the Land of Canaan was called the land of promise] saying [viz. to each one of those three Patriarchs in particular, and as several times] unto thy sed will i give it]
\p
\v 2 And I will send an Angel before thy face, [He doth not speak here of the Son of Go, as before, Exod.23.20. But of another created Angel] and i will drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites, and the Hithies, and the Pherizites, the Hivites,a nd the Jebusites; [understand like wise the Girgasites, expressed , Deut 7.1.]
\p
\v 3 Unto the land that floweth with Milk and Honey, for I shall not go up in the midst of thee; [i.e. I shall not conduct you henceforward any longerby a visible token of my presence, as hitherto i did by the cloudy pillar:never the less God of his goodness was entreated again, and did continue marching along before and with his people as formely] for thou art a stiff – necked people, that i consume thee not upon this way.
\p
\v 4 When the people heard this evil word, they mourned, and none of them put on his ornament.
\p
\v 5 And the LORD had said to Moseh, Say unto the children of Israel, Thou art a stiff – necked people; in a moment i should i should go up in the midst of thee, and should destroy thee, should i destroy thee. The sense is, ifi did go up in the midst of thee, should i destroy thee. The sense is, if ye should chance to treapass once again so obominably against me, as ye did with the setting of the golden Calf, i should assurredly destroy you altogether on a sudden] yet now, put off thy ornament from thee, and i shall know what I shall do.
\p
\v 6 Then the children of Israel bereaved themselves of their ornaments, (afar off) [This parenthesis inserted here out of the next verse] from Mount Horeb.
\p
\v 7 And Moseh took the Tent , [ Oth. a Tent : not the tent where the people was to assemble together , for the exercise of the publique worship, for the same was not made yet, as appears by Exodus 36 .But this was Moseh his own Tent , or an other which was made of purpose for Moseh to take up his abode for a time in the same , where the people might repair unto him , until they should be reconciled with God . And pitched him (the same) without the Camp , removing far off from the Camp, God eing departed from the Camp, verse 3. Moseh would not remain there neither ] and he called it, the Tent of the Congregation : and it came to pass , that every one that sought the LORD [ or, enquired counsel of the LORD, viz. by Moseh ] went forth to the Tent of the Congregation , which was without the Camp.
\p
\v 8 And it came to pass , when Moseh went forth to the Tent , [ viz. out of the Camp, to his new-erected Tent without the Camp , to intercede with God for the people ] all the people stood [ Heb. they stood ] up, and every one put himself in the door of his Tent : and they looked after Moseh , untill he was entred into his Tent .
\p
\v 9 And it came to pass , when Moseh was entred into the Tent , that the cloud pillar came downwards [ viz. from the Mount ] and stood in the door of the Tent : and He [viz. the LORD , as verse 11.] spake with Moseh , [ viz. out of the cloud pillar, which was an assured token of Gods grace and favour , Psalm 99.7.]
\p
\v 10 When the people saw the cloud pillar to stand in the door of the Tent ; then all the people rose up , and bowed themselves , every one in the door of his Tent .
\p
\v 11 And the LORD spake to Moseh face to face , [ i.e. familiarly, plainly, by a clear and articulate voice , this was a special priviledge , which no other Prophets had , Deut .5.4. and chapter 34.10. and Num.12.6,7,8.] even as a man speaketh with his friend : after that , he [ viz. Moseh] returned again to the Camp ; yet his servant Joshua , the son of Nun , that young man , departed not out of the midst of the Tent [ i.e. he came not into the midst of the Camp, but remained constantly in the tent without the Camp.]
\p
\v 12 And Moseh said to the LORD ; Behold, Thou sayest to me , [ Above verse 1.] Carry this people up , but Thou letst me not know , whom [ Oth. What] Thou wilt send with me : whereas Thou hast said ; I know thee by name , [ i.e. I have known and chosen thee in love before others , and take a very particular care of thee ; Compare Gen.18.19. Exod. 31.2.] and likewise Thou hast found grace in mine eyes . [ see Gen.6.8.]
\p
\v 13 Now then, I pray, if I have found grace in thine eyes ,then let me know thy way now, [ i.e. shew me the means , whereby Thou intendest to guide and guard this people ; or, how Thou wilt deal with them ] and I shall know Thee , that I may finde grace in thine eyes : [ oth. Because I found grace , etc. or, that I may finde grace , etc. and regard , that this Nation is thy people.
\p
\v 14 Then he said , Must my face go along , for to set thee at rest ? [ Oth. My face shall, etc. by the face of God here , is understood the visible token of his gracious presence , such as was the cloud-pillar, and the fire-pillar.]
\p
\v 15 Then he [viz. Moseh ] said to him ; If thy face shall not go along, do not make us go up hence .
\p
\v 16 For whereby should it be made now , that I found grace in thine eyes , and thy people ? is it not thereby , That thou goest with us ? Thus shall we be seperated , I, and thy people from all the people that is upon the face of the earth .
\p
\v 17 Then the LORD said to Moseh : This same thing likewise which thou hast spoken , I will do : [i.e. I will go up along with you ] because thou hast found grace in mine eyes , and I know thee by name . [see above verse 12.]
\p
\v 18 Then said he , shew me now thy glory.
\p
\v 19 But he said ; I will curse all my goodness to pass by before thy face , and I will proclaim the Name of the LORD [or , the Name of JEHOVAH ; see the fulfilling hereof , Exod. 34.6.] before thy face : but I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious , and I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.
\p
\v 20 He said moreover ; Thou shalt not be able to see my face [ i.e. my own Essence and proper Being, nor my Glory in its perfection , by reason of thy sinfulness , Rom.3.23. We cannot see God in this mortal and corruptible life . See Gen.16.13. but hereafter we shall see him as he is , 1 Cor. 13.12. and 1 Jo.3.2.] for no mae shall see me , and live . [ Hence arose the common opinion amoung the Israelites , that they must die , if they should see the LORD , Deut .5.24,25. Jud. 13.22. Isa.6.5. Dan. 10.8. and Rev.1.17.]
\p
\v 21 The LORD said further ; Behold there is a place by me , [ viz. upon mount Sinai , or Horeb] there thou shalt place thy self upon a Rock.
\p
\v 22 And it shall come to pass , when my Glory shall pass by before thee , [ i.e. when I shall pass by thee there in my Glory ] then I will set thee in a cleft of the rock : and I will cover thee with my hand , until I shall be passed by.
\p
\v 23 And when I shall have taken away my hand , then shalt thou see my hindmost parts , but my face shall not be seen. [ See above verse 20.]
\c 34
\s God commandeth Moseh to hew two Tables of stone , wherein he was ready now to write his Law again , v.1, etc. with these two Tables Moseh goeth up into the Mount , 4. The LORD comes down in a cloud , and proclaimeth his Name abroad ,5. Moseh prayeth the LORD that he would go with them ,8. which he promiseth , and makes a Covenant with them , and he warneth them to beware of the Idolatry of the Canaanites , and of marrying with them, 10. The Commandement touching unleavened bread , and the first-born is renewed , as also that for the Sabbath and other feasts , 18. some other laws yet ,26. After that Moseh had been other fourty days upon the Mount , he cometh down with the two Tables ,28. His face shineth ; which he covereth , 29. He acquainteth them with all that the LORD had spoken with him , upon Mount Sinai, 32. Moseh was fain to have his face covered , while he spake with the people , 33.
\p
\v 1 Then the LORD said to Moseh, Hew thee two stone-Tables , as the first were : and I shall write upon the Tables of the same words , which were upon the first Tables which thou brakest .
\p
\v 2 And be ready against the morning ; that in the morning Thou come up on Mount Sinai , [ This is the second time , that Moseh was upon Mount Sinai , continuing each time fourty days and fourty nights there ] and put thyself there before me on the top of the mount . [Heb. heard, etc.]
\p
\v 3 And none shall come up with thee , [ When Moseh went up into the mount the first time, there were with him Aaron,Nadab and Abihu , together with seventy more of the Elders of Israel ; but now they were grown stinking before the LORD , by reason of Idolatry thy had committed with the golden Calf ] also let none be seen upon the Mount ; neither shall the small cattel , nor the oxen feed over against this Mount .
\p
\v 4 Then he did hew two stone-Tables , like unto the first , and Moseh arose early in the morning , and went up on mount Sinai , according as the LORD had commanded him : and he took the two stone-Tables into his hand .
\p
\v 5 Now the LORD came down in a cloud , [ To wit , that cloud, which was a sure token of the presence of the LORD ] and put himself there by him : and he [ viz. the LORD , see above chap.33 19.] proclaimed the Name of the LORD .
\p
\v 6 Now when the LORD passed by before his face, then he [ viz. the LORD ] cried; LORD, LORD, God , merciful and gracious , long suffering , [ Heb. long of wrathfulness , i.e. slow to anger , not hasty to execute his wrath ; so Numb. 14.18. Eccl. 7,8, & c. the contrary here of is , short of wrathfulness , i.e. hasty and prone to wrath , Prov.14.17. ] and great of beneficence ( or kindnesse ) and truth, [ see Gen. 24.27. ]
\p
\v 7 Who keepeth beneficence ( or kindness ) to many thousands , who forgiveth iniquity , and transgression , and sin ; who in no wise doth hold the (guilty ) guiltless, [ Heb. who doth not holding guiltless , hold guiltless ] visiting the iniquity of the fathers , [ wicked and ungodly parents ] upon the children, [ viz. walking in the wicked footsteps of their fathers ] and on the childrens children , in the third and in the fourth ( generation ) [ Heb. on the third and on the fourth , Exod.20.6. Deut.5.9.]
\p
\v 8 Moseh now hasted , and enclined the head to the ground, and he bowed himself .
\p
\v 9 And he said , LORD, if now I have found grace in thine eyes , let the LORD now go in the midst of us : [ viz. with the cloud pillar , conducting and refreshing us thereby ] for this is a stiff necked people , yet forgive our iniquity, and our sin , and receive us for an inheritance .
\p
\v 10 Then he said ; Behold, I make a Covenant , Before all thy people I will do wonders , which were not created upon all the earth , nor amoung any people : so that all this people , in the midst whereof thou art, shall see the work of the LORD , that it is terrible , which I do with thee, [ viz. O Israel . Oth. with thee, viz. O Moseh.]
\p
\v 11 Observe thou that which I command thee this day : [ Here now follow the conditions of the Covenant , which God requireth on the peoples part ] behold, I shall drive out before thy face , the Amorites and the Canaanites , and the Hithites , and the Pherezites , and the Hevites , and the Jebusites . [ understand likewise the Girgasites .]
\p
\v 12 Take heed to thy self , that thou make not any Covenant with the Inhabitants of the Land , innto which thou shalt come ; that the same become not a snare perchance in the midst of thee .
\p
\v 13 But their Altars ye shall overthrow , and their erected images ye shall break in pieces , and their groves [ viz. those wherein they did commit Idolatry] thou shalt cut down .
\p
\v 14 ( For thou shalt not bow thy self before any other God , for the LORDS Name is Jealous, he is a jealous God .)
\p
\v 15 Lest thou make a Covenant with the Inhabitant of that Land, and they go a whoring after their Gods , [ viz. by committing Idolatry , which is called spiritual whoredome, Jer.3.9. See Lev. 17. on verse 7.] nor suffer sacrifice to their Gods , and he inviting thee , thou eat of their sacrifice .
\p
\v 16 And thou take thy sons ( wives ) of their daughters , and their daughters whoring after their Gods, make thy sonnes also to goe a whoring after their Gods .
\p
\v 17 Thou shalt make thee no molten Gods [ Understand hereby likewise the painted, pictured, hewen, cut and carved Gods . Here the molten ones are expressed by Name , in regard of the molten Calf which they had worshipped .]
\p
\v 18 The feast of the unleavened (bread) [ see Exod. 13.4.] thou shalt keep ; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened (bread) ( or, loaves) as I commandeth thee, at the appointed time , in the moneth of Abib thou didst go forth out of Egypt .
\p
\v 19 All that openeth the womb [ Heb. all , ( or, every) opening of the matrix , i.e. all , or , every first born male, see Exod. 13.] is mine : yea all thy cattel that shall be born male , opening ( the womb of) the great and small cattel . [Heb. opening of the Oxe, i.e. of the Cows , or great Beasts, and of the twenty cattel .]
\p
\v 20 Yet the ass [ or, she ass] opening [the womb] thou shalt redeem with a small beast ; [ The ass, whether he or she , might not be offered in sacrifice , being unclean ] but if thou wilt not redeem him , thou shalt break his neck : [ or, head him ; or, cut his neck thorow ] All the first born of thy sons thou shalt redeem ; and before my face one shall not appear empty . [ i.e. without a gift or present ; that which was given to the Priests , was accounted as given to God himself.]
\p
\v 21 Six days thou shalt labour , but on the Seventh day thou shalt rest : in the plough time , and in the harvest thou shalt rest . [ viz. during the Sabbath day .]
\p
\v 22 Thou shalt likewise keep [ Heb. do, and Exod. 31.16. and Deut .16.1. ] the feast of the weeks [ understand here the Pentecost feast , which was celebrated seven weeks after the Passeover , Lev.24.15. Acts 2.1. being the feast of the firstlings of the wheat harvest : and the feast of the in-gathering , [ i.e. at the time , when thy fruits are all gathered in by thee, and brought home out of the field ] when the year is ( come) about . [ Heb. the running about of the year .]
\p
\v 23 All that bis male amoung you shall appear thrice a year before the face of the Lord LORD , the God of Israel.
\p
\v 24 When I shall expel the Nations out of possession before thy face, , and enlarge thy borders : then nobody shall desire thy Land, , the whiles thou shalt go up to appear before the face of the LORD thy God thrice in the year .
\p
\v 25 Thou shalt not offer the bloud of my Slay-offering with leavened (bread) [ i.e. as long as there is leavened ( bread) in thy house ] the Slay-offering of the Passeover feast shall likewise not be left till the morning .
\p
\v 26 The firstlings [ i.e. the beginnings ] of the first-fruits of thy Land , thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God : Thou shall not boil the Kid in his mothers milk .
\p
\v 27 Moreover, the LORD said to Moseh ; Write thee these words : for according to the tenour [ Heb. mouth ] of these words have I made a Covenant with thee, and with Israel .
\p
\v 28 And he was there with the LORD fourty days and fourty nights ; he did eat no bread , and he drank no water : [ by the word bread , there is understood all manner of food , as by the word water , all manner of drink ] and he [ viz. the LORD , as verse 1. and Deut.10.2. plainly shew. That God doth charge Moseh in the precedent verse , is to be understood of his writing it into the book of the Law, as Exod.17.14. but not that he should write the Law into the two Tables of stone] wrote upone the Tables, the words of the Covenant , the ten words . [ i.e. the Ten Commandements : as Galat.5.14.]
\p
\v 29 And it came to pass , when Moseh came down from Mount Sinai , (Now the two Tables of the Testimony were in the hand of Moseh , when he came down from the Mount ) Moseh knew not the skin of his face did shine , [ i.e. was casting forth beams , like unto the Sun ; The Hebrew Verb is derived from a word signifying horns ; and thence came the mistake of painting Moseh with horns ] when he spake with him . [ or, since he [viz. the LORD] had spoken with him : or, because he had, etc.]
\p
\v 30 Now when Aaron and all the children of Israel looked on Moseh , behold, then the skin of his face did shine ; therefore they were afraid to step near to him . [ It should seem , that at first they did not know him perfectly, supporting it was some Angel , that appeared to them .]
\p
\v 31 Then Moseh called upon them : and Aaron , and all the chief [ or, Princes, Governours, Rulers ] in the Congregation , turned again unto him , [ knowing him now the better by his voice ] and Moseh spake unto them .
\p
\v 32 And after that [viz. When the chief and eldest of the people had first been with Moseh , and they had seen Moseh communing with them ] all the children of Israel slept near , and he commanded them all that the LORD had spoken with him, upon Mount Sinai.
\p
\v 33 Thus Moseh made an end of speaking with them ; and he had put a Vail ( or, cover) upon his face .
\p
\v 34 Yet when Moseh came before the face of the LORD to speak with him, he took off that cover , until he went forth : and after that he was come forth he spake to the children of Israel that (which) was commanded him .
\p
\v 35 So then the children of Israel saw the face of Moseh, that the skin of Mosehs face did shine : [ Moseh let the people see the lustre of his face , that they might give his words so much the more credit ; and afterwards he put the cover on again, when he was to speak with them , that they should not turn away from, nor seek to avoid him] therefore Moseh put the cover again upon his face , until he went in to speak with him . [viz. with God.]
\c 35
\s Moseh commandeth the people again to observe the Sabbath day , v.1, etc . That they should bring a free-will heave offering to the LORD , of gold, silver, and copper , for the Tabernacle , and the Furniture thereof , 4. Men and women bring in their jewels , and other things for the same , 20. The understanding women spin the stuff, 25 . The chief of the people bring in precious stones , and spices, 27. bezaleel and Aholiah are the men , whom God endowed with the spirit of wisdom to make this work , 30.
\p
\v 1 The Moseh caused all the congregation of the children of Israel to assemble, and said unto them ; these are the words [ oth. things, matters, and so likewise ver. 4. and elsewhere ] which the LORD commanded to be done .
\p
\v 2 Six days work shal be done , but on the seventh day there shall be holiness unto you , [ i.e. an holy day ] a Sabbath of rest to the LORD , all ( or every one ) that doth work therein , shall be put to death .
\p
\v 3 Thou shalt kindle no fire [ viz. for to dress meat , Exod. 16.23.] or, to work by , but the kindling of the fire for burnt offering was lawful enough ] in any of [ Heb. in all] your habitations upon the Sabbath day .
\p
\v 4 Moreover Moseh spake to all the Congregation of the children of Israel , saying ; This is the word which the LORD hath commanded , saying ;
\p
\v 5 Take of that which ye have [ Heb. which is by , ( or , with ) you] a heave – offering to the LORD ; everyone whose heart is willing , [ see Job.12 on verse 21. ] shall bring it for a heave- offering of the LORD : gold, and silver, and copper .
\p
\v 6 As also sky colour and purple , and scarlet , and fine linnen , and goats ( hair. )
\p
\v 7 And red coloured rams-skins , and badgers skins , and sittim wood .
\p
\v 8 And oil for the Candlestick ; and spices for the anointing oil , and for perfuming sweet smelling spices .
\p
\v 9 And Sardonix-stones, and filling stones for the Ephod , and for the breast-plate .
\p
\v 10 And all (those) that are wise of heart among you, shall come , and make all that the LORD commanded .
\p
\v 11 The Tabernacle , his Tent , and his Cover : his books ansd his planks , his bars, his pillars, and his feet .
\p
\v 12 The Ark, and and her hand bars , [ Whereby the Ark was born up and carried or removed from one place to another ] the expiation cover , and the vail of the Cover . [ this cover was made of goats-hair , Exodus 26.7.]
\p
\v 13 The Table and its hand-bars , and all its furniture , and the shew-bread-(loaves ) [See Exodus 25.30.]
\p
\v 14 And the Candlestick for the light , [ Oth. of the light ; i.e. giving light .Thus Psalm 148.3. Stars of the light . i.e. shining Stars ] and his furniture , and his lamps , and the oil for the light .
\p
\v 15 And the Incense Altar , [ Understand this of the golden Altar, Exod.30.1. ] and his hand-bars , and the anointing oil , and the incense of sweet-smelling spices : and the cover of the door of the Tabernacle.
\p
\v 16 The Altar of the burnt offering , and the copper Grate , which he is to have , his hand-bars , and all his furniture : the Laver, and its foot .
\p
\v 17 The hanging of the Court , its pillars, and its feet, and the cover of the gate of the Court .
\p
\v 18 The nails of the Tabernacle , and the pins of the Court, [Whereby they fastned the lower ends of the Covers , and hangings to the ground , that the wind might not stir or remove them] with their ropes [These ropes served likewise for the tying and fastening of the hangings or covers of the Tabernacle .]
\p
\v 19 The officiating garments for to serve in the holy (place) : the holy garments of Aaron the Priests, and his sons garments , to administer the Priests office . [ viz. the high Priest, his office, as Exod.31.10.]
\p
\v 20 Then all the Congregation of the children of Israel went forth before the face of Moseh .
\p
\v 21 And they came every man whose heart moved [Oth.exalted, elevated] him : and every one whose spirit made him willing , They brought the LORDS heave-offering for the work of the Tent of the Congregation , and for all the service thereof , and for the holy garments . [ Heb. garments of holiness .]
\p
\v 22 Then the men came with the women , all willing of heart : they brought hooks , and pendants ,( or ear-ornaments ) and rings, and laces , [oth. hanging girdles ] all golden vessels ; and every man which offered a golden wave-offering to the LORD. [ Offered , Heb. moved , (or waved) in regard that that gold which the men brought , was moved and lifted up as they offered it to the LORD wherefore it is called a move or wave-offering both here and Exod.38.24.]
\p
\v 23 And every man, with whom there was found [i.e. with whom there was , or that had , as Esth.1.5. Malach.2.6.] so likewise, There was no guile found in his mouth , i.e. there was no guile in it ] sky-colour, and purple , and scarlet, and fine linnen , and goats -(hair) , and red-dice rams-skins, and badger skins , those they brought .
\p
\v 24 All ( or, every one ) that offered a heave -offering of silver or copper , they brought it for a heave offering of the LORD : and all, with whom there was found Sittim-wood , brought it for all the work of the service [ understand the service of Gods publique worship .]
\p
\v 25 And all women , which were wise of heart, did spin their hands , [ i.e. they spun themselves , and did not put it out for hire , or let their maids do it ] they brought that which was spun , the skie-colour (silk) and the purple , and the scarlet , and the fine linnen .
\p
\v 26 And all women , whose heart moved them in wisdome, they spun the goats (hair) .
\p
\v 27 The Chieftains now (they) brought Sardonix stones , and filling stones , for the Ephod , and for the breast-plate.
\p
\v 28 And spice and oil for the Candlestick , and for the anointing oil ; and for perfuming well-smelling spices .
\p
\v 29 Every man and woman whose heart moved them willingly to bring for all the work which the LORD had commanded to make , by the hand of Moseh : [ i.e. by his direction , order , and command ] that the children of Israel brought (for) a free-will-offering to the LORD.
\p
\v 30 After that Moseh said to the children of Israel ; Behold , the LORD hath called by Name , Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur , of the Tribe of Judah.
\p
\v 31 And the spirit of God hath filled him with wisdome, with understanding , and with knowledge , namely, in all (or, every ) handy-craft .
\p
\v 32 And for to devise rational labour , to work in gold , and in silver, and in copper .
\p
\v 33 And in artificial stone-cutting , to set them in , and in artificial wood-cutting : for to work in all (or, every) rational handy-craft.
\p
\v 34 He hath likewise given into his heart, to instruct ( others ) : him and Aholiab, the son of Abisamach of the Tribe of Dan.
\p
\v 35 He hath filled them with wisdome of heart to make every work of a work-master , and of the most rational ( crafts-man ) and the embroiders in skie-colour , and in purple , in scarlet, and in fine linnen , and of the Weaver , making every work , and devising rationall labour .
\c 36
\s The stuff and materials which was brought by the children of Israel for a heave-offering to the making of the Tabernacle , is committed to the hands of Bezeleel and Aholiah , v.1,etc.The people are forbidden to bring more, 5. The Artificers fall awork, and make all ready that belongeth to the Tabernacle ,as the Curtains with the Cherubims, 8. the Curtains of goats (hair), 14. the covers of the rams -skins , and the badgers-skins , 19. the planks , with their tenons , and the bars , the Vail,20, etc.
\p
\v 1 Then Bezaleel wrought, and Aholiah, and every man that was wife of heart, into whom the LORD has given wisdome and understanding for to know , how they should make all the work for the service of the Sanctuary , according to all that the LORD had commanded .
\p
\v 2 For Moseh had called Bezaleel and Aholiah , and every man that was wise of heart , in whose heart God had given wisdom : every one whose heart moved him to step to the work, for to make the same .
\p
\v 3 They then took from before the face of Moseh , all the heave-offering [ viz. the gold, silver , copper & c. which was offered ] which the children of Israel had brought to the work of the service of the Sanctuary, for to make the same : howbeit they brought to him every morning yet [ Heb. in the morning , in the morning ] free-will-offering.
\p
\v 4 Therefore all the wise (men) came, which made all the work of the Sanctuary : every one [ Heb. man , man ] from his work which they made .
\p
\v 5 And they spake to Moseh , saying ; The people brings too much : [Heb. the people multiplieth to bring , or, multiplying the people bringeth ] more then sufficeth for the service of the work which the LORD commanded to make.
\p
\v 6 Then Moseh commanded that a voice shall be made to go [i.e. Proclaimation should be made , a publique notice given] throughout the camp , saying : Let nor man nor woman [ i.e. prepare,furnish] more work [i.e. stuff or materials for the work ] for (a) heave-offering of the Sanctuary : so the people were kept back from bringing (more) .
\p
\v 7 For of the stuff [ Heb. of the work , i.e. of the stuff or materials for the work , as verse 6.] there was enough to them [viz.to the Artificers or workmen , i.e. they had stuff enough for all this work ] for all the work that was to be made, yea there was over.
\p
\v 8 Thus every one wife of heart among them which made the work , did make the Tabernacle of ten Curtains : [ The Tabernacle was first made , although chap.25. The Ark , and the Table, and the Candlestick were first mentioned because the Tabernacle was to contain all the furniture] ; of fine twinned linnen, and a skie- colour , and purple , and scarlet, (with) Cherubims , of the most artificial work he made them .
\p
\v 9 The length of one Curtain was twenty eight ells , and the bredth of one Curtain four ells : all these Curtains had one measure. [viz. both for length and breadth.]
\p
\v 10 And he joined five curtains , the one to the other : and he joined (other ) five curtains , the one to the (other).
\p
\v 11 After that , he made loops of skie -colour at the edge of one Curtain , on the uttermost in the jointing (place) : he did it likewise at the uttermost edge of the second joining Curtain .
\p

\p
\v 15 And thou shalt anoint them , as thou shalt have anointed their father , that they may administer me the Priests office : and it shall come to pass, that their anointing shall be unto them for an everlasting Priesthood by their generations . [ So namely , that it shall not be needful to renue the anointing , when their posterity shall come to be consecrated Priests , for in after-times onely the high Priestwas anointed at his Entrance.]

\v 31 Ans Moseh,and Aaron, and his sons, washed thereout their hands and their fest.
\p
\v 32 Whe they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they drew near to the altar, they washed themselves: according as the LORD replenished the tabernacle [ Here now is fullfilled that which the LORD had promised, Exod 25. verse 8. See the like, 2 Chron. 5.14. and Ezek 43.4,5.]
\p
\v 33 He likewise set up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and he hung up the cover of the gate of the court; Thus Moses finished the work.
\p
\v 34 Then the cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of God replenished the tabernacle. [Here now is fulfilled that which the LORD had promised, Exod. 25.8. See the like, 2 Chron. 5.14 and Ezek. 43.4,5.]
\p
\v 35 So that Moseh could not enterinto the tent of the congregation, while the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD did fill the tabernacle.
\p
\v 36 Now then the children o Israel journeyed on in all their journeyings.
\p
\v 37 But when the cloud was not lifted up, they journeyed not, until the day that it was lifted up.
\p
\v 38 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day; and the fire [i.e. the pillar of fire, or fiery pillar ] was thereon by night, before the eys of all the house of Israel, in all the wilderness, until they came into the land of Canaan.]
