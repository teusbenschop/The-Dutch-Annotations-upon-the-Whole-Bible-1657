\mt2 THE BOOK OF
\mt JOSUA
\s The Argument of this Book
\p In this BOOK are rehearsed the wonderfull works of the LORD , which, to demonstrate the truth and faithfulnesse of his Promises , he did since the death of Moseh to the decease of Josua ; to wit , how he brought the children of Israel into the promised Land of Canaan , leading them on drie foot thorow Jordan , and delivering into their hands all the Kings of the Canaanites, with their Lands and Cities ; which Josua divided among nine Tribes and an half : The Cities of refuge , together with those Cities which the Levites were to inhabite, are also appointed . Lastly, in this BOOK is related the death of Josua , when he was an hundred and ten years old , having set before the Israelites the curse of God , if they should depart from the Covenant which the LORD had made with them. Josua was both in name and in office a speciall Type of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, who bringeth the faithfull into the true place of rest ; to wit, that Heavenly Canaan , Heb.4.8, & c. This History containeth the time of somewhat more then seventeen years , and beareth the name of Josua , because therein is treated of his famous Acts : By whom this Historie was penned , is doubtfull and uncertain .Some conceive that it was penned by a Prophet , who lived some few years after . It may firstly be divided into three parts : for in the twelve first Chapters are mentioned the exceeding great victories , which Josua, by the strength and power of God , obtained . In the second part , to wit , from Chapter 13. to Chapter 22. is treated of the dividing of the Land among the Tribes. In the third part is described the dismissing, or sending away of the two Tribes and an half : As also the strict and serious charge of Josua unto the people of Israel . And lastly, the decease of Josua , and of Eleazer.
\c 1
\s God commandeth Josua to lead the people unto the Land of Canaan , verse 1, & c. whose borders are mentioned ,4. God confirmeth Josua by speciall promises ,5. and exhorteth him to diligent consideration of his Law .7. Josua commandeth the people to prepare themselves for the journey and passage over Jordan, 10. and exhorteth the Reubenites , Gadites, and the half Tribe of Manaseh to march, because of the promise which they had made unto Moseh , 12. which they are ready to do, 16. All the Tribes promise to obey Josua, 17.
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass after the death of Moseh the servant of the LORD , that the LORD spake unto Josua the son of Nun, Moseh his servant, saying :
\p
\v 2 My servant Moseh is dead : therefore arise now , go over this Jordan, [ This is the greatest River of the land of Canaan : It runneth along the promised Land , and endeth in the dead Sea , or Lake called Lacus Asphaltites ; and about this River did John the Baptist first administer the Baptisme, mark 1.5. and our Saviour Jesus Christ was also baptized in it , Matth.3.13.] thou and all this people , unto the Land , which I gave unto them , the children of Israel . [ i.e. promised long ago to give , but now put in full and actual possession .]
\p
\v 3 Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread , have I given unto you ; according as I spake unto Moseh.
\p
\v 4 From the wilderness [ viz. the wildernesse Sin, Exodus 16.] and this Lebanon , [ this is the tallest and greatest mountain in Syria , beginning from about Zidon and reaching till near Damascus ] even unto the great river, the river Phrath, [ this was the border towards the East] all the land of the Hethites , and even unto the great Sea, ( toward the ) going down of the Sun shall be your border.
\p
\v 5 No man shall be able to subsist before thy face all the dayes of thy life , according as I have been with Moses , will I be with thee ; I will not fail thee, nor will forsake thee.
\p
\v 6 Be strong and couragious ; for thou shalt cause this people hereditarily to possessethat land which I have sworn unto their fathers to give them.
\p
\v 7 Onely be strong and very couragious , that thou mayest observe to do according to all the Law which Moseh my servant commanded thee ; turn not from it to the right hand nor to the left, that thou mayest deal understandingly where ever thou shalt go.
\p
\v 8 Let not the Book of this Law depart out of thy mouth [i.e. let thy heart be so filled with the word and knowledge of God , that thy mouth may overflow therewith, see Matth.12.34] but meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written in it, for them shalt thou make thy wayes prosperous , and then shalt thou deal understandingly.
\p
\v 9 Have not I commanded it thee ? be strong and couragious , be not affrighted , neither be dismayed : for the LORD thy god is with thee where ever thou goest .
\p
\v 10 Then Josua commanded the Officers of the people, saying :
\p
\v 11 Pass thorow the midst of the Camp , and command the people saying, Prepare victuall for your selves : for within three dayes ye shall passe over this Jordan, that you may go in to inherit the land which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit .
\p
\v 12 And Josua spake unto the Reubenites and Gadites, and the half Tribe of Manasseh , saying :
\p
\v 13 Remember the word which Moseh the servant of the LORD commanded you , saying : the LORD your God giveth you rest , and he giveth you this land ; [ viz. where they were at this time, on this side Jordan ; see Num.32.33.]
\p
\v 14 Your wives , your little children , and your cattell remain in the Land , which Moseh gave you on this side Jordan , but ye shall goe before the face of your brethren armed , [See Exodus 13. on v.18.] all the mightie men of valour , [ intimating , that all those who out of these Tribes were to goe forth upon this service , were to be choice men , stout and valiant souldiers well armed ] and shall help them.
\p
\v 15 Untill the LORD give your brethren rest , as ( he hath given) you, and that they likewise hereditarily possess the Land which the LORD your God giveth them : then ye shall return unto the land of your inheritance , and shall hereditary possess it , which Moseh the servant of the LORD gave you on this side of Jordan, toward the Sun-rising .
\p
\v 16 Then answered they Josua , [ viz. all the Tribes , or the Officers in their name , submitting themselves thus unto the government of Josua ] saying ; whatsoever thou hast commanded us we will do, and where ever thou shalt send us we will go ,
\p
\v 17 As in all things we have heakened unto Moseh, so will we hearken unto thee : onely the LORD thy God be with thee as he was with Moseh. [This is a wish or desire , whereby these Tribes wiith prosperitie unto Josua , in the administration of the Office which he had taken upon him , looking upon that which God had promised him, verse 5. But others conceive it to be a stipulation or condition , promising to obey him , in case the LORD should be with him , as he was with Moseh .]
\p
\v 18 Every men that shall rebell against thy mouth , [ i.e. command] and shall not hearken to thy words in all things , which thou shalt command him , the same shal be put to death ; onely be strong and couragious.
\c 2
\s Josua sendeth two men to spie out the land of Cannan and Jericho , verse 1, & c. Whom the King of that City causeth to be sought after , 3 . but Rahab bideth them , 4. and craftily deceiveth the Kings messengers , 5. and she relateth the great dismaydnesse of the people of that city, and of the land , declaring that the same came from God , 9.She requesteth that the israelites would save her and her fathers house alive , 12 . which the spies promise upon oath , yet with condition , 14. after that they return unto Josua , 23. and bring him good tidings 24 .
\p
\v 1 Now Josua the son of Nun had sent from Sittim [ Situate in the land of the Moabites , where the Israelites had transgressed in committing fornication and idolatry with Baal-Peor , Numb. 25.1.] two men , to spie secretly, [ Heb. silently : i.e. he had not acquainted the people therewith , as Moseh had done , when he sent out the twelve men , Num.13.2. and 33.49.] saying : Go your wayes , view the land and Jericho : [ Jericho was afterward allotted to the tribe of Benjamin ; distant about 150 furlongs from Jerusalem , and about 60 from Jordan : this is the first city which te Israelites set upon by force : It was seated or placed in a pleasant fruitful countrey , where many palm-trees grew , whence it was called the palm-City , Deut.34.3. Judg.1.16. and 2 Chron 28.15.]They then went , and came unto the house of a woman , a harlot , [ Oth. of a woman , who was an harlot .The Hebrew word signifieth also an hostesse : but, Heb. 11.31. and Jerem.2.25. Rachabis expresly called an harlot ] and they lodged there .
\p
\v 2 Then it was told the King of Jericho , saying : Behold, this night are come hither two men from the children of Israel , to search out this land .
\p
\v 3 Wherefore the King of Jericho sent unto Rachab , saying : Bring forth the men that are come to thee , for they are come to search out all the land .
\p
\v 4 But that woman had taken both of these men , and she had hid them , [Heb. had hid him ; viz. each of them] and said thus ; [ Oth. and she said , it is right ] There came men unto me , but I know not whence they were.
\p
\v 5 And it came to passe , when the gate should be shut , when it was dark , that those men went forth ; whither those men are gone , I know not ; pursue quickly after them , for ye shall overtake them .
\p
\v 6 But she had caused them to go up into the roof : and she had hid them among the stalks of flax , [Heb. in the flax of the wood , thus raw flax , which is not cleared from its stalks , seems to be called . There be those who conceive , that by the flax of the wood is meant cotten , which by the Greeks is called Eunivov , Eunov , wherefore abundance is found in Syria and Assyria ] which by her were placed on the roof.
\p
\v 7 Those men now pursued after them on the way of Jordan, unto the ferries . [ Understand here the ferrie, or ferries , where they are wont to passe over the Jordan ; that there their passage over might be stopped ] and the gate was shut , [viz. the City-gate , that those spies , if they were yet in the city , might not scape away ] after they were gone forth that pursued after them .
\p
\v 8 Now before they were laid down , she went up to them upon the roof,
\p
\v 9 And she spake unto these men , I know that the LORD hath given you this land , and that your terror is fallen upon us , [ i.e. the terror because of you , or for your sake ] and that all the inhabitants of the land are melted before your face.
\p
\v 10 For we have heard that the LORD dried up the waters of the red-sea before your face , when ye went forth out of Egypt , and what ye did unto the two Kings of the Amorites , Sihon and Og, who were on the other side of Jordan , whom ye banned . [ or devoted to destruction .]
\p
\v 11 When we heard it , our heart melted , [ i.e. we fainted and lost all our courage . See this manner of speaking likewise , Jos.5.1. and 7.5. Deut.1.28. And 20.8. Isa. 13,7. Ezech.21.14. Nehem.2.12 , etc.] neither did there remain any more courage in any man , because of your presence : for the LORD your God is a God in the heaven above , and on the earth beneath.
\p
\v 12 Now then, swear unto me ( I pray) by the LORD , because I have shewed kindnesse unto you : that ye likewise will shew kindeness unto my fathers house , [ i.e. kindred . See Jos. 23,25.] and give me a true token ,
\p
\v 13 That ye will save alive my father and my mother , as also my brethren , and my sisters , with all that they have ; and that ye will deliver our soules from death. [i.e.our persons .]
\p
\v 14 Then said those men unto her , Let our soul be to die for you , [ i.e. we will spare and protect both you and yours , though it should cost us our life ] if ye discover not this our businesss : [ i.e. thou, or any of thine ] It shall then be , when the LORD giveth us this land , that we will show [Heb. do ] kindnesse and faithfulnesse unto thee.
\p
\v 15 Then she let them down by a cord through the window : for her house wa upon the city wall , and she dwelt upon the wall.
\p
\v 16 And she said unto them , Get up to the mountain , lest preadventure the pursuers meet you , and hide your selves there three dayes , untill the pursuers shall be returned , and afterward go your way.
\p
\v 17 Also those men said unto her : we will be guiltlesse [ i.e. free . So likewise , verse 20.] of this thy oath [ i.e.of the oath whereby thou hast engaged us ] hich thou hast caused us to swear.
\p
\v 18 Behold , when we come into the land , thou shalt tie this line of scarlet thred to the window , whereby thou shalt have let us down , and thou shalt gather unto thee into the house , thy father , and thy mother , and thy brethren and the whole household of thy father .
\p
\v 19 So shall it be , that whosoever shall go forth out of the doors of thy house , let his blood be upon his head , [ i.e. let him be guilty of it himself, if his blood be shed ] and we shall be guiltlesse, but whosoever shall be with thee in the house , his blood be upon our head , if any hand shall be against him.
\p
\v 20 But if thou shalt make known this our businesse , then we shall be guiltlesse of this by oath , which thou hast made us swear.
\p
\v 21 Then she said , Bee it so according to your words : then she let them go , and they departed , and she tied the scarlet line to the window.
\p
\v 22 They then went their way , and came up into the mountain , and abode there three dayes , untill the pursuers were returned : for the pursuers had sought them all the way , [ viz. towards Jordan , but they sought then not upon the mountain , where the spies lay close ] but not found them.
\p
\v 23 So these two men returned , [ i.e. they came again into their right way , from which they were departed , that they might not fall into the hands of those that pursued after them ] and descended from the mountain , and passed over , [ to wit , over Jordan ] and came to Josua the sun of Nun , and they related unto him whatsoever had befallen them . [ Heb. whatsoever had found them.]
\p
\v 24 And they said unto Josua , Assuredly the LORD hath given us that land into our hands , for even all the inhabitants of the land are melted before our faces .
\c 3
\s Joshua with the Israelites being departed from Sittim , cometh to Jordan , v.1. & c. the officers give direction when , and in what manner the people and the priests should march, 2. joshua comforteth and encourageth the people , declaring the wonderfull work which the LORD should do before their eyes , 9. drying up Jordan , untill the ark and all the people should have passed over it on drie-foot : 13.
\p
\v 1 Josua then rose early in the morning , and they journeyed from Sittim, and came unto Jordan , he and all the children of Israel : and they over-nighted there before they marched over .
\p
\v 2 And it came to passe , that the Officers at the end of three dayes , [ Understand the end of the three dayes , wherof is spoken above chap.1.11. & see concerning this manner of speaking , Deut.15.1.] went thorow the midst of the Camp :
\p
\v 3 And charged the people , saying : When ye see the Ark of the covenant of the LORD your God , and the Leviticall Priests [ i.e. who were all of the tribe of Levi but all that were of the tribe, were not Priests ] bearing the same , do you likewise remove from your place , and follow after it .
\p
\v 4 Yet so that there be space between you , and between it about two thousand ells ( or cubits) in measure , and approach not unto it , that ye may know that way which ye shall go , for ye passed not that way yesterday ( and) eve yesterday . [ i.e. heretofore. See Genes.31.2.]
\p
\v 5 Josua said [ viz. before ; or had said ] also unto the people , hallow your selves ; [ Of hallowing , see Exod. 19.10. Levit 20.7. Num. 11.18. Jos. 7.13. and 1 Sam.16.5.] for to morrow the LORD will do wonders in the midst of you. [ See below v. 15, etc. ]
\p
\v 6 Likewise Josua spake unto the Priests , saying , Take up the ark of the covenant , and passe over before the face of the people : Then they tooke up the Ark of the covenant , and they went before the face of the people .
\p
\v 7 For the LORD had said unto Josua , This day will I begin to magnifie thee [ i.e.bring thee in repute & esteem by this miracle which I will do , whereby the people of Israel shall know that I have made thee the head over them and that by thy ministry I will bring them into the land of Canaan : ] before the eyes of all Israel : that they may know that I will be with thee , even as I have been with Moseh.
\p
\v 8 Thou then shalt command the Priests , who bear the Ark of the covenant , saying : when ye are come unto the brink of the water of Jordan , stand still in Jordan.
\p
\v 9 Then Josua said unto the children of Israel , Draw neer hither , and hear the words of the LORD your God .
\p
\v 10 Moreover, josua said , hereby [ To wit, by this miracle , which is related , verse 13.]ye shall acknowledge that the living God is in the midst of you , [ Oth. that God is living in the midst of us ] and that he will wholly drive out before your face the Canaanites , and the Hethites , and the Hivites , and the Perezites , and the Girgasites , and the Amorites , and the Jebusites .
\p
\v 11 Behold the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth , [ Oth. the Ark of the covenant ( yea) the Lord of the whole earth . Compare Micah 4.13. Zach.4.14. and 6.5. ] passeth thorow before your face into Jordan .
\p
\v 12 Now then take ye unto yourselves twelve men out of the tribes of Israel , [ viz. to offer that which is mentioned , below chap 4.2, etc .] out of every tribe a man [ Heb. one man , one man out of one tribe .]
\p
\v 13 For it shall come to passe , assoon as the soles of the feet of the Priests who bear the Ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth , shall rest in the waters of Jordan , that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off , [ Intimating , that the warer which descended from above should stand still , the other should run down ] ( to wit ) the waters which came down from above , and they shall remain standing upon one heap .
\p
\v 14 And it came to passe when the people removed out of their tents , to passe over Jordan , that the Priests did bear the Ark of the covenant before the face of the people .
\p
\v 15 And they that bare the Ark were come unto Jordan , and the feet of the Priests that bare the Ark were dipped in the outmost (part) of the water ( Jordan now was full all the dayes of harvest [ i.e. it was wont to be full at this time , that in his nature , and so was it likewise also at this time ] on [ Oth. above . See above chap.4.18.] all his banks : )
\p
\v 16 the waters which came down from above , stood : they rose up upon an heap , very far off from the citie Adam [ This city is placed in some Maps on the east-side of Jordan over against Gilgal ] which ( lieth) on the side of Zartan , [ a place situate South-wards from adamon the east-side of Jordan . See of two other Zarthans , 1 Kings 4.12. and 7.46.] and those that came down toward the Sea of the plain ( to wit ) the salt Sea , [ Heb. the sea of salt , see gen. 14.5.] they passed away , they were cut off : [ intimaing that the lowermost waters with a speedy current straight-way descended , and emptied themselves or were swallowed in the salt-sea , that the people of God might walk on drie foot in the bottom of the River , ] then the people passed over , right against Jericho .
\p
\v 17 But the Priests that bare the Ark of the covenant of the LORD , stood firm on the drie (ground ) in the midst of Jordan : and all Israel went over upon the drie (ground ) untill all the people had made an end to passe thorow Jordan.
\c 4
\s God commandeth to carry twelve stones out of Jordan , in remembrance that the Israelites had passed thorow the same on dry foot , verse 1. & c, Josua orders it to be done so, 4. the children of Israel perform it , 8. Josua also setteth up twelve stones for a memoriall in the midst of Jordan, 9. The order which the people and the Priests kept in passing thorow Jordan , 10. The Reubenites , Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh march armed before them , 12. God magnifieth Josua in the sight of the Israelites , 14 . The Priests are commanded to come up out of Jordan with the Ark , 15.the waters of Jordan return to their place , 18.The time of this passage , 19. Twelve stones are set up at Gilgal, 20. To what purpose, 21.
\p
\v 1 Now it came to passe, when all the people had made an end to passe over Jordan , that the LORD spake unto Josua , [Further declaring the charge which he had given him , above chap.3. v.12.] saying :
\p
\v 2 Take ye to your selves men out of the people , out of every tribe one man [ Heb. one man , one man out of the tribe , as verse 5,]
\p
\v 3 And command them , saying : Take up for your selves , hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the standing place of the feet of the Priests , and prepare twelve stones , and bring them over with you, and place them in the night camp [ To wit, Gilgal, as appeareth below verse 19,20.] where you shall overnight (or lodge) this night .
\p
\v 4 Josua then called those twelve men whom he had caused to be appointed of the children of Israel , out of every tribe one man,
\p
\v 5 And Josua said unto them : Passe over before the Ark of the LORD your God , into the midst of Jordan and take up to you every on a stone upon his shoulder , according to the number of tribes of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 6 That this may be a token [ i.e. memorial . v.7. it is called a memorial ] among you : when your children shall ask to morrow [ see Gen. 30. vers. 33. Exod. 13.14. Deut. 6.20. ] saying : what are these stones to you ? [ i.e. to what purpose serve these stones ? or, what do they signifie ? so likewise , v.21. See exod. 11.26.]
\p
\v 7 then ye shall say unto them : Because the waters of Jordan were cut off [ i.e. divided . See chapter 3. v .16.] before the Ark of the covenant of the LORD ; when it marched thorow Jordan , the waters of Jordan were cut off , therefore these stones shall be a memoriall unto the children of Israel for ever . [ see Gen. 13. on verse 15.]
\p
\v 8 Now the children of Israel did so , according as Joshua had commanded ; and they took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan , according as the LORD had spoken unto Joshua , according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel : and they brought them over with them unto the night-camp, [ see above v.3.] and placed them there.
\p
\v 9 Joshua also set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan , at the standing place of the feet of the Priests that bare the Ark of the covenant : and they are there unto this day.
\p
\v 10 Now the Priests that bare the Ark , stood in the midst of Jordan , untill every thing was fulfilled , which the LORD had commanded Joshua to declare unto the people , according to all that Moseh had commanded Josua : [See Num. 27.21.] and the people hasted , and passed over.
\p
\v 11 And it came to passe , when all the people had made an end to passe over : then the Ark of the LORD passed over , and the priests before the face of the people . [ i.e. in the view of all the people .]
\p
\v 12 And the children of Reuben and the children of God , together with the half tribe of Manasseh , marched armed before the face of the children of Israel : [ To wit, before the other tribes of the children of Israel . See chap.1.14. ] according as Moseh had spoken unto them .
\p
\v 13 About fourty thousand men , well prepared men of war , marched before the LORD [ i.e. before the LORD , who did manifest himself upon the Ark of the covenant .See Numb.32.21. ] unto battell , to the plain fields of Jericho.
\p
\v 14 The same day did the LORD magnifie Josua before the eyes of all Israel : and they feared him : even as they had feared Moseh , all the dayes of his life .
\p
\v 15 The LORD now spake unto Josua , [ i.e. had said and so also verse 17. ] saying :
\p
\v 16 Command the Priests that bear the Ark of the testimony , that they come up out of Jordan .
\p
\v 17 Then Josua commanded the Priests , Saying : Come up out of Jordan .
\p
\v 18 And it came to passe, when the Priests , who bare the Ark of the covenant of the LORD , were gone up out of the midst of Jordan , (and ) the soles of the Priests feet were drawn off upon the dry (ground ) that the waters of Jordan returned into their place , and went as yesterday (and ) eve yesterday on all his ( Jordans ) banks .
\p
\v 19 Now the people were come up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first moneth : And they camped themselves at Gilgal , [ viz. in the place which Josua afterward called Gilgal , below chap 5.9.] on the east-side of Jericho.
\p
\v 20 And Josua set up twelve stones in Gilgal , which they had taken out of Jordan.
\p
\v 21 And he spake unto the children of Israel , saying : When your children shall ask their fathers to morrow , saying What are these stones ?
\p
\v 22 Then ye shall tell your children , saying : on the dry (ground) did Israel [ i.e. the posterity of Israel , or, Jacob] passe thorow this Jordan .
\p
\v 23 For the LORD caused the waters of Jordan to be dried up before your faces , untill ye were passed thorow it , even as the LORD your God did unto the Red-sea , which he caused to be dried up before our face , untill we [ viz. I , Caleb , and your fathers ] were gone thorow it.
\p
\v 24 That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD , that it is strong : [ Oth. for it is strong ] that ye might fear the LORD your God all dayes . [ Heb. all the dayes .]
\c 5
\s All the Kings of the Amorites , and of the Canaanites are sorely affrighted , hearing of the drying up of Jordan , and of the Israelites passage thorow it , v.1, & c. The males of the Israelites born in the wildernesse , are circumcised by the command of God, 2 . where they likewise celebrate the passeover , 10.The Manna ceaseth , after they had eaten of the corn of the land , 12. CHRIST , the Prince of the people appeareth unto Josua in the form or shape of a man of war , 13.
\p
\v 1 And it came to passe , when all the Kings of the Amorites , which (were) on this side of Jordan west-ward , [i.e. inhabiting the West part , in the land of Canaan ] and all the Kings of the Canaanites , which (were) by the Sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan before the face of the children of Israel , untill we were passed it : Their heart melted , [ i.e. they fainted ; see chapter 2.9, 24.] there was no more courage in them , before the face of the children of Israel .
\p
\v 2 At that time the LORD spake unto Josua , Make thee stone knives , [ Oth. sharp knives . Heb. swords , or knives of rocks, as Exod.4.25.] and circumcise again [Heb. return circumcise ; i.e. circumcise again , an Hebrew manner of speaking , see Numb. 11. on v.4. Psal.85.7. Ezech.8.6. The circumcision was first enjoyned unto Abraham and his seed , and was afterward continued till in Egypt , where those who were come out of Egypt were also circumcised : but for as much as circumcision was not administered unto those that were born in the wildernesse , therefore the same is here again by Gods command re-assumed ] the children of Israel the second time .
\p
\v 3 Then Josua made him stone-knives , and circumcised the children of Israel , [ viz. those, who as yet were not circumcised , which were those that were born in the wildernesse ] upon the hill of the foreskins . [ some keep the Hebrew word Areloth used in the text , which signifieth foreskins , because the foreskins of the children of Israel weren there circumcised.]
\p
\v 4 Now this was the cause wherefore Josua circumcised them : all the people that went out of Egypt , the males , all the men of war , died in the wildernesse by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
\p
\v 5 For all the people that came out thence were circumcised ; but all the people that were born in the wildernesse by the way , after they came forth out of Egypt , ( them) they [ To wit, the Parents ] had not circumcised . [ this was omitted, either through negligence and heedlessenesse , or because they knew not the precise time when they were to march ; and it would be very troublesom , yea doubtless prove exceeding dangerous to those that were but newly circumcised , immediately to march upon it .]
\p
\v 6 For the children of Israel marched fourty years in the wildernesse , till all the people of the men of war , that were gone out of Egypt , who had not obeyed the voice of the LORD , were consumed : to whom the LORD had sworn, that he would not let them see the land , which the LORD had sworn unto their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey .
\p
\v 7 But he [viz. the Lord God ] hath put their sons in their stead , those did Joshua circumcise , because they had the foreskin , for they had not circumcised them by the way.
\p
\v 8 And it came to passe , when they had made an end of circumcising all the people , that they abode in their place in the camp, untill they were healed . [ Heb. untill they lived , as Numb.21,8.]
\p
\v 9 Moreover the LORD spake unto Josua , This day have I called away the reproach of Egypt [ So he calleth the foreskin , which the Israelites had left on their children , herein rather following the example of uncircumcised Egyptians , then the command of God . See Jerem.9.25,26 . Some understand by the reproach of Egypt , the reproach, or aspersion , which the Egyptians would have cast upon God and his people , if they should have been excluded out of the land of Canaan : See Deut.9.26. ] from you : [ Heb. from upon you ; i.e. which lay upon you] therefore the name of the place was called Gilgal, [ i.e. rolling , rolling away , because by circumcision the shame or reproach of the Israelites was as it were rolled away ] unto this day . [ viz. keepeth the name , or that place beareth his name ]
\p
\v 10 While the children of Israel lay encamped at Gilgal , they kept the passeover [ Heb. they made, & c, The celebrating of the passeover was likewise in the wilderness , save in the second year after their going out of Egypt , intermitted ; see Numb.9.1.] on the fourteenth day of the same moneth . [ viz. on the fourteenth day of the first moneth of the year , as appearrth, Jos. 4.19.] in the evening , on the plain fields of Jericho.
\p
\v 11 And they did eat of the ladt yeare s corn of the land , the second day of the Passeover , unleavened bread , and parched eares , even the same day.
\p
\v 12 And the Manna ceased the next day , after they had eaten of the last yeare s corn of the land , and the children of Israel had no more Manna , but they did eat of the revenue of the land of Canaan , the self-same year .
\p
\v 13 Moreover, it came to passe when Josua was by Jericho , that he lift up his eyes , and looked , there stood a man over against him , [ This was the Lord Christ in the shape of a man , as may be gathered from chap.6.2.] which had a drawn sword in his hand : [ viz. thereby to encourage Josua , giving him to understand , that he would be with him , and fight on his side against the Canaanites, and cause him to have the victory ] And Josua went unto him , and said , art thou ours , or our enemies?
\p
\v 14 And he said , NO, [ i.e. I belong not to your enemies ] but I am the Prince of the host of the LORD , [ viz. Christ, taking care of the camp of the Israelites, which are the Lords people ] I am now come : then Josua fell on his face to the earth , and worshipped , [ for he knew him to be the true God . If this had been but a created Angel , he would not have suffered himself to be honored thus , as may be seen , Revel. 19.20. and 22.6.] and said unto him , what speaketh my Lord unto his servant ?
\p
\v 15 Then said the Prince of the host of the LORD unto Josua , Pluck off thy shoes from thy feet , [ This God likewise commanded Moseh , Exod.3.5. see also Act. 7.33. for the place whereon thou standest , is holy : [ Heb. holinesse . Wherefore was this place holy ? because the Lord had hallowed it by his special presence . See Exod.3.5. And the annotat. there ] and Josua did so.
\c 6
\s The Lord giveth the city of Jericho into the hand of Josua verse. 1, & c. yet causeth first the souldiers, as also the Ark and few Priests to go round about the city, for seventeen dayes together ,2. On the seventh day the city is taken , the wall falling down , 20. The Israelites fall in on all sides , and destroy with the sword both men cattell , 21. Notwithstanding they spare Rachab with all that appertaineth to her , 22. The city and all that is in it , is burnt, except the gold, silver, copper, and iron vessels , 24. Josua curseth that man, that should build up Jericho again , 26.God is with Josua,27.
\p
\v 1 Now Jericho shut the ( gates,) and was shut before the children of Israel , [ viz. for fear of the children of Israel ] there none went forth , neither did any go in there .
\p
\v 2 Then the LORD [ Above chap.5.13. he is called a man ] said unto Josua , Behold, I have given Jericho into thine hand , with her King , and valiant champions .
\p
\v 3 Then all ye that are men of war , shall go round the city , compassing the city once , thus shall ye do seven dayes together .
\p
\v 4 And seven priests shall bear seven rams-trumpets [ i.e. Trumpets made of rams-horns ] before the Ark. And on the seventh day ye shall go about the city seven times : and the Priests shall blow with the trumpets .
\p
\v 5 And it shall come to passe , when they blow slowly with the rams-horn, when ye hear the sound of the trumpet , that all the people shall shout with a great shout , then shall the city-wall [ Understand this onely of a part of the wall , for if all the wall had fallen , then must all Rahabs house have fallen , for it stood upon the wall above chap 2. verse 15.] fall down , [ Heb. on its place ]and the people shall ascend into it , every man over against himself .
\p
\v 6 Then Josua the son of Nun called the Priests , and said unto them , Carry the Ark of the covenant : and let seven Priests bear seven rams-trumpets before the Ark of the LORD.
\p
\v 7 And unto the people he said , Passe thorow , and go round about this city : and let him that is prepared , [ i.e. armed ] passe on before the Ark of the LORD .
\p
\v 8 And it came to passe , that according as Josua had spoken unto the people , so the seven Priests went , bearing seven rams-trumpets before the face of the LORD , [ See above the annotat. on chap.4. verse 13.] they marched on , and blew with the trumpet : and the Ark of the covenant [i.e. the Ark in which the two tables lay , where in the covenant was written ] of the LORD , followed after them,
\p
\v 9 And he that was ready (armed) went before the face of the Priests that blew the trumpets : and the rereward followed after the Ark , [See Numb 10. on v.25.]whilest they went and blew with the trumpets ,
\p
\v 10 Now Josua had commanded the people , saying , ye shall not shout , yea ye shall not cause your voice to be heard nether shall any word be uttered out of your mouth untill the day when I shall say unto you , Shout ,then shall ye shout .
\p
\v 11 And he caused the Ark of the LORD to go round about the city , compassing ( the same) once : then came they ( again ) into the camp , and overnighted in the camp.
\p
\v 12 Afterward Josua rose early in the morning , and the Priests carried the Ark of the LORD .
\p
\v 13 And the seven Priests bearing the seven rams trumpets before the Ark of the LORD , went on , and blew with the trumpets : and the armed (men) marched before their faces , and the rereward followed after the Ark of the LORD , whilest they went and blew with the trumpets .
\p
\v 14 So they went once round about the city on the second day , and they returned into the camp : thus they did for seven dayes together .
\p
\v 15 And it came to passe that they rose up early, by break of day ; and they went round about the Citie in the same manner seven times : onely on that day they went seven times round about the Citie.
\p
\v 16 And it came to pass at the seventh time when the Priests blew with the Trumpets , that Josua spake unto the people , Shout , for the LORD hath given you the Citie.
\p
\v 17 Yet this Citie shall be banned ( or accursed ) to the LORD , [ See Deut. 2.34.] it and all that is in it : onely Rachab the harlot shall remain alive , she and all that are with her in the house , because she hid [some read it , well,or, diligently hid ] the messengers whom we [ viz. I and the Rulers without the peoples notice , above, chap.2.1. and 4.6.] sent out .
\p
\v 18 Onely beware of the banned (thing)lest peradventure ye ban your selves ; [ i.e. because that ye be destroyed ] by taking of the banned (thing) and make the Camp of Israel to be a ban, and trouble to the same.
\p
\v 19 But all the silver and gold , and the copper and iron vessels shall be holy unto the LORD : [Hebr. Holiness ]they shall come to the treasure of the LORD.
\p
\v 20 Then the people shouted when they [ To wit , the seven Priests] blew with the Trumpets : and it came to pass , when the people heard the sound of the trumpet , that the people shouted with a great shout , and the wall fell down, and the people ascended into the Citie , every man over against himself, and they took the citie .
\p
\v 21 And they banned all that was in the citie [i.e. utterly destroyed all , as the manner was to deal with thing banned or accursed . See Deteronomy 2. on verse 34.]from the man to the woman , from the chld to the aged , and to the Ox and the small Cattell, and the Ass , with the edge of the sword . [ Hebr. the mouth of the sword .]
\p
\v 22 Now Josua said unto the two men , the spies of the land , Go into the house of the woman , the harlot, and bring out thence the woman with all that she hath, according as ye sware unto her .
\p
\v 23 Then the young men and the spies went in thither , and brought out Rachab, and her father , and her mother, and her brethren , and all that she had , also they brought out all her families ; [ Or, generation or , kinreds , to wit , which were allied to her ] and they placed them without the Camp of Israel , [viz. so long time untill they were well instructed in the Israelitish religion , and so admitted into the Congregation of God ; see Deut. 21.10.]
\p
\v 24 Now they burnt the Citie with fire , and all that was therein : onely the silver and the gold , together with the copper and Iron vessels , they gave to the treasure of the house of the LORD ; [ viz.of the Tabernacle ; see above v.19. and Numb.31.54.]
\p
\v 25 Thus Josua suffered Rachab the harlot to live , and the family of her father , and all that she had , and she dwelt in the midst of Israel [Yea, she was married afterward in the Tribe of Juda, unto Salmon the sonne of Nahasson ,Matth.1.5.] unto this day : [ this argueth not , that Rahab and her posteritie , did not likewise afterthat time dwell among the Israelites ] because she hid the messengers which Josua sent to spie out Jericho.
\p
\v 26 And at the same time Josua adjured them , [ viz. by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost ] saying , Cursed be that man before the face of the LORD , that shall rise up, and build this Citie Jericho ; he shall lay the foundation thereof in (or, for) his first- born son , [ i.e. it shall cost him the life of his first-born son. See the fulfilling hereof in Hiel and his sons, 1 Kings 16.34.] and shalt set up the gates thereof in his youngest son.
\p
\v 27 So the LORD was with Josua , and his fame ran thorowout all the Countrie . [ Hebr. was , & c. i.e. they talked of him in all the circumjacent Countreyes.]
\c 7
\s The wrath of the LORD is kindled against Israel , because Achan had taken of the banned goods , verse 1. etc. Josua dispatched forces to Ai, 2. there thirtie six Israelites are slain , 5.Josua and the eldest of Israel are much astonished thereat , and do humble themselves before the LORD , 6. Who discovereth unto him the cause of this defeat . 11. And enjoyneth him to finde out by lot the man that had stollen the banned goods , 14. and to burn him and all he had , 15. Achan is found to be the guiltie person , 16. He and all his are stoned , and burnt , 24.
\p
\v 1 But the children of Israel [Understand one of the children of Israel , viz. Achan. Compare Judges 12. on verse 7.] transgressed , by transgressing with the banned (thing :) [ viz. against the Law of God , touching the banned things ] for Achan [ 1 Chronicles 2.7. he is called Achar , i.e. the troubler ]the son of Charmi , the son of Zabdi ; [ he is also called Simri, 1 Chron.2.6.] the son of Zerah, of the Tribe of Juda, took of the banned (thing) [see above chap.6.18,19.] then the anger of the LORD kindled against the children of Israel . [ for one mans sinne God is incensed against the whole Congregation of the Israelites. See Jos. 22,20.]
\p
\v 2 When Josua sent men fron Jericho to Ai, [ Ai was seated upon a hill three leagues westward from Jericho , , in that part of the Land of Canaan , which fell to the Tribe of Benjamin . There was likewise another Ai, in the Tribe of Gad , which the Amminites had taken , against which Jeremy prophesieth , chap.49.3.] which lieth by Beth-aven , on the East of Bethel , he spake unto them , saying, Go up, and spie out the land : so these men went up and spied out Ai.
\p
\v 3 Afterward they returned unto Josua , and said unto him , Let not all the people go up , let about two thousand men, or about three thousand men go up to smite Ai, do not tire all the people thither , for they are few .
\p
\v 4 So there went up thither from the people about three thousand men , which fled before the face of the men at Ai.
\p
\v 5 And the men at Ai smote of them about six and thirtie men , and pursued them ( from ) before the gate unto Schebarm , [ This place was first so called from this defeat of the Israelites . Sheborum signifieth breakings , or, shiverings , because the Israelites Army was there broken and hewen asunder ] and smote them in a descent : then the heart of the people melted , and it became water .
\p
\v 6 Then Josua rent his clothes [ In token of great grief and anguish of heart , see Gen.37.29.] and fell to the earth upon his face before the Ark of the LORD , untill the evening , he and the eldest of Israel ; and they cast dust upon their head .[ this the Israelites were wont to doe in token of sorrow and astonishment , 1 Sam . 4.12. and 2 Sam 13.19. Jon. 3.6. Mich.1.10.]
\p
\v 7 And Josua said , Ah, Lord LORD wherefore hast thou ever made this people go through Jordan , [ Heb. passing made pass . Here Josua seemeth somewhat to start aside through humane fraitie by reason of the damage sustained ] to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites ; [ understand here under all the seven Nations that possessed the land which the LORD had promised to give unto the Israelites ] to destroy us ? [oth. that we had been content , and remained on the other side of Jordan .]
\p
\v 8 O LORD ! [ Heb. in me Lord , see Gen 43.on v.20.] what shall I say, seeing that israel hath turned the neck before the face of his enemies ?
\p
\v 9 When the Canaanites and all the Inhabitants of the Land shall hear it , they will surround us and destroy our name from the earth : What wilt thou then do to thy great Name ? [ As if he had said , how wilt thou preserve thy great and glorious Name, when the Canaanites shall say that thou hast not now any more the power to defend us , and to subdue them , as thou in times past hast done ]
\p
\v 10 Then the LORD said unto Josua , Arise : wherefore liest thou thus down upon thy face ? [ Heb. properly art thou falling down .]
\p
\v 11 Israel hath sinned [ i.e. one among the Israelites , viz Achan ] and have likewise transgressed my covenant , [ i.e. my commandment , whereunto they have obliged themselves in the covenant , to observe the same . See above chap.6.18.] which I commanded them : and they have also taken of the banned (thing ,) [ which I commanded to be banned , chapter 6.24. ]and likewise stollen , [viz. that which ought to have been brought into the Treasury of the Lord , above chap.6.19. ] and likewise lied [ Oth. denyed , disavouched ] and have likewise put it among their stuff .
\p
\v 12 Therefore the children of Israel shall not be able to subsist before the face of their enemies , they shall turn the neck before the face of their enemies , for they are in the ban [ i.e. they are fallen into the punishment or judgement which I intended to bring those banned nations , because they have transgressesd in the banned thing ]I will henceforward be no more with you , unlesse you put away the ban [ i.e. him that hath deserved to be banned , because he hath transgressed in the thing . So also below 13.13.] from the midst of you.
\p
\v 13 Arise, hallow the people , [ i.e. cause the people to purifie themselves unto holinesse , by the ceremonies appointed by God , Exod.19.10.] and say, hallow your selves against to morrow : for thus saith the God of Israel , here is a ban in the midst of thee Israel , thou shalt not be able to subsist before the face of thine enemies , untill you put away the ban out of the midst of you.
\p
\v 14 In the morning therefore shall ye come on according to your tribes : and it shall come to passe , that the tribe whom the LORDshall have hit [ Heb. caught or taken , viz. by the lot, which the LORD directeth or disposeth , Prov. 16.33. See 1 Sam.14.41. Jon.1.7.] the same shall come on according to the families , and the family which the LORD shall have hit , the same shall come on by housholds, [ Heb. houses ] and the houshold which the LORD shall have hit , the same shall come on man to man .[Heb. with men.]
\p
\v 15 And it shall come to passe , that whosoever shall be hit with the ban , [ i.e. with the banned thing , or stolen goods ] the same shall be burned with fire , [viz.after that he shal have been stoned to death . See Num.15.30,35.] he, and all that he hath : because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD , and because he hath committed folly in In Israel .[i.e. notorious crime , or abomination .Thus the rape of Dina was called , Gen. 34.7. and the abusing of the Levites wife , Exod.20.6.]
\p
\v 16 Then Josua rose up early in the morning , and caised Israel to come on according to their tribes , and the tribe of Judah was hit .
\p
\v 17 Then he caused the family [i.e. the Tribe , or each family thereof ] of Juda to come on , he hit the family of Zarhi : When he caused the family of Zarhi to come on man for man , [ Heb. by men ; i.e. according to the housholds of the fathers , head by head, every one as v.18.] Zabdi was hit .
\p
\v 18 Whose houshold when he caused to come on man for man, then was hit Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Juda.
\p
\v 19 Then Josua said unto Achan , My son , Give , ( I pray) the honnor unto the LORD, the God of Israel , and make confession before him : [ Heb. put etc. When Achan confessed his trespasse committed, he gave the honor to God , that he had hit him right .] and tell me ( I pray ) what thou hast done , and hide it not before me.
\p
\v 20 Now Achan answered Josua , and said , Verily I have sinned against the LORD , the God of Israel, and have done thus and thus . [ viz. as the LORD hath spoken , v.11.]
\p
\v 21 And I saw among the prey a beautifull [ Heb. good ]stately Babylonish upper garment , [Heb. a cloak of Sineor . See Gen.10.v.10.] and two hundred shekels of Silver , [ this is the moiety of the price, for which Abraham bought the double cave of Ephron, 200 . common shekels making 50 Ryx-dollers ] and a golden tongue ( or wedge ) [ a long and broad piece of gold , in fashion of a tongue , whatever it was ] whose weight was fifty shekels , and I coveted it , and took it , and behold , they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent , and the silver under it. [ viz. under the Babylonish garment.]
\p
\v 22 Then Josua sent messengers thither , who run to the tent ; and behold , it lay hid, [ viz. the goods , Or the garments : ] in his tent , and the silver underneath.
\p
\v 23 They took those things out of the midst of the tent , and they brought them unto Josua , and to all the children of Israel , and poured them out before the face of the LORD , [ i.e. before the Tent of the congregation where the ark ( which was the holy place of Gods presence ) was : for this whole consecration was made in a generall assembly of the people .]
\p
\v 24 Then Josua , and all Israel with him , took Achan ,the son of Zerah , [ i.e. great grand-childe. See v.1.] and the silver , and the stately upper garment , and the golden tongue , and his sons and his daughters , and his oxen and his asses , and all that he had , and carried them unto the valley of Achor . [ i.e. the valley of trouble , afterwards so called , from this history v.26. ]
\p
\v 25 And josua said , thou hast troubled us : [ Of the word to trouble , see 1 Kings 18. on v. 17.] the LORD shall this day trouble thee : and all Israel stoned him [ viz. Achan ; understand hereby also all his , as v.26 ] with stones , and they burned them with fire , and they cast them all over with stones .
\p
\v 26 And they raised over him a great heap of stones being unto this day : thus the LORD turned himself from the heat of his wrath : therefore they called [ Oth. he called , viz. Josua ] the name of the place , The valley of Achor . [ i.e. the valley of trouble , because all the people of Israel were here troubled and grieved for Achans theft : and because he also was therein troubled by a terrible judgement , v.25.]
\c 8
\s God putteth new courage into Josua , and commandeth him to go and besiege Ai, promiseth him that he shall take it , v.1, & c. Josua besiegeth Ai , and layeth an ambush against it 3. and they take it by stratagem and by surprisall , 19. Ai is burned , 20. The King of Ai is taken prisoner, 23. All the inhabitants of the city are put to the sword , 25. and the cattell and other goods are spoiled , 27 . Ai is made an heap of stones , 28. The King thereof hanged , 29.Josua buildeth an Altar unto the LORD , 30. according to Gods command , and offered thereon , 31. he writeth the Law of Moseh in stones , 32. Causeth the same with its blessings and curses to be read before all the people upon the mountains , Gerisim, and Ebal. 33.
\p
\v 1 Then the LORD said unto Josua , Fear not , neither be dismayed , take with thee all the people of war , and go thou , march up to Ai, I have given it into thine hand the King of Ai, and his people , and his city , and his land .
\p
\v 2 Thou now shalt do unto Ai and her King according as thou didest unto Jericho and her King , for that he shall prey for your selves , the prey thereof and the cattell thereof , then put (or lay ) thee an ambush against the city , from behinde it .
\p
\v 3 Then Josua arose , and all the people of war , to march up to ward Ai : and Josua chose out thirty thousand men of valour , and sent them forth by night .
\p
\v 4 And commanded them, saying : Behold , ye shall lie in ambush behinde the city , keep your selves not very far from the city ; and be ye all ready .
\p
\v 5 I now and all the people that are with me , will draw neere to the city : and it shall come to passe , when they shall go out to meet us , even as at the first , that we will flee before their face .
\p
\v 6 Let them therefore come out after us till we draw them off from the Citie , for they will say , They flee before our faces as at first, therefore we will flee before their faces .
\p
\v 7 Then shall ye rise up out of the ambush , [ viz. when ye shall see the token which I will give you ; see verse 18.] and ye shall take up the Citie ; [ oth. ye shall expel the Citie ; i.e. the residue of the inhabitants of the Citie ] for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.
\p
\v 8 And it shall come to pass, when ye have taken the Citie , that ye shall set the Citie on fire , according to the Word of the LORD shall ye doe , lo , I have commanded it you.
\p
\v 9 So Josua sent them forth , and they went to the ambush , and they abode between Bethel , and between Ai , toward the West of Ai : but Josua overnighted ( or lodged ) that night in the midst of the people .
\p
\v 10 And Josua rose up early in the morning , and he mustered the people : [ oth. numbred , put them in order , ( or , aray ) viewed them ] and he marched up , he and the Eldest of Israel , before the face of the people , to Ai.
\p
\v 11 Also all the people of War , that were with him , marched up, and they drew near and came over against the Citie : and they camped themselves toward the Nort of Ai, and there was a valley betwixt him and betwixt Ai.
\p
\v 12 He took likewise about five thousand men : and he placed them for an ambush betwixt Bethel , and btwixt Ai on the West of the Citie .
\p
\v 13 And they put the people , [ viz. in order ] all the Camp , that was on the North of the Citie , and its ambush [ The Hebrew word signifieth properly heel , Supplanting , or , treading under foot ; yet it is also used for craft, deceitfull snares and gins , oth. its utmost end ] was on the West of the Citie : and Josua went the same night into the midst of the valley ; [ whereof above verse 11.]
\p
\v 14 And it came to pass , when the King of Ai saw ( that) then they made haste, and got up early , and the men of the Citie came forth to meet Israel , to battell , he, all his people [ i.e. with the greatest part of the people , for that some people still remained in the Citie is manifest verse 16.] at the appointed time , [ or the appointed , or prefixed place ] before the plain field ; for he knew not that any one laid an ambush against him from behind the Citie .
\p
\v 15 Josua then and all Israel were beaten before their faces ; [ This is not to be understood according to the letter , as if any of the Israelites were indeed and in truth beaten by the men of Ai, for then the Israelites would thereby again have lost their courage ; but thereby is intimated, that they dissembled , or feigned , that they were afraid , that they should be again smitten by those of Ai ] and they fled by the way of the wildernesse. [ oth. before the wilderness ; viz. in the way of the wilderness , which is between Ai and Jericho ; viz. running back to Jericho , from whence they were come ]
\p
\v 16 Therefore all the people that were in the Citie , were called together to pursue after them , and they pursued after Josua , and were drawn off from the Citie .
\p
\v 17 And there was not a man [ viz. that was fit for the battel ; compare below , verse 24.] left in Ai, nor Bethel , that marched not forth after Israel , and they left the Citie open , and pursued after Israel.
\p
\v 18 Then the LORD said unto Josua , stretch forth [ viz. for a token to those that lie in ambush that they may come forth and march on ; oth. from the 26. verse thus , stretch forth (thy hand ) with spear , or flag, standard , banner ; Compare this act of Josua with the act of Moseh , Exodus 7.11,12.] the spear , [see 1 Sam.17.6.] that is in thine hand , toward Ai, for I will give it into thine hand ; Then Josua stretched forth the spear that was in his hand toward the citie .
\p
\v 19 Then the ambush arose hastily out of their place , and ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand , and came unto the Citie , and they took it ; and they hasted , and set the citie on fire . [ Not all the city ,(for then the prey had likewise been burned ) but a part thereof , that the Israelites who made a shew as if they had fled seeing the smoke might face about and fall upon the enemy ]
\p
\v 20 When the men of Ai turned about , they saw , and behold, the smoke of the Citie ascended up to Heaven , and had no room to flee this way or that way : [ Heb. in them there were no hands to flee . Hand is taken for room , or place , Numbers 2.17. Psalm 104.25. Isa.22.18. Nehemiah 7.4. oth. no power ] for the people that fled to the wilderness turned themselves against those that pursued (them.)
\p
\v 21 And went Josua and all Israel saw , that the ambush had taken the Citie , and that the smoke of the Citie ascended , they turned about and smote the men of Ai.
\p
\v 22 Also those of the Citie [ viz. who had layen in ambush , and were now entred into the Citie , and had set the same on fire ] came against them ; [ viz. against the Citizens of Ai] so that now they [viz. the Citizens of Ai ] were in the midst of the Israelites , those on this , and those on that (side ) : and they smote them untill there remained , nor escaped a remnant among them ; [ Hebr. that there remained none among them , in saving life or escaping ]
\p
\v 23 But King of Ai they took alive , and they brought him unto Josua .
\p
\v 24 And it came to pass, when the Israelites had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai on the field , in the wilderness , wherein they [viz. the children of Israel ] had chased them , and that they were all fallen by the edge [ Hebr. the mouth ] of the sword , untill they were all destroyed ; then all Israel turned unto Ai, and smote it [viz. those that remained yet in the Citie , as old men , women children , and all that were not gone forth to battell ] with the edge of the sword .
\p
\v 25 And it came to pass, that all those that fell that dayboth men and women , [ Hebr. from the man to the woman ]were twelve thousand , all of them people of Ai.
\p
\v 26 Josua likewise drew not back his hand which he had stretched out with the spear , [ See above , v.18. This was the token whereby the Israelites might know , when they should cease from waiting or destroying the Citie ] untill he had banned all the inhabitants of Ai.[i.e. had utterly destroyed and rooted them out ]
\p
\v 27 Onely the Israelites plundred for themselves the cattell and the prey of the same Citie , according to the Word of the LORD, which he commanded Josua .
\p
\v 28 Now Josua burnt Ai, and put it to an everlasting heap, [ Hebr. an heap of Eternitie . This signifieth some times a long time . Ai was afterwards inhabited by the Benjamites , Neh.11.31.] a desolation , [ i.e. a desolate place ]unto this day.
\p
\v 29 And the King of Ai he hanged on a tree untill even-tide : [ According to the Law of God , Deut. 21.22.] and about the going down of the Sun , Josua commanded that they should take his dead body down from the tree, and they threw it at the door of the Citie-gate , and raised thereon a great heap of stones being unto this day.
\p
\v 30 Then [ viz. after they were come over to Jordan , or after they had taken Ai ] Josua built an Altar unto the LORD the God of Israel , upon mount Ebal ; [ this mount lay by Sichem as may be seen , Judges 9.6. ]
\p
\v 31 According as Moseh the servant of the LORD had commanded the children of Israel , according to that which is written in the ( Law-) book of Moseh , an Altar of whole stones , [ i.e. not smoothed or polished with the tools of the stone- cutters ] over which they had not moved ( or stirred ) [ i.e. used ] any iron : and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD , they offered also thank-offerings .
\p
\v 32 He wrote also there , upon stones , [ These were other stones , then those mentioned , verse 31.] a duplicate [ or draught, copy , repetition of the Law ] of the Law of Moseh [viz. the chiefest points of the Law , or the ten Commandements , or ( as some conceive )the blessings and curses . See Deut .17. on v.18.] which , [ or that , viz. the Law ]he wrote before the face of the children of Israel .
\p
\v 33 And all Israel with their Eldest ,and Officers , and their Judges , stood on this and on that side of the Arke , before the Levitical Priests , that bare the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD , as well strangers as natives , one half thereof over against mount Geresim , [ oth. Gerisim . Both these mountains Gerisim and Ebam are situate in the Tribe of Ephraim. Not far from Sichem ; see thereof , Deut. 11.29,30 and 27.12. Jud. 9.v.7.] and one half thereof over against mount Ebal ; as Moseh the servant of the LORD had commanded to bless the people of Israel [ withall understand , and to the curse against the transgressours of the Law ; see Deut. 27.11. and 31.10, etc.]at the first . [or , for the first time . This is added in regard the law was every seven years to be read before the people ]
\p
\v 34 And afterward he [ viz. Josua , yet by one of the Levites , as Moseh commanded Deut.27.14.] read aloud all the words of the Law , the blessing and the curse , according to all that is written in the (Law-) book.
\p
\v 35 There was not a word of all that Moseh commanded , which Josua read not aloud before all the Congregation of Israel , and the women , and the little children , and the strangers [ Understand here such kind of strangers , as had embraced and professed the Religion of the Israelites ; see above verse 33. ] that walked ( or were conversant ) in the midst of them .
\c 9
\s When all the Kings of Canaan heard of Josua's exploits ,they held counsell together , and concluded with one accordto fight against Israel , verse 1, & c. The Gibeonites feigning that they were come from farre remote Countreyes , are served alive by means of a certain deceitfull covenant which they make wit the Israelites, 3. three dayes after their craft is discovered , 16. The agreement nevertheless remaineth firm by reason of the oath , 18. But for a punishment of their deceit , they are made bond-men unto the Israelites , 21.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass , when all the Kings that were on this side of Jordan , [ viz. in the land of Canaan , wherinto the Israelites at that time were come , as also the Writer or Pen-man of this Book ] on the hills , and in the low grounds , etc in all havens [ oth. shores , roads , sands , ] of the great sea , [ i.e. the mid-land sea ] over against Libanon : the Hethites , and the Amorites , the canaanites , the Pheresites , the Hevites , and the Jebusites , [ the Girgasites are not here added , probably because they were of mean account ] heard this ;
\p
\v 2 That they gathered themselves together to fight against Josua , and against Israel with one accord . [ Hebr. with one mouth ; i.e. combining with one accord together ]
\p
\v 3 When the inhabitants at Gibeon [ This was a great City ; Jos.10.2. situate in the inheritance of the Tribe of Benjamin , and it was at this time the Metropolis or chief Citie of the Hevites , Jos.11.19. In which respect the Gibeonites did likewise appertain to those Nations , which the Lord had commanded to destroy , and with whom they might in no wise make a Covenant without Gods speciall approbation , Exodus 23.32. Deut.7.2. It was afterwards given to the Priests for a place of habitation Jos,21.17. ] heard what Josua had done with Jericho , and with Ai :
\p
\v 4 Then did they also deal craftily , [ viz. as Balak and others had done before : or , as the other Canaanitish Kings sought to defend themselves by force of armes , so these endeavoured to save themselves by craft ] and went their way , and feigned themselves to be Ambassadours , and they took old sacks upon their Asses , and old and rent , and bound up ( or patched ) [ viz. where they were rent ] lethern wine sacks (or bottles. )
\p
\v 5 Also old, and spotted [ Oth. mended ] shoes , on their feet , and they had old garments upon ( them ) ; and all the bread which they had on their journey [ Hebr. all the bread of their journey - provision ] was drie (and ) mouldie ; [ Heb. properly speckled, spotted ]
\p
\v 6 And they went to Josua into the Camp at Gilgal ; [ See Jos.5.9.] and they said unto him , and to the men of Israel [Heb. to the man of Israel ; i.e. to every one among the Israelites . Oth. to the Princes , or chiefest men of Israel ; so also below , v.7. And 14.] we are come from a far Countrey , therefore now make a Covenant with us .
\p
\v 7 Then the men of Israel said unto the Hevites , [ i.e. Gibeonites , see below chap.11, v.19. ] peradventure ye dwell in the midst of us , [in this land which is given us of God ] how shall we then make a Covenant with you ?[ this was expresly forbidden to the Israelites Exodus , 23.32. and Deut. 7.2.]
\p
\v 8 They then said unto Josua , We are thy servants : [ i.e. we subject our selves unto thy dominion and command , and are willing to receive such terms and conditions as thou shalt please to afford us , yea, though it were to make us thy slaves and bond-men,] then Josua said unto them , who are ye , and whence come ye ?
\p
\v 9 And they said unto him , thy servants [ i.e. we ] are come from a very far Countrey, because of the Name of the LORD thy God : [ i.e. having heard of the glory of the God of Israel , and of the great and mightie works which he hath done ] for we have heard his fame , and all that he did in Egypt .
\p
\v 10 And all that he did to the two Kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side of Jordan , Sihon the king of Hesbon , and Og the king of Basan ,which (dwelt) at Astoroth.
\p
\v 11 Therefore our Eldest , and all the inhabitants of our Countrey spake to us , saying , Take victual with you in your handsfor the journey , and go to meet them , and say unto them , we are thy servants ; therefore now make a Covenant with us .
\p
\v 12 This is our bread we took warm for our provision out of our houses , on the day we set out to travel unto you ; but behold , now it is drie , and it is mouldie . [ as verse 5.]
\p
\v 13 And these lethern Wine-sacks which we filled , were new, but behold , they are rent , and these our garments , and our shoes are become old , by reason of our long journey .
\p
\v 14 Then the men [ i.e. Princes of the israelites , as v.15.] took of their victual ; [ oth. they accepted , or entertained the men, because of their victual , judging by their mouldie victuals that they were come from a farre Countrey , ] and they inquired not [ viz. by the high Priest wearing the Ephod , see Numbers 27.21. See also 1 Sam.23.9.] at the mouth of the LORD . [ i.e. of the Lord who had promised to answer from the expiation cover , Exod. 25.22. ]
\p
\v 15 And Josua made peace with them , and he made a league with them , that he would save them alive : and the Princes of the congregation sware unto them . [ i.e. they ratified by oath that which josua had promised them, viz. that they should remain alive .]
\p
\v 16 And it came to passe at the end of three dayes , after they had made the league with them , that they heard they were their neighbours , and that they dwelt in the midst of them .
\p
\v 17 For when the children of Israel marched onward they came unto their cities on the third day , now their cities were Gibeon , and Chophira , [ Chophira was a city in the heritage of the tribe of Benjamin . See Jos.18.26. ] and Beeroth , [ this city lay also in the tribe of Benjamin , Jos.18.25.] and Kiriath-Jarim.
\p
\v 18 And the children of israel smote them not, because the Princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD , the God of Israel : therefore all the congregation murmured against the Princes . [ viz. because they might not destroy the Gibeonites , as wel as the other nations of the Canaanites . ]
\p
\v 19 Then all the Princes said unto all the congregation , We have sworn unto them by the LORD, the God of Israel ; therefore we might not touch them . [ viz. in hostile manner ; i.e. we may not kill them , nor suppresse them.]
\p
\v 20 This we will do to them , [ viz. which is mentioned , v.21.] to save them alive ; that there may be no great wrath upon us , [ i.e. that the LORD be not incensed against us for such perjury as this , & bring a plague upon us afterwards , as came upon Saul, 2 sam. 21.1.] because of the oath which we sware unto them [ viz. if we should break the same .]
\p
\v 21 Furthermore the Princes said unto them , [ viz. unto the children of Israel ] Let them live , and let them be hewers of wood , and drawers of water [ these were the meanest and contemptiblest among the people , Deut.29.11. ] unto all the congregation , as the Princes [ i.e. as we ] have said unto them [ viz. to the Gibeonites .]
\p
\v 22 And Josua called them , and spake unto them , saying : Wherefore have ye deceived us , Saying : We are seated very far from you whereas ye dwell in the midst of us ?
\p
\v 23 Now therefore be ye accursed , [ Understand by this curse, a temporall poor and miserable condition , as is declared in the sequel , ] and among you shall not be cut off there [ i.e. shall not cease , but there shall alwayes remain slaves in your generaion & among your posterity ] neither hewers of wood , nor drawers of water for the house of my God . [ i.e. in the Tabernacle , and afterward in the Temple , yea, for the service of the whole congregation . v.21.]
\p
\v 24 then they answered Josua and said , because it was made known to thy servants , [ relating it was related .] that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moseh , that he would give you this land , and destroy all the inhabitants of the land before your face : we were sore afraid of our lifes [ Heb. our soules ; i.e. lives , persons See Gen. 12.5. ] before your faces , therefore have we done this thing .
\p
\v 25 And now, behold , we are in thine hand : [ i.e. in thy power , and might , thou mayest impose upon us , and ours , such a service and burthen as thou pleasest ] as it is good , and as it is right in thine eyes to do unto us , do .
\p
\v 26 And so he did unto them , and he delivered them from the hand of the children of Israel , that they slew them not.
\p
\v 27 So Josua delivered them over [ Hence it is thought that they were called Nethinims ; i.e. given , delivered over ] the same day to (be) hewers of wood, and drawers of water of the congregation , and that for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day , at the place , which he should chuse .
\c 10
\s Five Kings of the Canaanites combine together to besiege Gibeon , v.1, & c. Those of Gibeon crave help of Josua , 6. He marcheth on with his army , 7.And surpriseth them unawares , 9. and smiteth them , 10. The LORD casteth hail-stones upon them , 11. The sun and noon shall still about the space of one day, at the request of Josua , 13. The five Kings hide themselves in the caves by Makkeda , 16. Josua causeth them to be shut up therein , 18. Afterwards causeth them to be brought forth , 22. and to be trod upon in the presence of all the people , 24. Afterward causeth them to be hanged pu , 26. and to be thrown out in the cave by Makkeda , 27. Josua taketh Makkeda , and burneth the King thereof , together with the city , and all that was in it , 29.from thence to Lachis , and winneth it , 31. King Horam is defended , 33. Eglon is taken ,34. Hebron is taken, 36. likewise Debir, 38. and all the land , 40. Josua returneth to Gilgal, 43.
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass when Adonizedek the King of Jerusalem had heard that Josua had taken Ai , and banned it , and had done so unto Ai, and the King thereof , even as he had done unto Jericho and the King thereof : and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel , and dwelt in the midst of them :
\p
\v 2 Then they were sore afraid ; [ viz. the King of Jerusalem , and his people ; as also the other Kings which are named verse 3. ] for Gibeon was a great Citie like one of the Royal cities , yea, it was greater then Ai, and all the men thereof were strong ; [ oth. stout , valiant , mightie .]
\p
\v 3 Therefore Adonizedek King of Jerusalem sent unto Chobam the King of hebron , and unto Piream the King of Jarmuth , and unto Japhia the king of Lachis , and unto Debir the king of Eglon , saying : [ i.e. sending word unto them ].
\p
\v 4 Come up to me and help me , that we may smite Gibeon : for that it hath made peace with Josua, and with the children of Israel .
\p
\v 5 Then (there) were assembled and came up five kings of the Amorites , [See the annot, Gen. 48.22.] the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachis , the King of Eglon , they , and all their camps : and they besieged Gibeon , and made war against it .
\p
\v 6 Now the men of Gibeon sent unto Josua unto the camp at Gilgal , [ viz. when they heard that the five Kings came up against them ] saying : Withdraw not thy hand . [ Or , let not thy hands be remisse , slacken not thy hands ] from thy servants [ i.e. from us , who have given our selves over unto thee to be thy servants , wherefore thou art obliged to protect us against this great power ] come up, quickly to us , and deliver us and help us : for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell on the mountains , have gathered themselves together against us ;
\p
\v 7 Then josua went up from Gilgal , he and all the men of war with him , [ These were no hired Souldiers , but the stoutest and valiantest men out of all the tribes ] and all the mighty men of valour .
\p
\v 8 For the LORD had said unto Josua , Be not afraid of them , for I have delivered them into thine hand : none of them shall subsist before thy face .
\p
\v 9 So Josua came unto them suddenly , all the night long marched he on from Gilgal.
\p
\v 10 And the LORD affrighted them before the face of Israel, and he slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon : [ Not in the city of Gibeon , but in the countrey about Gibeon . So it is said , Jos. 5.13. at Jericho i.e. in the countrey bordering neer upon , or about Jericho ] and chased them on the way , where they go up Bethoron , and smote them unto Azeka , and unto Makkeda.
\p
\v 11 Now it came to passe when they fled before the face of Israel , being in the desert of Beth-horon , that the LORD cast great stones [ i.e. hail-stones , as presently followeth in this v. ] upon them from heaven unto Azeka , that they died : there were more that died of the hail-stones , then they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword .
\p
\v 12 Then Josua spake unto the LORD [ i.e. he called upon , and prayed unto the Lord ] in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the face of the children of Israel , and said before the eyes [ i.e. in the presence ] of the Israelites , Sun stand still [ Heb. be silent , as 1 Samuel 14.9. Psal. 4.5. Jon. 1.12.] at Gibeon , [ i.e. stand still in the place where thou now art , for Josua was at this time at Gibeon , v.10.] and thou Moon in the valley of Ajalon : [ this place belonged to the tribe of Zebulon , Judg. 12.22. There was another Ajalon in the tribe of Dan : Jos.19.42. The meaning of Josua's words is this , Sun , go not down upon us all the while we are fighting in Gibeon , neither do thou , Moon , in the valley of Ajalon . See v.13. Others tender it thus : let the sun stand still , or , the moon stand still .]
\p
\v 13 And the Sun stood still , and the moon stayed , untill the people had avenged them selves upon their enemies . Is not this written in the book of the Upright ? [ Or of the Godly ,or of him that is just . Some retain in Hebrew word Jaschar in the text . This book with some other historical books more , of which mention is made in the holy Scripture , are not now any more extant . See Num. 21.14.] the Sun now stood still in the midst of heaven , and hasted not to go down about a whole day.
\p
\v 14 And there was no day like unto this , before it , nor after it , that the LORD (so) hearkened unto the voice of one man : [ i.e. that God for one mans prayer made the Sun and the Moon to stand still . In Ezechias time the Sun stood not still , but went back ] for the LORD fought for Israel .
\p
\v 15 Then Josua returned [ viz. after he had dispatched whatsoever is recorded from this verse to the end of this chapter . The writer of this book hath briefly as in one short sum or draught related this whole war : afterward he describeth more amply and fully that which afterward happened ] and all Israel with him , unto the camp at Gilgal .
\p
\v 16 But those five Kings [Which are named , v.3. ] were fled , and had hid themselves in the cave of Makkeda .
\p
\v 17 And it was told Josua , saying : Those five Kings are found hid in the cave by Makkeda :
\p
\v 18 And Josua said : Roll great stones before the mouth of the cave , and set men before it , for to keep them.
\p
\v 19 But stand ye not still , pursue after your enemies , and smite them in the tail : [ The meaning is , that they should fall upon and smite the hindmost , or rereward ] let them not enter into their cities , for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand .
\p
\v 20 And it came to passe when Josua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter , untill they were consumed , and that the remnant who remained of them were entered into the fenced cities .
\p
\v 21 That all the people whom Josua had sent , to pursue the enemie , v.19. ] returned unto Josua into the camp by Makkeda in peace : [ i.e. well and in good health ] no man had moved his tongue against the children of Israel . [ i.e. no man had set himself against them with so much as a word ; or no man had opened his mouth against them . Compare Exod. 11.7.]
\p
\v 22 Afterward Josua said , Open the mouth of the cave , and bring forth those five kings unto me out of the cave.
\p
\v 23 They then did so , and brought forth unto him those five Kings out of the cave : the King of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachis , the ing of Eglon .
\p
\v 24 And it came to passe , when they had brought forth those kings unto Josua , that Josua called all the men of Israel, and he said unto the chieftains of the people of war which went with him, come neer, and set their feet upon upon their necks.
\p
\v 25 Then Josha said unto them, Fear not, neither be dismayed, be strong and of good courage , for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies, against whom ye fight.
\p
\v 26 And afterwards Joshua smote them, and slew them, and bang them on the trees, until the evening . [as above chap.8.29.]
\p
\v 27 And it came to passe on the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded that they should take yhem down off the tree, and they cast them into the cave, where they had been hid: and they laid great stones upon the mouth of the cave, (which are there) until this very day.
\p
\v 28 The same day Joshua also took Makkeda, [this was a city, situate in the uttermost boarder of the tribe of Juda, toward the west, Josh.15.41.] and smote it with the edge of the sword, likewise them, and every soul[i.e all the men and so hereafter,for cattel and other things were the spoil or prey of the Isrealites Deut.20.16.&17.& below v 40&11.11.] that was therein, he let no remnant remain: and he did unto the King of Makkeda, according as he had done unto the King of Jericho.
\p
\v 29 Then Joshua marched on, and all Israel [viz. all those that have been with him in Gibeon] with him from Makkeda unto Libna? [Oth. Lobna were of the house of Aaron, for an habitation, Jos.21.13] and he warred against Libna.
\p
\v 30 And the LORD gave the same also into the hand of Israel, with the King thereof, and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and the every soul that was therein, he let no remnant remainin it: he did it unto the King thereof according as he had done unto the King of Jericho
\p
\v 31 Then Joshua marched on, and all Israel with him from Libna unto Lachis : [ This was a strong city lying in the uttermost border of the tribe of Judatoward the West , so Jos. 15.39. ] and he besieged it , and warred against it :
\p
\v 32 And the LORD gave Lachis into the hand of Israel , and he took it on the second day , [ viz . after he came with the camp before it .] and he smote it with the edge of the sword , and every soul that was therein , according to all that he had done unto Libna.
\p
\v 33 Then marched up Horam the king of Gezer , [ A city lying in the Tribe of Ephraim , Jos.16.3,10 Judg.1.19.] for the help Lachis : but Josua smote him , and his people , untill he had left him none remaining .
\p
\v 34 And Josua marched on from Lachis unto Eglon , [ A city lying in the midst of Juda , Jos.15.38. about five leagues distance from Jerusalem toward the South , three leagues from Emmaus ] and all Israel with him and he besieged it , and warred against it .
\p
\v 35 And they took it the second day , [ He had besieged it , See v.32.] and slew them with the edge of the sword , and he banned [ Or, devoted to destruction ] every soul that was therein the same day : according to all that he had done to Lachis .
\p
\v 36 After that Josua marched on , and all Israel with him , from Eglon unto Hebron : [ The taking of Hebron is more amply related below chap.14. and 15. This city was one of the ancientest cities in the land of Canaan ; it was built seven yeares before Zoan in Egypt Numb.13.23. It was situate in the inheritance of Juda, Jos.15.13. It was at first called Kirjath-Arba ]and they warred against it .
\p
\v 37 And they took it , and smote it with the edge of the sword , as well as the King thereof , [ Understand here the King of Hebron , that succeeded in the room of him that was hanged , v.26.] and every soul that was therein , he left none remaining alive ,according to all that he had done to Eglon : and he banned it , and every soul that was therein .
\p
\v 38 Then Josua remained , and all Israel with him to Debir : [ A citie lying on the uttermost borders of the Tribe of Juda, where it joyneth on the inheritance of the Tribe of Simeon , and was at first called Kiriath-Sepher, i.e. the Book Citie . There was also another Citie called Debir , which lay beyond Jordan in the tribe of Gad , on the uttermost border thereof , Jos.13.26. ] and he warred against it .
\p
\v 39 And he took it with the King thereof , and all the Cities thereof , and they smote them with the edge of the sword , and bound every soul that was therein , he let no remnant remain ; according as he had done unto Hebron , so did he unto Debir , and the King thereof , and according as he had done unto Libna , and the King thereof .
\p
\v 40 Thus Josua smote all the land ; [ i.e. he subdued all the Countrie and took possession of it ] the hills , and the south , and the low grounds , and the descents of waters , and all their Kings , he left none remaining , yea he banned all that had breath ; [ i.e. all mankind , for the cattel they reserved for their prey , Heb. all or , every breath ] according as the LORD the God of Israel had commanded . [ This serveth to excuse Josua and the Israelites , for slaying of so great a maltitude of men as they destroye by the edge of the sword ]
\p
\v 41 And Josua smote them from Kades-Barnea , unto Gaza : also all the land of Gosen ; [ This is not Gosen in Egypt , Gen.45.9. but it lieth in the land of Canaan , chapter 11.v.6. and 17. and chap.15.51. and unto Gibeon .
\p
\v 42 And Josua took all these Kings and their land at once , for the LORD the God of Israel fought for Israel .[ These words are added to take away from all men that read this , all scruple or doubt concerning the truth of these great acts ]
\p
\v 43 Then Josua returned and all Israel with him , unto the Camp at Gilgall . [ All that hitherto hath been related in this Book , happened within the space of about seven years from the beginning of this Book , i.e. of that which Josua and the children of Israel perfomed in the land of Canaan .]
\c 11
\s And those five Kings of the Canaanites were subdued , all the other Kings and Nations of the land of Canaan , gathered themselves together at the waters of Merom , for to fight against Israel , v.1, & c. God encourageth Josua , and promiseth him victorie over them all ,6. Josua suprizeth them unawares , 7. and smiteth them all together , 8. and taketh all their Cities , and plundereth them , slaying the inhabitants thereof , 12. Onely, Gibeon maketh peace with Israelites , 19. The Enakims are also destroyed , 21. Excepting those that dwelt at Gaza , at Gath , and at Asdod , 23.
\p
\v 1 Afterward it came to pass , when Fabon the King of Hazor [ The name of a Citie , lying in the upper Galilee, otherwise called the Galilee of the Gentiles , not far from Kades ] heard , that he then sent unto Jobab the King of Madon , and unto the King of Simeon , [ Jos. 12.20. this Citie is called Simeon Meron ] and unto the King of Achsaph.
\p
\v 2 And unto the King which were toward the North of the hills , and on the plain [ Oth. in the wilderness ] toward the South of Cinneroth , [ oth. called Genesareth Luke 5.1. also the Sea of Tiberius and the Sea of Galilee ] and in the low grounds , and in Napheth-Dor , [ or, in the Coasts , Regions, Countries of Dor ] on the Sea [ or, toward the West ]
\p
\v 3 Unto the Canaanites towards the East and towards the West , and the Amorites , and the Hethites , and the Pherezites , and the Jebusites on the hills , and the Hevites beneath at Hermon in the land of Mizpa. [ See Judges 10.verse 17. ]
\p
\v 4 These now went forth and all their Hosts with them , much people , as the sand of the Sea-shoar is in multitude ; and very many horses and chariots .
\p
\v 5 All these Kings were gathered together , and came and camped themselves together at the waters of Meron , for to war against Israel .
\p
\v 6 And the LORD said unto Josua , Fear not before their faces , for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all smitten before the face of Israel : thou shalt hough their horses , [ i.e. cut their ham-strings , to make them unserviceable either for war , or any other labour .] and burn their charets with fire .
\p
\v 7 And Josua and all the men of War with him , came suddenly upon them at the waters of Meron , and fell upon them .
\p
\v 8 And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel , and they smote them , and they chased them unto great Zidon ; [ This is not therefore called great Zidon , as if there were also a little Zidon , but in respect of the greatness or largeness of the Citie , It hath its name of Zidon the first-born son of Canaan , of whom mention is made , Gen.10.15. ] and unto Misrephot Maim , [ this word is diversly interpreted , Some expound it unto the warme waters . Others, to be grasse furnaces . Others , the salt pits. Heb. unto the burnings of the waters ] and unto the valley of Mizpor towards the East , and they smote them untill they left none remaining among them ,
\p
\v 9 Now Josua did unto them according as the LORD had said unto him , he boughed their horses , [ See v.6.] and he burnt their chariots with fire.
\p
\v 10 And Josua returned at the same time , and he took Hazor , and he slew the King thereof with the sword : for Hazor was afore-time the head of all these kingdoms [ i.e. the Metropolis or chief Citie . Understand this of that part of the land of Canaan , where Josua at that time made war ]
\p
\v 11 And they smote every soul [ i.e. all mankind , for the cattell they took for prey , and reserved the same for themselves ] that was therein with the edge of the sword , banning the same , and there remained nothing that had breath : [ i.e. no man was left alive ] and he burnt Hazor with fire.
\p
\v 12 And Josua took all the Cities of these Kings , and all these Kings thereof , and he smote them with the edge of the sword , banning them , according as Moseh the servant of the LORD had commanded .
\p
\v 13 Onely the Israelites burned not any cities that stood upon their hills , [ Oth. which remained with their walls ( or bulwarks ) i.e. which were not as levelled or unwalled , when the Israelites took them , but continued still fenced and walled ; for the children of Israel left those whole and entire , that themselves might freely and safely dwell therein , ] save Hazor onely , that did Josua burn .
\p
\v 14 And all the prey of these cities , and the cattel, the children of Israel preyed for themselves ; they onely smote all the men with the edge of the sword , untill they destroyed them , they let nothing remained that had breath .
\p
\v 15 According as the LORD had commanded Moseh , so did Moseh command Josua : and so did Josua , he diminished not one word from all that the LORD had commanded Moseh.
\p
\v 16 Thus Josua took all the land , the hills , and all the South-( Countrey ) and all the land of Gosen , [ See above chap.10.41. ] and the low grounds , and the plains , and the mountain of Israel , [ i.e. wherein Israel dwelt or which fell to the lot and portion of the Tribes of Israel ( Juda excepted. ) Those of the Tribe of Juda had their own mountains or hilly countrey , as appeareth v.21. ] and the vale thereof .
\p
\v 17 From the bald mountain ; [ So is this mountain called , because it was bald , or without trees , grass or herbs . Other retain the Hebrew word Halak , as being a proper name ] that goeth up to Seir , unto Baal-Gad, in the valley of Libanon , beneath mount Hermon : he took all their Kings and smote them, and slew them .
\p
\v 18 Many dayes [ Somewhat more than six years , as may be gathered from Calbs age , when he requested of Josua a land of inheritance , Jos.14.7.] did Josua make war against all these Kings.
\p
\v 19 There was no Citie that made peace with the children of Israel , save the Hivites inhabitants of Gibeon : they took them all by war . [ i.e. all the above named Cities , or all the Cities that Josua approached unto ; otherwise it is certain , that there were yet long after that , viz. in the time of the Judges , many cities which the Israelites had not as yet subdued .]
\p
\v 20 For it was of the LORD , to harden theiir hearts that they went forth to war against Israel , that he might ban them ( or devote them to destruction ) that no favour might be shewed them , but that he might destroy them according as the LORD had commanded Moseh.
\p
\v 21 Now at that time Josua came and destroyed the Enakims ; [ See Numbers 13.23. Deut.1.18. ] from the mountains , from Hebron , from Debir , from Anob, and from all the mountains of Juda, and from all the mountains of Israel ; Josua banned them with their Cities .
\p
\v 22 There was none of the Enakims left in the land of the children of Israel ; onely they remained at Gaza , at Gath , [ There dwelt in after times the giant Goliath , 1 Samuel 17.4.] and at Asdod .
\p
\v 23 So Josua took all that land , [ i.e. the greatest and chiefest part thereof ; or all ; i.e. all manner of land , viz. plain, mountainous , pasture lands , heaths , moors , etc.] according to all that the LORD had spoken unto Moseh and josua gave it unto Israel for an inheritance, according to their divisions ; [ this division of the land is related Jos. 15. and in the following chapters ] according to their Cities : and the land rested from war . [ Understand this of open warres when armies took the field one against another ]
\c 12
\s A short recitall or Catalogue of the Kings and their Kingdomes , that were deserted by the Israelites ,that they might hereditarily possess their land ; first in the time of Moseh on the other side of Jordan, v. 1, & c. After ward by Josua on this side of Jordan , 7.Being in all one and thirty Kings , 24.
\p
\v 1 Now these are the Kings of the land , which the children of Israel smote and hereditarily possessed their land on the other side of Jordan toward the Sun-rising ; from the brook unto mount Hermon , and all the plain field toward the East.
\p
\v 2 Sihon the King of the Amorites , who dwelt at Hesbon ; who ruled from Aroer , which is on the bank [ Hebr. lip ] of the brook Arnon , over the midst of the river , and the moyetie of Gilead , and unto the river Jabbok , the border of the children of Ammon .
\p
\v 3 And over the plains unto the Sea Cinneroth . [ See Jos. 11.2. and Deut.3.17.] toward the East , and unto the Sea of the plains , [ so the dead sea is called , i.e. the salt sea , and the lake of Sodom , and the lake of Asphaltites ] the salt-sea , towards the East , the way to Beth-Jesimoth : [ which lieth in the border of the Moabites , Ezech.25.9.] and from the South beneath Asdoth-Pisga ; [ i.e. the descent of the hill . It is a part of the mountain Abarim, Deut. 1.4.]
\p
\v 4 Besides, the border of Og the King of Basan , who was of the remnant of the Giants , [ Hebr. Rephaim] dwelling at Astharoth, and at Edrei.
\p
\v 5 And reigned over mount Hermon , and over Salcha , and over all Basan unto the border of the Gesurites ; [ These dwelt in the land of Basan at the uttermost borders of the same land , which 2 Sam.15.8. is called by Absalom , Gesur in Syria , because it lay about the city & country Damascus. Gesur was a royall citie : the daughter of Thalmai king of Gesur was Davids wife , and mother of Absalom , 2 Sam. 3.3. Unto whom Absalom fled after he had slain his brother Amnon 2 Sam. 13.37. The land of the Gesurites fell indeed by lot unto the half Tribe of Manasseh , but they did not expel the inhabitants thereof , Jos.13.13.] and of the Maachtites , and the moyetie of Gilead , the border of Sihon , the King of Hesbon .
\p
\v 6 Moseh the servant of the LORD , and the children of Israel smote them , and Moseh the servant of the LORD gave that land unto the Reubenites , Gadites , and the half Tribe of Manasseh for an hereditary possession .
\p
\v 7 These now are the Kings of the land , which Josua and the children of Israel smote on this side of Jordan toward the West , from Baal-Gad in the valley of Libanon , and unto the bald mountain , [ see above chapter 11.17.] that goeth up to Seir ; and Josua gave it unto the Tribes of Israel for an hereditary possession , according to their divisions [ i.e. unto every one his share hereditarily, ]
\p
\v 8 That which was upon the mountains and in the low grounds , and in the plain , and in the descents of waters , and in the wilderness, and toward the South : the Hethites , the Amorites and Canaanites , the Pheresites , the Hevites and the Jebusites .
\p
\v 9 The King of Jericho one ; The King of Ai, which is besides Bethel one .
\p
\v 10 The King of Jerusalem one , The King of Hebron one .
\p
\v 11 The King of Jarmath one , the King of Lachis one .
\p
\v 12 The King of Eglon one , the King of geser one .
\p
\v 13 The King of Debir one , the King of geder one .
\p
\v 14 The King of Horma [ See the Annot. Judg.1.17. ] one , the King of Hared one .
\p
\v 15 The King of Lidna one , the King of Adullam [ This was a citie in the land of juda , of which mention is made , 1 Chr.11.15. Near unto it was a Cave , wherein David abode when he fled from saul , 1 Samuel 22. 1. there he penned the 57. Psalm ] one .
\p
\v 16 The King of Makda one , the King of Bethreb one .
\p
\v 17 The King of Tappuah one , the King of Hepper one .
\p
\v 18 The King of Aphek one , the King of Lassaron one .
\p
\v 19 The king of Madon one , the King of Hoshor one .
\p
\v 20 The King of Simron Mero one , the King of Achsaph one .
\p
\v 21 The King of Taunach one , the King of Megiddo one .
\p
\v 22 The King of Rodes one , the King of Jokneam at Carmel one .
\p
\v 23 The King of Dor , at Naphath-Dor [ See Josua 11.3.] one : The King of the Gentiles [ or, the King of Gojim ] at Gilgal one .
\p
\v 24 The King of Tirza one one : All these Kings are one and thirty .
\c 13
\s The Lord maketh known unto Josua when he was grown old , what land there was yet to be subdued , verse 1. & c. and he commanded him to divide that land among the nine Tribes and an half , 7. hereunto is added a short survey of the Land which Moseh had subdued on the other side of Jordan, 9. The cause wherefore the Levites were to have no inheritance , 14. The portion of the Reubenites , 19. of the Gadites , 24. of the half Tribe of Manasseh ,29. There is again shawed , wherefore no inheritance was given unto the Levites , 33.
\p
\v 1 Josua was old , stricken in yeares ( or full of dayes ) [ Heb. coming , or entering into dayes . See the annot. On Gen.18.11.] and the LORD said unto him , Thou art grown old , stricken in yeares , and there is very much land remaining that is to be inherited .
\p
\v 2 This is the land that remaineth : all the Philisines ( land, ) and all Gesuri : [ Of the land of Gesur is also mention made 2 Sam .3.3. and 15.18. and 14.26. ]
\p
\v 3 From Sihor , [ A river that beareth its name from blacknesse, is conceived that it parteth Palestina from Egypt. See Num.34.5. ] which is before Egypt , unto the border of Ekron toward the North , which is counted to the Canaanites : five Princes ( or Lords ) of the Philistines , [ here the word Princes , or Lords is put for the Lordships themselves ] the Guzadite , and Asdodite , the Askelonite , the Gethite , and Ekronite , and the Avites . [ i.e. besides the five Lords or Princes , there were also the Avites , Heb. Avoim . It is true judged , that those of Caphthor had destroyed the Avites , Deut. 2.23. but still there did some remain , whereof this text speaketh in this place.]
\p
\v 4 From the South, and all the land of the Canaanites , and Neara [ Some take this to be the name of a city : Others , to be the name of a river ] which is the Zidonians , unto aphek, even to the border of the Amorites .
\p
\v 5 Also the land of the Giblites [ See 1 Kings 5. on verse 8. ] and all Libanon toward the rising of the sun , from Baal-Gad beneath mount-Hermon , unto the entrance of Hamath.
\p
\v 6 All those that dwell upon the mountains , from Libanon unto Misrepoth-Maim , all the Zidonians ; I will drive them out from the face of the children of Israel . Only cause thou it to fall unto the Israelites for an inheritance , according as I have commanded .
\p
\v 7 And now divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes , and to the half tribe of Manasseh.
\p
\v 8 With whom [ viz. the half tribe of Manasseh ] the Reubenites and Gadites have received their inheritance : which Moseh gave unto them on the other side of Jordan , towards the East , according as Moseh the servant of the LORD had given them . [ i.e. in such manner and form , and with such conditions . See above chapter 4.12. ]
\p
\v 9 From Aroer , which is on the bank [ Heb. lip ] of the river Arnon , and the city which is in the midst of the river , and all the plain land from Medeba unto Dibon .
\p
\v 10 And all the cities of Sihon the King of the Amorites , who reigned a Heshbon , unto the border of the children of Ammon :
\p
\v 11 And Gilead , and the border of the Gesurites , and of the Maachathites , and all mount-Hermon , and all Basan, unto Salcha .
\p
\v 12 All the Kingdom of Og in Basan , who reigned at Astharoth and at Edrei , this ( man ) remained of the remnant of the Giants , [ See Deut. 14. v.5. ] whom Moseh slew , and drave them out .
\p
\v 13 But the children of Israel did not expell the Gesurites , nor the Maachithites . But Gesur and Maachath dwelt in the midst of Israel untto this day .
\p
\v 14 Onely he [ viz. Moseh, as appeareth v. 33. ] gave no inheritance unto the tribe of Levi : the fire offerings [ i.e. that which remained of the fire offerings , See Num.18. v. 8. 20,24. Deut. 10.9. & 18.2. ] of the LORD God of Israel , they are [ or that is ] his [ viz. Levi's , or the Levites ] inheritance , according as he had spoken unto him.
\p
\v 15 So Moseh gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their families .
\p
\v 16 That teir border was from Aroer , which is on the brook of the river Arnon , and the citiy which is in the midst of the river , and all the plain land unto Medeba .
\p
\v 17 Hesbon [ This city belonged to the Reubenites and Gadites together , which is to be observed , for that it is said below chap.21.39. that the Gadites gave this city unto the Levites ] and all her cities , which are in the plain land , Dibon , and Bannoth-Baal , and Beth-Baal-Meon.
\p
\v 18 And Jabza , and Kademoth , and Maphaath .
\p
\v 19 And Kiriathaim , and Sibma , and Zereth -hassahar on the mount of the valley .
\p
\v 20 And Beth-Peor , and Asdoth-Pisga , [ See the Annot. on Jos. 12.3. ] and Beth Jesimoth ,
\p
\v 21 And all the cities of the plain land , and all the Kingdom of Sihon the King of the Amorites who reigned at Heshbon : whom Moseh smote together with the Princes of Midian , Evi, and Rekem, and Zur , and Shur, and Reba [ Understand that Moseh likewise smote those : See Num.31.8.] Mighty men of Sihon , [ i.e. Deputies , Governours, Rulers : Num.31,8. they be called Kings : ] inhabitants of the countrey,
\p
\v 22 Likewise the children of Israel slew Bileam te son of Beor the sooth sayer with the sword , [ See Num.24. on v. 25. ] besides those that were smitten by them.
\p
\v 23 Now the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan , and the border thereof : that is the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families , cities and their villages .
\p
\v 24 And unto the tribe of Gad, unto the children of God according to their families Moseh gave ,
\p
\v 25 That their border was Jaezar , and all the cities of Gilead : and half the land of the children of Ammon ; [Here is to be observed that Sihon had first taken this same from the Ammonites . Num.21,26. So that the children of Israel took it not from the Ammonites ( for that was forbidden them , Deut. 2.19. ) but for King Sihon , see Judg.11.15. ] unto Aroer , which is before Rabba.
\p
\v 26 And from Hesbon unto Ramoth-mispe , and Bethonim : and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir ,
\p
\v 27 And in the valley of Beth-haram, and Beth-Nimra , and Succoth , and Zaphon , which remained of the Kingdom of Sihon the King at Hesbon , Jordan , and the border ( thereof , ) [ This was the bank of Jordan ] unto the end of the Sea Cinnereth , beyond Jordan , toward the East.
\p
\v 28 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad , according to their families : the cities and their villages .
\p
\v 29 Moreover, Moseh had given unto the half tribe of Manasseh ( an inheritance : ) which remained [ Heb. was ]unto the half tribe of the children of Manasseh , according to their families .
\p
\v 30 So that their border was from Mahanaim , all Basan , all the Kingdom of Og the King of Basan , and all the towns of Jair , [ Jair , by the fathers side , was of the tribe of Judah : for Hesron the son of Perez was his grand father , of the tribe of Judah ; but the daughter of Machir the son of Manasseh was his grand mother , 1 Chron.2.21,22. and because Manasseh was his grand mothers grand father , therefore he is called a son of Manasseh , Num.32.41. He also followed the tribe of Manasseh, among whom he behaved himself so valiantly , that he obtained among them so great a portion of land and inheritance ] which are in Basan , threescore cities . [ this is the number of the cities which this tribe had in the Kingdom of Basan .]
\p
\v 31 And half Gilead and Ashteroth , and Edrei , cities of the Kingdom of Basan , were ( pertaining to ) the children of Machir , the son of Manaeseh , ( namely, to ) one half of the children of Machir , [ for his six sons had received their inheritance on the other side of Jordan with the nine Tribes : See before Chap.17.2. ] according to their families .
\p
\v 32 This is that which Moseh had described [ Oth. had given in ] for inheritance in the field of Moab , on the other side of Jordan from Jericho, eastward.
\p
\v 33 But unto the tribe of Levi , Moseh gave no inheritance : The LORD, the God of Israel , himself is their inheritance , according as he spake unto them . [ Or , of them. ]
\c 14
\s When they were to divide the land on his side Jordan , v.1. Caleb instanced , that the land of Hebron was promised by Moseh , 6. When he was returned from spying the land , putting courage into the people , 7. Josua giveth unto Caleb the land which he requested , 13.
\p
\v 1 Now this [ viz. that which is rehearsed in the five following Chapters ] is that which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan , which Eleazer the Priest , and Josua the son of Nun , and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel , [ i.e. the chief fathers of the children of Israel ; These men , who were to be overseers of the dividing of the land , were formerly appointed of God , and their names expressed in Moseh his time , Num.34.19.] caused them to inherit ;
\p
\v 2 By the lot of their inheritance , as the LORD had commanded by the ministry [ Heb. the hand ] of Moseh , touching the nine tribes , and the half tribe . [ viz. the half tribe of Manasseh .]
\p
\v 3 For unto the two tribes , and to the half tribe had Moseh given an inheritance on the other side of Jordan : but unto the Levites had he given no inheritance among them [ Heb. in the midst of them .]
\p
\v 4 For the children of Joseph were two tribes , Manasseh and Ephraim : and unto the Levits they gave no share in the land , but cities to dwell in , and their [ viz. cities ] suburbs for their cattel , and for their possession .
\p
\v 5 According as the LORD had commanded Moseh , so did the children of Israel ; and they divided the land . [ Not actually , but according to the order which they formed in their minde , or by themselves . So Gen. 37.21. it is said , He delivered him ; i.e. He purposed , or endeavoured to deliver him . So also Exod. 12.48. And they keep the passover ; i.e. will keep.]
\p
\v 6 Then the children of Juda drew near unto Josua [ viz. to assist Caleb, who was of their tribe , in the furthering of his right and inheritance which was promised him ] at Gilgal , [ it seemeth , that his division was made when the Camp , or the Tent or Tabernacle was yet at Gilgal ; nthe other divisions were made at Silo , whither the Tent or Tabernacle was brought from Gilgal , as is related here below , chapter 16.] and Caleb the son of Jephunne the Kenesite , said unto him , Thou knowest the word which the Lord spake unto Moseh the man of God [ see Judg.13. on ver.6. ] at Kardes-barnea , concerning me and concerning thee.
\p
\v 7 I was fourty years old [ a son of fourty years : so also ver. 10.] when Moseh the servant of the LORDsent me out from Kades-barnea to spy out the land : and I brought him answer according as it was in mine heart .[ i.e. as I knew to be true in mine heart , viz. that God would bring us into the land of Canaan .]
\p
\v 8 But my brethren [ i.e. my Countrey men , understanding the ten Spies that were sent out with him ] that went out with him , made the peoples heart to melt , [ i.e. they daunted and discouraged the heart of the people ] but I held on to follow after the LORD my God . [ Heb. I fulfilled after the Lord . So also v. 9. & 14. See Numb. 14. v. 24. ]
\p
\v 9 Then Moseh sware on that day [ Without doubt by Gods command and instinct . Compare the Oath of God , Numb. 14. 21,24. ] saying , If the land whereon thy foot hath troden shall not be thine , and thy childrens for an inheritance for ever ! [ See Gen. 14. on v. 23 . and the perfect sentence , Jos. 22, 22. and 1 Samuel 24. 22. and 25.22. ] Forasmuch as thou hast held on to follow after the LORD my God ,
\p
\v 10 And now [ This was the seventh year after the Israelites were come into the land of Canaan ] behold , the LORD hath kept me alive , according as he hath spoken : it is now five and fourty year since that the LORD spake this word unto Moseh , when Israel walked in the wilderness : And now behold I am this day fourscore and five year old . [ Heb. a son of fourscore and five year.]
\p
\v 11 I am yet as strong this day , as I was that day when Moseh sent me out : as my strength was then , so is my strength now for the war , and to go out , and to come in . [ See Deut. 31. v. 2.]
\p
\v 12 And now give me this mountain [ i.e. this hilly country , viz. the mountain of Juda, whereon the City Hebron lay] whereof the LORD spake on that day : for thou hast said it on that very day that the Anakims were there , and that there were great fenced Cities , if the LORD would be with me , to drive them out , according as the LORD hath spoken . [ hence may be gathered , that Caleb made this request unto Josua , before the land of Canaan was wholly subdued , notwithstanding that that Chap.10.36,37. is related , that Josua took and destroyed Hebron .]
\p
\v 13 Then Josua blessed him , [ i.e. he granted him his request , and he wished him all happiness and prosperity therewith ] and he gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunne Hebron for an inheritance .
\p
\v 14 Therefore Hebron [ Understand this not so much of the City of Hebron ( for it was a City of Refuge , and belonged to the Levites ) as of the country , villages and towns lying round about . See Jos. 21. v.11, 12. and 1 Chronicles 5.56.] became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunne the Kenesite , unto this day ; because he had held on to follow after the LORD God of Israel .
\p
\v 15 Now the name of Hebron was heretofore Kiriath-Arba , [ Many are of opinion , that Kiriath-Arba came to be called Hebron , from Hebron the son of Caleb , which 1 Chronicles 2.21. is called , The father of Hebron ] which [ Arba is the name of a man , from whom that city was called ] had been a great man among the Anakims : [ great, in respect as well of his power and authority , as of the greatness of his body : and , great among the Anakims ; i.e, the greatest among them . So likewise Luke 1.28.] And the land rested from war , [ to wit , after that Josua had given the city Hebron unto Caleb, and Caleb had taken the same ; but not at that time whe Caleb requested of the same from Josua , ver.12. for at that time Hebron, and much of the land , was yet to be subdued .]
\c 15
\s The borders of inheritance of the tribe of Juda , v.1, etc. and among the same , Kiriath-Arba the inheritance of Caleb , 13. Who drave out thence the three sons of Anak, 14. Caleb promiseth to give his daughter Achsa in marraige unto him that should smite Kiriath-Sepher , 16. which Othniel did, 17. She requesteth of her father some land for a Dowry, 18. which he granteth her , 19. Hereunto is added , a Catalogue or List of the Cities in the tribe of Juda , 20. The children of Judacould not drive out the Jebusites out of Jerusalem ,63.
\p
\v 1 And the lot for the tribe of the children of Juda according to their families , was : on the border of Edom , the wilderness of Zin Southward , was the utmost toward the South :
\p
\v 2 So their border [ viz. the South-border ]toward the South, was utmost of the salt-sea , from the tongue [ It's thought , it was some arm or creek , which from the land did extend into the Salt-sea, in the form and shape of a Tongue ; as also Isa.11.15. or some nook of the Sea , like a Tongue entring into the land ] that looketh toward the South .
\p
\v 3 And goeth out to the south , to the ascent of Alcrabbim [ See Judg.1. v. 36. It seemeth that this place was so called , because there were so many Serpents and Scorpions : See Deut. 8.15. ] and passeth on to Zin [ which seemeth to be the name of a place of note in those times , whereof the wilderness of Zin had its denomination ] and ascendeth from the South unto Kardes-barnea ; and passeth through Hesron, and goeth up to Adar , and encompasseth Karkaa :
\p
\v 4 And passeth through unto Azmon , and cometh out at the brook of Egypt , [ Oth. River, called Sichor : See Jos.13.3. Oth. Valley ; as also below v.7. and elsewhere ]and the going out of this border shall be to the Sea : This shall be your border toward the south .
\p
\v 5 Now the border toward the east , shall be the Salt-sea, unto the utmost of Jordan : [ viz. where it falleth into the Salt -sea ] and the border on the side toward the north , shall be from the tongue of the sea , from the utmost of Jordan .
\p
\v 6 And this border shall go up unto Bethogla , and shall pass thorow from the north of Betharaba : and this border shall go up to the ston of Bohan the son of Reuben : [ The tribe of Reuben had no land on that side of Jordan ; it seemeth , that that place had the name from Bohan a Reubenite , in regard of some memorable Act there done by him , or concerning him .]
\p
\v 7 Moreover, this border shall go up to Debir , from the valley of Achor , and shall look northward toward Gilgal , [ Below chapter 18.17. called Geliloth ] which is toward the ascent of Adummim, on the south of the brook : Then this border shall pass on to the water of Ensemes , and their goings out shall be at En-rogel. [ Oth. at the fountain of Rogel ; i.e. the fountain of the Fuller .See 1 Kings 1.9.]
\p
\v 8 And this border shall go up through the valley of the son of Hinnom , on the side of the Jebusites , from the south , the same is Jerusalem : [ Jerusalem is called Jebus , or the City of the Jebusites , because it was the Metropolis or chief City of the Jebusites , and was yet inhabited by them Judg. 18.28. and 19.10. ] and this border shall go up to the top of the Hill , that is before the valley of Hinnom westward , which is in the utmost of the valley of the Rephaites , toward the north.
\p
\v 9 Then shall this border reach from the height of the mountain , unto the water-fountain of Nephthoa , and go out to the cities of mount Ephron : Further this border shall reach to Baala , this is Kiriath-jearim .
\p
\v 10 Then this border shall turn about from Baala , toward the west , to mount Seir , [ This mount lay in the land of Juda . There was another Seir in Edom , from whence this land had its name ] and shall pass through on the side of mount Jearim , from the north : this is Chesalon , and it shall descend to Beth-semes , [ i.e. the house of the Sun . ' T was a Cty situate in the tribe of Juda , 2 Kings 14.11. but given to the Levites for their habitation , Jos. 21.16. It must be distinguished from that Beth-seme which lieth in the tribe of Issachar , Jos. 19.22. Into this city was the Ark of the Covenant first brought , after it had been seven moneths in the Philistines country, 1 Samuel 6.12.] and pass thorow Timna .
\p
\v 11 Moreover , this border shall go out on the side of Ekron northward ; and his border shall reach unto Sichron , and pass over the mountain Baala , and go out to Jabneel : and the goings out of this border , shall be to the sea . [ viz. To the Midland-sea , which v.12.is called the great Sea.]
\p
\v 12 Now the border toward the west , shall be unto the great sea , and the border ( thereof : ) This is the border of the children of Juda round about , according to their families .
\p
\v 13 But unto Caleb the son of Jephunne , be [ viz. Josua ] had given a part in the children of Juda , according to the mouth of the LORD [ i.e. according to the command and express injunction of the Lord ] unto Josua , the city of Arba [ generally called Kiriath-Arba ] ( the father of Anak ) which is Hebron .
\p
\v 14 And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak , Sefai , and Abiman , and Talmai , born ( or begotten ) of Anak.
\p
\v 15 And from thence he marched [ viz. Caleb , unto whom this expedition is ascribed , the same being done in his behalf . Wherefore he also promiseth to give his daughter unto him that should smite Kiriath-Sepher , 16. Yet Josua and all Israel marched up with him , Jos. 10.36. ] upwards to the inhabitants of Debir ( now the name of Debir was before , Kiriath-Sepher .)
\p
\v 16 And Caleb said , He that shall smite Kiriath-Sepher , and take it , unto him will I also give my daughter Achsa to wife . [ See a larger relation hereof , Judg.1.11.
\p
\v 17 Now Othniel the son of Kenaz , Calebs brother , [ Oth. cousin , i.e. one of the posterity of Kenaz . See 1 Chron.4.13. ] took it , and he gave him Achsa his daughter to wife .
\p
\v 18 And it came to pass , when she came ( to him , ) [ viz. to Othniel her husband ] that she set him on [ viz. Othniel ] to desire a field of her father ; and she lighted off the Ass : [ viz. for to speak with reverence unto her father . See Gen. 24. the annot . on ver.64. and 1 Samuel 25.23. ] then spake Caleb unto her , What ( ailest ) thou ?
\p
\v 19 And she said , Give me a blessing, [ i.e. a gift , or present . See Gen. 33.v.11. ] since thou hast given me a dry land , [ Heb. properly South-land ] give me also water wells : [ Oth. water- fountains , or water-springs ] then he gave her high water-wells, and low water-wells .
\p
\v 20 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Juda , according to their families .
\p
\v 21 Now the cities from the uttermost ( border )of the tribe of the children of Juda , unto the border of Edom toward the South , are Kebzeel , [ Nehem. 11.15. it's called Jekabzeel ] and Eder , and Jagur .

\v 63 But the children of Juda could not drive the Jebusites , inhabitants of Jerusalem : [ The cause hereof , see Judg. 2,20. ] So the Jebusites dwelt with the children of Juda at Jerusalem , unto this day . [ Understand here , the day or time wherein this book was written ; for afterwards the Jebusites were subdued and expelled thence by David , 2 Sam. 5.6. Also a part of this City was taken before by Juda , Judg. 1. 8. ]

\s The lot of the tribe of Joseph , namely , that of Ephraim and Manasseh in general , v.1 , etc . Afterward a particular description of the borders of Ephraim , 5. The Ephraimites expel not some Caananites , but make them tributary , 10.
\p
\v 1 After that came forth the lot [ viz. out of the vessel into which the lots were cast ] of the children of Joseph from Jordan by Jericho , unto the water of Jericho , eastwards : the wilderness going up from Jericho thorow mount Beth-el.
\p
\v 2 And it cometh from Beth-el unto Luz : [ This is not that Luz , of which mention is made Gen. 28.19. but another Luz , mentioned Judg.1.26. ] and it passeth on to the border of the Archite , unto Ataroth .
\p
\v 3 And it goeth down toward the west , unto the border of Japhleti , unto the border of the nethermost Beth-horon , and unto Gezer : and the goings out thereof are by the Sea.
\p
\v 4 Thus the children of Joseph , Manasseh and Ephraim , got their inheritance .
\p
\v 5 Now the border of the children of Ephraim , according to their families , is this : To wit , the border of their inheritance eastwards , was Athroth-Addar , unto the uttermost Beth-horon .
\p
\v 6 And this border goeth out toward the west by Michmetah , from the north , and this border windeth it self about toward the east , unto Thaanat-Silo , and passeth thorow the same , from the east unto Janoach .
\p
\v 7 And cometh down from Janoach unto Ataroth , and Naharoth , and joyneth to Jericho , and goeth out at Jordan .
\p
\v 8 This border goeth out from Tappuah westward unto the brook Kana , [ Oth. in the valley of Kana ] and the goings out thereof are at the Sea : This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim , according to their families .
\p
\v 9 And the cities which were set apart for the children of Ephraim , were in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Manasseh : all these cities and their villages .
\p
\v 10 And they drave not out the Caananites which dwelt at Gazer : So those Canaanites dwelt in the midst of the Ephraimites unto this day . [ viz. In which the Writer of this Book lived . In Solomons time the King of Egypt subdued the Caananites , and he gave withall the city of Gazer in dower with his daughter , Solomons wife , 1 Kings 9.16. ] but they served under tribute . [ i.e. they subdued them , and held them in subjection , making them tributary .]
\c 17
\s The inheritance of the tribe of Manasseh on this side Jordan , ver. 1 , etc. An inheritance is given unto the five daughters of Zelaphead , at their request . 3 The border of Manasseh is more particularly related ; 7 by whom the Caananites that were not driven out , are made tributary . 12 When the children of Joseph complained that their border was too narrow , 14 Josua sheweth them a way how to enlarge the same , 15 Which they are not pleased with . 16 But Josua promised them the subduing of the Caananites.
\p
\v 1 The tribe of Manasseh had likewise a lot , for being Josephs first-born : ( to wit ) Machir the first-born of Manasseh the father of Gilead , because he was a man of war , [ Implying , that Machir having by his valour subdued the land of Basan , obtained a double portion ; the same likewise appertained to him , as to the first-born , Deut. 21.17. ] therefore he had Gilead and Basan .
\p
\v 2 Also the rest of the children of Manasseh [ Understand this of those that had received no inheritance on the other side of Jordan ] had ( a lot ) according to their families , ( to wit ) the children of Abiezer , and the children of Helek , and the children of Asriel , and the children of Sechem , and the children of Hepher , and the children of Semida : These are the male-children of Manasseh the son of Joseph , according to their families . [ i.e. which were heads of the generations and families that descended from them , and bare the name .]
\p
\v 3 Now Zelaphead the son of Hepher , the son of Gilead , the son of Machir , had no sons but daughters : and these are the names of his daughters , Machla , and Noa , Hogla , Milcha , and Tirza .
\p
\v 4 These then drew near before the face of Eleazer the Priest , and before the face of Josua the son of Nun , and before the face of the Princes , saying , The LORD commanded Moseh to give us an inheritance in the midst of our brethren : Therefore he gave them , according to the mouth of the LORD , an inheritance in the midst of the brethren of their fathers .
\p
\v 5 And there fell to Manasseh ten lines , [ i.e. ten pieces of ground , for they were wont to measure out , and divide land with cords or lines . And observe here , that the five brethren which are named v.2. had five lots , but the sixth lot for Zelaphead the son of Hepher , fell to his five daughters , because he left no son : this together maketh the ten lines , or ten parts ] besides the land of Gilead and Basan , which is on the other side of Jordan .
\p
\v 6 For the daughters of Manasseh [ viz. which descended from Manasseh , and were begotten of Zelaphead ] inherited an inheritance in the midst of his sons : And the rest of the children of Manasseh had the land of Gilead .
\p
\v 7 So that the border of Manasseh was from Aser unto Michmechat , which is before Sechem : And this border goeth along on the right hand to the inabitants of Entappuach.
\p
\v 8 Manasseh had indeed the land of Tappuach : but Tappuach it self on the border of Manasseh , the children of Ephraim had .
\p
\v 9 The border descended unto the brook Kana toward the south of the brook : [ Or of the valley ] These cities [ to wit , Tappuach and Kana ] are Ephraims , in the midst of the cities of Manasseh ; [ meaning , that the cities and the countrey of the tribe of Ephraim and Manasseh were intermixed one with another . See above chapter 16.9. ] and the border of Manasseh is on the north of the brook , and the goings out thereof are at the Sea .
\p
\v 10 It was Ephraims toward the south , and toward the north it was Manassehs , and the sea [ viz. the Syrian sea ] was the border thereof : [ this respecteth both the border of Ephraim , and that of Manasseh ] and on the north they joyn to Aser , and on the east to Issachar .
\p
\v 11 For Manasseh had in Issachar and in Aser , Beth-Sean [ Afterward called Scythopolis , or the City of the Scythians , 2 Mach.12.29. See also 1 Mach.5.52.] and her dependant places , and Gibleam , and her dependant places , and the inhabitants at Dor , and her dependant places , and the inhabitants at En-dor , [ this is translated The Fountain Dor . About this place , many of Sifera's fugitive souldiers were slain by Barac , Psal 83.11. ] and her dependant places , and the inhabitants at Thaanach , and her dependant places , and the inhabitants at Megido , and her dependant places , three distintions of land .
\p
\v 12 And the children of Manasseh could not drive out ( the inhabitants of ) those cities : for the Caananites would dwell in the same land .
\p
\v 13 And it came to pass , when the children of Israel grew strong , that they made the Cannanites tributary : but they drave them not quite out . [ Heb. driving out , they drave them not out .]
\p
\v 14 Then spake the children of Joseph [ viz. Both the tribes , as well as Ephraim as Manasseh , as appeareth ver. 15,16,17.] unto Josua , saying , Wherefore hast thou given me but one lot and one line to inherit , [ i.e. but so much land , as if we were but one tribe , and should dwell together , whereas indeed we are two tribes ] whereas indeed I am a great people ? forasmuch as the LORD hath thus far blessed me . [ these two tribes were in the last mustering or numbring 85 200 strong . See Num. 26.34,37.]
\p
\v 15 And Josua said unto them , Seeing thou art a great people , get thee up to the wood , and cut down there for thee in the land of the Pherezites , and of the Rephaites , [ As if he should say , Cut down the wood , and fit the ground for tillage , and build houses and cities upon it ] seeing the mount of Ephraim is too narrow for thee.
\p
\v 16 Then said the children of Joseph , That mountain will not suffice us , [ Heb. will not be found for us . So Numb.11.22. and elsewhere ] there be also iron charets , with all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley , [ as if they should say , The Canaanites who have many iron charets , wherewith they come into battel , will be too strong for us , and will forcibly oppose us , when we shall go about to cut down the wood upon the Mount ] with those at Beth-Sean , and her dependant places , [ Heb. her daughters , i.e. small towns ] and those that are in the valley of Jezreel .
\p
\v 17 Furthermore spake Josua unto the house of Joseph , unto Ephraim , and unto Manasseh , saying , Thou art a great people , and hast great power , thou shalt not have one lot :
\p
\v 18 But the mountain shall be thine : ( and ) because it is a wood , therefore cut it down , so shall the goings out thereof be thine , [ i.e. So shalt thou be able to plant it and possess it from the one end unto the other ] for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites , though they have iron charets , though they be strong . [ this Josua uttereth thus confidently , relying on the promise of God , above chap.13.6.]
\c 18
\s The Tent of the Congregation is set up at Silo , v.1 , etc.Three men out of every tribe , by the command of Josua , are sent out into the land of Caanan , which was yet undivided , to make out seven parts yet out of the same , for the seven tribes , which as yet had received no inheritance : 3 which being done , 9 Josua casteth the lot at Silo, and so divideth the land unto them . 10 The first cometh out for the tribe of Benjamin , whose borders and cities are described ,11.
\p
\v 1 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Silo , and set up the Tent of the Congregation [ See hereof Exod . 25.22. ] there : after that the land was subdued before them .
\p
\v 2 And there remained among the children of Israel , unto whom they had not divided their inheritance , seven tribes .
\p
\v 3 And Josua said unto the children of Israel , How long are ye so slack , to go on to inherit the land , which the LORD the God of your fathers hath given you ?
\p
\v 4 Give for your selves three men out of each tribe , that I may send them away , and they may arise , and walk thorow the land , and describe the same , [ i.e. that they may somewhere draw in it a manner of a Map , wherein all the situation of the land , yet to be divided , may be set forth ] according to their [viz. the tribes ] inheritances , [ Heb. according to the mouth of their inheritances ] and come ( again ) to me .
\p
\v 5 Now they shall divide it into seven parts : Juda shall abide upon his border from the south , and the house of Joseph shall abide upon his border from the north .
\p
\v 6 And ye shall describe the land into seven parts , and bring (it) hither to me , that I may cast the lot for you here before the face of the LORD our God . [ viz. before the Tent of the Congregation : and so ver. 8.]
\p
\v 7 For the Levites have two ports in the midst of the you , [ Here Josua giveth the reason , wherefore there should be but seven lots , although there were almost as many tribes more ] but the Priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance : [ i.e. the offerings , the tenths , the first-fruits , etc. apertain unto the Levites , which they are to live upon ] Now Gad , and Reuben , and the half tribe of Manasseh , have taken their inheritance on the other side of Jordan, eastward , which Moseh the servant of the LORD gave them .
\p
\v 8 Then those men arose , and went away : and Josua commanded them that went away , to describe the land , saying , Go , and pass thorow the land , and describe it , come then again to me , then I will cast the lot for you before the face of the LORD at Silo . [ As above , ver. 6.]
\p
\v 9 The men then went away , and passed thorow the land , and described it , according to the cities , into seven parts , in a book : and came ( again ) to Josua into the camp at Silo.
\p
\v 10 Then did Josua cast the lot for them at Silo , before the face of the LORD : and Josua divided the land there unto the children of Israel , according to their divisions .[ i.e. unto each tribe their part ]
\p
\v 11 And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up , [ viz. out of the vessel whereinto it was cast ] according to their families : and the border of their lot came out between the children of Juda , and between the children of Joseph .
\p
\v 12 And their border was unto the corner northward from Jordan : and this border goeth upward at the side of Jericho from the north , and goeth up through the mountain westward , and the out-goings thereof are at the wilderness of Beth-aven .
\p
\v 13 And from thence the border passeth thorow to Luz , at the side of Luz , ( which is Beth-el ) [ See above , chap.16.v.2. ] southward , and this border goeth down toward Atroth-Addar , at the hill , which is at the south-side of the nethermost Beth-horon .
\p
\v 14 And that border extendeth and windeth itself about to the west-corner southward from the hill , which is over against Beth-horon southward : and the goings out therefore are at Kiriath-Baal , ( which is Kiriath-jearim ) a city of the children of Juda . This is the corner to the west .
\p
\v 15 Now the corner to the south is at the uttermost of Kiriath-jearim : And this border goeth out to the west , and it cometh out to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah .
\p
\v 16 And this border goeth down to the uttermost ( part ) of the mount , which is over against the valley of the son of Hinnom , which is in the valley of the Rephaites [ Or, Giants ] toward the north , and descendeth through the valley of Hinnom , on the side of the Jebusites southward , and descendeth to the fountain of Rogel.
\p
\v 17 And stretcheth it self from the north , and goeth out to the En-semes , from thence [ i.e. from En-semes ] it goeth out toward Geliloth , [ which is called Gilgal , Jos. 15.7.] which is over against the going up to Adummim : and it descendeth at the stone of Bohan [ see Jos 16.6.] the son of Reuben
\p
\v 18 And passeth through side-wise over against Araba [ Oth. the plain field ] to the north , and descendeth unto Araba .
\p
\v 19 Furthermore , this border passeth thorow on the side of Beth-hogla northward , and the goings out of this border are at the tongue [ See Jos.15.2.] of the Salt-sea northward , at the uttermost ( part ) of Jordan southward : This is the southern border .
\p
\v 20 Now Jordan bordereth it at the corner toward the east : This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin in their borders round about , according to their families .
\p
\v 21 Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin , according to their families , are Jericho , and Beth-hogla , and Emek-Keziz ,
\p
\v 22 And Beth-Araba , Zemaraim , and Beth-el ,
\p
\v 23 And Havvim, and Para , and Ophra ,
\p
\v 24 And Cephar-hammonai , and Ophni , and Gaba , twelve cities and their villages .
\p
\v 25 Gibeon , and Rama , and Beeroth ,
\p
\v 26 And Mizpe , and Chephira , and Moza ,
\p
\v 27 And Rekem , and Irpeel , and Tharaba ,
\p
\v 28 And Zela , Eleph , and Jebusi , [ Oth. the city of the Jebusites ] ( this is Jerusalem ) Gibbath , Kiriath , fourteen cities together with their villages : This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin , according to their families .
\c 19
\s The lot of the tribe of Simeon falleth in the tribe of Juda , ver. 1, etc. Because the lot of the tribe of Juda was too great , 9. The third lot of the children of Zebulon , 10. The fourth for the children of Issachar , 17. The fifth for Aser , 24. The sixth for Naphtali , 32. The seventh for Dan , 47. The children of Israel give unto Josua Timnath-Serah for an inheritance , 49. The dividing the land of promise is finished , 51.
\p
\v 1 Then came out [ viz. out of the vessel into which they cast all the lots , and drew them out ] the second lot for Simeon , for the tribe of the children of Simeon , according to their families : and their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Juda . [ see Gen. 49.7. where Jacob foretelleth , that Simeon and Levi should be scattered in Israel , for the murther which they had committed in Sichem : The Levites were spread throughout the whole land , and the Simeonites were divided in Juda ]
\p
\v 2 And they had their inheritance Beer-Seba , and Seba , [ The particle (and ) here , is conceived to be in this place as much as , or , that is . For Seba and Beer-Seeba , according to the opinion of many , is one and the same City ; therefore it is quite left out in 1 Chronicles 4.28.where this history is again repeated , and below ver.6. Are no more then thirteen cities named ] and Malada .
\p
\v 3 And Hazar-Sual , and Bala [ This city is called , 1 Chron.4.29. Bilha . There doth often happen some alteration or addition in the proper names of men , cities , and villages ; here ver.4. Is Eltholad , which 1 Chro. 4.29. is called Tholad : and for Bethul , is put Bethuel : for Beth-lebaoth , v.6. is put , 1 Chronicles 4.31. Beth-Biri. Many such alterations there be , as would be too long and tedious always to mark them all . These changes and alterations happened either through length of time , or brevities sake , or for the readier and easier pronounciation.]
\p
\v 4 And Eltholad , and Bethul , and Horma , [ See the annot. Judg.1.17.]
\p
\v 5 And Ziklag , and Beth-hammarchaboth , and Harza-susa ,
\p
\v 6 And Beth-Labaoth , and Saruhen , thirteen cities and their villages .
\p
\v 7 Ain, Rimmon , and Ether , and Asan : four cities and their villages .
\p
\v 8 And all the villages that were round about these cities , to Balath-Beer ( that is ) Ramath [ Some conceive , that Balath-Beer and Ramath , are one and the same city ] toward the south : This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon , according to their families .
\p
\v 9 The inheritance of the children of Simeon is among the line of the children of Juda : [See the annotat. on Jos.15.32. ] for the inheritance of the children of Juda was too great for them , [ i.e. it was greater then they had need of , or too great to be onely inhabited by the tribe of Juda ] therefore do the children of Simeon inherit in the midst of their inheritance .
\p
\v 10 After that came up the third lot for the children of Zebulon , [ Here the tribe of Zebulon is placed before the tribe of Issachar , notwithstanding that Issachar was elder then Zebulon ; as also Jacob in his last Will Gen.49.13,14. ordered it , Moseh likewise , Deut . 33.19. ] according to their families : and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid .
\p
\v 11 And their border goeth upward toward the west , [ Heb. toward the Sea ] and Marala , and reacheth unto Dabbaseth : and reacheth unto the brook which is before Jokneam.
\p
\v 12 And it turneth it self from Sarid eastward , toward the rising of the Sun , unto the border of Chisloth-Thabor : and it cometh out at Dobrath , and goeth upward unto Japhia .
\p
\v 13 And from thence it passeth on eastward to the rising of Gath-hepper [ Whence the Prohet Jona was born , 2 Kings 24.15. ] at Eth-Cazin : and it cometh out at Rimmon -Methoar , which is Nea . [oth. which ( viz. Rimmon ) ended at Nea ]
\p
\v 14 And this border turneth it self about toward the north to Hannathon : and the out-goings thereof are the valley of Jiphtah-El.
\p
\v 15 And Kattah, and Nahalal , and Simeon , and Idala , and Bethlehem : [ this is not that Bethlehem where Christ was born , for that lay in the tribe of Juda , and this lay in the tribe of Zebulon , ver.10 ] twelve cities and their villages .
\p
\v 16 This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulon , according to their families : these cities and their villages .
\p
\v 17 The fourth lot came out for Issachar , for the children of Issachar , according to their families .
\p
\v 18 And their border was Jezreel , and Chesuloth , and Simeon . [ This city was situate on the border of Issachar , and it is known by the hospitality which the Prophet Elizeus found there : And being birth-place to Abisag , who cherished King David in his old age , 1 Kings 1.3.]
\p
\v 19 And Hapharain, and Sihon, and Anachacath,
\p
\v 20 And Rabbath, and Kision, and Ebez,
\p
\v 21 And Rameth, and En-gannim, [There lieth another En-gannim in the tribe of Juda, another besides on Jordan] and En-hadda,and Beth-pezez.
\p
\v 22 And this border reacheth unto Thabor, and Sahazima, and Beth-semes, [There were divers cities in the land land of Canaan, called Semes] and the goings out of their border are at the Jordan : fifteen cities and their villages .
\p
\v 23 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar , according to their families , the cities and their villages .
\p
\v 24 Then came out the fifth lot for the tribe of the children of Aser , according to their families .
\p
\v 25 And their border was Helcath , and Hali , and Beten , and Achsaph ,
\p
\v 26 And Alammelech , and Amad , and Misal : and reacheth unto Carmel westward , [Heb. to the Sea ] and unto Sihor-Libnoth . [ Some conceive that Libnah is a brook , otherwise called Belum , or Pagida ]
\p
\v 27 And turneth it self towards the rising of the sun unto Beth-dagon , and reacheth unto Zebulon , and unto the valley Jiphtah-El, northward to Beth-Emek , and Nehiel , and cometh out unto Chebul [ Some take this for the name of a city , others conceive it to be the name of a countrey , wherein lay the twenty cities which Solomon gave unto Hiram ] on the left hand .
\p
\v 28 And Ebron , [ This Ebron , written in Hebrew with an Ain , is to be distinguished from the known Hebron situate in Juda , which is written with a Cheth ] and Rebob , and Hammon , and Kana : [ this is the great Kana situate not far from Zion , and the Galilee of the Gentiles : The little Kana lay in the tribe of Zebulon , in the nether Galilee. Here Christ turned the Water into Wine , Joh. 2. and here he healed the Noble-mans Son , Joh. 4.46. ] unto great Zidon . [ this City is called great Zidon , not because there is also a little Zidon , not because there is also a little Zidon , but because of its excellency , fame , and riches ]
\p
\v 29 And this border turneth it self toward Rama , and unto the fenced City Tyrus : [ Heb. Tson , and signifieth a Rock, because it was born upon a Rock , and lay as it were encompassed in the Sea , on the Rocks : It belonged indeed to the tribe of Aser , but the Heathen kept it , as may appear , 2 Sam.5.11.& 1 Kings 5.1,2. and elsewhere besides ] then this border turneth to Hosa , and the out-goings thereof are at the Sea, from the land-line , extending to Achzib.
\p
\v 30 And Ummah , and Aphek , and Rahob : two and twenty cities and their villages .
\p
\v 31 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Aser , according to their families : these cities and their villages .
\p
\v 32 The sixth lot came out for the children of Naphtali : for the children of Naphtali , according to their families .
\p
\v 33 And their border is from Heleph , from Allon , unto Zaanannim , and Adami-Nekeb , and Jabneel , unto Lakkum : and the goings out thereof are at the Jordan .
\p
\v 34 And this border turneth it self westward toward Aznoth , Thabor , and from thence it goeth on to Hukkok : and it reacheth unto Zebulon toward the south , and to Aser it reacheth towards the west , and unto Juda at the Jordan , toward the rising of the sun .
\p
\v 35 Now the fenced cities are : Ziddim , Zer , and Hammath , Rakkath , and Chinnereth . [ Oth. Gennesereth ]
\p
\v 36 And Adama , and Rama , and Hazor ,
\p
\v 37 And Kedes , and Edrei , and En-hazor ,
\p
\v 38 And Iron , and Migdal-El , Horem , and Beth-Anath , Beth-Semes : nineteen cities and their villages .
\p
\v 39 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, according to their families, the cities and their villages.
\p
\v 40 The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan, according to their families.
\p
\v 41 And the brother of their inheritance was Zoar, And Estaol, and Ir-Semes,
\p
\v 42 And Saalabbin, and Ajalon and Ithla,
\p
\v 43 Elon, and Timnata, and Ekron,
\p
\v 44 And Elkete, and Gibbeton, [When Nadab the son of Rehabeam belieged this city, he was slain of Baala, 1 Kings 15. verse 27.] and Baalach,
\p
\v 45 And Jebud , and Bene-Berak , and Gath-Rimmon ,
\p
\v 46 And Mejarkon , and Rakkon : with the border over against Japho . [ Oth. Joppe , Acts 9.36. Here Jonas took shipping for to sail to Tharsis , Jon. 1.3. now it is called Jaffa.]
\p
\v 47 But the border of the children of Dan was come out too little for them : therefore the children of Dan went up , and warred against Lesem , [ Oth. Laisch , or Lais , as Judg. 18 . where this History is more amply rehearsed . And there its said , That this was done when there was no King or Judge in Israel . Hence may be gathered , That this book was not written by Josua , for he could not write that which happened after his death ] and took it , and smote it with the edge [Heb. mouth ] of the sword , and inherited it , and dwelt therein , and they called Lesen , Dan , after the name of Dan their father . [ the meaning is , after they had taken the city of Lesen they called it Dan , after the Patriarch Dan , from whom they were descended . This city was seated at the foot of the hill Libanus , in the valley of Tehob , where Jordan had its original sourse . When Philip the Tetrarch , the brother of Herod , in the time of the Emperour Tiberius , had re-edified this city , and much enlarged it , he called it Cesarea-Philippi, after the Emperour's and his own name . Pliny testifieth that it was also called Paneas ; and yet more lately Pelin . It lieth at the end of the land of Caanan , about 35000 paces from Sidon ]
\p
\v 48 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of dan , according to their families , these cities and their villages .
\p
\v 49 Now when they had made an end of dividing the land hereditarily , according to its borders , the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Josua in the midst of them.
\p
\v 50 According to the mouth of the LORD , they gave him that city which he desired , Timnath-Sepher [Otherwise called Timnath-Hereb, Judg.2.9. Here that great commander Josua was buried , Jos. 24.30. ] on the mountain of Ephraim : and he built that city , and dwelt therein .
\p
\v 51 These are the inheritance which Eleazer the Priest and Josua the son of Nun , and the heads of the fathers of the tribes , hereditarily divided by lot unto the children of Israel at Silo before the face of the LORD , at the door of the Tent of the congregation : Thus they made an end of dividing the land . [ This 51 ver. is a general conclusion of all that was written , from the first Chapter even to this place , concerning the division of the land of Promise .]
\c 20
\s The command of the LORD concerning the six cities of refuge , for those who unawares should slay a man , v.1, etc. and the right use of the same , 5. The Israelites appoint hereunto six cities , three on this , and three on the other side of Jordan .
\p
\v 1 Furthermore , the LORD spake unto Josua , saying ,
\p
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Josua , Saying , Give yourselves the five cities [ Heb. Cities of Retreat or Contraction . The Hebrew word signifieth to draw together , or to contract . These cities are so called , because those that fled for slaying a man , are to take refuge there , and to keep with the same ] whereof I spake with you by the ministery of Moseh. Heb. By the hand of Moseh.]
\p
\v 3 That the slayer may flee thither that slayeth a soul [ i.e. man , yea , the body of a man , for the soul of a man cannot be killed : for soul , ver. 5. it's said , his neighbour ] through errour , not wittingly [ they that wilfully , or of set purpose , had slain any man , were no where free , not so much as in the Temple , nor at the Altar , Exod. 21.14. ] that they may be a refuge unto you before the avenger of blood . [ i.e. before him , who being of kin to , or of the blood of him that was slain , had right or reason to take or demand vengeance for the same ]
\p
\v 4 When he doth flee from to one of those cities , he shall stand at the door of the gate of the city , [ i.e. at the Town-hall , or place of Judicature , which formerly was wont to be in the City-gates ] and he shall utter his words [ i.e. he shall give notice wherefore he came thither , how aud what he hath done ] before th ears of the Eldest [ i.e. of the Magistrate ] of that city : then [ viz. after it is found that he is no wilful Murtherer ] shall they take [ Heb. gather ] him unto them into the city , and give him place , that he may dwell among them.
\p
\v 5 And when the avenger of blood pursueth after him , they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand , because he slew not his neighbour wittingly , and hated him not yesterday ( and ) ere yesterday . [ i.e. formerly ]
\p
\v 6 And he shall dwell in the same city , until he stand before the face of the congregation for judgement , [ Oth. from having stood , & c. intimating , that he might not be admitted into the city , without having past a solemn tryal ] until the High-Priest die , that shall be in those dayes : [ the meaning of these words is , that the party fled after he was heard and acquitted , was nevertheless to continue in the City of Refuge , until the death of the High-Priest , that liveth at that time when the fact was committed ] then shall the slayer [ i.e. after his tryal and and acquitment ] return and come unto his city , and unto his house , unto the city from whence he fled .
\p
\v 7 Then they hallowed [ i.e. they appointed and ordained for Cities of Refuge ] Kedes in Galilea on Mount Naphtali , and Sichem on Mount Ephraim : and Kiriath-Arba , this is Hebron [ these three Cities lay on this side Jordan , and may be gathered from ver.8. ] on Mount Juda . [ i.e. the mountanous or hilly countrey of Juda , as Luke 1.39. & 65.]
\p
\v 8 And the other side of Jordan from Jericho eastward , they gave Bezer in the wilderness , in the plain land , [ That this city lay in the wilderness , appeareth by 1 Mach.5. That it lay in the low grounds ( viz. of the Moabites countrey ) appeareth by Jer.48.24.] of the tribe of Reuben : And Ramath in Gilead of the tribe of of Gad , and Golan in the Basan of the tribe of Manasseh .
\p
\v 9 Now these are the cities that were appointed [ Heb. the cities of appointment , or ordaining , i.e. which were ordained and appointed for Cities of Refuge , oth. of coming together ] for all the children of Israel and for the stranger that sojourneth in the midst of them , that everyone might flee thither that slayeth a soul through errour , lest he die by the hand of the avenger of blood , until he shall have stood before the face of the congregation . [ i.e. until his cause shall be heard in Judgement : And understand herewithall , and he shall be acquitted .]
\c 21
\s The Israelites give cities unto the Levites , by lot , to inhabit , and also the suburbs thereunto appertaining , ver.1, etc. After that , are specified the cities which fell by lot unto the children of Aaron , v.8. The names of the cities that were given to the Kohathites , 20. As also unto the Gersonites , 27. and Merarites , 34. All the cities that were given to the Levites , were eight and forty , with their suburbs , 41. The Israelites do quietly possess the land of Canaan promised unto their fathers , 43.
\p
\v 1 Then drew near the heads of the fathers of the Levites [ i.e. chiefest over the families of the Levites , of which there were three , viz. the Kohathites , Gersonites , and Merarites ] unto Eleazar the Priest , and unto Josua the son of Nun : and unto the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel .
\p
\v 2 And they spake unto them at Silo [ Where the Ark of the Covenant , and the Tent of the Congregation were set up ] in the land of Canaan , saying , The LORD commanded by the ministery of Moseh , [ Heb. By the hand of Moseh . So also v.8. ] that cities should be given us to dwell in , and their suburbs for our beasts .
\p
\v 3 Therefore the children of Israel gave unto the Levites of their inheritance , according to the mouth of the LORD , these cities , and the suburbs thereof .
\p
\v 4 Then the lot came out for the families of Kohathites : and for the children of Aaron the Priest , of the Levites , (there) were of the tribe of Juda , ad of the tribe of Simeon , and of the tribe of Benjamin by lot , thirteen cities . [ Of which see further below ver. 11, etc.]
\p
\v 5 And to the rest of the children of Kahath , (there) fell by lot of the families of the tribe of Ephraim , and of the tribe of Dan , and of the half tribe of Manasseh , ten cities . [ Whereof see further below ver.20. ]
\p
\v 6 And unto the children of Gerson , of the families of the tribe of Issachar , and of the tribe of Aser , and of the tribe of Naphtali , and of the half tribe of Manasseh in Basan , by lot , thirteen cities . [ Whereof see further below ver. 27, & c.]
\p
\v 7 Unto the children of Merari according to their families , of the tribe of Reuben , and of the tribe of Gad , and of the tribe of Zebulon , twelve cities . [ Of these twelve cities , see below ver. 38 , & c.]
\p
\v 8 so thwe children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these suburbs and their suburbs , as the LORD had commanded by the ministery of Moseh. [ Heb. By the hand of Moseh , as above ver.2. ]
\p
\v 9 Furthermore , they gave of the tribe of the children of Juda, and of the tribe of the children of Simeon , these cities , which were named :
\p
\v 10 That they were the children of Aaron 's , of the families of the Kahathites , of the children of Levi : for the first lot was theirs .
\p
\v 11 So they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anok [Oth. Enak, Jos. 15.13 .] ( that is Hebron ) on the mountain of Juda , and the subrbs thereof [ i.e. fields and the meadows that lay round about the cities ] round about it .
\p
\v 12 But the field of the city [ viz. two thousand ells or cubits distant from the city . See Numb. 35.5. ] and the villages thereof , they gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunne for his possession . [ See above chapter 14.14.]
\p
\v 13 Thus they gave unto the children of Aaron the Priest , the free city of the slayer , Hebron , and her suburbs , [ In the Register or Roll of names of these cities here below mentioned , and in the Register or Roll thereof , 1 Chronicles 6.57. we finde sometimes some difference in some names of Cities . This cometh to pass from thence , that some names of the Cities by length of time are changed ; or that some cities have had more then one name ] and Libna , and her suburb . [ See Jos .10.29.]
\p
\v 14 And Fatthir and her suburbs , and Esthemoa and her suburbs ,
\p
\v 15 And Cholon and her suburbs , and Debir and her suburbs ,
\p
\v 16 And Ain and her suburbs , and Jutta and her suburbs , and Bethsemes [See of this city 2 Kings 14. on v.11. ] and her suburbs : nine cities of these two tribes.
\p
\v 17 And of the tribe of Benjamin , Gibeon and her suburbs , Geba and her suburbs .
\p
\v 18 Anathoth [ Where the Prophet Jeremia was born , Jer.1.1.] and her suburbs , and Almon [this city is also called Allemeth , both signifying youth. It is also called Bachurim , 2 Sam.3.16. which signifieth the same ] and her suburbs : four cities .
\p
\v 19 All the cities of the children of Aaron the Priest , were thirteen cities and their suburbs.
\p
\v 20 Now unto the families of the children of Kahat , the Levites which remained of the children of Kahat : they had the cities of their lot of the tribe of Ephraim .
\p
\v 21 And they gave Sichem a free city of the slayer , and her suburbs upon mount Ephraim , and Gezer [ See Judg. 1. 29.] and her suburbs :
\p
\v 22 And Kibzaim and her suburbs , Beth-horon and her suburbs : four cities.
\p
\v 23 And the tribe of Dan , Elteke and her suburbs , Gibbethon and her suburbs ,
\p
\v 24 Ajalon and her suburbs , Gath-Rimmon and her suburbs : four cities .
\p
\v 25 And the tribe of Manasseh , Thaanach and her suburbs , Gath-Rimmon and her suburbs : two cities .
\p
\v 26 All the cities for the families of the rest of the children of Kahat , are ten with their suburbs .
\p
\v 27 And unto the children of Gerson , of the families of the Levites , of the half tribe of Manasseh , the free city of the slayer , Golan in Basan and her suburbs , and Beesthera and her suburbs : four cities .
\p
\v 28 And of the tribe of Issachar , Kisjod and her suburbs, and Dobrath and her suburbs ,
\p
\v 29 Jarmuth and her suburbs , Engannim and her suburbs : four cities .
\p
\v 30 And of the tribe of Aser , Misal and her suburbs , Abdon and her suburbs ,
\p
\v 31 And Helkath and her suburbs , and Rehob and her suburbs : four cities .
\p
\v 32 And of the tribe of Naphtali , the free city of the slayer , Kedes in Galilee and her suburbs , and Kartan and her suburbs : three cities .
\p
\v 33 All the cities of the Gersonites , according to their families , are thirteen cities and their suburbs .
\p
\v 34 Now unto the families of the children of Merari , of the rest of the Levites ( was given ) of the tribe of Zebulon , Jokneam and her suburbs , Karta and her suburbs ,
\p
\v 35 Dimna and her suburbs , Nahalal and her suburbs : four cities .
\p
\v 36 And of the tribe of Reuben , Bezer and her suburbs , and Jaza and her suburbs ,
\p
\v 37 Kedemoth and her suburbs , and Mephaath and her suburbs : four cities .
\p
\v 38 Now of the tribe of Gad , the free city of the slayer , Ramoth in Gilead and her suburbs , and Mahanaim and her suburbs ,
\p
\v 39 Hesbon and her suburbs , Jaezer and her suburbs : all those cities are four .
\p
\v 40 All those cities were the childrens of Merari , according to their families , which yet were remaining of the families of the children of the Levites : and their lot was twelve cities .
\p
\v 41 All the cities of the Levites in the midst of their inheritance of the children of Israel , were forty eight cities and their suburbs . [ The tribe of Levi was least among all the tribes of the Levites , for in the same were numbred onely 20000 men , Numb. 16 . How cometh it then to pass , that other tribes that were as numerous again , and more , had but twelve , or sixteen , or nineteen , or twenty cities , and the tribe of Levi had forty eighty? The answer is , That all the cities of the other tribes are not named ; but all the cities of the Levites are named . Secondly , the Levites might dwell no where but in cities , but so might the other tribes ; and therefore the Levites had need of more cities then the other tribes .]
\p
\v 42 These cities were each { Heb. city city ] with their suburbs round about them : so was it with all the cities.
\p
\v 43 Thus the LORD gave unto Israel [ i.e. unto the children of Israel ] all the land , which he had sworn to give unto their fathers : and they inherited it , and dwelt therein .
\p
\v 44 And the LORD gave them rest round about , according to all that had sworn unto their fathers : and not one man of all their enemies subsisted before their face , [ i.e. no man was able to withstand or annoy the children of Israel ] all their enemies the LORD gave into their hand .
\p
\v 45 There fell not one word of all the good words which the LORD had spoken unto the house of Israel : it came all ( to pass .)
\c 22
\s The Reubenites , and the half tribe of Manasseh are sent home by Josua , ver.1,etc. Josua chargeth them very strictly to fear the Lord , 5. They depart with great booty , 8. They build an Altar at the brink of Jordan , 10. Which the rest of the Israelites understanding , they assemble to make war against them , 11.Yet they send first ambassadors to them , sharply reproving them for it , 13. But they clear themselves ,21. So that the ambassadors and all the people did rest satisfied therewith ,30.
\p
\v 1 Then Josua called the Reubenites and the Gadites , and the half tribe of Manasseh ,
\p
\v 2 And said unto them , Ye have kept all that Moseh the servant of the LORD commanded you : and ye have obeyed my voyce in all that I have commanded you . [ See Numb. 32.20. Deut.3.18.]
\p
\v 3 Ye have not left your brethren now a long time , [ Heb. these many dayes . It was according to the computation of some , full thirteen years . They spent seven years in subduing the land , and seven years in dividing the same ] unto this day : but ye have observed the keeping of the commandments of the LORD your God .
\p
\v 4 And now the LORD hath given rest to your brethren , as he had promised them : therefore now return , and go unto your tents , unto the land of your possession , which Moseh the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side of Jordan . [See Num.32.33. Deut.3.13. & 29.8. Jos.13.8. ]
\p
\v 5 Onely take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law , which Moseh the servant of the LORD commanded you , that ye love the LORD your God , and that ye walk in all his wayes , and keep his commandments , and cleave unto him , and that ye serve him with all your heart , and with all your soul.
\p
\v 6 Thus Josua blessed them : and he let them depart , and they went unto their tents . [i.e. habitations , dwelling-places : as elswhere ]
\p
\v 7 For unto the ( one ) half of the tribe of Manasseh , Moseh had given ( an inheritance ) in Basan : but unto ( the other ) half thereof [ i.e. the other half tribe of Manasseh , Heb. and their half ) Josua gave ( an inheritance ) by their brethren [ viz. with the other nine tribes , who received their inheritance on this side of Jordan ] on this side of Jordan westward : [ Oth. by the Sea , or unto the Sea ] Moreover also , when Josua let them depart unto their tents , he blessed them ,
\p
\v 8 And he spake unto them , saying , Return unto your tents with much riches , and with very much cattel , with silver , and with gold, with copper , and with iron , and with very many garments : divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren . [ i.e. with the tribes that remained on this side of Jordan with the baggage . See hereof Num. 31.27. & 1 Sam.30.24.]
\p
\v 9 So the children of Reuben , and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned , and departed , from the children of Israel from Silo, which is in the land of Canaan , to go unto the land of Gilead , unto the land of their possession , wherein they were made possessors , according to the mouth of the LORD by the ministery [ Heb. hand ] of Moseh.
\p
\v 10 When they came unto the borders of Jordan , which are in the land of Canaan , then the children of Reuben , and the children of Gad , and the half tribe of Manasseh , built there an Altar by Jordan , an Altar great in sight .
\p
\v 11 And the children of Israel heard say , Behold , the children of Reuben , and the children of Gad , and the half tribe of Manasseh , have built an Altar , over against the land of Canaan , at the borders of Jordan , on the side of the children of Israel . [ i.e. of the greatest part of the children of Israel ]
\p
\v 12 When the children of Israel heard this , then the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled at Silo , to march up against them with an host .
\p
\v 13 And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben , and unto the children of Gad , and unto the half tribe of Manasseh , in the land of Gilead , Pinchas the son of Eleazar the Priest ,
\p
\v 14 And ten Princes [ There were nine tribes and an half ; so that it appeareth here , that the half tribe of Manasseh , as well as the whole tribes , sent one Prince ] with him : of each fathers house one Prince [ Heb. one Prince one Prince in the fathers house ] out of all the tribes of Israel : and they were every one a head of the house of their fathers , over the thousands of Israel .
\p
\v 15 When they came unto the children of Reuben , and unto the children of Gad , and unto the half tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead , they spake with them , saying ,
\p
\v 16 Thus speaketh the whole congregation of the LORD , What transgression is this wherewith ye have transgressed against the God of Israel , turning away this day from after the LORD [ i.e. not following after the LORD [ i.e. not following after the Lord ; so also v.18, 23,29.] in that ye have built you an Altar , to rebel this day against the LORD ?
\p
\v 17 Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us ? [ See Num.25.3. Deut .4.27.] fromwhich we are not cleansed until this day , although the plague hath been in the congregation of the LORD ?
\p
\v 18 Seing ye turn your selves away this day from after the LORD : it shall come to pass then , when to day ye are rebellious against the LORD , then to morrow [ i.e. hereafter , in time to come : So also ver.24. and chapter 4,6.] he will be greatly incensed against the whole congregation of Israel .
\p
\v 19 But yet if the land of your possession be unclean , come over into the land of the possession of the LORD , [ As if he should say , If ye think thatGod doth not take your land into his favour and protection , as well as ours , why then come over , etc.] where the Tabernacle [ Heb.dwelling , dwelling place ] of the LORD dwelleth , [ the Tabernacle was set up at Silo . See Jos. 18.1. ] and take possession in the midst of us : but rebel not against the LORD, neither rebel against us , in building an Altar for your selves , besides the Altar of the LORD our God .
\p
\v 20 Did not Acham the son of Zarah [ i.e. that was of the generation , or family , and posterity of Zerah , for his immediate father was Charmi , Jos.7.17,18.] commit transgression [ Heb. transgresse transgression with the banned ( thing ) ? [ Heb. the ban ] and came [ Heb. was ] there not an indignation [ viz. of God , i.e. punishment. See Num.1. on v. 53, ] on all the congregation of Israel ? And that man died not alone [ For first there were thirty six Israelites slain near Ai, and afterward his wife , children and goods were likewise destroyed . Heb. and that onely man perished not ] in his iniquity . [ or , for his iniquity]
\p
\v 21 Then answered the children of Reuben , and the children of Gad , and the half tribe of Manasseh , and they spake with the heads of the thousands of Israel : [ The Israelites were divided into thousands , see Exod.18.52. Judg.6. on v.15. ]
\p
\v 22 The God of gods , [See Deut.10. on v.17.] the LORD , the God of gods , the LORD , he knoweth it , even Israel himself shall also know it , if it be by rebellion , or if it be by transgression against the LORD, save us not this day . [ Some conceive this to be an address unto the Lord ; others , unto the people of Israel , or Pinehas ]
\p
\v 23 That we should have built us an Altar , to turn our selves away from after the LORD ; or to offer thereon burnt-offering , and meat-offering , or to offer thank-offering thereon , let the LORD require it . [ i.e. let the LORD punish us for it : Heb. let the LORD seek it ]
\p
\v 24 And if we have not done this out of care , in regard of this ) thing , [viz. of the true worship of God ] saying , To morrow [ i.e. hereafter , in time to come ] your children might speak unto our children , saying , what have you to do with the LORD the God of Israel ? [ Heb. What is (it) to you , and the Lord the God of Israel ? Such phrases or manners of speaking , are also used in the New Testament , Matth.8.29. and Joh.2.3. ]
\p
\v 25 The LORD surely hath set Jordan for a border between us , and between you , the children of Reuben and the children of Gad , ye have no part in the LORD : [i.e. ye are not the people of God , ye have no part in the riches of his grace and benefits : See the like manner of speaking , 2 Sam.20.1. and 1 Kings 12.16.] then your children might cause our children to cease from fearing the LORD.
\p
\v 26 Therefore we said , Let us now make for our selves , building an Altar , not for burnt offering , nor for sacrifice , [ i.e. not for any offering or sacrifice ]
\p
\v 27 But that it may be a witness between us and between you , and between our generations after us , that we might serve the service of the LORD before his face , with our burnt-offerings , and with our slay-offerings , and with our thank-offerings , and that your children might not say to morrow unto our children , Ye have no part in the LORD.
\p
\v 28 Therefore we said , When it cometh to pass , that they shall ( thus ) to morrow to us , and to our generations ; then we shall say , Behold the shape [ Or , fashion , i.e. patern , figure , form , likeness ] of the Altar of the LORD which our fathers have made , not for burnt offering , nor for sacrifice , but it is a witness between us and between you .
\p
\v 29 Be it far from us , that we should rebel against the LORD , or that we should this day turn away our selves from after the LORD , building an Altar for burnt offering , for meat-offering , or for slay-offering , besides the Altar of the LORD our God , which is before his Tabernacle .
\p
\v 30 When Pinehas the Priest , and the Princes of the Congregation , and [ i.e. namely , to wit : see ver. 14. ] the heads of the thousands of Israel that were by him , heards the words which the children of Reuben , and the children of Gad , and the children of Manasseh had spoken , it was good in their eyes .
\p
\v 31 And Pinehas the son of Eleazar the Priest said unto the children of Reuben , and unto the children of Gad , and unto the children of Manasseh , This day we know , that the LORD is in the midst of us , [ Forasmuch as he keepeth you , that ye sin not against him , nor seperate your selves from us , as we feared , from whence great mischief would have come to all Israel ] seeing ye have not committed this transgression against the LORD: Then ye delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD. [ viz. when ye built that Altar for that end and purpose , as ye told us : for had ye built it to set up a new worship , and to seperate your selves from the rest of the tribes , thereby ye would have kindled Gods wrath , and brought down his judgement upon all Israel ]
\p
\v 32 And Pinehas the son of Eleazar the Priest , with the Princes , returned from the children of Reuben , and from the children of Gad , out of the land of Gilead unto the land of Canaan , unto the children of Israel , and they brought them answer back . [ Heb. they brought them the word again , i.e. they faithfully reported unto the Congregation , the answer and apologie of the Reubenites , etc.together with their whole transaction and intent ]
\p
\v 33 Now the answer was good in the eyes of the children of Israel ; and the children of Israel praised God , and spake no ( more ) of going up against them with any host , to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and the children of Gad dwelt .
\p
\v 34 And the children of Reuben , and the children of Gad , called that Altar , Be it a witness between us , [ Others insert herein the Hebrew word Ed , i.e. witness ; others conceive , that the following words in the Text , ( KIED HU BETRUNU , for he is witness between us ) were the name of this Altar ] that the LORD is God . [ i.e. that he alone is to be worshipped , and acknowledged to be the true God ]
\c 23
\s Josua being grown old , assembleth all Israel , and declareth how wonderfully God had fought for his people , and given them the lands of the subdued nations for inheritance , v.1 , & c. therefore he exhorteth them to be diligent in keeping the Law written by Moseh , 6. And to beware of going in , and mixing themselves with the idolatry of the heathen , 7. Setting before them the mercies which they had received of God , and yet were to receive , 9 . With threatning of Gods judgements , if they should forsake the Lord ,11.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after many days , [ 'T was about fourteen years after they were come into the land of Canaan : Compare this with the Annot. above chapter 22.3. ] after that the LORD had given Israel rest from all their enemies round about : and Josua was old ( and ) stricken in age : [Heb. was come unto days ]
\p
\v 2 That Josua called all Israel , [ Underst. the Heads and Princes , with all those of the people that could give their appearance or attendance thereunto ] their eldest , and their heads , and their judges , and their officers : and he said unto them , I am grown old , and stricken in age .
\p
\v 3 And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations before your face : for it is the LORD your GOD himself that hath fought for you.
\p
\v 4 Behold ; I have made these remaining nations [ viz. which were yet to be warred upon , and destroyed by the Israelites ] to fall unto you by lot , for inheritance unto your tribes , from Jordan , together with all the nations which I saw destroyed , and unto the great Sea , toward the going down of the Sun.
\p
\v 5 And the LORD your God himself shall thrust them out [ To wit , the heathen nations which yet remain in the land of Canaan ] before your face , and he shall drive them out before your face ; and ye shall possess their land by inheritance , according as the LORD your God hath spoken [ i.e. promised ] unto you.
\p
\v 6 Therefore be very strong to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the Law of Moseh, that ye may not depart from it to the right hand , nor to the left .
\p
\v 7 That ye go not in to these nations , these that yet remain amongst you : [ i.e. entertain no fellowship or society with them : for he that dealeth with Pitch , is soiled therewith. Some understand this , as if the Israelites were forbidden here to marry with those nations . See below v.12.] neither remember the name of their gods , [ oth. make no mention of the name of their gods ] nor swear by them , [ the meaning is , Swear not by the gods of the heathen , nor cause others to swear by them : See Exod.23.13. Deut. 12.3. Psal.16.4.] nor serve them , neither bow your selves before them .
\p
\v 8 But ye shall cleave unto the LORD your God : even as ye have done this day.
\p
\v 9 For the LORD hath driven out from your face great and mighty nations : and as for you , no man hath subsisted before your face unto this day.
\p
\v 10 One man among you shall chase a thousand : for it is the LORD your God himself that fighteth for you , according as he hath spoken [ i.e. promised ] unto you.
\p
\v 11 Therefore keep your souls diligently , that ye love the LORD your God .
\p
\v 12 For if in any wise ye turn aside , and cleave unto the remnant of these nations , of these that remain among you, and do joyn your selves in affinity with them , and that you shall go in unto them , and they unto you :
\p
\v 13 Know for certain , [ Heb. know knowing ] that the LORD your God will not go on to drive out these nations from before your face : but they shall be unto you for a snare , and for a net , and for a scourge on your sides , [ of old they were wont to whip , or scorge mens sides , as may be gathered here , and Ecclesiasticus 30.12. and 42.5. ] and for thorns in your eyes , untill ye perish from this good land , which the LORD your God hath given you.
\p
\v 14 And behold , this day [ i.e. soon , ere long : for Josua made this exhortation not just the same day that he dyed , but somewhat before ] I go the way of all the earth : [ i.e. I dye , even as all men that live upon the earth , and in all your soul , that there is not one word fallen [ compare 1 Sam 3.19. with the Annotat. there ] of all those good words , which the LORD your God hath spoken concerning you , they are all come upon you , there is not one word of the same fallen .
\p
\v 15 And it shall come to pass , according as these good things are come upon you , which the LORD your God spake unto you : so shall the LORD cause to come upon you all those evil things [ Oth. words ; viz. wherewith he hath threatned you , if ye should not keep and obey his commandments ] until he casteth you from off this good land , which the LORD your God hath given you .
\p
\v 16 When ye transgress the covenant of the LORD your God , which he hath commanded you , and ye go away and serve other gods , and bow down your selves before the same ; then shall the anger of the LORD kindle against you , and ye shall perish quickly from the good land which he hath given you .
\c 24
\s Josua assembleth all the tribes of Israel at Sichem , v.1, & c. He putteth them in minde of the favours and benefits of God , shewed unto their fathers and themselves , 2. He exhorteth them in that regard faithfully to serve the true God , 4. Protesting for himself and his house in this behalf , 15. The people also promise four several times to persevere in the sincere worship of God , 16. Josua reneweth the covenant of the LORD with the people , 25. He writeth this in the book of the Law of the LORD , and setteth up a great stone in remembrance thereof , 26. The death, age , and the burial of Josua , 29. The burying of Joseph's bones , 32. The death and burial of Eleazar , 33.
\p
\v 1 After that,Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel as Sichem [i.e. according to the opinion of some,at Silo,which lay in the land of Sichem,for there the Tabernacle was.Understand this likewise so below ver.32. But others coinceive,that upon this day of solemn assembly,Joshua caused the Ark to be brought from Silo unto the City of Sichem.as the same hath been often done,viz. Under Eli,Samuel,Saul, and David] and he called the eldest of Israel,and the heads thereof,and they presented themselves before the face of God.[ i.e before the Tabernacle wherein God dwelt]
\p
\v 2 Then Joshua aid unto all the people,[ See chap.23. on ver.2.] Thus saith the LORD the God of Israel , Your fathers dwelt of old (time) on the other side of the river , [ Understand the river Euphrates : so below v. 3,14,15.] (namely) Therah the father of Abraham,and the father of Nabor: and they served other gods. [ See Gen.11.26,31.& Deut.26,5.]
\p
\v 3 Then I took your father Abraham from the other side of the river, and made him walk thorow all the land of Canaan: I also increased his seed,and gave him Isaac. [See Gen.12.1.& 21.2.]
\p
\v 4 And unto Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau: [Here Esau the first-born is not named first, but Jacob: See the like also Gen.11.26 & 1 Chron.1.28.and in this Chap.v.5.] and unto Esau I gave Mount Seir, hereditary to possess it: but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.
\p
\v 5 Then I sent Moseh and Aaron,and plagued the Egyptians, according as i did in the midst thereof: and afterward I led you out thence.
\p
\v 6 When I carried your fathers out of Egypt, then came unto the Sea, and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers,with charets, and with borsemen, onto the Red-sea.
\p
\v 7 They now called unto the LORD, and he put a darkness between you, and covered them, and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt : [ This is to be understood of many of those that were under twenty years old when they departed out of Egypt,for they that were above the age of twenty (excepting Caleb and Joshua) they all dyed in the Wilderness ] after that ye have dwelt in the wilderness many days.
\p
\v 8 Then I brought you into the land of Amorites,which dwelt on the other side of Jordan, they fought against you ,but I delivered them into your hand, and ye possess their land hereditarily, and I destroyed them before your face.
\p
\v 9 Also Balak the son of Zippor, the King of the Moabites arose,and he fought against Israel: [ i.e. Intended, or purposed to fight: See Judg.11.25. compare Job.10.32,33. where the word stoning , is put for intending,or going about to stone.So that it seems,that this is to be understood of Balaks enmity shewed against Israel;first when he went about to curse them by Bilean;and after that, when by Bileams counsel,( by means of the Moabitish women) he brought them to commit first whoredom, and then idolatry, and so caused the wrath of God to come upon them] and he sent forth, ands caused to call (for) Bileam the son of Beor,that he might curse you.
\p
\v 10 But I would not hearken unto Bileam: therefore he blessed you still, and I delivered you out of his band.
\p
\v 11 When he had passed over Jordan , and came to Jericho,the citizens [ Or Lords,or men] of Jericho warred against you , [ viz. those of Jericho by shutting their gates; but these nations which are named,by force of arms] the Amorites,and the Girgasites,the Hivites,and the Jebusites: but I delivered them into your hand.
\p
\v 12 And I sent bornets [ Heb. the Hornet ] before you , they drave them away from your face , (as) both the kings of the Amorites , [ as if he should say , As ye before tim drave out both the Kings of the Amorites , to wit , Sihon and Og. See below ver. 18.] not by your sword , nor by your bowe . [ understand this also , of all other weapons and arms , as Gen. 48.22. Psal. 7.13 . & 44.3 , 13. The meaning of these words is , That their Swords and Bowes had been in vain had not the Lord destroyed their enemies ]
\p
\v 13 Thus I have given you a land wherein ye have not laboured , and cities which ye have not built , and ye not built , and ye dwell thereor thein : [ Jos. 11.13. it's said , That the Israelites banned , or utterly destroyed no cities , save Hazor onely. This was therefore done , that the children of Israel might finde houses and cities to dwell in ] ye eat of the vineyards and of the olives that grew upon the trees . See the like phrase or manner of speaking , Gen.3.12. & Rev.2.7. ] which ye have not planted .
\p
\v 14 And now , fear the LORD , and serve him in uprightness , [ i.e. uprightly , sincerely , with all the heart , without dissembling ] and in truth : and put away the gods which your fathers served [ viz.Therah , Nahor , etc. yea , Abraham himself , before God called him out of Ur of the Chaldees ] on the other side of the river , and in Egypt , and serve the LORD.
\p
\v 15 But it be evil in your eyes to serve the LORD , chuse you this day whom ye will serve , whether the gods which your fathers that were on the other side of the river , served ; or the gods of Amorites,in whoseland ye dwell:[ Joshua leaves it not arbitrary to the Israelites, whether they should serve God or no;but this he saith,That they might freely, and without compulsion, declare what they were minded to do; and that they might be more firmly tyed to serve God,in that they had freely taken upon them to do it.See the like phrase or manner of speaking,Ruth 1.8,15.] but as for me and my house we will serve the LORD.
\p
\v 16 Then answered the people, and said,Far he it from us,that we should forsake the LORD, [ Herb. Be it far to us from forsaking, & c.] to serve other gods.
\p
\v 17 For the LORD is our God, it is he that brought us and our fathers up out of land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage: and that did these great tokens before our eyes, and kept us on all the way thorow which we went ,and among all people,through the midst of whom we marched.
\p
\v 18 And the Lord hath driven out before our faces all those nations, even the Amorite, inhabitant of the land; we also will serve the LORD, [viz. as well as thou, and thy fathers house] for he is our God.
\p
\v 19 Then Josua said un to the people , Ye will not be able to serve the LORD , [ viz. if ye keep with you the strange gods among you , mixing the false worship with the true worship of God , as may be gathered from vers. 23.] for he is a holy God ; [ Heb. Elohim Kedoschim hu. See hereof , Gen. 20, on ver. 13. ] He is a jealous God , he will not forgive [Heb. take away: see the like phrase or manner of speaking , Gen.50.17. oth. not bear or endure ] your transgression , nor your sins .
\p
\v 20 If ye shall forsake the LORD , and save strange gods , he will then turn about , and he will do you hurt , and he will destroy you , after that he hath done you good .
\p
\v 21 Then the people said unto Josua , Nay, [ Understand withall , we will not forsake the Lord ] but we will serve the LORD .
\p
\v 22 Now Josua said unto the people , ye are witnesses against your selves , that you have chosen you the LORD , to serve him : And they said , We are witnesses .
\p
\v 23 And now put away the strange gods which are in the midst of you , [ viz. the gods of the strangers .By these words it appeareth , That although idolatry was not publickly tolerated , yet there were some among the Israelites at this time , that had idols in secret , which they privately worshipped and served . See Amos 5. ver.25,26. & Acts 7.43. See also Gen. 35.on ver. 2 . ] and encline your hearts unto the LORD the God of Israel .
\p
\v 24 And the people said unto Josua , We will serve the LORD our God , and we will obey his voice .
\p
\v 25 So Josua made that same day a covenant with the people : [ i.e. he renewed , and confirmed the Covenant which God had made with the people of Israel ] and be set it to them for a statute and right ( or , Ordinance ) at Sichem . [ See above vers. 1. ]
\p
\v 26 And Josua wrote these words [ i.e. the words of this Covenant ] in the book of the law of God : and he took a great stone , and he set the same up there under the Oak , which was by the sanctuary of the LORD .[ See of this Oak , Judg. 9.6.]
\p
\v 27 And Josua said unto all the people , Behold , this stone shall be for a witness unto us , for it hath heard all the words of the LORD , that he hath spoken unto us : [ i.e. it hath been there present . Here sense is ascribed and attributed unto the stone , which is void of sense . So likewise it is said , Hear , ye heavens , and thou earth , Isa.1.2. and Deut . 32.1. The heavens declare the glory of God , Psal. 19.1. The stones shall cry , Luke 19.40. ] yea , it shall be for a witnesse against you , that ye may not lye unto the LORD your God . [ but keep and do what ye have promised him ]
\p
\v 28 Then Josua sent the people away , each one unto his inheritance .
\p
\v 29 And it came to passe after these things , that Josua the son of Nun , the servant of the LORD , died , being an hundred and ten years old . [ Heb. a son of an hundred and ten years ]
\p
\v 30 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance , at Timnath-Serah , [ Otherwise called , Timnath-Heres , Judges 2.9.] which is upon a Mountaine of Ephraim , on the North of Mount Gaas .
\p
\v 31 Now Israel served the LORD all the dayes of Josua , and all the dayes of the Eldest , that lived long after Josua , [ Heb. that prolonged their dayes after Josua . See Exod. 20.12.] and which knew all the work of the LORD, which he had done unto Israel . [ Understand here , those that together with Josua , had governed the people , and out-lived him . See Judg.2.7.]
\p
\v 32 They also buried the bones of Joseph , which the children of Israel had brought up out of Egypt , at Sichem , [ Understand this as above vers.1. For here followeth , That Joseph's bones were buried in the parcel of the field or ground , etc. which lay not in the City of Sichem , as may be gathered from Genes. 33.18. ] in that parcel of the field ich Jacob had bought of the children of Hemor , the father of Sichem , for an hundred pieces of money : [ See Genes. 33.19. and the annotat. thereon . Stephen , Acts 7.16. saith For the price of silver ] for they were become an inheritance of the children of Joseph . [ viz. that parcel of the field and the burying place that was therein ]
\p
\v 33 Also Eleazar the son of Aaron died and they buried him on the hill of Pinehas his son , which was given him on mount Ephraim .
