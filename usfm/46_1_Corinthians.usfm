\mt2 THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE
\mt CORINTHIANS
\s THE ARGUMENT OF THE EPISTLE.
\p THE Apostle having by Christ’s command, made his abode at Corinth the chief City of Achaia, about a year and having planted a great church there, Acts 18.9,10,11. he went forward from thence to preach Christ also in other Cities of Asia; and after a considerable time being now at Ephesus, as appears from 1 Cor.16.8. he understood there from some of the household of Chloe, 1 Cor.1.11. that there was a division risen in the Church. He received a letter also from the Corinthian themselves, 1 Cor. 7.1. wherein they desired advice from the Apostle about some problems risen in their Church: whereunto he answered in this Epistle. First therefore after a short introduction in the first 9 verses of the Epistle, he reprehends them in the rest of the first, and in the three following Chapters, for the division that was risen among them, especially by the pride and curiosity of some Teachers, who made ostentation of their eloquence and humane philosophy, and adulterated the simplicity of the Gospel, and despised the same in Paul. Afterwards he reproves them in the 5. Chapter for suffering an incestuous person in their Congregation: and prescribes them how they shall use Ecclestiatical discipline against him and other scandalous brethren. In the 6. Chapter he admonisheth them that they should not bring the differences which they had one with another with worldly matters, before unbelieving Magistrates, but that they should end them selves in a friendly manner, and reprehends them because of the fornication which was yet practiced amongst them In the 7. Chapter he begins to answer the questions which they had propounded to him in writing, and first concerning the state of virginity and widow-hood, and marriage. Afterwards in the 8 Chapter treats of the things which were offered to Idols. In the 9 Chapter. of the maintenance of the Ministers of the Church. In the 10. again of fleeing from Idolatry, and offerings Idos. In the 11. Chapter he reprehends certain abuses which were crept into their Congregations, in women apparel, and in the use of the Lords Supper, and orders that according to Christ’s institution. In the 12.13. and 14. Chapters, he speaks of the right use of the spiritual gifts, which the Holy Ghost diversely distributed amongst the Church, and especially of the gift of prophecy, and of strange tongues. In the 15 Chapter he treats of the certainty of the resurrection from the dead, and declares largely how it shall come into pass. And after that in the beginning of the 16 Chapter he had spoken the relief which the Grecian Churches collected for the poor believers in Judea, he concludes this Epistle with some exhortations and salutations to them.
\c 1
\s In the introduction which lasts to the 10. verse the Apostle in the first place puts his name, as writer of the Epistle, and the name of those whom he writes, with the usual Apostolick salutations. 4 Further thanks God for the benefits which he had already bestowed upon his Church, 8 and assures them of Christs faithfulness in finishing the work he had begun. 10 Cometh afterward to the matter it self, and declareth how he hath understood that there was division among them, and the one said I am of Paul, the other I am of Cephas, etc. 13 Reprehends them for it with divers reasons, and sheweth that of a token of unity there were baptized in the name of Christ alone. 18 Afterwards deals against them who boasted of worldly eloquence, and declares that God had not been powerfull amongst them by that, but by the simplicity of the preaching of a crucified Christ, 26 and that this power had manifested it self in the conversion, not of many wise and mighty among them, but of the mean and unwise according to the world, 29 that they might not boast in themselves, but only in Christ, in which they had all that was needful in salvation.
\p
\v 1 PAUL [Of the name Paul and that which followeth, see the annot. On Acts 13.9. and Rom. 1.11.] a called Apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God and Sosthenes [some think that this was the same Softhenes, who before was a Ruler of the Synagogue at Corinth, and was converted unto Christ, Acts 18.17. and that he was now with Paul, or was departed from Corinth with him, because of persecution against him: but this is uncertain] the brother, [so he calleth this Softhenes, not only because he was a disciple of Christ, but also a principal teacher and companion of Paul, and in great esteem with the church, See the like, 2 Cor. 1.1. and Gal. 1.2.]
\p
\v 2 . To the church of God which is at Corinth [This was the chief City of Achaia in Greece, situate betwixt two Seas, in the straight whereby Peloponnesus was joined to Achaia, a very rich and famous mart-town, and withal full of voluptuousness and luxury, which had been once laid waste by the Romans, but afterward in the time of Augustus Caesar was built up again, and brought to its former flourishing condition. See Acts 18. 1.] the sanctification in Christ Jesus, [that is, who are by Christ and communion with him, separated from the communion heap of the world, up to a church of God] the called Saints, [namely, not outwardly, by the word, but also inwardly by the power of the Holy Ghost, whereby he understands the best part of the church, that is, true believers, of whom Christ speaks, Acts 18.10.] every place, [namely, of Achaia in which Corinth lay as is exprest 2 Cor. 1.1. Or of the world, where the name of Christ is called upon, as believers are described thereby, Acts 9 14. 2 Tim. 2.22. For that which Paul writes unto the church, is a prescript according to which all churches must regulate themselves: as Christ said unto his disciples, Mark 13.37.] both theirs and our (Lord.)
\p
\v 3 . Grace be to you [See hereof, Rom. 1.7.] and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 4 . I thank my God. [This is the word of faith, which acknowledgeth God for his God, Rom. 1.8. and Christ his Saviour, Gal. 2.20. not to exclude other believers from it, but to prescribe them an example of true confession. See the like, Job 19.25. Psa. 18.3. and 23. 1. etc.] always concerning you, because of the grace of God which is given you in Christ Jesus: [or through Christ Jesus.]
\p
\v 5 . That ye are become rich in him in all things, [That is, abundantly endowed with all manner of spiritual gifts through him. Hereby he lays a foundation to show that by these gifts they must not be high-minded or boast one against another, but that they must thank God in Christ for them, and use them for edification of one another in peace and unity] in all reasoning, [Or in every word. This is to be understood either of the gift being able, fitly to utter that which by knowledge was conceived by them, or of the word of the Apostle himself, whereby there were brought to this knowledge of all the mysteries of faith, Acts 20.20.] and all knowledge.
\p
\v 6 . Even as the testimony of Christ [That is, the word of the Gospel of Christ, Rom. 16. as hereafter, 1 Cor. 2.1.] was confirmed among you. [namely, outwardly by divers miracles, which were done among them, 2 Cor. 12.12. and inwardly by the obligation of the Holy Ghost in their hearts, 1 Cor. 2.12. 2 Cor. 1.22. see also Mark 16.20.]
\p
\v 7 . So that ye have want of no gift [Namely, needful of salvation and edification. Otherwise here we know but in part, and prophesy but in part, 1 Cor. 13.9. And this the Apostle speaks in general of the true Christians which were among them, whom afterwards he reprehends for the abuse of their gifts, in respect of the faults which were crept in, even among some of them] wait for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ. [namely, in his second coming, in which we shall first be made perfect in all that which is yet wanting to us, 1 Cor. 13. v.10,11,12. see also 1 Pet. 1.7,13.]
\p
\v 8 . Which (God) shall also confirm you [Or strengthen you, namely, in the faith and good which is already begun in you] even unto the end, (to be) unreproeable [that is, properly, whom no man shall not be able to accuse, Rom. 8.1,33.] in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. [that is, in the last day, when Christ shall appear to judgment, and perfectly to redeem his, Rom. 2.16. Eph. 4.30.]
\p
\v 9 . God is faithful [Namely, in the performance of his promises: whereby he hath promised that he will not forsake his. See Isa. 49.15. Jer. 32.40. etc.] by whom ye are called to the communion of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord: [namely, not only the outward, whereby we process to have communion with Christ and his benefits: but especially the inward, wherein we are united to him by faith, and by the Sprit of Christ, and are partakers of all his benefits. See Rom. 8.32. Ephes. 3.17. John 1.3.]
\p
\v 10 . But I beseech you [Or exhort you. Here the Apostle begins to admonish them against schisms, and warn them, that they must not be respecters of persons among their teachers, seeing division riseth from thence: nor because of outward gifts adheres more to one then to another. And the teachers themselves, that they should not deck up the Gospel with humane wisdome or eloquence, but set it forth in simplicity and power of the spirit of Christ] Brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ [that is, by Christ or Christ sake] that ye all speak the same thing, [that is, use one manner of speaking of the same faith, or of the grounds of the same faith: namely, because from the diversity of speaking oftentimes comes diversity of opinions, are at least wise contending] and (that) there be no rents [Gr. Schismata, which are properly divisions which arise in the church about some differences in belief, which are not fundamental; or which concerns not faith it self, but love or outward orders only: which as well as heresies (which properly strikes at the foundation of the doctrine) are numbered among the works of the flesh, Gal. 5.20. although it be sometimes taken more largely also] among you, but that ye be joined together [or united, a similitude taken from a thing which consist of a divers parts, which joined one to another make one perfect work or body] in the same sense [or meaning, this is the other means to keep true unity in the church; namely, under the same manner of speaking, to hold all one meaning or opinion] and in the same opinion.
\p
\v 11 . For it is made known to me concerning you my brethren, by them that (are of the household) of Chloe, [This seems to have been an honest matron, and of esteem among the Church of Corinth] that there are strifes among you.
\p
\v 12 . And this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul, [Namely, a disciple, as also in the following] and I of Apollo, [that this Apollo also brought many to faith at Corinth, appears from acts 18.24.27.] and I of Cephas, [that is, of Peter. See John 1.43. Gal. 2.9. from whence nevertheless it follows not that Peter preached at Corinth also. But it may be that some of his disciples were there, who boasted of Peter or of Peters doctrine. For that they also abused the names of Paul, Cephas, and Apollo for this purpose, and not only the names of other teachers, appears by that which follows, chap. 4.6.] and I of Christ. [these were the simple and upright Christians who would not take any factious names of teachers upon them; and well therein.]
\p
\v 13 . Is Christ divided? [From henceforward the Apostle brings forth divers reasons, whereby he proves that such divisions are unfitting. For first, hereby it seems that men would divide Christ, who only is the head of the church, when one part of the church only is named from Christ, and the other parts from Paul, Peter, Apollo and other teachers. Moreover also that Christ is not the only Redeemer of his Church; finally that they should be baptized in the name of some other then in the name of Christ] Is Paul crucified for you? Or are ye baptized in the name of Paul. [namely, hereby to take on you the name of Paul. See of this phrase Mat. 28.19.]
\p
\v 14 . I thank God that I baptized none of you, save Crispus and Gaius.
\p
\v 15 . That no man should say, that I have baptized in mine own name.
\p
\v 16 . But I baptized also the household of Stephanas: further I know not whether I baptized any other.
\p
\v 17 . For Christ sent not to baptize, [That is, not chiefly. For all the Apostles were sent to baptize, Mat. 28.19. and otherwise the Apostle might not have baptized these. But they left this service; whereunto less gifts were needful then to preaching, to other their disciples and teachers that they might lose no time. See Acts 10.48.] but to publish the Gospel. Not with wisdome [in the following words the Apostle the original from whence these divisions amongst the Corinthians had sprung; namely, from thence that some teachers sought to garnish up the uprightness and simplicity of the Gospel of Christ with humane eloquence, and to mingle it with human wisdome or philosophy, whereby the ears of some of the hearers were tickled, and despised other upright teachers or passed them by: which practice the Apostle confutes by his own example and other reason] of words, [Gr. Word, or speech, namely, which humane wisdome teacheth. 1 Cor. 2.4. Or with artificial eloquence] that the cross of Christ [that is, the word of the cross, as is expounded in the following verse] be not made vain. [that is, be not deprived of its praise and virtue, which is done when men ascribe the same to humane wisdome or eloquence.]
\p
\v 18 . For the word of the cross [That is, the doctrine of the Gospel of Christ who was crucified for us] is indeed to them that perish foolishness: [that is, is by them held for foolishness, and by the worldly wise so accounted] but to us who are saved, it is a power of God. [that is, a means whereby the spirit of Christ powerfully worketh in us faith and generation for our salvation, Rom. 1.16. 2 Cor. 3.3,4.]
\p
\v 19 . For it is written, I will cause the wisdome of the wise [That is, who are accounted worldly wise, or who ascribe such wisdome themselves. The Prophets relates these words against those who despise the word of God propounded by the Prophet, and more esteemed of humane doctrine] to perish, And I will bring naught the understanding of intelligent.
\p
\v 20 . Where is the wise? [That is, worldly wise. These words seem to be taken out of Esa. 33.18. where the like, though somewhat altered, are found: or they are the words of Paul himself which he draws from the foregoing testimony. But the sense comes all to one] where is the Scribe? Where is the inquirer of this age? Hath not God made foolish [that is, showed it to be foolish: or else by a righteous judgment given it up to foolishness. See Rom. 1,21,22.] the wisdome of the world [namely, when men will measure divine things according to the same.]
\p
\v 21 . For after that in the wisdome of God, [That is, in the creatures of Heaven and Earth, by which God reveals his wisdome in an special manner, Rom. 1.20.] the world knew not God [namely, as it ought, and as was necessary to salvation, Rom. 1.18,20.] by wisdome, [that is, by the preaching of Christ crucified, which worldly men accounts foolishness, v.23.] to save them that believe.
\p
\v 22 . Forasmuch the Jews desire a sign [That is, miracles. See Mat. 16.4. John 4.48.] and the Greek seek wisdome. [that is, reasons which are accounted wisdome by the humane understanding.]
\p
\v 23 . But we preach Christ the crucified, to the Jews indeed an offence, [Namely, by reason of his mean and despised estate in the world, seeing they looked for a mighty King in the world, which should cause them as little Kings to reign over others See also Luke 2.34.] and to the Greeks foolishness. [namely, that we should obtain life by a crucified man.]
\p
\v 24 . But to them that are called, [Namely, not only outwardly by the word for the former are also called which perish; but also inwardly and effectually by the Spirit of God, and according to his purpose, Rom. 8.28,30. and here verse26,27.] both Jews and Greeks (we preach) Christ [hereby may be understood either the preaching of Christ which before ver. 18. is also called the power of God: or Christ himself who is called the power and wisdome of God because he is the express image of the Fathers person, by whom he hath manifested his divine power and wisdome above all things, in the redemption of mankind, ver. 30. See Prov. 8. Mat. 11.19. Luke 11.49.] the power of God and the wisdome of God.
\p
\v 25 .For that which is foolish of God [That is, that which worldly men account foolish, is wiser then which are with all worldly wisdome] is wiser then men: and that which is weak of God [that is, that which they account weak and of no power to bring men to salvation, is stronger or more powerfull then with all their arrogant eloquence and elegance] is stronger then men.
\p
\v 26 . For ye see your calling brethren [Or, see your calling, i.e. how you are called: or those that are called among you, namely, to the communion of Christ and his Church] that (ye are) not many wise according to the flesh [that is, according to the outward state and estimation of men] not many mighty, not many Noble.
\p
\v 27 . But that which is foolish of the worldly, [That is, those that the worldly wise account foolish, weak, ignorable etc] hath God elected, [that is, according to his eternal election brought to his Church] that he might shame the wise: and that which is weak of the worldly hath God elected, that he might shame that which is strong. [that is, might show that it avails nothing before God in matters of salvation, but is vain.]
\p
\v 28 . And that which is ignoble of the world, and that which is despised, hath God elected, and that which is not, [That is, that is esteemed so mean as if it were nothing, 1 Cor. 3.7.] that he might bring to naught [that is, show to be unprofitable and vain] that which is (anything) [that is, that which is esteemed to be ought or some great thing.]
\p
\v 29 . That no flesh [That is, no man as Gal. 2.16. namely, as if they were anything in him, whereby God should be moved to show him this grace rather then others] should glory before him.
\p
\v 30 . But of him [That is, by his grace and power, as Rom. 11.36. See also 1 John 4.ver.2,4,6.] are ye in Christ Jesus, [that is, united to Christ by faith, Rom. 8.1.] who is become wisdome to us of God, and righteousness, and sanctification [that is, the cause and matter of all true wisdome, and righteousness, and sanctification] and redemption. [namely, from all evils and miseries of body and soul, which shall perfectly come to pass at the last day, which is therefore called the day of redemption, Eph. 4.30. See also Luke 21.28. Rom. 8.23.]
\p
\v 31 . That (it may be) as it is written, he that glorifieth, let him glory in the Lord. [That is, ascribe all to him alone with thanksgiving, Jer. 23.24.]
\c 2
\s I The Apostle shows by his own example, how the Gospel of Christ must be set forth, namely not with humane wisdom or eloquence, but in simplicity, and spiritual power. 6 Declares further what heavenly wisdome is contained therein, 10 and how the same is revealed by Gods sprit and not by humane reason. 13. Relates again with what good words it must be uttered, 14 and how it is discerned and judged, not by the natural, but by the spiritual man.
\p
\v 1 AND I brethren when I come unto you, come not with excellency words [Gr. Excellency of word or speech i.e. a garnished manner of speaking, by which I sought to seem wise above others, or to excel: or to persuade you. See 1 Cor. 4.19.] or of wisdome, publishing unto you the testimony of God. [that is, the Gospel which is revealed to us by God, and testifies of the will of God for our salvation 1 Cor. 16.]
\p
\v 2 . For I purposed not [Gr. Judged; for although the Apostle was expert in many other things, yet nevertheless he would not hold forth nothing but that which was necessary to their salvation] to know anything among you, [that is, to speak of any other knowledge with you] save Jesus Christ and crucified. [that is, who by his death, and resurrection following, redeemed us from our sins, and made us partakers of everlasting salvation, Rom. 4.25. and chap. 10.9,10.]
\p
\v 3 And I was with you in weakness [These things may be understood either of the low estate wherein the apostle kept himself when he was at Corinth, that not he, but only his doctrine might be in esteem with them, contrary to the haughtiness of those who occasioned these schisms, or of the circumspection and jealousy, which he used in propounding the doctrine of salvation; that he might mingle nothing human therewith, that the power of it might be ascribed, not to his own wisdome or eloquence, but only to the nature of the doctrine which he preached, and the cooperation of the spirit of God: which best agrees with that which follows] and in fer, and in much trembling.
\p
\v 4 . And my speech and my preaching was not in moving words of humane wisdome, in demonstration of the Spirit and of power. [That is, demonstration of the spiritual power which was joined with his word, outwardly by miracles, and inwardly by the operation of the Holy Ghost, 2 Cor. 3.3.]
\p
\v 5 . That your faith should not be [That is, should not have its cause or foundation] in the wisdome of men [that is, in speeches or words which humane wisdome inventeth] but in the power of God. [that is, in the divinity of the doctrine, witnessed to our hearts by the power of the Spirit of God, Acts 16.14.]
\p
\v 6 . And we speak wisdome [That is, the difficulties and profoundest mysteries of Gods word: as ver.7. Otherwise he fed the weak and tender with milk. See 1 Cor. 3.2 Heb. 5.12.] amongst the perfect: [that is, those that have made more progress in the matters of faith, and now need no more to be instructed in the first principles. See Rom. 14.1,2. and 15.1. Phil. 3.15. Heb. 5.14. These are called perfect in comparison of others: otherwise no man is here perfect in knowledge as long as he liveth, 1 Cor 13.9.] yet a wisdome not of this world, [that is, which is invented and greatly esteemed by humane reason] nor of the Rulers of this world [that is, of the wise and mighty as ver. 8.] which come naught: [namely, with all their wisdome and might, forasmuch as it is of no use out of this world.]
\p
\v 7 . But we speak the wisdome of God [that is, which God hath revealed to us for our salvation] (consisting) in a mystery, [ so the Apostle calls the doctrine of the Gospel, because the same was never found out by any humane wisdome, but was hidden from them, until God revealed it by his Prophets and Apostles] which was covered, which [namely, wisdome of God: whereby is understood the person of Christ, who 1 Cor. 1 24. is also called the wisdome of God: or the mysteries of our salvation purposed by God in Christ, and afterwards revealed in the Gospel unto our glory, Luke 2.32. Both well agree with that which follows] God ordained unto our glory, before the world was. [Gr. Before the ages.]
\p
\v 8 . Which no man of the Princes of this world knew, [Namely, by their ion natural reason or understanding, how great and how acute soever it was. Such as were Herod, Pilat, Cajaphas, and other mighty ones in this world, as also of the Philosophers, Scribes, and such like. Otherwise Abraham also by Gods Spirit and revelation saw this day, John 8.56. and David rejoiced therein, Psalm 16.9. with other holy Kings and Prophets Luke 10.24. and also some of the Rulers of the Jews, as Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea knew him; but these were few, and consented not unto his death, Luke 23.51. See the like phrase, John 3.32.] For if they had known them they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. [namely, who is the chief point of this wisdome of God. So Christ is called in respect of his divine nature, Psalm 24.7. Acts7.2. who was crucified according to his humane nature. See the like phrase John 3.13. Acts 3.15. and 20.28.]
\p
\v 9 . But as it is written, that which the eye hath not seen, and arte not heard, and is not ascended into the hearts of men, [These words the Apostle interposeth for further explication of the former words of the Prophet, to that the mysteries of the Gospel, and the greatness of the glory which God hath prepared for his faithful ones hereafter, are so excellent, that not only no eye nor no ear, but even no understanding was able of it self to think of them, or to understand them. See 1 Pet. 1.ver.10,11,12.] that which God hath prepared for them that love him.
\p
\v 10 . But god hath revealed (it) to us [Namely, who love God. For that the Apostle speaks not only of the Apostle, but also of them that believe in Christ through their word, appears from what follows] by his spirit [namely, which by word, and with the word is powerful in us. See 2 Cor. 3.8. 1 john 2.27.] for the spirit seachedth all things, [this the Apostle saith, not as if the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us, were ignorant of any divine thing; which he must seek to know, but because the deepest things of God are clearly known to him, 	as being the same God with Father and with the Son: as God is said to search and reins, because there are naked and known before him, Rom. 8.27.] Revel. 2.23.] even the depths of God. [that is, the most secret counsel of God. See Isa. 40.13.]
\p
\v 11 .For who of men knoweth that which is of man, save the Spirit of man which is of him? [That is, the reasonable soul and understanding of man knoweth what is in them. See 1 John 3.20.] even so also no man [namely, among the creatures. For the Son knoweth the Father, and the Father the Son, Mat. 11.27. and here also the Holy Ghost, as one only God with the Father and the Son, Rom. 8.27.] knoweth that which is of God, save the Spirit of God.
\p
\v 12 . But we have not received the Spirit of the world [That is, which teacheth worldly things, and hath delight, or placeth its happiness in worldly things] but the Spirit which is of God: [that is, which proceeds from God, and is promised and given to his children, John 14.16. Rom. 8.15.] that we might know the things which are freely given to us of God. [namely, for our comfort and salvation, i.e. Christ and his benefits, Rom. 8.32. Col. 2.9,10.]
\p
\v 13 . Which we also speak, not with words which humane wisdom teacheth, but with (words) [Or, reasons, motives] which the Holy Ghost teacheth, [namely, in his divine inspiration and writings, not decked up with humane eloquence, but powerfully in its spiritual simplicity] conjoining [or, comparing Gr. judging together, i.e. as the doctrine is spiritual, so we propound it also, not with worldly, but with spiritual words] spiritual things with spiritual.
\p
\v 14 . But the natural man [Gr. The animal man i.e. he that hath no other or higher wisdom, then which the light of nature and humane reason teacheth him. See Hud. Ver.19.] comprehendeth not the things which are of the Spirit of God. [namely, to receive the same, and to apply them to himself for salvation, Rom. 8.5. See an example, Acts 17.18. and chap.25.ver.19.] For they are foolishness unto him, [See 1 Cor. 1.ver.21.22,23.] and he cannot understand them, [namely, but by the grace and power of Gods Spirit, which enlightens the understanding and opens the heart, Acts 16.14.] because they are spiritually distinguished. [Gr. Judged, i.e. with judgment distinguished from humane and worldly doctrines.]
\p
\v 15 . But the spiritual (man) [That is, he that is enlightened and regenerated by the Spirit of God] distinguished indeed all things, [namely, necessary to salvation. For even believers sometimes err indeed in some things, but which are not needful to humane salvation: or when they do not sufficiently stir up this gift of discerning by diligence and prayer. See John 10.4.27. 1 Thes. 5.21. 1 John 4.1.] but he himself is distinguished [or, judged, i.e. with judgment discerned as ver. 14.] of no man. [namely, who is not regenerate or spiritual: otherwise the Spirit of Prophets must also be subject to the Prophets, 1 Cor. 14.29, 32.]
\p
\v 16 . For who hath known the mind of the Lord [Or, the spirit of the Lord, as Isa. 40.13. where these words are, is expressed, i.e. the sense or the meaning of the Spirit of the Lord, Rom. 8.27.] who should instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. [that is, the meaning of Christ is made known to us by his word and by his Spirit, as is declared before ver. 10,12.]
\c 3
\s 1 The Apostle gives yet another reasons why he preached the Gospel among them in all simplicity, namely, because of their childhood in knowledge, and carnal ness in their divisions, 5 Declares further, in what esteem teachers must be, and how the praise of their work must be ascribed, not to them who plant and water, but to God who giveth the increase. 10. That their office is build on the Christ foundation; not hay, straw, stubble, but gold, silver and precious stones, 13 and that each ones work shall bebe proved by fire; and they then shall receive reward according as it is found. 16.That the Temple of God must not be avoided by divisions, 18 seeing the wisdom of men is foolishness before God, 21 that therefore not man must glory in men, seeing we are Christ’s.
\p
\v 1 AND I brethren could not speak unto you as into spiritual [That is, as such who are extraordinarily enlightened by the Spirit of God; and have made great progress in knowledge, see Gal. 6.1.] but as to carnal, [that is, as to such in whom the flesh or humane inclinations do yet too much manifest themselves, as useth to come to pass in children, who follow their inclinations more then reason] as unto young children in Christ, [that is, who are yet very tender and ignorant in the doctrine of Christ: and hereby he expound the word carnal, that it might not taken for persons who are wholly strangers from the spirit of Christ, as it is often used in the holy Scripture, See Rom. 8.8.]
\p
\v 2 . I have fed you with milk [That is, with the first principles and foundations of Christian doctrine, which are set forth with example and naked words. Gr. Given you milk to drink] and not with (firm) meat: [that is, the higher declarations of Christian doctrine, which are set forth with higher words, and profounder reasons, see more at large Heb. 5.12. etc.] For ye are not able for it (then) yea neither are ye now able for it.
\p
\v 3 . For ye are yet carnal. For seeing there is envy and strife and division among you, are ye not yet carnal? And do (ye not) walk according to man? [that is, as natural men used to do, which is unseemingly for you.]
\p
\v 4 . For while one saith I am of Paul, and another I (am) of Apollo, are ye not carnal? [that is, yet driven by carnal or childish inclinations in distinguishing your teachers.]
\p
\v 5 . Who therefore is Paul, and who is Apollo, other then Ministers by whom [That is, by whose ministry and teaching Rom. 10.17] ye believed, and (that) even as the Lord gave to every one? [namely, of his ministers, to whom he diversely distributes his gifts. See 1 Cor. 12.4. etc.]
\p
\v 6 . I have planted, [That is, the first foundation of the Church by my preaching, as is declared hereafter ver 10.] Apollo hath watered: [that is, that which I had begun, he by his teaching hath furthered & strengthened] but God gave the increase. [that is, made the word which was outwardly preached by us, effectually in the hearts of the hearers, for their conversion. See John 6.44,65. Acts 11.21. and 16.14. etc.]
\p
\v 7 . Therefore neither is he that planteth anything, [Namely, to be esteemed, or to glory: which is not to be understood, as if Paul would have ministers to be despised (for 1 Cor. 4.1. he will say the contrary) but because no man must so gaze upon the gifts of the ministers, whosoever they be, as to give them the honour, which belongs to the supreme author of this work: seeing it is God who appoint them, which gives them fitting gifts, and by their labour is powerfull in the hearts of men, 1 Cor. 3.5. and 12.6. Gal. 3.5.] nor he that moisteneth them: but God which giveth the increase.
\p
\v 8 . And he that planteth, and he that moisteneth are one: [That is, labour in one and the same thing, and for one and the same end, namely to spread abroad one and the same doctrine of the Gospel, and to edify the Church of Christ, although with divers’ gifts. For he speaks here yet, of the office of faithful teachers, such as he and Apollos were] but ever one shall receive his own reward, according to his labour. [namely, according as he shall well have acquitted himself, and been diligent in this his office. Mat. 25.20. etc.]
\p
\v 9 . For we [Namely, who are ministers of Gods word] are Gods fellow-labours: [namely, who under God, labour together on the building of the Church, as instrument which it hath pleased God to make use of for this purpose, although the principal work cometh from him, and the fitness of those instruments themselves commeth also from him, 2 Cor. 3.5,6.] Gods husbandry, [that is, ye as members of the Church of God, are they on whom this labour is bestowed, as it were on a piece of husbandry] Gods building, [another similitude taken from a great edifice, whereof the master hath the ordering, and whereon he employs his servants, which similitude he afterwards more largely explains and applies] are ye.
\p
\v 10 . According to the grace of God which is given unto you, [Namely, by which I am called to be an Apostle of Christ, and with which he hath hitherto assisted and accompanied me in my ministry. Whereby he ascribes all that he is and doth, not to himself but to God] I have a wise master-builder [that is, as becomes a right prudent, and faithful master-builder] laid the foundation, [namely, together with other Apostles, in the first setting up of the Church of Christ throughout the whole world: and as the first which set up your Church, Rom. 15.20. Eph. 2.20. Revel. 21.14.] and another buildeth thereon; [this he speaketh of the Ordinary ministers, which after the Apostles, were called and settled in the Churches that were founded, and went forward on the Apostles work, Rom. 15.20.] but let every one take heed, how he buildeth thereupon. [some understand of the persons, who by the teachers are built on the foundation, as the word work is so taken, 1 Cor. 9.1. But seeing the Apostle here saith, let every one take heed how he buildeth thereupon, this is commonly and more fitly understood, that the Apostle would here admonish the teachers, that they take heed what doctrine they purpose upon the foundation that the Apostle have laid, for the strengthening and enlarging of the Churches already founded.]
\p
\v 11 . For no man can lay another foundation then that which is laid, [Or, besides that. Namely, by me and the other Apostles] which is Jesus Christ. [Christ is called the foundation of the Church, either in respect of himself upon whom the salvation of the Church depends, because he as true God and man hath procured salvation for us, and applies the same to us by his Spirit. Mat. 16.18. 1 Pet. 2.6. or in respect of his doctrine, whereby we are directed and brought unto him as the only Saviour, and by faith in him receive righteousness, holiness and eternal life. To this doctrine the Apostle here hath respect, and declares that in the doctrine of the Gospel, we may not be directed to any one else to find salvation, but to his person and merits. See John 14.6. Acts 4.12. Eph. 2.20.]
\p
\v 12 . And if any man build upon this foundation [That is, on the doctrine of seeking salvation in Jesus Christ alone] gold, silver, precious stones [that is, edifying doctrines, not drawn from humane wisdom, but from the right grounds of Gods word, 2 Tim. 1 13.] wood, hay, stubble. [hereby are understood not heresies, or false doctrines which overthrow the foundation, whereby the Church of Christ is seduced or rent, for such the word of God condemns as works of the flesh which deprive man of salvation. Acts 20.30. Gal. 5.20. 1 Tim. 4.ver.1,2,3. but some doctrines, error, or institutions of lesser moment, brought forth by humane reason, which do not overthrow the foundation; or some curious and unnecessary disputes which do not edify, and flourishing manners of speaking without the word of God, which the Apostle every where reproves in these four first chapters.]
\p
\v 13 . Every ones [Namely, teachers, For them and their work only the Apostle here speaks] work [that is, doctrine which he holds, forth] shall be manifest: for the day [that is, time, or the light of truth. Rom. 13. 12,13. Eph. 5.13.] shall declare it: [namely, whether it be wood, hay, straw and stubble, or whether it be gold, silver, or precious stones] seeing it is discovered by fire: [by this fire here, cannot be understood the fire of Purgatory, whereby after this life men should be purged or purified from sins; forasmuch as this fire whereof Paul here speaketh, not only the works which perisheth or is burned, but also that which remaineth and is rewarded shall be proved: but is to be understood either of the fire of the Holy Ghost, which by the light of Gods word in time discovers in the Church the firm labour and faithful doctrines of the teachers, which discerneth the unnecessary and curious doctrine, and causeth it to vanish, no otherwise then gold by fire is purified from its impurities, Psalm 12.7. Jer. 22.29. Or the fire of persecution, trouble, and temptation, whereby the true doctrine is as it were proved, because it then gives us firm consolation, which the other cannot do, Jam. 1.2. 1 Pet.1.ver.6,7.] and of what sort every ones work is, the fire will try.
\p
\v 14 If the mans works abide [That is, his doctrine be judged firm and solid by Gods word, I Thes. 5.21.] which he hath build thereupon, he shall receive a reward. [namely, at the last day, of grace, and especially for this his work, Dan. 12.3. 1 Cor. 15.ver. 41.42.]
\p
\v 15 . If any mans work shall be burnt, [That is, if any ones doctrine after trial made by Gods word, shall vanish and be esteemed vain] he shall suffer loss: [namely, of this his labour] but he himself shall be saved [namely, because in his he hath still held fast the foundation] yet so is by fire. [that is, difficulty, as one saves himself out of fire, leaving all that he hath therein Jud. Ver.23.]
\p
\v 16 . Know ye not that ye [Namely, who believe in Christ, 1 Pet. 2.5. See Eph. 2.21.] are the Temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
\p
\v 17 . If any one violate the Temple of God [That is, if any one divide or rend the Church Of God by doctrines of humane wisdom, or by special adhering to this or that teacher] him shall God bring to shame, [Gr. Corrupt, i.e. bring him to shame and confusion] for the Temple of God is holy, which ye are.
\p
\v 18 . Let no man deceive himself: [Or seduce] if among you thinketh that he is wise in this world, [that is, endued with humane wisdom] let him become a fool, [namely, according to the judgment of the worldly wise, while he accounts the knowledge of Christs cross and humiliation, for his highest wisdom, which the world accounts folly. See 1 Cor. 1.v21,22,23,24.] that he may be wise. [namely, in God, and in the matters of his salvation.]
\p
\v 19 . For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He catcheth the wise in their own craftiness. [That is, he confounds their worldly and subtile consolations against God and against the upright, so that they perish themselves thereby.]
\p
\v 20 . And again, the Lord knoweth the reasoning of the wise [That is, worldly wise as before. The text Psa. 94.11. hath men, namely, who rely on their wisdom] that they are in vain. [that is, in vain set their wisdom on work against Gods wisdom.]
\p
\v 21 . Therefore let no man glory men: [That is, let him not admire nor trust in any humane wisdom] For all is yours. [that is, prepared and ordained by God to serve for your salvation: even the chiefest among the teachers are not for themselves, but for the Church. And therefore they must order all things not for their own honour, but for the honour of Christ, and for your salvation.]
\p
\v 22 . Be it Paul, be it Apollos, be it Cephas, be it the world, be it life, be it death, be it present, be it future things: they are all yours.
\p
\v 23 . But ye are Christ, [Namely, body or brides as being your head] and Christ is Gods. [namely, the Fathers well beloved Son, and Ambassador, to bring us to the eternal inheritance with him. See 1 Cor. 11.3. and chap. 15.v.27,28.]
\c 4
\s 1. The Apostle teacheth for what the teachers of the Church must be accounted, and what is required of them, 5 Regards little the judgment of men, and shows by his example that they shall principally give an account of their ministry before God. 6 Exhorts not only the teachers, but also all believers, to a modest opinion of themselves, 7 Seeing not they themselves, but God by his gifts makes them to differ. 8 Puts a difference between the great opinion they had of themselves, and the low and miserable estate of the last Apostles in this world, 14 that by this comparison they might also have a meaner conceit of themselves. 17 declareth that he also sends Timothy to them for that end. 18 again reprehends their loftiness, and threatens them with his coming, 20 that they might in time reprove the evil from among them, and escape the rod.
\p
\v 1 Let (every) man so account of us as Ministers of Christ, and distributors [Gr. Oiconomous, i.e. providers for the house, or dispensers of Gods house, namely, in distributing and administering of his Word and Sacraments, 1 Cor. 2. 7. See of this word Luke 16. 1.] of the mysteries of God.
\p
\v 2 . And further it is required in distributors that each be found faithful, [Namely, go not beyond his charge herein, or come short of it, Heb. 3. 5.]
\p
\v 3 . But it is to me the least that I should be judged of you, or of a human judgment, [Gr. A human day: a phrase taken from ordinary judgments, in which count is kept on certain set days to judge that which falls out. Not that one Prophet also might not judge of another, for he commands the contrary, 1Cor. 14. 29. but he speaks of such a judgment as shall be noted in the following words. And Paul hath here respect especially to the last day, when all things shall be judged according as they ought, Mat. 25. 14. & c. Luke 19. 12. ] yea, neither do I judge myself. [that is, not to be understood of a judgment of trying of ourselves whether we be in the faith, and in what terms we stand with God, 1Cor. 11. 28. and 2 Cor. 13. 5. but of a judgment whereby any one lifts up and praiseth himself above another in his ministry, or puts himself below another, and dispraiseth himself; as this is here reproved in some, that one exalted Paul above Peter, & c. and the other again set Peter or Apollo, & c. above him. This is it which he here submits to Gods judgment, seeing men oftentimes herein judge out of affections, as that which follows also sets forth.]
\p
\v 4 . For I am conscious of nothing [Namely, as concerning the faithful administration of mine Apostleship: therein I have a good conscience, for hereof only the Apostle speaks] to my self: yet am I not thereby justified: [namely, before God, or in Gods judgment, as David also speaks, Psa. 143. 2. and Paul , Gal. 2. 16. For it is one thing to have a good conscience in ones actions before God, for his own comfort, 1 John 3. 21. and another thing by his actions to be justified before God. The first shows diligence and sincerity of his actions, which David also testifies often times in his Psalms, the other a perfection without defects, which Paul, even as David also, found yet in himself, Psa. 19. 13. Phil. 3. 12, 13. & c.] but he that judgeth me [namely, as a supreme judge, not only in the outward matter of my ministry, but also of my conscience, whereof the Lord Christ only is the judge, who shall indeed judge thereof at the last day, as the following verse declares] is the Lord.
\p
\v 5 . Therefore judge nothing before the time [Namely, of judgment, in which Christ shall also bring to light the secret matters of conscience, Rom. 2. 16.] until the Lord shall be come, who shall also bring to light that which is hidden in darkness, [Gr. The hidden things of darkness] and make manifest the counsels of the hearts. [that is, with what uprightness and to what end every one shall have performed his actions in his ministry. Whereby he seems to reprove those who indeed preach the Gospel, but more for their own honour or for favour of men, than for Gods glory, and out of a desire of men’s salvation ] and then shall every one have praise of God. [that is, not only a public testimony of his well-doing, but also a reward, Rom. 2. 6. 2Cor. 5. 10.]
\p
\v 6 . And these things [Some understand hereby that which the Apostle said before of the faults and pride of some teachers, and that he reproved them in his own and Apollo’s person, without expressing their names, to spare them: but seeing many things are spoken heretofore in the person of Paul, Cephas and Apollo, which cannot be applied to such teachers , and also that Paul is not want to take the faults of such upon him to spare them, but much rather to oppose his example unto such, to give the church warning of them; therefore this may altogether as conveniently be understood of the faults of the church itself, who made such difference among the faithful teachers and Apostles, whereby these divisions were occasioned, without all the teachers being guilty thereof: and declares that in his own and Apollo’s person he had showed them what esteem they ought to have of their teachers whosoever they be, namely, only as ministers of Christ, who directed them to Christ, and to the true unity in Christ, and not to themselves to make a particular faction] Brethren, I have applied by similitude to myself and Apollo, for your sakes: [that is, lightly to instruct you how you must carry yourselves in respect of your teachers, and in what esteem you must have them] that you might learn in us, not to think [namely, neither of your teachers, nor of yourselves who are instructed by them] above that which is written,[ namely, throughout in the word of God, which every where commends humility and unity to us. Or above that which was written unto you by us heretofore] that ye be not the one for another’s sake puffed up against the other.[ that is, one member of the Church against another, because he was brought to Christ by this or that teacher and by his ministry was made partaker of such or such gifts for the edification of the church of Christ.]
\p
\v 7 . For who differenceth thee? [Namely, whether thou be a teacher which excellest others in gifts, or whether thou be a member of the Church, who by this or that teacher, art brought to faith in Christ and other spiritual gifts. It is therefore God in Christ (he would say) who by his grace differenceth thee from another, not the teacher, not ye yourselves. For although Paul plants, Apollo moistneth, yet it is God alone which giveth the increase, 1Cor. 3. 6. ] And what hast thou that thou hast not received ? and if thou hast also received it, why dost thou boast as if thou hadst received it?
\p
\v 8 . Ye are satisfied already [That is, you imagine to yourselves that you are now altogether happy, and that you have now no more want in spiritual gifts, but that you have obtained to perfection in all things, and excel all others as a King in his kingdom, which the Apostle speaks by way of upbraiding, to exhort them afterwards by his example, and the consideration of his miserable estate, unto humility. See the like Revel. 3. 17.] ye are already become rich: ye have reigned without us , [ that is, without our having had any part, in your dominion, or imagination of dominion, rest, and prosperity] and oh that ye did reign, [namely indeed and in truth] that we might reign with you. [this he saith because anyone that loveth another, is glad of it when it goeth well with him, and when he prospers in all things, and esteems such a ones happiness as his own.]
\p
\v 9 . For I think [Here he begins for a warning to propound his and the other Apostles example, to bring them to a suspicion, and a lowly esteem of themselves & of their condition, and to exhort them much rather to suffering , than boasting] that God hath set us who are the last Apostles [That is, who are last called since Christ’s ascension, as Paul, Barnabas, Silas, Apollo, Timotheus, and the like, who were therefore through dis-esteem by some called the last Apostles. See of this name Rom. 16. 7. 2Cor. 8. 23.] for a spectacle [or, brought us forth. Paul here alludes to the custom of the heathen, who brought forth malefactors into the public Theaters, to cast them before the wild beasts for the recreation for the others, or to cause them to fight against those beasts even unto death : which was also oftentimes done by them to the Christians. See 1Cor. 15. 32.] as it were condemned to death, so we are become a spectacle to the world,[ that is, to the reasonable creatures in the world , which he divides into Angels and men; whereof the good Angels and good men were witnesses of their suffering, and had compassion on them; and the evil Angels and men took also a delight in it, as in the Theaters were found all manner of people and judgements] and to the Angels, and to men.
\p
\v 10 . We (are) foolish for Christ’s sake, [that is, esteemed fools by the world] but ye are wise in Christ, [namely, according to your thinking and imagination] we are weak but ye (are) strong: ye are glorious, but we despised.
\p
\v 11 . Even unto this present hour we suffer hunger, and we suffer thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no fixed dwelling place.
\p
\v 12 . And labour, working with our own hands, [See an example hereof in Paul, Acts 18. 3. 1Cor. 9 6. ] we reviled, and we bless: we are persecuted and we bear it.
\p
\v 13 . We are reproached and we intreat, we are become as the cleansings-out of the world, [That is, where we come, worldly men seek to be rid of us, and cast us out as filth and scrapings-off, or else as accursed men; as the Greek word Katharma is also taken. See Lam. 3. ver. 45.] (and) the scraping-off of all things even until now. [that is, not once or twice but continually even until now.]
\p
\v 14 . I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I admonish (you) [ Namely, to bring you to consideration and reformation of these faults.]
\p
\v 15 . For although ye had ten thousand schoolmasters in Christ, [Gr. Paidagogous, i.e. Schoolmasters or tutors: namely, who further instruct you in the things of Christ, after that ye are begotten by me by the gospel of Christ. And this the Apostle saith because a Father instructs his children with greater affection and truer love then a tutor doth. See 2cor. 11. 20. ] yet (ye have) not many Fathers. For in Christ Jesus I have begotten you [or, gotten, engendered, i.e. first brought to the faith: for the preaching of the Gospel is the means, whereby we are regenerated by the spirit of God, Philem. Ver. 10. 1Pet. 1. 23.] through the Gospel.
\p
\v 16 . I exhort you therefore be imitators of me. [Namely, in humility, peaceableness, patience, simplicity, etc.]
\p
\v 17 . Therefore I have sent Timothy unto you, who is my dear and faithful son in the Lord, [Namely, not only because I have begotten him to Christ by the Gospel, but also because as a true Son he follows my footsteps in all things, 1 Tim. 1. 2. and chap. 4. 6.] who shall put you in remembrance of my ways which are in Christ, [that is, of my walking in my life, Psalm 1, 1, 6. and of my manner of doing, in setting forth the Gospel of Christ with all uprightness and simplicity, as he presently subjoyness] like as I teach every where in all churches.
\p
\v 18 . But some are puffed up [This he saith, not only of some teachers, who by reason of some outward eloquence had a very high conceit of themselves, and despised Pauls simplicity: but also of some members, who being instructed by them, accounted themselves great masters, although they wanted much as yet, and despised others in comparison of themselves, as is declared in the following verses] as if I would not come unto you. [namely, to reform such faults, and to punish them according as they deserve.]
\p
\v 19 . But I will come unto you speedily if the Lord will; and I will (then) understand, not the words [That is boasting of the eloquence, or of knowledge in spiritual things] of them that are puffed up, but the power. [namely, which they indeed show forth in faith, love and other Christian virtues or gifts, which God’s Spirit powerfully works, 1 John 3. 18.]
\p
\v 20 . For the Kingdom of God [That is, the State of a Christian-man or child of God, in whom God sets up his kingdom, Rom. 14. 17.] (consisteth) not in words but in power.
\p
\v 21 . What will ye? Shall I come unto you with the rod?
\p [That is, with the exercise of punishment and discipline, 2 Cor. 10. 6.] or in love [that is, in kindness and affectionateness: otherwise punishment also comes from a Father out of love, Heb. 12. 6.] and (in) the spirit of meekness.
\c 5
\s 1. The Apostle comes further and proves by the defects which were yet in their Church, that the Corinthians had more cause to humble themselves, then to boast and lift themselves up, and first because of their suffering incest among them. 2. Exhorts them earnestly, that they should cast him that had done this, out of the midst of them, and deliver him to Satan, 6. produces divers’ reasons to this purpose, especially by a similitude taken from heaven, which in the keeping of the Passover in the Old Testament was too purged out. 9. Informs them afterwards more at large against what kind of men this Ecclesiastical discipline must be exercised. 11. Namely against those who are called brethren, and gave such like offences, 12. leaving those that were without the Church, committed to the judgment of God.
\p
\v 1 It is wholly reported [That is, not as an uncertain report, but as a certain thing] (that there is) fornication among you, and such fornication as is not named even among the Gentiles; [namely, without detestation or abomination. For howsoever here and there in the Greek, Roman, and other histories such examples are found, yet not withstanding they are always condemned by them as unfitting and unlawful] so that one hath his Fathers wise.[that is, his mother in Law, as she is also called in Gods word, Levit. 18.8.]
\p
\v 2 . And are ye (yet) puffed up, and have not much rather mourned? [Namely, as men do when there is cause of common sorrow: for although such are sins of particular persons, yet nevertheless they concern the whole Church, because Gods name is blasphemed for it, and his wrath kindled thereby against the whole congregation, if they be not duly punished] that they may take away out of the midst of you, [that is, by Christian excommunication cast out of your congregation, as hereafter ver. 7.11. is declared] that hath done this indeed.
\p
\v 3 . But I, as being indeed absent in body, but present in Spirit, [That is, with my thoughts, will, and the power of the Spirit. See the like, 2 Kings 5.26. Col. 2.5.] have decreed already as (if I were) present, him that hath so committed that (thing.)
\p
\v 4 . In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [That is, according to the command and charge of Christ, and with calling upon his name, Mat. 18.ver.15.] when ye and my Spirit shall be gathered (together,) with the power of the Lord Jesus Christ, [that is, the powerfull working of Christ in the hearts of those amongst whom, and against whom this punishment is lawfully used. See Mat. 18.ver.18.19,20.]
\p
\v 5 . To deliver over such a one unto Satan, [That is, to banish him out of your communion, or as Christ speaks Mat. 18.ver.17. to account him as a heathen and a Publican. For without the Church of Christ Satan hath his Kingdome. See 2 Tim 2.ver.25,26.] for the destruction of flesh, that is, for the mortifying and abolishing of the old man, i.e. of the corrupt nature, which is everywhere called flesh, See Rom. 8.13. Gal. 5.24.] that the Spirit may be saved [that is, the new man, which by the fleshly desires and sins seemed as it were dead and buried, may be raised up again, and to obtain the conquest, until that in the day of Christ coming, it shall wholly and only reign in us] in the day of the Lord Jesus.
\p
\v 6 . Your glorying [Namely, whereby you glory is as if you and your Church were altogether perfect] is not good. Know ye not that the little leaven [Gr. A small leaven. By this similitude the Apostle declares, that a scandalous person if he be not punished in the Church, easily draws others to imitate him] makes the whole dough sowre?
\p
\v 7 . Purge out therefore the old leaven [This may either particularly be understood of the purging out, or casting out of this scandalous person, that the whole Church might be without infamy and danger of further infection, seeing that they were already by the spirit of God in a great part freed from the leaven of natural corruption. Or in general for a universal exhortation by occasion of the foregoing similitude, namely that each one in particulars should more and more purge out of himself the old leaven of sin, as they were already delivered from the dominion thereof. See Eph. 4.22. Col. 3.5,9,10.] that ye may be a new dough, even as ye are unsowred. For even our Passover is slain for us, (namely) Christ. [Or, our Passover is offered for us, i.e. the Passover which is offered for us for the expiation of our sins. Christ is here called the Passover, which is often used of the Sacraments ( as the bread in the Lords Supper is called the body of Christ, and the communion of the body of Christ) because the Paschall lamb was a sign and figure of Christ and his sacrifice. See John 19.36.]
\p
\v 8 . So then let us feast, [That is, in that which the Israelites were to do in the type, after the killing of the outward Passover, on the preparation of the Passover, by the purging out of all leaven, and by obtaining of from leaven bread for seven days, according to Gods command, Exod. 12.ver.15. that the Apostle commands the Christians to do in the signified all their life long: namely to walk holily and righteously before God and men, and for this cause also to take away all offences from among them, since they are reconciled unto God by the sacrifice and sprinkling of the blood of Christ] not in the old leaven, [that is, in the defilement of natural corruption in which we are born] nor in leaven of evil and wickedness, which natural men yet daily heap thereunto] but in the unleavened (bread) [that is, in a pure and undefiled walking] of uprightness and truth.
\p
\v 9 . I wrote to you in the Epistle [This some understand of another Epistle which the Apostle should have written to the Church of Corinth before this, because the words which follow are not before expressed in so many letters: but seeing the sense of these words is related before in the second and seventh verses, therefore this may fitly be understood of the same Epistle of Paul] that you should not mingle your selves with fornicators. [that is, not admit them unto the communion of your congregation and converse ordinarily with them as brethren. See ver.11.]
\p
\v 10 . But not altogether [That is, this I understand not in general of all such scandalous persons, which dwell among you or with you] with the fornicators of this world, or with covetous, or with extortioners, or with idolaters: for otherwise ye must go out of the world. [namely, seeing the world is full of such men, with whom ye daily have to do, whose footsteps ye must not follow, but whom you must seek to win to Christ, Mat. 5.16. Eph. 5.11. And although this agrees to all ages, yet not withstanding it agrees most of all to that age, in which Gentilism prevailed, who were all idolaters, whereupon these other sins commonly follow.]
\p
\v 11 . But now I have written unto you [that is, I thought it needful to write unto you, that ye may well understand me] that ye should not mingle your selves, (namely) if any one being a brother [namely, beheld, and acknowledged for a member of the Church ; as Christians every where in the Acts of the Apostles, and the Epistle of the same, are called brethren; as Christ also speaks thus of this Ecliasticall discipline, Mat. 18.15.] be a fornicator, or a covetous person, or an idolater [that Christ at that time sometimes also themselves into idolatry appears, 1 Cor. 10.20. Rev. 2.14.20.] or a rattler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner: that with such a one ye shall not so much as eat. [that is, shall keep no similar and public mutual friendship with such, that they may be ashamed. See 2 The. 3.14. 2 Joh. V.10. Otherwise the Apostle forbids not that by man and wise, parents and children, and the like, even civil communion it self ( whereunto the law of nature and manners of men oblige us) discipline doth but deprive such of the communion which is proper to Christians, as well in the spiritual as temporals: not (that) whereby there are obliged one to another as men or citizens in general.]
\p
\v 12 . For what have I also to do to judge them that are without? [Namely, yet strangers from the Church of Christ and from the faith, Eph. 2.12.] do ye not judge them? [that is, them that are account members of the church, whom ver. 11. he calls brethren.] But them that are without God judgeth. [That is, receives them to his own judgment, to punish or convert them. Whereby he shews that albeit such are without the discipline of the church, yet they are not therefore free from the judgment of God. See the like phrase, 1 Cor. 11.32.] And put ye away this wicked person out of you.
\p
\v 13 But them that are without God judges. [That is, receives them to his own judgement, to punsih or convert them. Whereby he shews that albeit such are without the discipline of the church, yet they are not therefore free from the judgement of God. See the like phrase, 1 Cor. 11.32.] And put ye away this wicked person out of you.
\c 6
\s 1 The apostle here reproves some more faults among the Corinthians, whereof the first is, that they aid not rather make an of the differences that were amongst them about worldly matters, between themselves in a friendly manner, then bring them before unbelieving Magistrates. 2 Proves that this was not seemly for believers, forasmuch they shall judge the world and the Angels. 7 Afterwards shews the original from whence the difference arose, namely, from want of love, forbearance and justice. 9 Testifies that the righteous and other scandalous persons shall not inherit the Kingdome of heaven. 11 And that it was unfitting for them that they should yet henceforward be like unto them, because by the Spirit of God they were delivered from the dominion of such sins. 12 Reproves yet another fault in them, consisting in the abuse of meat, and other things concerning the belly, but especially fornication. 15 Proves afterwards by many reasons how unseemly that is for Christians, 19 whose bodies are Temples of the Holy Ghost, which are clearly bought, and who must glorifie God in body and spirit.
\p
\v 1 Direth any one of you hath a matter [That is, a difference about worldly things. See v.3.] against another, go to law [Gr. Be judged, or let him be judged] before the unjust [namely, Magistrates which he so calleth, because the Magistrates at that time were most Heathen, and strangers from faith in Christ, and true righteousness, and for the most part also oppressors of Christians] and not before the Saints?
\p
\v 2 Know ye not that the Saints [That is, the faithful whom he so names, because they are sanctified by the spirit of Christ, and by their holy profession and their holy sacraments are separated from others] shall judge the world? And if the world be judged [that is, shall be] by [Gr. In you] you, [namely, as Assessors of Christ the universal judge, whose sentence they shall also approve and justify, Mat. 19.v.28. Luke 22.v.30.] are ye unworthy of the smallest law-matters? [so he calls the matters of this life and of this world, because they are to be esteemed nothing in respect of the heavenly and spiritual.]
\p
\v 3 . Knew ye not that we shall judge the Angels? [Namely, which have sinned, and are kept with chains of darkness unto the day of great judgment. See Mat. 25.41. 2 Pet. 2.4. Jude v.6.] how much more the things that concern this life?
\p
\v 4 . If therefore ye have law-matters which concerns this life, set them (about it) who are least esteemed [Gr. Are esteemed for naught, namely, according to the judgment of some among you] in the Church. [namely, rather then the unrighteous or Heathen. This the Apostle speaks by comparison, against those that thought that no man in the Church was wise enough to end their differences: but the Apostle expounds this in the following verse, and commands that they should take the wisest and understanding of them for Mediators in these matters. See Exod. 18.21.]
\p
\v 5 . I speak (this) to you shame. Is there so then none among you that is wise, no not one who might be able to judge betwixt his brethren? [Gr. Betwixt his brother, i.e. betwixt one believer and another, as the following verse declares.]
\p
\v 6 . But the (one) brother goeth to the law with the (other) brother, and that before unbelievers. [The Apostle therefore doth not altogether forbid to go to law before Magistrates, but only before unbelievers with offence and scandal; even as he also doth not forbid when any one is oppressed by others, or sued at law, that he might not defend himself by the help of unbelieving Magistrates. For he himself also in such a case appealed unto unbelieving Magistrates; and made use of their help, not only against the Gentiles, but also against the Jews. See Acts 22.v.25. and chap. 23.17. and chap. 25.10.]
\p
\v 7 . Now therefore there is altogether a defect [Gr. Hertema, which here signifies a want of love or courage whereby evill inclinations are overcome] among you, that ye have law-suites one another. Why do ye not rather suffer wrong? Why do ye not rather suffer loss?
\p
\v 8 . But ye [That is, some among you] do wrong and procures loss, and that your brethren.
\p
\v 9 . Or know ye not that the righteous [That is, they that do others wrong or injury] shall not inherit the Kingdome of God? [that is, the eternal glory in heaven, which is hee called an inheritance, because it is given not of merit, but to those only whom God of his hath taken for his children.]
\p
\v 10 . Do not err [Or deceive not yourselves] neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor wantons, nor they that lye with men, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards: nor rattlers, nor extortioners shall inherit the Kingdome of God? [namely, except they repent, and leave off to be such any more, Mat. 21.31,32. as the following verse imports.]
\p
\v 11 . And this were some of you: [Namely, one in the one, and another in the another. For although in all Gentiles, all these sins were not always manifest, yet nevertheless the root of all men was in them, and the one or the other upon occasion always breaks forth: but they were all idolaters, See Rom. 1.29. Eph. 2.v.1,2,3. and chap. 4.v.17.18.] but ye are washed off, [that is, purged from the reigning power of such sins, namely, by your sanctification or regeneration, and by your justification, consisting in the forgiving of sins, and imputation of righteousness of Christ, whereof baptism is a sign and seal See Mark 1.4. Acts 22.16. Rom. 6.4. Eph. 5.26. Tit. 3.5. 1 Pet. 3.21.] but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, [that is, for Jesus Christ and his merits sake. For the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all our sins, 1 John 1.7. Rev. 1.5.] and by the spirit of our God.
\p
\v 12 . All things [Namely, which are indifferent, and not forbidden in Gods word, of the use whereof he here speaks briefly, and shall speak more largely hereafter, chap. 7.8, 9, 10, 11. and will distinguish them from others] are lawful for me; but all things are not profitable: all things are lawful for me, but I will not suffer my self to be brought under the power of any. [that is, that I should suffer my self to be bound by any humane command not to make use of that which the Lord hath left free to me, when I can do it without offence of others. See Rom. 14.14. 1 Cor. 7.23. and 10.23. or I will not suffer my self to be domineered over by any thing, namely, so that I should bring my self in bondage to things different, not to use them for the edification of my neighbour.]
\p
\v 13 . Meats are for the belly, and the belly for meats, but God shall bring to naught both this [Namely, belly: not in respect of its being which is a part of mans body, temporal and natural life which shall no more be needful then. See Mat. 22.ver.30. 1 Cor. 15.44. Revel. 7.ver.16,17.] and them. But the body is not for fornication] namely, which the Gentiles held for an indifferent thing, and which at Corinth it self, where a public Temple was erected for this sin, was very common. Therefore Apostle treats thereof first and particularly, before he comes to other things, which they also held for indifferent, and in which they laid needless snares for themselves, or sinned grievously] but for the Lord, i.e. to use the same for the service of the Lord Jesus Christ] and the Lord for the body. [that is, the Lord is also a Lord of the Body, seeing he gave up himself not only for the redemption of the soul, but also of the body, ver.20.
\p
\v 14 . And God hath also raised the Lord, and shall raise up us [That is, our bodies to glory, Rom. 8.11. Phil. 3.21.] by his power.
\p
\v 15 . Know ye not that your bodies [That is, your bodies also. For seeing true believers are wholly united to Christ as their head, 1 Cor. 12. ver. 12. 17. their bodies are also apart of his spiritual body] are members of Christ? Shall I therefore take the members of Christ, and make them members of a whore? Far be it.
\p
\v 16 . Or know ye not that adhere to a whore are one body (with her?) for they two saith he shall be for one flesh. [This place taken out of Gen. 2. 24. is properly spoken of the bond of marriage: but Paul applies it also to fornication, because such dishonest love and carnal union, binds these persons one to another dishonestly and lawfully; even as marriage binds them lawfully and honestly.]
\p
\v 17 . But he that adheres to the Lord, [Namely, by true faith and sincere love] is one spirit (with him), [that is spiritual; or united unto him by his Spirit, 1 Cor. 12. 13.]
\p
\v 18 . Flee fornication. Every sin which a man doth, [Namely, which is done by a man in the outward act] is without the body: [that is, abuseth somewhat, or doth hurt to somewhat which is without a man himself] but he that committeth fornication, he sinneth [ this must be understood comparatively, namely, more than any other sin. For howsoever a drunkard and glutton abuseth his body also, yet nevertheless it is done by somewhat that is no part of his body, as meat and drink; and doth likewise much hurt and shame to his body, but not so great as fornication] against [or, in] his own body.
\p
\v 19 . Or know ye not that your body is a Temple of the Holy Ghost, [Which therefore must be kept pure and clean, and wherein God will be served: which the Apostle testifies also of the whole man, 2 Cor. 6. 16] which is in you, which ye have of God, [namely, to assure you of your adoption, Rom. 8. ver. 11, 15. 2 Cor. 1. 22.] and (that) ye are not your own. [ namely, to do your own will, but the will of him to whom ye belong.]
\p
\v 20 . For ye are dearly bought: [Gr. By price, namely, by the precious blood of Christ, 1 Pet. 1. 18. 19. Revel. 5. 9.] therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, [that is, with body and soul which is renewed by the Holy Ghost] which are Gods. [ namely, not only ny the right of creation, but also by the right of redemption.]
\c 7
\s 1. The Apostle answers a question proposed whether it be good to take a wife. 3. He commands the married not to withhold themselves each from other, 5. except it were by mutual consent for a time, to give themselves to fasting and prayer. 8. Declares further to the unmarried and widows, that it is good to remain unmarried, namely, for such as have the gift thereunto, but not for others. 10. Commands the married that they shall not part, 12. no not believers from unbelievers, if they be content to remain with believers. 15. But if the unbelievers will separate he testifieth that believers are not then obliged. 18. Declares further that every one must be content with his estate wherein he was called to Christ, as well circumcised as uncircumcised, 21. as well servants as free men. 25. Afterwards speaks of Virgins which are under the power of the another, and shows in what case it is good to bestow them or not. 29. Adjoins a general exhortation, how marriage and other things of this world must be used, 32 and what advantage the unmarried have above the married to adhere well to the Lord. 36. So notwithstanding that they do not sin who give their Virgins in marriage, 39. and declares again that the married are bound one to another as long as they live.
\p
\v 1 Now concerning the thing whereof ye wrote unto me, it is good [ By this word good here, is understood not that which is honest, virtues, or holy; for the Apostle testifieth that the married estate is honourable. Heb. 13. 4. as also the Holy Scripture throughout; but for that which hath less trouble, incumbency and inconvenience as the Apostle expounds the same hereafter ver. 26.] for a man (homo) [that is, (vir) ] not to touch [that is, to marry, or to know, as this word is also taken thus, Gen. 20. 6. ] a wife.
\p
\v 2 . But because of fornications [He speaks in the plural number, thereby to express all manner of uncleanness and wantonness] every (man) shall have his own wife [Gr. A wife of his own i.e. one married wife, and not many] and every (wife) shall have her own husband.
\p
\v 3 . The husband shall pay to the wife the due benevolence: [Although this may be understood in general of all duties between man and wife Eph. 5. 22. yet nevertheless it is here principally understood of those duties which are peculiar to marriage, as appears by the following verse] and likewise also the wise to the husband.
\p
\v 4 . The wife hath not the power over her own body, [Namely, to withhold her body from the husband without reason in this due benevolence, as the following verse declares] but the husband; and like wise also the husband hath not the power over his own body, but the wife.
\p
\v 5 . Withhold not your selves from one another except it be with consent (of both) for a time, that you may be at leisure for fasting and prayer: [He speaks not here of ordinary prayer whereunto all Christians must be ready at all times, but of extraordinary necessities of prayer whether those necessities concerned those married persons in particular, or the Church of Christ in general, as by the joining of fasting appears, which is not required in all occasions, but in prayers in especial necessities. See Exod. 19. 15. Joel. 2. 16. Mat. 17. 21. Acts 13. 2.] and come together again, that Satan tempt you not [that is, by this occasion stir you not up to unfitting lusts or other uncleanness] because ye cannot contain your selves.
\p
\v 6 . But this I say by permission, not by command, [ This is not to be understood of that which the Apostle said in the second verse, seeing they that have not the gift of continence are not only permitted to marry, but also commanded, as also in the ninth verse: but of that which was spoken immediately before, of abstaining for a time and then coming together again, which he will leave to the liberty of the married according as they find themselves strong or weak therein, and according as their necessity and calling will bear.]
\p
\v 7 . For I would that all men were even as my self (am) [The Apostle declares, for reasons which shall be rehearsed, that he had rather that they all had a gift of continence. Yet nevertheless that every one must take notice of the gifts which he hath received from God for this purpose: namely, the one to contain himself, the other to make use of marriage in honour and moderation,] but every one hath his proper gift of God, the one indeed on this, but the other in that.
\p
\v 8 . But I say to the unmarried, [Namely, who are in their own as the Greek word imports. For of the virgins which are under the power of another, he will begin to treat hereafter in the 25. verse] and to the windows, it is good for them, [that is, advisable, useful and less troublesome. See v. 26.] if they remain even as I.
\p
\v 9 . But they cannot contain themselves let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn. [That is, it is good to marry, that we may not be inflamed with sinful lusts through desires of the flesh, and remain in danger to fall into uncleanness; which is always evil.]
\p
\v 10 . But to the married command not I [Namely, as the first proposer of this command, but as a relater of that which the Lord Christ hath expressly commanded before. See Mat. 19. 3. etc] but the Lord that the wife depart not from her husband.
\p
\v 11 . And if she also depart [Namely, otherwise then because of the husband’s adultery. See Mat. 5. 32. and chap. 19. v. 9. ] let her remain unmarried, [that is, let her not be permitted any other marriage in the church, if she cannot be reconciled to her husband] or be reconciled to the husband; and let not the husband forsake the wife.
\p
\v 12 . But to the others [ Namely, believers which are married to unbelievers ] Say I, [Namely, as an Apostle of Christ, informed and moved by his Spirit] not the Lord, [namely, by an express command as the former was, v. 10. The reason hereof seemeth to be, that Christ preached the Gospel only among the Jews who were yet in Gods covenant, and not amongst the Gentiles, where this difference fell out at that time, which therefore he caused to be propounded and commanded in its season by his Apostles] If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, [that is, a stranger from the Christian Religion, as the Gentiles were] and the same be content to dwell with him [namely, as those that are married use to do, and as it becometh her] let him not forsake her.
\p
\v 13 . And a wife that hath an unbelieving husband, and he be content to dwell with her, let her not forsake him.
\p
\v 14 . For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, [Gr. Sanctified in the wife, as also afterward in the husband. Namely, in regard those believers are heirs of Gods covenant, with their children, Gen. 17. 7. Acts 2. 39. which advantage the unbelieving party cannot hinder by his unbelief, because the grace of God in sanctifying such a marriage, is more powerful than the unbelief of the other party to unhallow the same] and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband. For otherwise your children were unclean, [that is, strangers from God’s covenant, as is testified of the unbelieving Gentiles and their seed, Eph. 2. 12.] but now are they holy. [that is, are comprehended in the outward covenant of God, and have access to the signs and seals of God’s grace, as well as they that are born of both believing parents.]
\p
\v 15 . But if the unbeliever depart [That is, forsake the believer, or drives him from her, and obstinately on his side makes void the bond of marriage, as was then usual with the Gentiles, and now also with the Turks] let him depart. A brother or a filter is not embondaged [That is, not bound on their side to hold the bond of marriage any further, or to remain unmarried, as he had commanded the married in general, v. 11. from which command they are also excepted] in such (cases:) [namely, when they on their side thus break the bond of marriage, only, out of hatred to the faith] but God hath called us to peace. [Gr. In peace, i.e. to live in peace and with a quiet conscience, whether it be in marriage or out of the same.]
\p
\v 16 . For what knowest thou O wife [Namely, who art a believer, and livest in peace with an unbelieving husband] whether thou shalt save thy husband? [namely, by thy peaceable and Christian walking shalt win him to Christ. See 1 Tim. 4. 16. Sam. 5. 20. 1 Pet. 3. 1, 2.] Or what knowest thou husband that thou shalt save thy wife?
\p
\v 17 . But as God hath distributed to every one, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk: [That is, let every one be content and frame himself according to the gifts and the calling which he hath obtained of the Lord, whether it be in a married estate or out of it: which afterwards he extends also to other callings of men, that by Christians under the name of Christian Religion, the State of the commonwealth might not be distributed, or the church be made hateful] and so ordain I in all the churches.
\p
\v 18 . Is any man called being circumcised? Let him not cause (the foreskin) to be drawn on. [As may be done by the art Chirurgery. See 1 Mat. 1. 16. Joseph. An. Lib. 12. cap. 6. Namely, as thinking that he should be the more acceptable to God thereby] Is any man called being in the foreskin [that is, uncircumcised] let him not be circumcised.
\p
\v 19 . Circumcision is nothing, [That is, of no force unto godliness. Which the Apostle understands chiefly of the times of the New Testament, when circumcision is no more a sacrament. See Gal. 5. 6.] and uncircumcision is nothing , but keeping of the commandments of God.
\p
\v 20 . Let every one abide in that calling [That is, be quiet and satisfy himself] wherein he is called.
\p
\v 21 . Art thou called being a servant ? let not (that) trouble thee; [Namely, as if thou be but a sincere Christian. See 1 Cor. 12. v. 13. and Gal. 3. 28.] but if thou canst also become free [namely, by lawful and fit ways, as amongst the Gentiles where slavery was in use, there were divers ways whereby the slaves might come to their freedom] use (that) rather.
\p
\v 22 . For he that is called in the Lord being a servant, [That is, is converted to faith in Christ being yet a servant or slave] he is a free-man of the Lord: [that is, by the Lord freed from the bondage of sin and of the Devil. See John 8. v. 34, 35, 36.] Likewise also he that is called being free, [namely, according to the civil or outward state] he is a servant of Christ. [that is, subject to his power and commands, as a servant to his Lord.]
\p
\v 23 . Ye are dearly brought [Gr. By price. See the last verse of the former chapter] Be not the servants of men. [namely, to do anything for the service or obedience of which should be repugnant to the commands of the service of God. Or suffer not your selves in spiritual things to be brought in bondage by any men, that you should not freely use that which the Lord hath made free to us. See Gal. 5.1. Col. 2.20.]
\p
\v 24 . Every one wherein is called, brethren, let him abide in the same with God. [That is, as in the presence of God: or, duly to acquit himself in such a calling.]
\p
\v 25 . Now concerning Virgins I have no command of the Lord: [Or, no ordinance, i.e. no express command of God or Christ: namely, that any one ought to remain a virgin. Whereby it appears that the words of Christ, Mat. 19.12. He that comprehend this, let him comprehend it, are not command but only a permission] but I speak [Gr. Give] (my) opinion, as who have obtained mercy of the Lord, to be faithful. [namely, in my doctrine and ministry, and in that respect also in that which I declare. See ver.40. and 1 Cor. 4.1.2 Or, to be worthy of credit.]
\p
\v 26 . I hold this therefore to be good [That is, profitable and useful as ver. 1.8.] for the instant necessity, [Or, present need. Namely, of the Church which is now in continual trouble, persecution and banishment. See the like phrase, 2 Cor. 6.4. and 1. The. 3.7. which necessity may better and easier be endured by the unmarried then by the married, who are burdened with a family and children] that (I say) it is good for a man to be even so. [that is, unmarried, wherewith also is always to be understood the condition set down before in the 9. ver. As hereafter in the 3.5. and 36. verse, of the gift of continence.]
\p
\v 27 . Art thou bound to a wife? Seek no dissolution: [Namely, no not that the instant necessity, as some might have misinterpreted his former words] art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.
\p
\v 28 . But if thou marrieth also, thou sinnest not: and if a virgin marry she sinneth not: and if a virgin marry she sinneth not. But such shall have affliction [That is, troubles, discontents, and many cares] in the flesh, [that is, according to the outward man, or according to the present life. And this he saith because of them who fancied themselves nothing but ease and pleasure in a married condition] and I spare you. [that is, I would gladly have you free from such encumbrances and troubles as marriages brings with it, as hereafter ver. 32. and the following is further declared, namely, that you may be able to serve the Lord the more freely.]
\p
\v 29 . But this I say brethren, that the time henceforward is short: [Gr. The time is drawn in, or, together. This may be understood either of the time of every mans life, seeing the ages daily grow weaker, and therefore a man must think the more spirit upon spiritual things which are everlasting. Or of the time which the world shall yet stand, which is also said to be short in respect of the time fore-past, and therefore is called the last hour, that we might the more carefully prepare ourselves speedily to look for Christ our judge from heaven. See 1 Pet. 3. 8. Others read, the time is short: it remaineth therefore that even they that have wives & c.] that they also that have wives, might be as not having: [this Paul saith, not to forbid the married the use of marriage: for that would contradict that which is said be forever. 3, 4, 5. but to exhort them to moderation and consideration in that use, that their spiritual duties may not be hindered thereby, as also in that which followeth.]
\p
\v 30 . And they that weep [That is, they that are in heaviness, especially for the mischances which marriage brings with it by the death of husband, wife, children, or such like troubles and adversities which happen in marriage] as not weeping: and they that are joyful [namely, upon the several occasions of the married estate, as getting of children, bestowing them in marriage, or other accommodations and recreations] as not being joyful: and they that buy as not possessing : [that is, not setting their heart upon it, so that by the use of the same, they be turned away from the chiefest good. See Mat. 6. 19, 33. as the following words also declare.]
\p
\v 31 . And they that use this world, as not abusing it. For the form of this world [That is, the things which the world esteem as a great good and happiness, but which are no other than an appearance thereof, as some shows in public spectacles use to be, from whence the Greek word Schema is taken. See Eccles, 1. 2. 1 John 2. 16, 17.] passeth away.
\p
\v 32 . And I will [ I would be willing or with] that ye should be without carefulness. The unmarried is solicitous [that is, ought to take care; and can more freely do it, because he is not hindered by the care of house keeping] for the things of the Lord, how he shall please the Lord:
\p
\v 33 . But he that is married is solicitous [That is, useth ordinarily to do so, and is by reason of the care of house-keeping, and to please his partner, more obliged to it] for the things of the world, [ the word world is not here taken for worldly lusts which are unlawful and forbidden every where in God’s word, but for such things whereby the is maintained in this world, as meat, drink, and clothes, dwelling, trading, and the like, which are not unlawful in themselves, 1 Tim. 3. 4. and chap. 5. 8. but nevertheless do trouble a man that he cannot always so earnestly and continually think upon that which is spiritual, and in which the unmarried have less hindrance than the married, when our gifts and calling permit it. See an example hereof in Mary and Martha Luke 10. 39.] how he shall please his wife. [not to do any thing contrary to Gods will. For so we may please no men, Luke 14. 26. Gal. 1. 10. but to live in love and peace with her, Eph. 5. 25. which must so be understood also, of the wives taking care towards the husband in the following verse.]
\p
\v 34 . A wife and a virgin are different. The unmarried taketh care for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married taketh care for the things of the world, how she shall please her husband.
\p
\v 35 . And this I say for your own advantage: [That is, ease and benefit. And so he expounds in this verse that which before he called good or not good] not that I might cast a snare upon you, [namely, precisely to bind you to the unmarried life] but (to lead you) to that which is comely and fit, to adhere well to the Lord, without being drawn this way and that way. [Or, not to be drawn off. Namely, with the cares and troubles of this world.]
\p
\v 36 . but if any man think [Namely, by all signs which he perceives thereof, is aware or judgeth. He speaks here properly of Parents or Guardians, under whom the virgins are] that he dealeth unfitly [ that is, not well becomingly or well advisedly, if he should hinder his from marrying contrary to her nature or inclination: or else contrary to what the condition of his family requires] with his virgin, if she pass over her youthful time, and it must so come to pass: [namely, to prevent greater troubles both in respect of her and of his family] let him do what he will: he sinneth not: let them marry.
\p
\v 37 . But he that stands firm in (his) heart, having no necessity [Namely, either for himself, for the preservation of his family and other occasions, which oftentimes necessitate Parents to marry out their children: or by reason of the Frailty of the children whereof is spoken in he former verse] but hath power over his own will, and hath decreed this in his heart, that he will keep his virgin, [namely, unmarried] he doth well.
\p
\v 38 . So then he that giveth her in marriage, he doth well, and he that giveth her not in marriage be doth better. [That is, he doth that which is more serviceable and beneficial for the quiet of his virgin, as v. 1, 8, 26. and as it is expounded, v. 35. 40.]
\p
\v 39 . A wife is bound by the Law [Namely, of marriage. See Rom. 7. 2.] as long as her husband liveth, [namely, except it because of adultery, Mat. 19. 9. or of the departing of the unbelieving party, before v. 15.] but if her husband be fallen asleep, she is free to marry to whom she will, only in the Lord. [that is, only that this be done in the fear of the Lord: to which purpose also especially serves, that she now being free, do not yoke herself with unbelievers, 2 Cor. 6. 14.]
\p
\v 40 . But she is happier [Namely, as well in respect of the troubles which marriage brings with it, as of the freedom which she hath to serve the Lord with less trouble, as is declared by the Apostle heretofore. Yet this must also always be understood with the former conditions, if she have the gift of continence, and her calling permit this, as he hath limited this, v. 7. 17.] if she so abide according to my opinion. And I think also that I have the Spirit of God. [this the Apostle saith not as if he doubted thereof, but to speak modestly of himself, contrary to that false conceit which some among them had of themselves. See before v. 25.]

\s 1. The Apostle answers one question more concerning the eating of things offered to idols, and shows that it is not enough for this purpose, that we know that the idol is nothing, 5. and that we have but one God and one Lord; 9. seeing there are many weak ones, who by so doing would be offended, 10. and might take liberty to do thus likewise after their example, with an evil conference, and so perish. 12. Declares that such sin against Christ, 13. whereas no man ought to offend his brother even for the use of any meat.
\p
\v 1 Now concerning the things which are offered to idols [The Greek word Eiodolon, which we call idol, signifies any kind of image or likeness, and generally whatsoever without, or together with God, any religious honour is given to, and is here taken for an image whereby men honour any idol, or to which men give divine or religious honour under what pretence soever it be. Now seeing the Gentiles used part of the sacrifices which they offered to their idols for feasts, which they held at their houses or else in the Temples of the idols, whereunto the Christians were also sometimes invited; therefore it was demanded of the Apostle, whether it were also lawful to them, whether it were without or within the Temples of the idols, to go to such feasts, whereunto the Apostle answers partly in the tenth] We know that we altogether [namely, who are duly informed of God and of his nature, and withal of our Christian liberty. For he himself afterwards accepts the weak out of them, v. 7. and the Apostle seems here to rehearse the words which some persons among them used to colour their doings] have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, [that is, makes self-conceited, and despisers of our neighbour, when knowledge is without love and the true fear of God as the following word misport] but love edifieth. [causeth our knowledge to be used for the edification of ourselves and our neighbour. See Rom. 14. 19.]
\p
\v 2 . And if thinketh that he knoweth any thing, [Namely, without conjoining of love as before] he hath known nothing yet, as it ought to be known.
\p
\v 3 . But if any man love God, [And consequently his neighbour also of Gods sake, which two things cannot be separated, 1 John 4. 20. and chap. 5. v. 1. 2.] he is known of him. [that is, known for his, as John 10. 14. Rom. 8. 29. and for that cause also taught by him, as some take the word know. See also 1. Cor. 13. 12. and Gal, 4. 9.]
\p
\v 4 . Concerning therefore the eating of things which are offered to idols; we know that an idol is nothing in the world, [That is, is no god, nor hath any divine power to pollute meats or to hallow them: otherwise idols are also something in the world, namely, gold, silver, stones, the sun, moon, deceased men, wicked spirits and the like which the Gentiles held for Gods, but have no divine power like as they thought, wherefore also they are called vanities and lies in the word of God] and that there is no other God but one.
\p
\v 5 . For although there be also them that are called Gods [Namely by blind men who accounted such creatures or even their own fancies for Gods, Rom. 1. 21. etc.] whether in heaven or on the earth (as there be many Gods and many Lords. [namely, such feigned Gods, or else which Gods word itself calls Gods, as are the Angels and Magistrates, Psa. 8. 6, Psa. 82. 1.]
\p
\v 6 . Notwithstanding we have but one God, [Namely, who is truly and essentially the eternal God] the Father, of whom, [that is, by whose ordering and almighty power. See the like, Rom. 11. 36.] are all things, and we for him, [that is, for his service and for his glory, Prov. 16. 4. and 1 Cor. 10. 31.] and (but) one Lord, [namely, who hath absolute power and command over us and our consciences. Which the Apostle saith not to exclude the Father and Holy Ghost from it, who are also every where in the Scriptures called our Lord, but only all creatures and feigned Gods, as before he said the Father to be one God, not to exclude the son and the Holy Ghost from it, but only the creatures and feigned Gods] Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, [namely as a co-worker with his Father in all his divine works, John 1. 3. and 5. 19.] and we by him. [Hereby he understands the work of redemption]
\p
\v 7 . But in all knowledge is not: [namely, that the idol is nothing, or hath no power to defile that which is offered] but some with a conscience of the idol, [that is, with a conscience that judgeth that the idol is somewhat, and hath power to pollute the meat] even until now [that is, without having been able hitherto to be brought to another opinion] eat as (ought) that is offered to an idol: and their conscience being weak is defiled. [namely, seeing they nevertheless eat that which they hold to be defiled, and that against their judgment.]
\p
\v 8 Now meat [That is, the simple use of meat. Some take this for the words of Apostle, who should hereby instruct the strong that they may so much the better leave such meat. Others take it for the words of those themselves, who under this pretext durst eat of the Idol-sacrifice. Both agree not ill with that which followeth] maketh us not acceptable to God. For whether we eat we have no abundance, [namely, in spirituals, or in respect of acceptableness before God; so also that which followeth. See Rom. 14. 17.] and whether we eat not, we have no want.]
\p
\v 9 . But take heed that this your power [Namely, which ye have or think that ye have in the use of such meat] become not in any wife a stumbling-block [the word stumbling-block signifies sometimes a grief which a man hath for that which any one doth amiss, but here it signifies a boldness which any one takes to do like another although he thinketh that the other doth ill, as that which followeth shows] to them that are weak.
\p
\v 10 . For if any man seeth thee who hast knowledge [Namely, that an Idol is nothing, as before] sit at meat in the Idols Temple, [or as some understand this, at the Idols Table, i.e. at the feast which is kept for the honour of the Idol] Shall not the conscience of the same who is weak, be hardened [Gr. Edified, which here is taken in an ill sense] to eat the things which are offered to Idols? [namely, whereas nevertheless he reckoneth that the Idol hath defiled these things, or as the Idolaters spoke, consecrated it to himself.]
\p
\v 11 . And the brother which is weak by thy knowledge [Or for thy knowledge, i.e. by or for the abuse of thy knowledge, seeing thou dost not use it for edification, but with offence of the weak] shall perish, [namely, seeing thereby as much as in thee is, thou givest occasion to this thy weak brother by thy example, so by little and little to fall to the Idol, and to fall away from the Christian Religion, and so to perish. See the like phrase, Mat. 5. 28. Rom. 14. 15. for whom [namely, weak brother] Christ died? [namely, to keep him from destruction, and for this end also to redeem him from idolatry and his former vain conversation, 1 Pet. 1. 18. For howsoever those for whom Christ died, and whom by his death he hath truly redeemed, cannot be seduced by the seducing power of offences, Mat. 24. 24. John 10. 15, 28. Yet nevertheless they that give offence do nothing else but as much as in them is, bring such as are weak in the faith to destruction, except they were kept by the power of God and the intercession of Christ, Luke 22. 31, 32. 1 Pet. 1. 5.]
\p
\v 12 . But ye so sinning against the brethren, and wounding [Gr. Striking, which is a matter of great cruelty to make the conscience of such which is weak of itself, by striking or wounding yet weaker, and as it were kill it] their weak conscience, sin against Christ. [namely, whose members they are. See Acts 9. 4.]
\p
\v 13 . Therefore if meat [Namely, of what sort so ever it be. And the Apostle gives here a general rule, according to which the conscience of all believers must be regulated in respect of indifferent things and of the weak: but not in respect of the obstinate or willful. See Mat. 15. 12. and Gal. 2. 3. & c] offends my brother, I will never eat any flesh, lest I should offend my brother.
\c 9
\s 1. The Apostle the better to bring the Corinthians to the right use of indifferent things, sets before them his own example, and for this end he here interposeth a discourse of the maintenance of the ministers of the Church, and testifieth he as well as other Apostles had power to receive maintenance. 7. Produceth divers reasons to prove this, taken from them that serve in the warre, that plant a vineyard, and feed a flock, 9. of an ox that thresheth, 11. of a sower, 13. of them that serve the temple or altar. 15. And declareth that nevertheless he made not use of this power, neither would he use it, because he judged not this for edification amongst them, and that he might not so abuse his power, 19. but that he every way accommodated himself to weak Christians as well as Jews as Gentiles in indifferent things, the better to gain them. 24. Finally exhorts them by the similitudes of those who strive to out-run one another in the race, and that fight or wrestle, as also by his own example, sobriety and diligent progress in godliness.
\p
\v 1 Am I not an Apostle? Am I not free? [Namely, from the ceremonies of the Law, and in that regard to eat all kinds of meat which might be set before me, as well as any of the other Apostles. See a contrary example, Dan. 1. 8. and Acts 10. v. 14, 28.] have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? [namely as well as the other Apostles, when I was called to the Apostleship by him in a vision, ecstasy, and afterward by being taken up to heaven. See Acts 9. 17. 2 Cor. 12. 2.] are ye not my work in the Lord? [that is, who are converted to the Lord by my ministry.]
\p
\v 2 . If I am not an Apostle unto others, notwithstanding I am unto you: [That is notwithstanding, ye have no reason to doubt thereof] for the seal of mine Apostleship [that is, the confirmation that I am truly an Apostle, forasmuch as ye were converted by my ministry, and God hath confirmed my calling among you by many miracles and signs 2. Cor. 12. 12.] mare ye in the Lord.
\p
\v 3 . My defense to those that make enquiry concerning me [Or, who examine me, or condemn me, i.e. who dare as judges take upon them to judge me] is this.
\p
\v 4 . Have we not power to eat and drink? [Namely, as the cost and charge of the Church.]
\p
\v 5 . Have we not power to lead about (with us) [Namely, from one place to another where we go to preach, at the costs of the Church] a wife being a sister, [Gr. A sister a woman or a wife. Some think from hence that the Apostle had a wife, but that he did not lead her all about with him, that he might not burden the Churches. But this seems to be repugnant to that which he saith of himself. 1 Cor. 7. 7. Others think that hereby are understood certain women which followed the Apostle to serve them, and to provide for them of their means, as the women who followed Christ, Luke 8. 3. But besides this that we read this no where, so neither is it likely to be true. For hereby the Apostle should have rendered their ministry suspected, and the Churches should have been eased hereby, whereas the Apostle evidently brings in this to show that he would not burden the Churches herewith. So that this therefore is to be understood of a wife, not which he had, but which he might have taken, and consequently also have led with him, as some other Apostles did] as also the other Apostles, and the brothers of the lord, [that is, cousins Hebr. For John and James, and also Judas and Simon were Christ’s cousin-Germans or mother’s sisters sons. See Gen. 13. 8. and 29. 15. Mat. 12. 46. and 13. 55.] and Cephas? [that is, Peter, of whose wife we read Mat. 8. 14.]
\p
\v 6 . Or have not I and Barnabas only, power of not working? [Namely, with our hands for our maintenance. See Acts 18. 3. and 20. 34.]
\p
\v 7 . Who ever serve in the war at his own charges? Who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of its fruit? Or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?
\p
\v 8 . Speak I this according to man? [That is, do I prove this only with reasons which are taken from the doings of men?] or saith not the Law [namely, written by Moses] the same also?
\p
\v 9 . For it is written in the Law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle a threshing Ox. [In those countries as also in others, men beat not the corn out of the ears with flails as they do here, but they cause beasts, especially oxen to go over it, and so tread the same, and trample it loose out of its ears, and draw the threshing wagon over it. See Deut. 25. 4. Isa. 28. 27, 28.] Doth God also take care for Oxen? [namely, chiefly, or more than for men, when he made this Law. For otherwise there is not so much as a Sparrow forgotten before the Lord. See Mat. 10. 29. So that this is to be understood comparatively, that God made this Law more for men than for oxen, to give us to understand, that if God will not have men to withhold his food from the labouring ox, that much less ought we to withhold the same from men which labour.]
\p
\v 10 . Or saith be (it) altogether for our sake? For our sakes (that) is written: for as much as he that plougheth must plough in hope: [Namely, of enjoying the fruit of his labour afterwards] and he that thresheth in hope, (must) be partaker of his hope.
\p
\v 11 . If we have sown unto you that which is spiritual, [Namely, I and Barnabas have published unto the word of God. See Rom. 15.27.] it is a great (matter) if we reap yours is that corporal? [Gr. Carnal, i.e. the good things which serve for the sustention of our bodies.
\p
\v 12 . If others [Namely, ordinary teachers, which we have left there to finish after us the work that is begun] be partakers of this power over you (why) not we much rather? Yet we have not used this power: but we bear all, that we may not give hindrance to the Gospel of Christ. [Namely, partly because of the unbelievers, who for fear of the changes might have shunned the word: partly because of certain false Apostles, which might have slandered Paul as if he preached the Gospel for maintainance sake, whereas they would seem to do the same for nothing, that so they might draw the Churches to them. See 2 Cor. 11. ver.13.]
\p
\v 13 . Know ye not that they that administer the holy things [Such as we ill the Levites in the Old Testament, who therefore receives the tenths, and had their part in that which was offered, See Numb. 18. Deut. 18.] eat of that which is holy (and) they that are continually by the alter, [Gr. Sit continually by the alter. As were the Priests the posterity of Aaron, which received the tithes also of the tithes of the Levites, and had a special part in all sacrifices, except those which must be wholly burnt before the Lord. Num. 18. ver.26. etc.] partake with the alter. [seeing one part was burnt upon the alter and consumed by them, and another was kept for the Priests.]
\p
\v 14 . So also the Lord ordained, [He hath respect here to Christ ordinance, Mat. 10.10. Luke. 10.7.] that they which publish the Gospel should live of the Gospel. That is, of the labour which they take in preaching of the Gospel, and governing of the Church.]
\p
\v 15 . But I have used none of these things: [Namely, among you, although the other Churches he sometimes received the liberality, 2 Cor. 11.8.] and I have not written this, that it should be done unto me: for it were beer for me [Gr. Good rather to dye, i.e. more advised or epidient] to dye, [namely, for want] then that any one would make this my glorying vain. [namely, namely of having preached the Gospel among you without offence, and without your costs. The reason hereof see before ver.12.]
\p
\v 16 . If I publish the Gospel, it is no glorying to me: [that is, I do nothing but I ought to do, Luke 1 10.] for necessity is laid upon me. [or, necessity lies upon me. Namely, by my calling and Christs command, vm. 1.14.] and woe to me [Gr. Woe is me, i.e. the punishment is ready for me which Christ had threaten to the unfaithful servant, Mat. 24.48. etc. Not the Apostle doubted whether he should continue faithful in his ministry, but this he said, by such spurs more and more to stir up both himself and others, diligence and prudence in their ministry] if I preach in the Gospel.
\p
\v 17 . F if I do that willingly [That is, gladly, and with due care and diligence, without regarding the judgment of Men, Rom. 12. ver.11.] I have reward: [namely, the crown of glory which is of grace, promised by the Lord to the faithful and diligence servants, Mat. 24.46. 2 Tim. 4.ver.7, 8. and the glory of faithfulness in this life against the false Apostles] but if willingly [this, only for fear of punishment, or to have honour and profit with men: as hirelings and slaves use to for their masters] the dispensation is (nevertheless) inbred into me. [namely, to give account thereof hereafter.]
\p
\v 18 . What reward have I then? [I have first reward to expect from the Lord, if I do it with diligence and faithfulness, respecting only the glory of God, and the greatest edification of the Church, without hope of reward of men. And seeing I have observed that the receiving of reward from men would give offence, and hinder edification and course of the Gospel, therefore I would not receive it: and for that I may glory unto you, but not unto God. See Rom.3.27. and 4.2. 2 Cor.11.10.] (namely) that I publishing the Gospel, might make the Gospel of Christ (to be) without cost, not to abuse [that is, to use with offence, and with approach of the false Apostles, v.15,] my power [namely, which I have taken to the fitting maintenance] in the Gospel.
\p
\v 19 . For when I was free from ad; [Namely, burdens and yokes, from whence the Christian and Apostolic liberty makes us free. The Apostle therefore proceeds from this point, wherein for edification sake he did not use his liberty, unto more other points, wherein he likewise did not use the same, the more to convince the Corinthians, that according to his example they ought to do the like, and not use they liberty to the scandal and hindrance of the course of the Gospel] I have made myself bondman of all, [that is, I have condescend to every ones weakness, or as a servant must always carry himself according to the condition and inclination of him who serves. But this must always be understood in indifferent things. So also ver.22.] that I might gain [that is, bring to faith in Christ. See the like phrase, 1 Pet. 3.1.] the more.
\p
\v 20 . And to the Jews I became as a Jew, [Namely, in things which were indifferent, as then the observation of the ceremonies of the Old Testament with weak Jews yet was: as for their sake he caused Timothy to be circumcised; caused his head to be shorn at Cennchrea by a vow, and at Jerusalem purified himself in the Temple] that I might the Jews: to them that are under the Law [namely, of the ceremonies which was then abolished by Christ’s suffering, as much as concerned that which was religious therein: but was yet born for a time as a thing indifferent, not to estrange the weak Jews. See Acts 21.20.] (I became) as being under the Law, that I might gain them that are under the Law.
\p
\v 21 To them that are without the Law, [That is, the Gentiles, who had not the ceremonial Law, neither were bound to use it, according to the decree of the Apostles, Acts 16.28. and 21.25.] I became as being without the Law, (nevertheless) not being without the Law, to God, but under the Law to Christ, [this he adds that no man might misconstrue that which he had said before, that he had been as without the Law, seeing in all that he did, he had always before his eyes the Law and commands of Christ in bearing of the weak, in shunning of the offences, Gal.6.2.] that I might gain them that are without the Law.
\p
\v 22 . I became to the weak [Namely, Christians or believers, who indeed embraced the foundation of the Christian faith, but as for that which concerns Christian liberty, could not yet in all things comprehend it, Rom. 14.1. Gal. 6.2.] as weak, that I might gain the weak: I became all things to all, that I might surely save some. [hereby he expounds that which before he called to gain. See 1 Tim. 4.16.]
\p
\v 23 . And this I do for the Gospels sake, that I might also be partaker of the same. [That is, that not only others might be saved by my preaching, but that I my self might be co-partner of this salvation: which would not be, if I do not myself that which I teach others.
\p
\v 24 . Know ye not [From henceforward the Apostle teacheth, that they should be so farre from being very much troubled by meat and drink, or feast of Idolaters, that they must much rather be careful to exercise themselves in all soberness, temperance and forbearance, which he proves by the examples of those that strives for a prize, and also by his own example] that they that run in the race [namely, for a prize] run all indeed, but (that) one receiveth the prize? [namely, who do not without others begin well, but before others ends well] So run [that is, so diligently and constantly even unto the end] that ye may obtain (it.) [or apprehend, namely, the proposed prize of God, Phil.3.v.12,13,14.]
\p
\v 25 And every one that striveth (for a prize,) [Namely, by wrestling, running or fighting, as among the ancients there were such sorts of striving for the prize] containeth himself in all things. [or, moderates himself, namely, from much meat, drink or other things, which make him slow or unapt in this strife] These then (do these) indeed, that they might receive a corruptible crown, [namely, of laurels, olive-branches, oaken-leaves, and the like, or at the highest of silver or gold, such as were propounded to those that strove for a prize]but we an incorruptible. [that is, unperishing, or everlasting, 1 Pet. 1.4.]
\p
\v 26 . I run so therefore, not as at an uncertainty, [Namely, like as these fighters or runners for a prize do, who do not know whether they shall get the prize or no, 2 Tim. 4.7, 8.] so fight I, not as beating the air. [namely, as they do, who do not know to fight or strive in good earnest, but only fight with a shadow, and exercise themselves against the air, from whence happens no victory over the adversary: which we must do in earnest against sin and the Devil, Eph. 6.11.]
\p
\v 27 .But I constrain my body, [The Greek signifies to strike under the eyes of the eyes by blows, to tame or bring under his obedience. See of this word also, Luke 18.5.] and bring it into bondage, [namely, to subdue the same to the spirit, and not to oppress the spirit by too much or by too great delicacy] left by any means when I have preached to others, [namely, to bring them to salvation] I my self should be refuseable. [that is, make my self unfit or incapable of the prize whereunto I incite and stir up others: whereby the Apostle meaneth that he is uncertain of his election, and of obtaining the prize, for the contrary appears clearly, Rom. 8.v.38. 2 Tim. 4.v.7, 8. but this is a similitude taken from the same striving for the prize, wherein the slow or lazy, who had too much fed themselves, were rejected, and disallowed as unfit for it.]
\c 10
\s I The Apostle declares that all the Israelites in the wilderness were baptized in the cloud and in the sea, 3 and that they did all eat the same spiritual meat, and drink the same spiritual drink, 5 but that nevertheless they were punished by God, 7 when they fell to idolatry, 8 or to fornication, 9 and when they tempted Christ, 10 or murmured against him. 11 Testifieth that this for our warning not to commit such sins 13 Promiseth concerning it Gods help in temptation, and a good issue 14 Exhorts them again to flee from idolatry, 15 seeing by the use of the Lords Supper they have communion in the body and blood of Christ: but by Idolatry with Devils, whose Tables therefore must avoid, 22. and under no pretext provoke God, or give offence to the neighbor, 25 notwithstanding permiteth to eat without question whatsoever is set before us, except any one gives us notice of it. 31. And concludes this discourse with a general exhortation to do all things for Gods glory, and the edification of our neighbhour.
\p
\v 1 AND I will not brethren that ye be ignorant that our Fathers [Namely, who came out of Egypt with Moses ] were all under the cloud, [namely, which interposed it self betwixt the army of the Egyptians and of the Israelites, and which bedewed and descended the Israelites, when they went through the red sea, Exod. 14.19. etc. Psalm 105.39. Which Paul here testifieth to have been antitype of our baptism, like as Peter speaks of deliverance of Noah in the Ark, out of the midst of the flood, 1 Pet. 21.] and all passed through the sea:
\p
\v 2 . And were all baptized into Moses [That is, by Moses, or by the ministry of Moses; or in the doctrine of Moses, as is said in Acts 19.3. that some were baptized in the baptism of John, i.e. in the doctrine of John, which was confirmed by his baptism] in the cloud, and in the sea.
\p
\v 3 . And did all eat the same [Namely, in the signs, which signified one and the same thing: and that not only with another, but also with us: which appears from thence that Paul here useth the name Baptism, and afterwards saith that the Rock was Christ: and for that otherwise Paul’s conclusion should not be firm, except they had one kind of meat with us in respect of the signification] spiritual meat: [namely, the Manna, which is called a spiritual meat, because it served the Israelites, not only for corporal food, but also to be for an extraordinary sign of the flesh of Christ, and in that respect had a spiritual relation unto Christ, as Christ at large declares, John 6. and as afterwards for the same reason the rock is called spiritual.]
\p
\v 4 . And did all drink the same spiritual drink. For they drank of the spiritual rock which [Namely, rock] followed; [i.e. by the streams or brook flowed from thence, after that it was stricken by Moses, Numb. 20.8,11. Psalm 105.41.] and the rock was Christ. [that is, was a sign and a type of Christ, who being by the Father smitten to death for our sake, should yield forth unto us the streams of the living water, John 7.38. And this is a phrase usual in the Sacrament as the bread and wine of the Lords Supper are called the body and blood of Christ, because they are a sign and seal thereof. What some would say, that the sense should be Christ was the rock, is repugnant not only to the words of the text, but also unto the thing its self, forasmuch as all the Israelites to have drunk of Christ, seeing many of them believed not, and God as not well-pleased with them, ver.5. and Heb. 4.2.]
\p
\v 5 . But in the greater things (part) of them God took no pleasure, for they were smitten in the witness. [Namely, because of their unbelief, as Paul clares Heb. 3.ver.17,18,19.]
\p
\v 6 . And these things happened for types of us, [That is, for examples, and warnings. Namely that if we follow after such like sins, notwithstanding we shall also have been partakers of these holy signs, either shall we escape the same punishment, which can upon them for the same. See of this word ver.11 Phil. 3.17. 1 Tim. 2.7.] that we should have no lust unto evil. [Gr. Should be no desires of evil things. Namely, of idolatry, fornication, and such ill which are related afterwards] like as they had lust.
\p
\v 7 . And be no idolaters, like as some of them That is, a great part of them, namely, those that committed idolatry with the molten calf] as it is written, people set down to eat and drink, and they rose up to pl. [that is, to dance, laugh, and caper, as the idolats after their Idolatrous feasts, commonly used to do Exod. 32.6.]
\p
\v 8 . And let us not commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, [Namely, in the air of the Midianites, by the counsel of Balaam being enticed unto Idolatry and fornication, Numb. 25.] d fell in one day three and twenty thousand. [Numb. 25.9. it is said four and twenty thousand. But it may be that there were killed betwixt three and four and twenty thousand, of which the Apostle kept the lesser number. Others think that there were three and twenty thousand slain with the sword, after the example of the zeal of Phineas, and that the other thousand of the chiefest were afterwards by the command of Moses.]
\p
\v 9 . And let us not tempt Christ, [That is, provoke him, or call in question his power to punish the unthankfull, as the Israelites, Numb. 21.5. when they were not content with the Manna, nor with the waters, which the Lord miraculously afforded them: and like as the Corinthians, who rather followed the feasts of Idolaters which were full of offence and danger, then a simple food which the Lord afforded them at home] as some of them also attempted, [namely, Christ, whom he had named immediately before. For it was the Angel of the Covenant, the eternal son of God, who guided them in the wilderness, and whom they provoked. See Exod. 14.19. and 23. and Esa. 63.9.] and were destroyed of the serpents
\p
\v 10 . And murmur ye not, as some of them also murmured, [The Israelites many times murmured against God in the wilderness, when they wanted anything, or when they were not content with the benefits which God gave them. But here respect is had especially to those events. Numb. 11.4.33. when they desired flesh, and were therefore by God destroyed with several plagues, and Numb. 16.1,2. when Corah with his company murmured against Moses and Aaron, and some were burnt, some sunk into the earth] and were consumed by the destroyer. [this name is not found indeed in this history, but is added by Paul, either hereby to understand the severity of God himself in these punishments, or any Angel which God made use of for this destruction, as he did, Exod. 12.23. and Esa. 27.36.]
\p
\v 11 . And all these things came upon them for types: [That is, examples of judgment upon such. See v.6.] and are written for warning of us, on whom the end of ages [that is, the last times, in which the grace of God is more powerfull, and weakedness greater. Wherefore we must by the grace of God take the more heed to our selves, 1 Tim. 4.1. 2 Pet.3.3.] are come [Gr. Meet, or are met.]
\p
\v 12 . So then he that thinketh to stand [That is, he that conceits himself to be firm in faith, he that could not fall into such sins] let him take heed that he do not fall. [that is, let him be careful that thereby he be not brought to a fall, to commit those sins and offences for which God punished the Israelites. From whence appears that the Apostle doth not exhort believers to doubt of their salvation, contrary to his own doctrine, Rom. 5.1. and 8.31. but that he warns the self-conceited only, not to depend upon themselves, and to shun the occasions whereby they might be brought to fall. For weak believers when out of weakness they may fall, have the promise of being raised up again. See Psalm 37.24. and the following verse here.]
\p
\v 13 . No temptation [Namely, whereby ye are brought to the communion of the Idolaters and their feasts] hath taken you, but humane: [namely, which sprung from your humane infirmity and from fear of the displeasure of the Idolaters, who have requested you thereunto. Herewith he comforts them, and exhorts them to more constancy for the future, seeing God maketh us this promise, that he will not let his be tempted above their power] but God is faithful who will not ye be tempted, above that you are able, [that is, above the power which ye have already received by Gods Spirit. For of our selves we were able to do nothing, John 15.ver.15. 2 Cor. 3.5. Phil. 4.13.] but he shall with the temptation [namely, which he shall suffer to come upon you, although they were much greater then hitherto have happened, John 16.33.] give [Gr. Make] also the issue, that ye may be able to bear them.
\p
\v 14 . Therefore [That is, seeing then that we have these examples of Gods judgment on the one side, and of Gods faithful promise on the other side] my beloved flee from Idolatry. [namely, not only that which is such indeed, but also that which might give inducement to, or suspicion of it, or which is a sign thereof: of which he hitherto spoken.]
\p
\v 15 . I speak as unto understanding (person) [that is, as to them that are expert and informed in the mysteries, of our faith] judge that which I say.
\p
\v 16 . The cup of thanksgiving [Or, the cup of blessing. But seeing the Apostle hereafter chap. 11.24. useth the word to give thanks or thank, as also the Evangelists, Mat. 26.27. Mark 14, 23 Luke 22.17. therefore this word thanksgiving is retained also here in the text] which we (giving thanks) do bless [Gr. Eulogoumen, which word signifies both to bless, and give thanks, Yet must here be translated bless, and not give thanks, forasmuch as it cannot be said that we give thanks the cup, as the Gr. Conjuction or construction of the words would require; but will bless the cup. And by this blessing is understood, not by force of any words to change the wine into the essential blood of Christ, but by prayer, thanksgiving, and rehearsing of the institution and end of the Holy Supper, to consecrate, or separate from other common drink, and appropriate it to the holy use, as the word bless is also used, Gen. 2.3. Exod. 20.11. where God is said to have blessed and hallowed the seventh day, because he separated it from the common days, and appropriated it to a holy use. See the exposition hereof in the annotation on Mat. 26.26.] is it not a communion of the blood of Christ? [that is, a sign and a pledge of the spiritual communion which we have with Christ’s body and blood, as ver 18. is said that the Israelites had communion with the alter, and ver.20. that they that ate Idol-sacrifices had communion with divels. A phrase usual in the Sacraments, see ver.4. and 1 Cor. 11.24.25.] the bread that we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
\p
\v 17 . For (it is) one bread, [Namely, that is broken, and in which we have communion. Or, for we many are one bread, and one body] (so) so are we many one body: [that is, one spiritual body, whereof Christ is the head. See Rom. 12.5. 1 Cor. 6.15. and 12.12 etc.] seeing we are all partakers of one bread.
\p
\v 18 . Behold Israel which is after the flesh: [that is, the people of the Jews, descended from Israel according to the flesh, which at that time had still their temple and worship; although the virtue of it was made void by the coming of Christ] have not they which eat the sacrifices, communion with the alter? [that is, with the worship which was used by them upon the alter and about the same, and which they thereby testified that they still approved.]
\p
\v 19 . What say I therefore? That an Idol is ought? Or that the Idol-sacrifice is ought?
\p
\v 20 . Yea (I say) that that which the Gentiles offer, they offer to devils, [For many of the Gentiles Gods which they honoured by their images were wicked spirit. See Levit. 17.7. and Deut. 32.17. And although sometimes they would thereby honour some deceased men and other creatures, or else the Creator of heaven and earth himself, as may be seen Acts 17.23. Rom1.21. yet nevertheless they are said to give that homour to devils, because the devil was the inspire and institutor of such image-worship, whereby God was not honoured but dishonoured. Esa. 40.8.] and not to God. And I will not that ye have communion with devils.
\p
\v 21 . Ye cannot [Namely, rightly and duly so that ye would please God. See the like phrase, Mat. 6.14.] drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of the Devil: ye cannot be partakers of the Table of the Lord, [that is, of the meat and drink of the Lords table, which is received by Christians for a sign of communion with Christ] and of the table of the Devils. [that is, of the meat and drink of the feasts, which is received for a sign of communion with Devils.]
\p
\v 22 . Or do we provoke the Lord? [That is, will we stir him up to our doings, and consequently bring his judgment upon our heads, Deu. 32.21. the Greek word properly signifies, stir him up to jealousy] Are we stronger then he? [namely, to keep off his punishing hand from us, when that shall strike us.]
\p
\v 23 . All things [Namely, which are indifferent in themselves, not forbidden by God in the New Testament, as among other things was the eating of all sorts of meat, when it could be done without offence. The Apostle now forwards treats of two other cases, which with certain limitations he permits in that which follows] are lawful for me, but all things are not profitable: [namely, for myself] all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not. [namely, my neighbour.]
\p
\v 24 . Let no man seek that which is his own [Namely, only or with the hurt and disadvantage of his neighbour, Ro. 13. v. 6.] but let every one (seek) that which is another’s. [that is, seek also that which is another’s, for we must love our neighbour as our selves: we may then indeed love our selves also, but not contrary to the love of our neighbour.]
\p
\v 25 . Eat all [That is, all sorts. Here then in the first place the Apostle permits, that whatsoever cometh to the market may be used for meat by us, although nevertheless it many times comes to pass, that part of that which was offered to idols, is sold there also, when it is not used in feasts or sacrifices. But when it is brought to the market or into the shambles, the Idol is then no more honoured therewith, but it is accounted common meat] that is sold in the shambles, questioning nothing [ or making no difference, namely, whether it were sacrificed before or not: for the Greek word signifieth both] for conscience sake.
\p
\v 26 . For the earth is the Lord’s, [That is, although before it was abused by idolaters, yet it ceaseth not to abide a creature of the Lord’s, who hath created it to be used with thanksgiving, 1 Tim. 4. 4.] and the fullness of the same.
\p
\v 27 . And if any one of the unbelievers invite you, [Namely, to his house, the feast not being made for the honour of the Idol, as the Gentiles often used the remainder of such sacrificed beasts, or meats, for private and civil feasts] and ye will go (thither) [that is, hold it expedient to go, to maintain civil communion or neighbourhood, whereby the Apostle gives to understand, that before men go thither they should also weigh well wherefore they are invited thither] eat all [that is, of all things] that is set before you, questioning nothing [or making no difference ] for conscience sake.
\p
\v 28 . But if any one [Namely, of the weak believers, which might be offended thereby: or else of the unbelievers who sits at meat with thee, and thereby might look upon thee for a man which went without religion or of their heathenish religion, if thou being admonished shouldst nevertheless eat therefore] saith unto thee, that is idol sacrifice, eat (it) not for his sake who gave (thee) notice of (it) and (for) conscience sake. For the Earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof . [this same place taken out of Psa. 24. the Apostle here again produceth, to show that men may well leave such meat, seeing there are more meats which God hath created upon earth for our use.]
\p
\v 29 . But I say (for) conscience not of thine own self, but of the other. [Namely, who gives the warning of this, and is offended thereby, for the reason before rehearsed] For why is my liberty judged [that is, why shall I by the scandalous use of liberty, give occasion that another’s conscience should condemn mine action or reproach the same. Or seeing I know from God’s word that this is now free to me, why shall I subject the judgment of my conscience to the judgment of another’s conscience who is yet weak, or suffer myself to be reproached by such a one: it is enough for me that I omit the eating of such meat for that time for their sakes, and nevertheless retain the liberty in my mind, to do this at another time without offence, and to thank God for it] of another’s conscience.
\p
\v 30 . And if I by grace [Namely, of the Gospel, in which Christ hath set us free from the yoak of ceremonies and the difference of meats] am partaker (of the meat) why am I reproached for that for which I give thanks?
\p
\v 31 . Whether therefore ye eat, or whether ye drink, or whether ye do anything (else) do it all for the glory of God.
\p
\v 32 . Be without giving offence, both to the Jews and to the Greeks, and to the Church of God. [Under these three sorts the Apostle comprehends all men, who were either Jews, or Gentiles, or Christians, non of which must be offended by us, by the use of liberty: which is to be understood if they be such persons, of whom we have hope that they may thereby be gained by us.]
\p
\v 33 . Even as I also please all [That is, seek to please. This must be understood as the former, namely, in respect of the use or omission of our Christian liberty, not in respect of doctrine or other things which are commanded or forbidden of God. See Gal. 1. v. 8, 10,] in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the (profit) of many, that they may be saved.
\c 11
\s 1. The Apostle exhorts the Corinthians to imitate him, and praiseth them that they kept his institutions. 3. Reforms certain abuses which were found in their assemblies: first that in praying and prophesying the men had their heads covered, and the women uncovered, 4. which he proves to be unseemly, both for the men because they are the head of the women, and for the men because they are the head of the women, and for the women, who seeing they are subject to the man, for a token thereof ought to cover their heads: or otherwise that both men and women dishonour their head, 14. and do contrary to nature. 18. Afterward that there were divisions in their assemblies. 20. and moreover that the Lords supper was not rightly observed amongst them, forasmuch as the rich in particular kept feasts beforehand, whereby some came drunk to the Lords supper, 23. to reform which abuses he sets before them the institution of the Lord ’s Supper and the signification of the same, 26. and teacheth to what end and to what manner it must be held, 29. and what judgments they are to expect, and were already sent by God upon some of them who did not use the same aright. 33. Finally be teacheth how they shall amend those abuses.
\p
\v 1 Be imitators of me, even as I also of Christ. [Namely, am an imitator, namely, who is the most perfect pattern of all virtues; so that men indeed must imitate their teachers, but so far forth as they imitate Christ,]
\p
\v 2 . And I praise you brethren that ye are mindful of me in all things, [Or that ye remember all my things, i.e. doctrines and exhortations] and keep the institutions [Gr. Traditions, or delivering-over, whereby then are understood as he himself afterward declares, some ordinances of his, not which are articles of faith, but which concerned the outward form which ought to be observed in the assemblies, and exercises of God’s worship] as I delivered (them) over unto you.
\p
\v 3 . But I will that ye should know, [That is, that ye mark the order of subjection which God hath appointed amongst men, in his spiritual body, that ye may do nothing repugnant to the same] that Christ is the head [that is, set over him, having dominion over him, as the head is above and over the members] of every man: [namely, belonging to his spiritual body: for of those he properly treats here. Not that he is not also the head of the woman, for he is the head of the whole body, Eph. 5. 23.] and the man the head of the woman: and God the head of Christ. [namely, God the Father, under whom the Son of God Jesus Christ stands, not in respect of his divine nature, according to which is equal to the Father in dignity and highness, John 10. 30. Phil. 2. 6. but in respect of his mediator-ship, according to which he hath subjected himself to the Father for our sakes, and is less than the Father, John 14. 28. as an Ambassador amongst men, as such, is less than him that sends him: although by nature they are equal.]
\p
\v 4 . Every man that prayeth [That is, that either makes the public prayer in the assemblies, or heareth and joins in prayer] or prophecyeth [ or readeth and expoundeth the writings of the Prophets in the assemblies, 1. Cor. 14. v. 3, 29. & c. or foretells some future things by divine revelation. For that gift was then given by God to some for the comfort of the church, 1 Cor. 14. 26. Eph. 4. 11. Or he that heareth such expositions in the congregations] having (ought) on his head [namely, any covering, as is long hair, v. 14. or a hat, veil or the like, v. 7. as the Gentiles used to worship their Idols with covered heads. See Virgil. Aneid. 3. Sueton. In Vitell.] he dishonours his head. [namely, forasmuch as the uncovering of the head was then a sign of power and dominion, as on the contrary now at this day those that have power over others, will keep their heads covered, and they that are under others will uncover their heads before them. But in all these things, we must always have respect to the use of divers times and countries and what is honourable and edifying therein, 1 Cor. 14. 40. Phil. 4. 8.]
\p
\v 5 . But every woman, [Namely, which is married and is subject to the power of her husband. See v. 3. although the rest are not here excluded] which prayeth or prophecyeth [that is, which in the assembly heareth the public prayers, or the exposition of the writings of the Prophets: For that a woman should make prayers openly in the assembly, or expound the Scripture is forbidden her, 1 Cor. 14. v, 34, 35, 1 Tim. 2. 12. Or who being endued with extraordinary gifts of prayer or foretelling things future, will propound them in the congregation, being moved thereunto by divine inspiration. See Joel 2. 28. Luke 2. 36. Acts 21. 9.] with an uncovered head, dishonoureth her head; [or shameth her head, causeth shame to her head, namely, because by that sign it seemeth she would deny that she is subject to her husband: and also in some sort that Christ is not the head of his church. See v. 4.] for it is one and the same [namely, of all one unseemliness, namely, if she lay aside the artificial covering, it is as much as if they should lay aside the natural covering] as if (her) hair were cut off.
\p
\v 6 . For if a woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: [That is, it is even as much, and even as shameful as if she were shorn] but if it be ugly for a woman to be shorn [namely, with sheers] or to have her hair cut off, [namely, with a razor] let her cover herself.
\p
\v 7 . For the man must not cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image, [Namely, in respect of his power and dominion which he hath over the woman. For otherwise in respect of holiness and righteousness the woman was created after the image of God as well as the man; Gen. 1. 26, 27.] and glory of God: [namely, because in the mans dominion over the woman, God makes appear the glory and command that he hath over his creatures] but the woman is the glory of the man. [namely, because the womans subjection under man is an argument of the power, authority and excellency of man above the woman.]
\p
\v 8 . For the man is not of the woman, [Namely, at first created by God. See Gen. 2.21,22. Otherwise now according to the course of nature, are born of women, Job. 14.1. See also the 12 verse] but the woman of the man.
\p
\v 9 . For neither was the man created for the woman, [Namely, to be subject to her and serve to her] but the woman of the man. [namely, to be subject to him for his service, and to be a help which should be with him, Gen. 2 18.]
\p
\v 10 . Therefore must the woman have a power on her head [That is, a covering, for a sign that she is subject to the power and command of the man. See Gen. 24.65. A phrase whereby the name of the thing signified is ascribed to the sign, which is also very usual in the Sacraments] because of the Angels. [this some understood of the teachers of the church, which in the Scripture are also called Angels, i.e. messengers, or Ambassadors of God, Mal. 2.7. Rev. 1.20. But many more fitly be understood of the ministering spirits, who by reason of their office are very where properly called Angels. For seeing they are present in the assembles of the faithful, Psalm. 34.8 and Mat. 18.10. and are grieved by all disorderliness or indecency which might be practiced there, therefore the apostle admonisheth the women that they ought also to reverence these holy spirits, that they may not grieve them herein.]
\p
\v 11 . Nevertheless either is the man without the woman, nor woman without the man [This Apostle adds, that because of this dominion, neither the men might wax proud, or the women be grieved] in the Lord. [namely, Jesus Christ with who in respect of his grace and merits, the women have communion as well as the men. See Gal. 3.28.]
\p
\v 12 . For as woman is of the man, [See v.8.] so also is the man by the woman, [namely, for as much as he conceived and born of a woman according to the natural birth. Wherefore also he ought not to despise the woman, but to have her in honour, and love her, although he have dominion over her] but all things (are) of God. [that is, as the women as the men are both created by God: and as well the subject of the wife as the wife as the dominion of the man, are both ordained of God. Otherwise it is true also in general, that all creatures are of God. See Rom. 11.v.36. 1 Cor. 8.6.]
\p
\v 13 . judge ye among your selves: Or judge ye with your selves. Gr. In your selves. The Apostle will show that this thing which he here presseth is so clear and known, that he will even make the Corinthians themselves judge thereof, as 1 Cor. 10.15.] is it comely that a woman pray to God uncovered?
\p
\v 14 . Or doth not even nature itself teach you, [Namely, which amongst other things hath also thereby, distinguished the female sex from male, that the hair of women grows longer and closer then men, and that the same serves her for an ornament and covering] that if a man wear a long hair, it is a dishonour to him? [namely, because this long hair on his head is a covering, and a sign of subjection, whereas he is the head of the woman; and therefore ought not to wear such a sign, whereby he seemeth to deny his dominion. Withal all because so he doth as it were transfer himself into a woman, wearing an ornament which is proper to women, and so as it were denies his sex, which God forbade in the law, Deu. 22.5.]
\p
\v 15 . But if a woman wear long hair that it is an dishonour to her? Because the long hair is given her for covering. [Gr. A thing to cast about. Namely, to serve her for covering, and consequently also for a sign of subjection, which therefore is an honour for her, that she thereby acknowledgeth that her subjection is according to the ordinance of God.]
\p
\v 16 . But if any man seems to be desirous of contention, [or to love the strive i.e. who would yet dispute much against this thing and reasons, we will not contend any further with him] we have not such a custom [namely, to contend about things which are so clear and notorious] nor the churches of God. [whose example of custom in such things ought in equity to be followed.]
\p
\v 17 . Now is [Namely, that which followeth] (that which) I say unto you) [or, relate, mention, declare] I praise not, (namely) that ye come together, not for the better, but for the worse. [that is, not for bettering, but for making you worse. For assembles appointed for this purpose, that believers may therein be edified and bettered: which is not don when things unseemingly are practiced in them.]
\p
\v 18 . For first when ye come together in the Church [That is, in the assembles of the faithful, which then were not yet kept in the Churches, as they have now, but in house and other convenient places] I hear [of whom he had heard it declareth, 1 Cor. 1.11.] that they are schisms among you: [schism is, when amongst the members of one Church, being one in point of doctrine, and in the grounds of the same, disunion and division ariseth because of other misunderstandings, each party following his head and leader, whereby the unity of Christ’s body is rent and broken: which is also numbered amongst the works of the flesh, Gal. 5.20. see more largely hereafter, 1 Cor. 1.10.] and I believe in part. [namely, seeing I know the pride and contentiousness of some among you.]
\p
\v 19 . For there must also [Namely, forasmuch as there shall always be the course of heresies, as pride, arrogance, ambition and boldness of some men, who are thereby carried on to raise up and adhere to heresies. So long as there shall be such men, there must be heresies. See the like phrase, and further exposition thereof, Mat. 18.7.] be heresies, [herein, is a contention arising about doctrine, when any stifneckedly urge and embrace any errors, repugnant to the fundamentals of saving the doctrine. So that heresies is worse and more harmful then schism. And thereby the Apostle gives the reason why he believes that there are schisms among them, because there was also yet evil found amongst them, namely, heresy, which he after describes and confutes, 1 Cor. 15.] among. [that is, in the midst of the Church. See Acts 20.30. 1 John 2.19.] that those that are sincere [Gr. They that are approved, i.e. they that are in the trial by schisms and heresies, continue in the unity of the Church, and in sound doctrine, and so are found to be sincere: a similitude taken from gold that in the trial by fire abides, 1 Pet. 1.ver.7.] may be made manifest among you. [that is, known to be upright. When the Church is in peace without schism or heresy, all the profess Religion are accounted upright: but when there ariseth schism and heresy, then it is manifest and notorious who abide steadfast in the unity of the Church, and in the soundness of the doctrine or not: as the chaffer is separated from the corn by the fan, Mat.3.12.]
\p
\v 20 . When therefore ye come together in one, (that) [Namely, that which ye do] is not to eat the Lords Supper. [namely, forasmuch as unlawful eating, is as not eating. Or, forasmuch as this is not to eat the Lords; but our own supper, as in the following verse.]
\p
\v 21 . For in eating [This is to be understood of eating of some meat which the rich brought with them when the Lords supper was to be held, to keep a feast therewith afterwards with the poor, which feasts in the Greek were called Agapai, i.e. love-feast. See hereof, Jud. Ver.12.] every one [namely, of the rich without of the poor. Or every one with those that held with them] taketh before [namely, before the poor are come to them. Or before the Lords supper is held] his own supper. [that is, a supper which is not held in common of the whole Church; as the Lords supper must be held, but which is held privately by some alone, with excluding of others] and this man is hungry, because they will not wait for them, and the rich are drunk, because they oftentimes so entertained one another before at those feasts, that they were drunk.]
\p
\v 22 . Have ye therefore no house [In ye can eat before; and assuage your hunger, without doing this openly in the places of assembles. See ver. 34] to eat and drink there? Or despise ye the Church of God [that is, do ye not care of the offences which thereby arise in the Church?] and do ye shame them who have not? [that is, the poor who could bring nothing to such feasts, which either ye will not admit to the same, or will not for them, or so openly show that ye despise them] what shall I say to you? In this I praise (you) not. [that is, in these abuses of the Lords supper I cannot justify you, or praise you as having done well.
\p
\v 23 . For I have [The Apostle to amend these abuses, sets them the institution of the holy supper, as the same was the first instituted by Christ: which is the best and surest way to reform and remove abuses, seeing all things in Gods worship must be ordered according to Gods and Christ’s institution] received of the Lord [namely, and not of the men, Gal. 1.12. This was done by relations, which the Lord Christ himself often made to Paul] that which I also gave over unto you, [or, delivered over. That is, faithfully taught, not as my doctrine but as the Lord Christ’s himself] that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread: [the exposition of this following institution of the Lords Supper. See Mat. 26.26. etc.]
\p
\v 24 . And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, take ye, that is my body, which is broken for you: do that for remembrance of me.
\p
\v 25 . In like manner he (took) also the cup, after the eating of supper, and said, this cup is the New Testament [Or, Covenant, Exod. 24.8. i.e. a sign and seal of the New Testament or Covenant. For the cup is not the covenant it self, but a sign and seal thereof] in my blood. Do that as often as ye shall drink (it) for remembrance of me.
\p
\v 26 . For as often as you shall eat this bread, [It is bread then which is eaten in the Lords supper] and shall drink this cup, [that is, the wine which is in the cup, an improper phrase] ye declare the death of the Lord, [the death of the Lord must be declared in the Lords Supper, as well by the ministers of the word, who by the administration must instruct the people, that this broken bread, and this wine, is a sign and sealing of the bitter death of Christ on the cross, and of the benefits procured for us thereby; as also by those that receive the same, who in their hearts must consider, believe, and with thanksgiving confess, that the Lord Christ died for them, to redeem them from eternal death, and save them; all which is given to understand by the words do this for remembrance of me, ver, 25.] until he come. [namely, to judge the quick and the dead: for as the Sacraments of the old Testament endured until the first coming of Christ in the flesh, so shall the Sacraments of the Testament endure until his second coming in glory.]
\p
\v 27 .So then whose unworthily eateth this bread, or drinketh the cup of the Lord, [That comes to pass when the persons are not rightly disposed who go to the Lords Supper, being either publicly scandalous persons, which must also be kept from it, or close hypocrites, and standing in the strife with their neighbours, and laden with hatred, envy, covetousness, and unrighteousness: or else when the faithful themselves have not duly prepared themselves thereunto, or do not receive the same with due consideration] he shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. [namely, because by such abuses he offers contempt to the sign of the body and blood of Christ. For the contempt which is offered to the Kings seal, is accounted as if were done to the King himself.]
\p
\v 28 . But let a man proves himself, [that is, search his mind and conscience, whether he feel in his heart a true sorrow and grief for sins, as also a firm faith and confidence in the merits of Jesus Christ, and moreover an unstained purpose to dye in sins more and more. And to walk before God in new godly life. See Gen. 17.1. 2 Cor. 13.5.] and so let him eat [namely, after that he shall duly have proved, and so found himself of [Gr. Out of] the bread, and drink of [Gr. Out of ] the cup.
\p
\v 29 . For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, he eateth and drinketh judgement [that is, guilt or punishment. See Mat. 23.14. Luke 23.40. Rom. 2.3. and 5.16. and 13.2. Jam. 3.1. which is to be understood either of eternal punishments in respect of hypocrites: or temporal chastisements in the respect of believers, who do not worthily use the Lords Supper, as is declared hereafter v.30.] to himself, not discerning Lord body. [that is, seeing he maketh no difference between the bread of the Lords Supper, which is a holy sign of the Lords body, and betwixt ordinary meat: and so without proving and reverence eats the same as other common bread.]
\p
\v 30 . Therefore [That is, for this abuse of the holy Supper] many are weak and sick among you, and many sleep. [that is, are already dead. See Mat. 9.24. and 27.52. John 11.11. 1 cor. 7.39. and 15.v.6.18. 1 Thes. 4.13.]
\p
\v 31 . For if we judge our selves [Or discerned, i.e. after a good and diligent proving of our selves judged rightly how it stands with us, whether we may go worthily to the lords table or not: and if we find our selves unworthy abstain from that sacred meat until we shall have amended our lives] we should not be judged. [that is, punished or chastened of the Lord which such plagues as are related before, v.30.]
\p
\v 32 . But when we judged, [This comfort the Apostle adds, that the faithful should not be too much dejected by the harshness of the former punishments. The comfort consists of two parts: first that such plagues are properly no punishments , but fatherly chastisements are or corrections: secondly, that they are sent to us by God for a good end, namely, for our salvation, that thereby we may brought to true repentance, and may not be damned with the ungodly] we are disciplined by the Lord, that we might not be condemned with the world.
\p
\v 33 . So then my brethren when ye come together to eat [namely, the Lords supper, or else afterwards to hold love-feasts, in which the rich waited not for the poor out of contempt of them] wait one for another, [namely, until ye are all come together; or that the one wait until the other have been at the table, that ye may not disorderly press upon one another.]
\p
\v 34 . But if any one hunger, let him eat at home, [That is, if any man cannot fast so long, until the Lords Supper be held, let him rather break his fast at his house, before he comes into the congregation, and goes to the lords table] that ye come not together unto a judgment. [that is, by disorderliness and confusedness do not pluck down a judgment upon your head. See ver. 29.] Now the things that remain, [namely, concerning the good order which must be observed in the exercise of the outward worship of God, in your assemblies; for therefore he speaketh, and not of things which concern doctrine or manners: as the word order which he here useth also imports] I will do when I shall come.
\c 12
\s 1 The Apostle further reproves the division risen amongst the Corinthians from the diversity of spiritual gifts, and Ecclesiastical administrations, and teacheth that they must not pride themselves, or despise others because of the same, forasmuch as they were all Gentiles before, and the holy Ghost bestowed the same upon them. 4 That the same Spirit worketh these gifts diversely , in one less, in another more, according to his pleasure, to the end that they should be bestowed for the common use and of the whole church: which he rehearseth to the number of nine. 12 this he explains by a similitude of the divers members of one body, whereby he teacheth that even the meanest gifts have their profit and necessity, and that therefore they that have received the most excellent gifts must not despise them that have less. 25 but that every must bestow his gifts for the service of others, and of the whole body of the church. 28 That God hath appointed as the gift, so also the ministries in the Church, not of one sort, nor of equal dignity. 31 But that nevertheless every one must seek after the best gifts.
\p
\v 1 AND of spiritual (gifts) [Thereby he understands not so much the inward spiritual gifts of faith and regeneration, as the outward and miraculous gifts which at that time were given to some of the Holy Ghost by laying on of hands, and are here called gifts, v.4. administration, v.5. and operations, v.6. and are rehearsed, v.8,9,10.] brethren, I will not that ye might be ignorant. [namely, from whence they come, to what end they are given, and how they must be used.]
\p
\v 2 . Ye that ye were Gentiles, drawn away [Namely, as brute beasts suffering your selves to led away by all manner of lies and deceits. See 2 Tim. 2.26.] unto dumb Idols, [namely, to serve them, and to enquire of them concerning things to come, which have neither life, nor understanding, nor speech. See Psa. 115. v. 4,5,6,7. Hab. 2.18.] according as ye were led. [namely, by the Idolatrous Priests, Sooth-sayers, and other instruments of the devil, the one to one Idol, the other to other.]
\p
\v 3 . Therefore I make known unto you that no man that speaketh by [Gr. in] the spirit of God, nameth Jesus a curse: [Gr. Anathema, of which word see Acts 32.12. Rom. 9.3. Gal. 1.8,9. This did the Heathen and Enemies of the Christian Religion. See Plin, ad Trajan. Lib. 10. Epist. 97.] and no man can say Jesus (to be) the Lord, [that is, acknowledge and confess that he is the true son of God, the promised Messiah, and Saviour of the world] but by [Gr. in] the Holy Ghost.
\p
\v 4 . And there is diversity [Gr. there are diversities, That is, the gifts are of many sorts, one more excellent then the other; and is also diversely imparted to this man and not that, and that in divers measure. See v.8. &c.] of gifts,
\p [namely, of prophesying, speaking with strange tongues, and the like, which are hereafter rehearsed] yet it is the same spirit. [namely, which works and distributes all these gifts, and therefore he hath received the most excellent, ought not to proud thereof, or to despise him that hath less, seeing truly he was able to give to the same as excellent gifts as the other.]
\p
\v 5 . And there is diversity of administration , [That is, Ecclesiastical ministries which are rehearsed. v.28.] and is the same Lord: [namely, Jesus Christ, who instituted them, and who calleth one to this ministry, and another to another, even as it pleaseth him. See Ephes. 4.11.]
\p
\v 6 . And there is diversity of operations, [That is, of the miraculous gifts of healing and other miracles. See v. 9.10.] but it is the same God [namely, the Father, by his Son and the Holy Spirit, to whom the workings of these gifts are ascribed also, John 5.19,21. and here v.11.] who worketh all in all.
\p
\v 7 . But every one is the revelation of the Spirit [Or, showing forth, i.e. the gift whereby is showed and made known that the Spirit hath wrought this in him] given, for that which is profitable. [namely, for edifying of the church, and for the common service of all. And therefore also they must not be used for any other end, and not for the pride and for despising of others.]
\p
\v 8 . For to this (man) is given by the spirit the word of wisdom, [That is, the gift of understanding excellently well divine things, and to be able prudently to apply and make use of the same for the salvation and service of men] and to another the word of knowledge, [that is, the gift of being very expert in the holy scripture, and of thoroughly understanding the right sense of the same: which gift some have indeed, albeit that they not fitness withal, either to import this knowledge to others, or well apply it to use] by the same Spirit. [or according to the same Spirit.]
\p
\v 9 . And to another Faith [Namely, of working miracles, which is a special confidence that God will herein give us that which we shall ask of him in the name of Christ, beyond the course of nature. See Mat. 17.20. Acts 14.8. 1 Cor. 13.2.] by the same Spirit: [Gr. in the same Spirit] and to another the gift of healings [namely, not by ordinary means of medicines, but with a word, by touching, or otherwise by miracle, as Peter, Acts 3.6. and Paul, Acts 28.8. See also Acts 14.3. and chap. 19.v11,12. Jam. 5.14,15.] by [Gr. in] the same Spirit.
\p
\v 10 . And to another the workings of mighty (works) [ Hereby is understood the gift to work miracles, not only for the help and service of men, but also for the punishment of hypocrites or enemies of Christ and his doctrine. See Acts 5.5. in Peter, and Acts 23.11. in Paul] and to another Prophecy [that is, certainly to foretell things to come, which gift had Agabus, Acts 11.27,28. and 21.10. the four daughters of Philip, Acts 21.9. or else to expound the writings of the Prophets for edification, exhortation and consolation, 1 Cor. 14.3. See Rom. 12.7. But here it seems to be taken for the first sort of prophesying] and to another discerning of the Spirits, [that is, the gift to discern true and false teachers, and to give the church warning of the false ones. See 1 John 4.1.] and to another many kinds of tongues, namely, which have not learned, but with they arte able to speak by a special miracle, and divine instruction and inspiration. See Mark 16.17. & Acts 2.4.] and to another interpretation of languages. [Gr. of tongues, i.e. who were able plainly to interpret in a known tongue that which was spoken or written in an unknown tongue, and declare it to other who do not understand it.]
\p
\v 11 . But all these things worketh one and the same spirit [See v.4,] imparting to every one in particular, even as he will. [ namely, the Holy Ghost, who being bound to no man, nor moved by any mans fitness, gives these according to his own free will and good pleasure.]
\p
\v 12 . For as the body [This similitude the Apostle useth also, Rom. 12.v.4,5. Eph. 4.4,12,16. and is very fit to persuade the members of one spiritual body unto peace and unity] is one, [that is, not divided into many bodies, so is also the universal Christian church but one Spiritual body, Can. 6. 9. Rom. 12. 5. Eph. 2. 14. and 4. 4, 5. which unity none must break by strife or schism] and hath many members, [namely, having diver’s gifts, dignity and administration] and all the members of this one body, being many, are (but) one body: even so also Christ. [namely, hath but one body, whereof he is the head, and that hath many and divers members. Or even so also Christ : i.e. the body of Christ, namely the church, which is so called from its head.]
\p
\v 13 . For we all [Namely, believers, who belong to this body of Christ as members] are also by one Spirit [Gr. in one Spirit, i.e. by the Spirit of regeneration, which is but one and consequently also admonisheth and obligeth us unto unity] baptized unto one body, [namely the church of Christ, into which we are ingraffed by baptism, which is the laver of regeneration, Eph. 5. 26. Tit. 3. 5. and obligeth us to unity also] whether it be Jews or Greeks, or servants, or free (men) [that is, of what decent, state or condition soever we be] and we are all made to drink [that is, the Lord’s supper also in which we all drink one drink out of one cup, admonisheth and obligeth us, that avoiding all divisions we seek after unity, to be one spiritual body and of one mind. The like reason the Apostle useth, 1 Cor. 10. 17. that as in the Lords supper we are all partakers of one bread; so we are also admonished thereby that we many are one body] unto one spirit. [or by one Spirit.]
\p
\v 14 . For the body also is not one member, [Namely, only, or consists not of one member only, but of many and divers, so also the body of the church consisteth of many members, which have divers gifts and administrations, of which some govern, others are governed, some teach, others are taught, some speak in the church and others hearken] but many (members).
\p
\v 15 . If the foot should say, seeing I am not the hand, I am not body: [Gr. not out of the body. To the foot and the ear the Apostle here compares those who have lesser gifts or administrations in the church, and to the hand and eye those that have greater and more excellent: and thereby admonished the first that they must not grudge the others their great gifts and administrations, but the content with their state and condition, Deu. 28. 13] is it therefore not of the body?
\p
\v 16 . And if the ear should say, seeing I am not the eye, I am not of the body: is it therefore not of the body?
\p
\v 17 . Were the whole body the eye, where (should) the bearing (be)? [The Apostle hereby showeth how needful it is, that this diversity of gifts and administrations should be in the church, for the welfare of the same] Were the whole (body) hearing, where (should) the smelling (be).
\p
\v 18 . But now hath God set the members, every one of them in the body, [Each namely in its place, and each for its special use and service for the whole body: so doth he also concerning the members of the church, which he sits each for his particular service, and imparts to every one his gifts for this purpose] even as he should. [See before v. 11.]
\p
\v 19 . Were they all (but) one member, [That is, had the members of the church all one kind of administration and gifts] where (should) the body (be?) [that is, how could the church stand and be edified, for one member alone cannot do it.]
\p
\v 20 . But now indeed there are many members, [Namely, having divers callings, administrations, gifts, and operations] yet (but) one body. [namely, to whose profit and edification, each must bestow and contribute what he hath.]
\p
\v 21 . And the eye [That is; they that have the most excellent callings, gifts, or administrations: as also by the head are understood the principal men and governors of the church] cannot say to the hand, [that is, to those who indeed have also excellent gifts or administrations, but not so excellent as the eye. See Deut. 28. 13.] I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
\p
\v 22 . Yea much rather, the members which seem (to us) to be the weakest of the body, they are needful. [Namely, for the sustentation and service of the whole body, for the eye can get or lay hold on nothing without the hand, and the head cannot walk without the feet.]
\p
\v 23 . And they that seem to us to be the least honourable (members) of the body; [ No members by God created in the body, are dishonourable in themselves : but that some are so accounted, that happens according to the use they have in the body] on them we put more abundant honour: [Gr. we put about the same more abundant honour. Namely, by covering them, and naming them in terms] and our uncomely (members) [namely, which are misshapen, crooked, or too short, or have any other defect, or which for honours sake must be covered] have more abundant adorning. [seeing men seek to cover these defects, or to beautify them with some ornament of apparel. So ought men also to do the mean members of the Church, which men must not therefore despise, but much rather honour them, and cover their defects.]
\p
\v 24 . But our comely have no need of it: [Namely, to be adorned, being comely enough of themselves] but God hath (so) joined the body together, [Gr. mingled or te percd together] giving more abundant honour [ that is teaching and commending us by natural modesty, to honour such members] to that which hath want (of it) [that is, to such a member as hath need of this honour. Which therefore must admonish us, that we also ought to do the same to the meaner members of the church.]
\p
\v 25 . That there be no discord [Gr. schism, namely which would necessarily arise, if one member would not serve another as it ought: and the same would necessarily tend to the destruction of the whole body. So also in the Church ] in the body, by the members should take the like [Gr. the same] care for one another.
\p
\v 26 . And whether it be that one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it: [That is, really show that the same concerns them also, and contribute all to free the suffering member from its suffering. So must the members of the Church do also, Heb. 13. 3.] or that one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it.
\p
\v 27 . And ye are the body of Christ, [The Apostle now applies the foregoing similitude to the Church which is the spiritual body of Christ, whereof each believer in particular is a member, who for this cause ought so carry himself towards his fellow-members, as is showed in the comparison that the outward members of one body do towards one another] and members in particular. [Gr. of a part, i.e. each believer is a particular member and part of the same body, which consists of all the parts and members joined together: therefore each part must be respected and esteemed in its own order, and contribute all to the service and benefit of the whole.]
\p
\v 28 . And God hath set some in this Church, [Namely, to certain ministries in the same: of which ministries he now treats further, for the exposition of ver. 5.] first Apostles, [of the word Apostles see Luke 6. 13. To these the first and chiefest place is ascribed amongst the ministers of the Church of the new Testament, because they were called by Christ himself without means of men, Gal. 1. 1. could not err in teaching, were sent to preach throughout the whole world, and were furnished with a special power to work miracles, and punish the disobedient] secondly Prophets, [see ver. 10. and Rom. 12. 7. Eph. 4. 11.] thirdly teachers, [that is, who are ordinarily called, to interpret the Scripture for the edification of the Church, and to maintain and defend the doctrine of the same against false teachers. See Eph. 4. 11.] afterward powers [that is, they that are endued with the gift to confirm the doctrine by miracles , and with power miraculously to punish the stiff-necked] after that gifts of healings, [who have such a gift by miracle to cure incurable and all other diseases. See ver. 9. ] helps, [that is, who take care of and help the poor and sick ] governments, [that is, they that are appointed to keep the Church in good order, and to guide them, which are Elders, Rom. 12. 8. 1 Tim. 5. 17.] many kinds of tongues. [Gr. sorts of tongues. See ver. 10.]
\p
\v 29 . Are they all Apostles? [That is, seeing then the ministries of the Church have not all administrations of one kind, nor of equal dignity, therefore they that have the highest ought not to despise them who have a lower, neither ought these to grudge the other this, and so to contend one amongst another, but to bestow their service each in his place for edification and peace] are they all Prophets? Are they all teachers? Are they all powers:
\p
\v 30 . Have they all gifts of healings? Do they all speak with (many kinds of) tongues? Are they all interpreters? [Or, translators. Namely, or strange languages. See ver. 10.]
\p
\v 31 . But be zealous after the best gifts: [Gr. the better, i.e. although the gifts are divers, the one more excellent than the other, and that each one being content with his own, how mean soever it be, must look to bestow the same, for the greatest profit and edification of the Church, yet nevertheless it is commendable also that men by convenient means seek after this, that they may get the best and most excellent] and I show you a way which is yet more excellent. [Gr. a way according to excellency, namely, which he sets forth in the following chapter, which is, that leaving all contention, pride, and despising, we order all our actions out of, and according to love.]
\c 13
\s 1. What the Apostle had promised in the latter part of the former chapter, that he would show the Corinthians a more excellent way, that he performs in this chapter; teaching that love is the principal gift, which Christians must seek after, which he proves by comparing it with other great gifts, as are divers tongues, prophecy, knowledge, working of miracles, liberally relieving the poor, and courageously even to suffer death for the name of Christ: and showeth that all such gifts are nothing without love, 4. and praiseth love because of its excellent properties, and operations, 8. as also because it shall endure and abide always, whereas other gifts shall cease, 9. seeing they are imperfect in this life, 10. which he declares by a comparison of the knowledge of a child, and of a man full-grown, and of seeing in a glass, and in the face itself, 13. and finally because love is greater and more excellent than faith and hope.
\p
\v 1 Although it were that I spoke the languages [Gr. with tongues ] of men [that is, which any men in the world were able to speak] and of Angels, [the Angels, which are spirits, Heb. 1. 14. have properly no tongues, as we have, but this must be understood of the excellency, and multitude of languages which even the Angels might be able to speak when they are with men] and had not love, I were become a sounding [or, resounding] brass, [that is, brazen instrument, wherewith men make a great noise without pleasantness or understanding] or a ringing cymbal .
\p
\v 2 . And although I had the (gifts) of prophecy, [See of his gift, Rom. 12. 7. and Cor. 12. 10.] and knew all mysteries and all knowledge: [See also of this gift, 1 Cor. 12. v. 8, 10.] and although I had all faith, [namely, to work all kind of miracles. See 1. Cor. 12. 9, 10] So that should transpose mountains, [that is, should do one of the greatest miracles, such as it would be to transfer a mountain from one place unto another] and had not love, I were nothing, [that is, the gift were not profitable nor serviceable to me for salvation.]
\p
\v 3 . And though I should distribute all my goods for the maintenance ( of the poor), [The Greek word signifies to cut bread in pieces or morsels to feed any one] and though I should give up my body that I might be burned, [namely, for Christ’s name and truth: which is the greatest work of the Christian fortitude] and had no love [that is, did not that out of love of Gods glory, and to edify the church thereby, and confirm it in the truth, but out of ambition, or other necessities and respects] it would yield me no profit. [Or profit me nothing]
\p
\v 4 . Love [That is, a man that hath true love] is long-suffering, [that is, by the grace of the Holy Ghost endures the reproaches and injuries offered unto it, and restrains wrath and desire of revenge] it is bountiful: [that is, inclined and ready to do good to every one, even to enemies] love is not envious: love dealeth not wantonly, [or pervesly, male pertly, vainly, namely, in words or in deeds] it is not puffed up. [that is, proud, ambitious, highly conceited of itself, and despising others.]
\p
\v 5 . It dealeth not unfitly [Or unseemly] it seeketh not itself, [Gr. the things which are its own; or the things which concern its own advantage, but the welfare of its neighbour and of many] it is not embittered, [namely, to wrath, passion, and desire for revenge] it thinketh no evil. [that is, plotteth not in its mind, how it shall do its neighbour any evil in the actions of its neighbour, out of mistrust or evil-suspicion; or imputes not evil]
\p
\v 6 . It rejoiceth not in unrighteousness, [Or for unrighteousness, namely, when any one doth that which is unjust, or else when injustice is done to any man] but it rejoiceth in the truth: [or with the truth, i.e. when any one doth, or there is done to any one, that which is just and fit.]
\p
\v 7 . It covereth all things, [Or, beareth, for the Greek word signifieth both. But forasmuch afterward in the same verse is spoken of forbearance; therefore the word cover is better used here; seeing this is a proper work of love, Prov. 10.12. 1 Pet. 4.8. Or it taketh all things in good part and to the best] it believeth all things, [namely, which are any way credible and not manifestly false. Namely, concerning the actions of his neighbhour, construing them always to the best as long as the contrary appears not] it hopeth all things, [namely, of God, that he will deliver and assist him, Job. 13.15. and of men, that they have not meant, spoken or done so evil, or that being fallen they will rise again] it beareth all things. [that is, suffers all injuries done to it for peace sake, without revenging it self.]
\p
\v 8 . Love never [That is, it neither ceaseth in this life to bring forth these fruits: neither shall it cease in that to come, but always abide and be perfect, although not always employed in one kind of operations] perisheth: [Gr. never falleth out, or off, as Rom. 9.6.] but whether it be prophecies, [see 1 Cor. 12.10.] they shall be abolished [namely, as well in this life, when that gift shall cease, as it came to pass after the Apostle times, as in that to come, in which the foretelling of things future shall not be necessary] be it languages, [Gr. tongues. See 1 Cor. 12.1.] they shall cease, [namely, the imperfect knowledge which we now obtain by the ministry of the word in this life, as is declared in the following verse it shall be abolished.
\p
\v 9 .For we know [Namely, now in this life] in part, [not that we do not know all that is necessary for us to salvation, John 16. v. 13. 1 Cor. 1.5. 2 Tim. 3.15. but the Apostle speaks thus in respect and comparison of the knowledge we which we shall have of divine things in the life to come: unto which, this is our knowledge which we now have, is to be accounted but a little part] and we prophecy in part.
\p
\v 10 . But when the perfect [That is, the perfect knowledge of divine things, as much as mere man shall be able to comprehend, and shall be needful for us to perfect joy and salvation] shall be come, [which shall be first in the life to come] then shall that which is in part, [that is, the imperfect knowledge. See v.8.] be done away.
\p
\v 11 . When I was a child, [The Apostle compares the knowledge which we have now in this life, to the knowledge which little children have: and the knowledge which shall have in the life to come to the knowledge of men grown. Such a difference there is betwixt both, and yet much greater] I spoke as a child, I was minded as a child, [or, I considered, I though] I reasoned as a child; [that is, weighing things with mine understanding] but when I became a man, I did away that which was a child’s. [that is, that small, mean, and childish knowledge which was in me.]
\p
\v 12 . For we see now [Namely, as long as we are in this life] by a glass: [that is, betwixt our present knowledge, that which we shall have after this life, is such a difference, as there is when one seeth the image of another’s face in the glass, when he beholds the face itself] in a dark sentence. [Gr. in a riddle. i.e. there is also such a difference, as one propounds any thing darkly, in the manner of a riddle, and when he doth the same with plain, proper and express words] but when [namely, in the life to come] (shall we see) [that is, know, namely, God and all divine things] face to face: [that is, clearly and perfectly. See 1 John 3.2.] now [namely, in this life] know I in part, [that is, even I myself although I am an Apostle, and was taken up in the third heaven, and there heard unutterable word, 2 Cor. 12.4.] but then [namely, in this life to come] I shall know even also I am known. [namely, acknowledgeth me for this, and through this his love shall give me the same knowledge.]
\p
\v 13 . And now [See v.12.] abideth faith, hope (and) love, these three: [that is, we have need that all these three virtues be and bide in us. For without faith we cannot be justified, and it is impossible to please God: and without hope faith cannot stand, and by love faith must be operative] but the greatest [Gr. greater, namely, because faith and hope shall cease in this life to come, because when we shall actually enjoy and posses the good things which we now believe and hope for: but love shall abide forever, and be perfect. See v.8.] of this is love.

\s 1 The Apostle concluding the foregoing exhortation to love, teacheth further that they that seek after spiritual gifts, must seek most after the gift of prophesying. 5 That nevertheless the gift of strange tongues is not to be despised, but must be used with interpretation of the same, 7 which he proves by the similitude of a pipe, harp and trumpet, 10 and shows that it is contrary to nature, and is nothing else then if men spoke to Barbarians. 13 Teacheth further that men must so pray, that this may be done not only with the Spirit, but also with understanding. 16. Otherwise that one that understandeth not the strange tongues, cannot say amen to such a prayer. 18 confirms the same by his own example which he exhorts them to imitate, 21 and proves out of the Scripture that strange tongues are sometimes rather a judgement then a gift, 23 teacheth also that it be ridiculous if they all spake with strange tongues, but for the edification if they all prophesied. 26 Afterwards he lays down certain rules which must be followed in the use of extraordinary gifts, namely, that all must be done to edification, 27 when they speak with strange tongues that another interpret it, 29 that prophesying must be done by turns, 32 and that the prophets judge thereof. 34 That the women hold their peace in the Church. 37 That these his ordinances are the commandments of the Lord. 40 Finally that all things must be done be seemingly, and in order in the Church.
\p
\v 1 Follow after love [Gr. pursue love. This is the conclusion of the former chapter] and be zealous [that is, labour nevertheless for this, that each may excel other therein] for spiritual (gifts) [to obtain extraordinary gifts, which the Holy Ghost then wrought in many. See 1 Cor. 12.ver.1,8.9.10. Although men must be zealous for the ordinary gifts, also] but most that ye may prophecy. [what that is, see Rom. 12.ver.7.10. 1 Cor. 12.10. and the third following.]
\p
\v 2 . For he that speaketh a (strange) language, [Gr. with a tongue, as also in the following] speaketh not to men, [that is, he might thereby known to them the thoughts his heart, which is the end whereof speech is used,] but to God, [that is, that God well understandeth it but not men, which is not enough] for no men understandeth (it) [Gr. heareth it; namely, with understanding See Gen. 11.7.] yet with the spirit [that is, with the gift which the holy Ghost hath wrought in him. Or his mind] he speaketh mysteries. [this may be understood either of the mysteries of the Kingdome of heaven, Mat. 13.11. 1 Cor. 4.1. and 13.2. which are more excellent then that they should be held forth without fruit and attention in an unknown tongue. Or that he that speaketh in an unknown tongue doth not otherwise then if he propounded some hidden things, which no man can understand.]
\p
\v 3 . But he that prophecieth [that is, he that interprets the writings of the Prophets in an unknown tongue. See ver.1.] speaketh unto men, [that is, speaketh so that men can understand it, and receive benefit by it] edification, and exhortation. [that is, that which may serve for edification or instruction of the ignorant, exhortation of the disorderly and consultation of the sad. Unto these three advantages must all interpretations of Gods word be fitted, Rom. 15.4. 2 Tim. 3.16. And for this course is the gift of prophesying better then that of strange tongues, because that these benefits are not obtained.
\p
\v 4 .He that speaketh a (strange) tongue he edifieth himself, but he that prophecieth edifieth the Church.
\p
\v 5 . And I will (indeed) [That is, I would or wished indeed: so far it is from me to have the gift of strange tongues hereby despised] that ye all speak in (strange) tongues, but rather that you should prophecy. For he that prophecyieth is greater [that is, hath a more excellent gift, and more serviceable to the edification of the Church.] then that speaketh (strange) tongues, except that he interprets it, [or, translate it, Namely, into another known tongue, for that the Church can understand it] that the Church may receive edifying.
\p
\v 6 . And now brethren, if I should come unto you, and should speak (strange) tongues, what should I bring you [Namely, for your edification] if I speak not unto you, either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in doctrine? [or, spoke not, either by revelation etc. i.e. preached not in you in a known tongue, so that you should be able to understand that I held forth unto you either some revelation of my mysteries, or some knowledge how a man must carry himself in doubtful matters, or some exposition of the writings of the Prophets, or some confirmation of some article of faith.]
\p
\v 7 . Even the very liveless things [Gr. soul-less i.e. the instrument of music] which give sound [Gr. voice] whether it be pipe, or harp, if they give no difference with (their) sound, [that is, diversity of tones, but always one kind of tone: which is very unacceptable, and irksome to hear] how shall that be known which is piped [that is, that song or ditty] or played on the harp?
\p
\v 8 . For if the Cornet [Or, Trumpet whereby solders are warned or stirred up to battle] give an uncertain sound, [or, unknown, Namely, by which men cannot understand that they are being warned and stirred up to prepare themselves for battle . For there was a certain manner of trumpeting wont be for this purpose which was called classium] who shall prepare himself to the war?
\p
\v 9 . Even so ye also, if ye by the language [or, by the tongue] give not a significant speech, [or speak words which men can understand what ye mean thereby] how shall that be understood [namely, by the hearers who understand not the language] which is spoken? For ye shall be as they that speak into the air. [that is, make some noise and cast it out into the air. Which vanisheth there without any profit. See 9.26.]
\p
\v 10 . There are, as it falleth out [That is, as according to the condition of times and places in happeneth] so many sorts of voices in the world, [namely, not only among them, who have their several speeches, but also among all sorts of beasts and souls] and none of them is without voice. [that is, without such a sound, that men of one kind of language may thereby understand one another, and that by the noise of the beasts and souls each sort of them may be discerned: so that they have yet some signification, which is not in strange unknown languages.]
\p
\v 11 . If therefore I know not the force of the voice, [That is, understand not the meaning of that which is spoken] I shall be barbarious [that is, as a man of an unknown language. The Greeks and Romans called all other nations which did not speak or understand their languages Barbarians. See Acts 28. 2.4. Rom. 1.14. Col. 3.11.] to him that speaketh: and he that speaketh shall be barbarious with me. [Gr. in me.]
\p
\v 12 . Even so ye also, seeing ye are zealous [Gr. are zealots of spiritual gifts, i.e. strive for endeavour after this, that ye may have the best spiritual gifts: which is a commendable zeal and strife] after spiritual gifts, [Gr. spirits] seek that ye may be abundant [or, excellent] for edifying of the Church. [that is, that ye may have and use such gifts, whereby the Church must be most edified.]
\p
\v 13 . Therefore he that speaketh [That is, can and will speak in the Church] in a (strange) tongue, let him pray [that is, that besides the gift of strange tongues, God will also bestow him the gift of the spirit. See 1 Cor. 12.ver.10.30. and here ver.26.27. and howsoever they themselves understood well what they said, yet nevertheless they had not always therewith the gift of being able plainly to translate the same. Or that he so pray, namely in the Church, that he also interpret in a known tongue made in an unknowing tongue] that he may interpret it.
\p
\v 14 . For if I pray [that is, make a prayer openly in the Church] in a (strange) tongue, my spirit (indeed) prayeth, [that is, I prayer indeed in my mind, through the gift of the Holy Ghost, which is good] that my understanding [namely, which I have of that language. See v.4. Or the meaning of my prayer] is fruitless. [namely, to the hearers, who understands not such a prayer.]
\p
\v 15 . What is then? [That is, what must men do then use this gift aright] I will (indeed0 pray with the spirit [that is, I will indeed use this gift of the Holy Ghost, to make a prayer in the Church in a strange tongue] but I will also pray with the understanding: [that is, I will adjoin a plain interpretation that the hearers shall be able to understand it] I will (indeed) sing [namely, psalms and spiritual songs in the assembly of the Church] with the spirit, but I will also sing with the understanding.
\p
\v 16 . Otherwise thou givest thanks, [Gr. blessest, i.e. being endured with this gift of the Holy Ghost, makest public thanksgiving in the Church] with the spirit, how shall he which filleth the place [that is, who sitteth amongst the common persons or hearers. For it seemeth that the teachers sate in a special and more raised place in the assembles] of an unlearned (person) [Gr. idiots, i.e. that understandeth not strange tongues, and who hath not public ministry or extraordinary gifts to teach in the Church, or to make prayer or thanksgiving] say amen? This word amen cometh from an Hebrew word, signifying truth, certainty, firmness,; and is used for the conclusion of prayer or other weighty speeches, thereby to declare that men consent so that which is prayed for or spoken, and with that it may come to pass. See Deu. 27.15. Neh. 5.13. Jer. 11.5. Luke 24.43. Rom. 1.25. and 9.5. Rev. 22.20,21.] upon thy thanksgiving? Seeing he knoweth not thou saist.
\p
\v 17 . For thou givest thanks very fitly, [That is, thou indeed makest a good thanksgiving, which can edify thee because thou understandeth the language] but the other [namely, who heareth thy thanksgiving, and understandeth not thy tongue wherein thou givest thanks] is not edified.
\p
\v 18 . I thank my God that I speak more (strange) tongues, then you all [Or, that I speak strange tongues more then you all. The Apostle propounds his own example to the Corinthians, which they ought in equity to imitate. He giveth God thanks for the gift of strange tongues, which he had received more abundantly than any one of them, who made ostentation thereof in the Assembles; to show that he did despise this gift, but only repriveth the abuse of the same:]
\p
\v 19 . But I will (rather) in the Church [That is, in the assembly of the faithful where many idiots are present also] speak five words [that is, some few] with [or, by] mine understanding, [that is, so that I express my understanding, or the thoughts of my mind with clear, known and significant words, which every one can understand] that I may instruct others also, then ten thousand words, [that is, a great and long speech; See 1 Cor 4.15. from whence clear appears; that they do directly contrary to the doctrine of the Apostle, who perform Gods worship and their prayers unto God in a strange tongue which they themselves or hearers understand not, and who do as it were number of those prayers to God by fifties and hundreds] in a (strange) tongue.
\p
\v 20 . Brethren, be not children in understanding: [that is, show that ye have better understanding then children, seeing it is altogether childish to make an ostentation in the Assemble with strange tongues without any edification or abide not always in the childish and mean knowledge of spiritual things. See Heb. 5.12. and chap. 6.1.] but be children in weakness, [that is, imitate children, not in their ignorance but in their innocence, seeing children although they are born with a corrupt nature notwithstanding do not yet so show it, as they that are grown] and in understanding [namely, of spiritual things necessary to salvation] be full grown. [Gr. perfect, i.e. increase daily in this understanding, in such a manner, that betwixt the understanding which ye now have of spiritual things, and that which ye shall yet obtain, there be such a difference, as there betwixt the understanding of a child and of a man grown. For that in this life we shall not come to an altogether perfect knowledge of Spiritual things, the Apostle taught in the former chapter v.9,10.11.12.]
\p
\v 21 . It is written in the law, [that is, in the Scriptures of the Old Testament. See John 10.34.] I will speak to this people, [namely, thereby to punish them; seeing then that God useth unknown tongues & speeches as a punishment, therefore men ought not to use them in the Church without interpretation, forasmuch as this tend more to punishment then to the edification thereof. See the further exhortation, Esa. 28.11.] by men of other tonus, [that is, of unknown tongues which they shall not understand] and by other lips, [that is, unknown speech] and neither so they will hear me [that is, not understand] saith the Lord.
\p
\v 22 . So then (strange) tongues are for a sign, [Namely, of Gods wrath] not to them that believe, but to unbelievers, [that is. They that obstinately reject the word of God, to them God sends (this) for a punishment, that they are spoken to in an unknown tongue] and prophecy [see v. 3,4.] not to believers, [for although the prophecy may serve also to convert an unbeliever; not withstanding seeing unbelievers come not much into the Congregation, it is principally framed to exhort comfort and confirm believers] but to them that believe.
\p
\v 23 . If therefore the whole church were gathered into one, and they all spoken in (strange) tongue, and (some) unlearned or unbelievers should come in, [Namely, who are not yet converted to the Christian Religion] would they not say ye were out of your wits? [namely, when ye spoke before the people that which they do not understand, which no wise persons, but they that are out of their wits do. Whereby when unbeliever is more and more estranged from the Christian Religion: as that which seemed to him to make men out of their wits.]
\p
\v 24 . But if they all prophesied, [Namely, who have the gift of prophecy, one after another. See v.28,29,30.] and one unbelieving or unlearned came in, he is convinced [or reproved, i.e. overcome in his conscience that the Christian Religion is the right and true Religion] of all, [namely, who use the gift of prophecy in the church aright] (and) he is judged [that is, condemned, namely, for his former sins, and if he will not receive by a true faith that which by prophesying is propounded out of Gods word, he is rendered without all excuse. See Acts 24.25.] all.
\p
\v 25 . And so the hidden things of his heart become manifest: [that is, when by prophesying Gods word is interpretated, it appears how a man is disposed in his heart, namely, whether he will abide stiffeneckedly in his unbelief, or believe the Gospel. See 2 Cor. 2.v.15,16.] and so falling on (his) face, [namely, he that by prophecying is convinced in his heart of the true Christian Religion, he will immediately with all reverence betake himself to the service of the true God, and to confess the Christian Religion for the true.] he will worship God, and declare that God is truly [that is, that in your that the true Religion is rightly taught and exercised] among you. [Gr. in you.]
\p
\v 26 . What is it then Brethren? [That is, seeing that which is said before is so indeed, what shall then be done further? Here the Apostle begins to prescribe certain rules; which men must observe in the church in using of gifts] when ye come together, every one of you hath he a Psalm [Or, hymn, namely made by him by inspiration of the Holy Ghost, to the glory of God, and edification of the Church] hath he a doctrine, [that is, a particular instruction, exhortation, or consultation, specially inspired into him by the Holy Ghost] hath he a (strange) tongue, hath he a revelation, [namely, of the Holy Ghost, of any unknown or future things. See Revel. 1.1.] hath he an interpretation; [that is, the gift of translating strange tongues into speeches that are known: or as well and plainly to expound any dark places of the Holy Scripture] let all things be done unto edifying:
\p
\v 27 . And if any man speaketh a (strange) tongue, (let) it (be done) by two, or at most by three, [That is, let not many spend the time thereby: but if men will indeed speak strange tongues, let this be by as few as may be] and by turn; [that is, not altogether at one time in a company, but one after another] and let one interpret it. [namely, that the Church may understand thereby, what is it that was spoken in an unknown tongue.]
\p
\v 28 . But if there be no interpreter, [namely, either he himself that speaketh a strange tongue, or another who hath the gift to translate these strange tongues, and to turn them into known tongues] let him hold his peace [namely, he that speaketh in a strange tongue] in the Church but let him speak to himself [or with himself, privately, not openly in the Church] and to God. [namely, inwardly calling upon and giving thanks to God. Who knoweth the thoughts of the heart, and understandeth all languages.]
\p
\v 29 . And let two or three [Namely, not to pass away the time with prophesying only] Prophets [see ver.3.4.] speak, [namely, in the Church and that by turn, ver.27.[ and let the other [namely, who have the same gift of prophesying, of the gift of discerning of spirits] judge. [namely, whether that prophecy agree with Gods word, by which all doctrines and revelations must be tried. See Isa. 8.20. John 5.39.]
\p
\v 30 . But if (ought) be revealed [Namely, which either is not, or not so clearly revealed to the other that speaketh, as to him] to another [namely, who hath the gift of prophecy also] which sitteth, [that is, who hath yet had no turn to stand up and speak] let the first hold his peace. [namely, to give place to that second to speak.]
\p
\v 31 . For ye may all prophecy one after another, that they might all learn [That is, as well the Prophets as the ordinary hearers may be instructed] and all be comforted. [or exhorted.]
\p
\v 32 . And the spirits of the Prophets, [That is, the doctrine which the prophets propound by the gift and inspiritation of the holy Ghost] are subject to the Prophets. [that is, are subject to the judgment of the other prophets which hear them, which judgment they also willingly submit unto: for howsoever this prophesying was inspired by the Holy Ghost which cannot err, yet nevertheless all was not always revealed unto one, that same was also oftentimes revealed unto more others likewise. There might also by some Prophets be somewhat of their own mingled therewith. It must therefore be proved and judged by others, whether their prophesying also be by inspiration of the Holy Ghost, and according to the measure of faith. See Isa. 8.20. Rom.12.7.]
\p
\v 33 . For God is no (God) [Or, no author, or lover] of confusion [or, disturbance] but of peace, as in all the Churches of the Saints. [namely, is taught by me: or is needful.]
\p
\v 34 . Let your women be silent in the Churches: [That is, not speak openly to the Church even although they be endured with good knowledge. See 1 Cor. 11.5.] For it is not permitted unto them to speak, [namely, to teach or propound any thing in the Church. See 1 Tim 2.12.] but (commanded) to be subject [namely, to the men to receive instruction from them: for he that instructs another in public assembles, hath thereby some authority over or above him that is instructed] as also the law saith. [namely, Gen. 3.16.]
\p
\v 35 . And if they will lean any thing, [That is, be more largely instructed concerning any points of doctrine] let them ask their own husbands, [namely, if they be fit to instruct them: otherwise they may also well in private inquire of the teachers of the Church, or any other honest and gifted men] for it is shameful [that is, uncomely, ill besitting: because thereby the order is inverted which God hath set between man and woman and that this is repugnant also to that honourable shamefastness which ought to be in women] for women that they should speak in the Church.
\p
\v 36 . Went the word of God from you? [That is, from your teachers of Corinth, who are so proud of your gifts, and not much rather from us Apostles, who first preached the word of God unto you] or is it come unto you only? [that is, you carry yourselves so proudly as if you alone had all wisdom. A serious reproof of those proud spirits, whereby is also shewd withal, that they have no reason to exalt themselves.]
\p
\v 37 . If any man thinketh that he is a Prophet, [That is, really endued with the gift of prophecy, or presumeth that he is, and gives himself out for such a one] or spirit, [that is. Endued with any extraordinary gift of the Holy Ghost. Or abundantly exercised in Christian doctrine, 2 Cor. 2.15. and chap. 3.1. Gal. 6.1.] let him acknowledge [that is, he must or ought to acknowledge: namely, if he be such a one as he gives himself out for] that what I write to you are the commandments of the Lord: [ namely, Jesus Christ, who as our Lord hath power to command us, and whom we his servants are bound to obey.]
\p
\v 38 . But if any one be ignorant [that is, willful, will not know or acknowledge the same] let him be ignorant. [that is, seeing he will willfully abide in his ignorance, and not suffer himself to be informed by my writing he may do this at his own peril: I will not trouble my self with such, seeing I have done my duty to bring them out of this ignorance. See the like phrase, Revel.22.11.]
\p
\v 39 .So then brethren be zealous to prophecy, and hinder not to speak in (strange) tongues. [That is, although I judge that prophesying produceth more edification in the Church then to speak with strange tongues, yet I will not thereby have the use of strange tongues altogether rejected or hindered, so it be but duly performed, and with interpretation.]
\p
\v 40 . Let all things [That is, which are to be done in the assembles of the Church, as there are prophesying of preaching the word of God, making the public prayers and thanksgivings, administration of the Sacraments, and the like] be done decently [or befittingly, so that it may have a faire appearance, which is becoming Christian decency and simplicity] and with order. [that is, without confusion, each in its due time, course, place etc.]
\c 15
\s 1 The Apostle proves the truth of resurrection of the dead by many firm reasons, of which the first is taken from the resurrection of Christ, which he confirms by the sum of his doctrine which according to the Scripture he had propounded unto them, 4 and by the testimonies of Peter, 6 of more then five hundred brethren, 7 of James, and of all the Apostles, 8 and of himself 13 Concludes that otherwise even Christians should not be raised up, 14 which he proves to be absurd, seeing thereby should be made of none effect, their testimonies, the grounds of Christian faith, and the hope of Christians, 21 teacheth that Christ is he that shall raise the dead, and that it shall come to pass at his coming, when he shall destroy all his enemies, and subject all things unto God. 27 That otherwise also baptism for the dead is used in vain. 30 That believers as also he himself, should endure so many perils in vain: and that the Epicureans should be in the right. 35 Afterwards he teacheth that believers shall arise with the same bodies, but with other spiritual qualities, as incorruptibility, glory, immortality, 47 and that the faithful shall have bodies, not as Adam had, but as the Lord Christ now hath. 51. Revealeth also a mystery, that they that live at the coming of Christ, shall not dye but be changed, 54 and that then the dead shall be swallowed up: whereat he sings a song of triumph, and thanketh God, 58 with an exhortation to the Corinthians that they would continue steadfast in the faith.
\p
\v 1 Furthermore brethren I make known unto you, [That is, I bring again in your remembrance] the Gospel that I publish unto you, [Gr. Evangelized] which also ye received, [namely, by faith] in which also ye stand. [that is, he remained steadfast hitherto.]
\p
\v 2 . By which ye are all saved, [Or, shall be saved] if ye retain it in such wise as I declared unto you: [or, remember with what speech or words] except that ye believed in vain. [namely, which comes to pass when men do not persevere in the faith, which then would be an argument of no true in faith. See Gal. 3.4.]
\p
\v 3 . For first of all [That is, principally, as the first and principal articles of our Christian religion, 1 Cor. 2.2. 2 Tim. 2.8. Or, among the first, namely, principles of the Gospel, Heb. 6.2.] I deliver over [namely, by teaching and preaching] unto you, that which also I received, [namely, from God and our Lord Jesus Christ. See 1 Cor. 11.23. So that this is not a doctrine signed by me or any men, but come from God, and given us by him to publish unto men] that Christ died for our sins. [namely, thereby to satisfy for the same for our reconciliation, 1 Pet. 3.18.] according to the Scriptures. [namely, of the Old Testament. See Acts 26.22. Rom. 1.2. Eph. 2.20.]
\p
\v 4 . And that he was buried, and that he was raised up the third day according to the Scriptures:
\p
\v 5 . And that he was seen of Cephas, [That is, of Peter: see of this name, John 1.43. 1 Cor. 1.12. Gal. 2.9.] afterwards of the twelve, [namely, Apostles, who although they were then but eleven; the number being diminished by the falling away of Judas: nevertheless held the name of that number, seeing shortly after the same was filled again. See John 20.ver.24. Acts 1.ver.25.]
\p
\v 6 . Afterward he was seen of more than five hundred brethren at once, [When this was done is not set down by the evangelists. Some think that it was done on the mount of Olives when he ascended into heaven, Luke 24.50. acts 1.9. Others think that this was done in Galilee, where he had many disciples. See Mat. 28.7.] Of whom the greater-(part) is yet remaining, [Gr. remain until now, i.e. are yet alive] and some also are fallen asleep. [that is, are dead. See Psa. 13.4. Dan. 12.2. Mat.9.24. and chap. 27.52. Acts 7.60. 1 Cor. 7.39. & 11.30. and here also, v.18.20,51.]
\p
\v 7 . Afterward he was seen of James [Amongst the Apostles there were two, who were called James, one that was the son of Zebedee and brother of John, Mat. 4.21. & 10.2. killed by Herod. Acts 12.2. and one that was a son of Alpheus, surnamed the little, Mark 15.40. and the Lords brother, Gal. 1.19. because he was a son of the sister of our Lords mother. See the annot. On Mark 15.40. Acts. 12.2.17. and 15.13. Of which of the two this must understood is uncertain, seeing the Evangelists make no mention of this appearing neither] afterwards of all the Apostles. [whereby some understand either the eleven Apostles being gathered all together in one: and that ver. 5. the same are also understood, when they were gathered together without Thomas, John 20.24. But others understand it, not only of the twelve, ver.5. but also of all the rest which were sent forth by him to preach the Gospel. Luke 10.1. Rom. 16.7.]
\p
\v 8 . And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born untimely. [The Apostle compares himself hitherto, in respect of his sudden and unexpected conversion and calling, which is described, Acts 9. and happened after that the Lord Christ was ascended into heaven: and because he had before persecuted Christ.]
\p
\v 9 . For I am the least of the Apostles, who am not worthy [Gr. not sufficient] to be called an Apostle, because that I persecuted the Church of God.
\p
\v 10 . Yet by the grace of God I am that I am: [Namely, a believing Christian, and besides that an Apostle of the Lord] and his grace which (was showed to) me [or, in me, towards me] was not in vain, [that is, not without the bringing forth much fruit] but I laboured more abundantly, [namely, both in the execution of the Apostleship, and in the enduring of all manner of affliction and persecution, which he describes, 2 Cor. 11.] then they all: [namely, the other Apostles, which were called before Christ’s ascension, and conversed with him upon Earth: as also in following verse] yet not I, [namely, as working that by mine own abilities, forasmuch as I am but an instrument thereof] but the grace of God which is with me. [that is, which God hath showed me, and whereby he blessed my labour.]
\p
\v 11 . Whether therefore it be I, or it be they,[Namely, the other Apostles, see ver.10] so we preach [namely, that Christ dyed for our sins, was buried and rose from the dead. See ver. 3.4.] and so ye believe.
\p
\v 12 . Now if Christ he preached [Namely, by me and by the other Apostles] that he was raised from the dead, how say, [that is, how can that stand which some say. This question imports a reprehension and showing of the absurdity of this error] some among you [so then this error was not common of the whole Church; but of some only, whose names are not expressed as 2 Tim. 2.17. that by shaming them he may not affright them from conversion] that there is [that is, shall be in the last coming of Christ] no resurrection of the dead.
\p
\v 13 . And if there be no resurrection of the dead, neither is Christ risen. [That is, then this absurdity must follow from thence that Christ is not raised from the dead. The reason hereof is, Because Christ is the head, and the faithful his members, who together make one body. If the members should not be made alive, then neither were the head alive. For it would be a deformed body, whereof the head was alive and members were and remained dead.]
\p
\v 14 . And if Christ be not be raised up, then our preaching [That is, mine and the other Apostles] is vain, [that is, false untrue] and your faith is also vain. [that is, faith hath no firm ground, and shall not obtain the end of the same which is the salvation of your souls]
\p
\v 15 . And we also are found false witnesses of God: for we have testified of God [Or, because we have testified against God, &c.] that he hath raised up Christ: whom he hath not raised up, if namely the dead be not raised up.
\p
\v 16 . For if the dead be not raised up, then neither is Christ raised up. [The reason of this consequence see in the annot. On v.13.]
\p
\v 17 . And Christ be not raised up, then is your in vain, [Namely, forasmuch as ye believe that Christ was delivered over to death because of your sins, and was raised up for your justification, Rom,4.25. which should be believed in vain if he were not raised up, see v. 14.] ye are yet in your sins [that is, yet subject to condemnation for your sins, seeing it would be an evidence that Christ had not satisfied for your sins, if he had remained in death.]
\p
\v 18 . Then they are also lost [That is, damned eternally] who are fallen asleep [that is, dead, see v.6.] in Christ. That is, in the faith of Christ, and in the hope of a blessed resurrection by Christ, 1 Thess. 4.14. Rev. 14.13.]
\p
\v 19 . If only in this life we are hoping in Christ: [that is, respecting only those things, or only for those things which concerns this life, and which might accrue to us in this life: which would be, if there should be no resurrection of the dead] we are the most miserable of all men. [Gr. more miserable. For Christians do not only deny worldly pleasure, but are also subject to many, crosses, afflictions and persecutions for the confession of the truth.]
\p
\v 20 .But now Christ is raised from the dead, [That is, by the former arguments it appears that it is certain that Christ is raised up from the dead] (and) is become the first fruits, [that is, seeing he is first risen, from thence it follows that they also who are fallen asleep in him shall be raised up: even as by the first fruits being offered up to God, the whole mass thereof was sanctified, Exod. 22.29. Deu. 26.1. Rom. 11.16.] of them that are fallen asleep. [namely, in Christ. See v.18.]
\p
\v 21 . For seeing death is by man, [Namely, Adam, v.22.] the resurrection of the dead is also [that is, God hath also ordained that the raising up of the dead should be done by one man] by a man. [Namely, Christ, v.22.]
\p
\v 22 . For as they all dye [That is, have pulled and brought upon them the guilt and necessity of dying, or of temporal death (for of that only is spoken here) in Adam, [Or, by Adam, that is, by the sin which Adam committed and all his posterity in him, as being in his loins, Rom. 5.12.] so also in Christ [or by Christ] shall they all [namely, the faithful who are fallen asleep in Christ, as the opposition here requires. For although Christ shall raise up all men in general, even the ungodly and unrighteous, as their just Judge, to punish them eternally in body and soul, Mat. 25.32. John 5.28. Acts 24.15. 2 Cor. 5.10. Rev. 20.v.12,13. yet notwithstanding here are understood those that are Christ’s, and whom he shall raise up as their head, of whom he is the first fruits, v.23.] be made alive. [that is, raised up from the dead: for thereof is spoken here, not of spiritual making alive.]
\p
\v 23 . But every one in his order, [Namely, of the time thereunto appointed by God] the first-fruits Christ, [that is, even as betwixt the offering up of the first fruits, and the gathering of the first fruits, there were some time between both, Exod. 23.16. and 34.22. So also there is time betwixt the resurrection of Christ and of believers] afterwards they that are Christ’s, [that is, who belong to him, who are his members, ingraffed into him by a true faith. See the annot. On the former verse] in his coming [namely, to judge the quick and the dead at the last day.]
\p
\v 24 . Afterward shall the end be, [Namely, of this present age or world. Or of this government of Christ, which he now administers a mediator] when he [namely, Christ] shall have delivered over the Kingdome, [namely, that he now executes as mediator, gathering his Church by the preaching of the word, regenerating the same by his spirit, and defending it by his power against its enemies. For that shall be no more necessary then] to God and the Father: [that is, to God, who is the Father, namely, of Christ, and also of the faithful, John 20.17.] when he shall have done away [not only that they have not the upper hand, but also that they be no more] all dominion, and all authority and power: [this some understand of all superiors, lawful and good also, for they shall be no longer needful then: Others of all dominion and power whether it be of unclean spirits, or men who have opposed the Kingdome of Christ.]
\p
\v 25 . For he must reign as King, [That is, accomplish his Kingly-office as mediator. Therefore that which is said, Psa. 110.1. (to which the Apostle here alludes) that he should sit at the right hand of God, as here interpreted by the Apostle to reign as King, as also in the same Psalm v.2. rule thou in the midst of thine Enemies] until [therefore as long as this is not accomplished, Christ shall not raise up the faithful from the dead. And afterwards he shall cease to reign or rule in such a manner as he now doth as mediator] he shall have put all Enemies [namely, of his Kingdome and chiefly the Devil and all his instruments, who oppose him, or will not have him to reign over them, Luke 19.27.] under his feet. [that is, shall have wholly overcome and destroyed them. See John 10.24.]
\p
\v 26 The last [That is, which shall last be overcome and abolished] enemy, [namely, of the life and salvation of men. For death destroyeth life, and is thereby as an enemy of nature] which is done away [that is, is taken away, and instead thereof life is given again by resurrection. See v.54.] is death. [namely, temporal and bodily death: for of that here is spoken.]
\p
\v 27 . For he [Namely, God the Father] hath subjected all things, [and consequently all Enemies also, amongst which is temporal death] unto his [namely, Christ’s. See a large exposition of this place, Heb. 2.6.] feet. [that is, put under him, to abolish whatsoever is an Enemy, that it may mot more hurt his Kingdome] But when he saith, that all things are subject unto (him) it is manifest, that he is expected [namely, God the Father. Or that it is without him] who hath subjected all things unto him. [Namely, to Christ.]
\p
\v 28 . And when all things shall be subjected unto him, then shall the Son himself also become subject unto him. [Namely, having laid aside not his divine nature and power, but this manner of administering his mediatory office, which as an ambassador of the Father, he shall then perfectly have accomplished and executed] who hath subjected all things unto him, that God [namely, the Father] may be all in all. [that is, from thenceforth may immediately glorify his Church by himself as true God with the Son and Holy Ghost.]
\p
\v 29 . Otherwise what they do [That is, what profit and advantage shall they obtain for doing that] who are baptized [or use baptizing. This is diversely interpreted. Some understand of the Sacrament of baptizing by which we have communion in the death of Christ, and openly testify that we will be accounted as for the dead and mortified to the world, Rom. 6.v.23. Others understand it of those who are so baptized with the cross and persecution, that they are as it were in a continual death. For so the word baptize is sometime taken, Mark 10.38. Luke 12.50. Some understand it of those that washed the bodies of the dead, seeing the words to be baptized for the dead, may also well be translated to baptize over the dead, that is wash, which custom was usually in the times of the Apostles, Acts 9.v37. and the word baptize sometimes signifies also to wash, Mark 7.4. Luke 11.38. Heb. 9.10. which also doth not ill agree with the scope of the Apostle] for the dead, [or over the dead] if the dead be not at all raised up? Wherefore are they also baptized for the dead?
\p
\v 30 . Why also are we [Namely, Apostles, Teachers, and also believers] every hour in danger? [namely, of losing not only our goods and good name, but also our lives for Christ’s sake. This should be done by us to no purpose if there were no resurrection.]
\p
\v 31 . I dye every day [that is, I am not only in danger of my life, but I am daily seized upon, by so many tribulations, that my life is rather a continual death than a life, 2 Cor. 11. 23. See hereof 1 Cor. 4. and 2 Cor. Ch. 11 & 12.] (which I testify) by our glorying which we have in Christ Jesus our Lord. [that is, by the faithfulness which I have showed in the cause of Christ, whereof I may justify glory. Others by your glorying, i.e. by the glorying which I have concerning you, that I have brought you to the faith by my ministry. See 2 Cor. 7. 4.]
\p
\v 32 . If according to man [That is, as it sometimes fares with men. Or that I may also speak something of myself as men use to do, Rom. 3. 5. 2Cor. 11. v. 16, 17, 21.] I have fought against beasts at Ephesus in the Theater, to be torn by them, being notwithstanding wonderfully delivered from it by God. But seeing Luke describing that which happened unto him in Ephesus, Acts 19. makes no mention hereof, therefore some understand this improperly of the contest which the Apostle had in Ephesus with his Adversaries, whom he compared to wild beasts, because they sought to tear and destroy him, as he also compares the Emperor Nero to a lion, 2 Tim. 4. 17.] what profit is it to me if the dead be not raised up? [this may also be fitly joined with the following words] Let us eat and drink, [that is, let us live in pleasures, and make good cheer every day. The Apostle rehearseth the words which the Epieureans are wont to use, being also rehearsed, Isa. 22. 13. and meaneth that therein they were in the right if there should be no resurrection ] for tomorrow [that is, very suddenly] we die. [that is, we shall by death be taken away out of this life.]
\p
\v 33 . Do not err [That is, suffer not your selves to be seduced by such speeches of the Europeans] evil communications corrupt good manners. [or evil converse. This is a verse taken out of a Heathen Poet Menander , wherewith Paul confutes the former speech of the Epicureans, showing the hurt which such speeches bring with them.]
\p
\v 34 . Awake [Namely, out of the sleep of security] righteously, [that is, truly in earnest. Or to walk righteously] and sin not. [that is, take heed that ye do not fall into the abominable sin of Epicurism and security] For some [namely, of your church, as v. 12.] have not the knowledge of God. [namely, the right knowledge: such as are they that deny the resurrection of the dead] I say it to your shame. [that is, that you might be ashamed that there are among you those that follow such gross and dangerous errors: and thereby be moved the better to flee from such errors.]
\p
\v 35 . But some one [Namely, of those Epicureans ] will say, [that is, object against this] how shall the dead be raised up? [Gr. how are the dead raised up, i.e. how is it possible that the dead, whose bodies are perished, rotten, eaten of beasts, or burnt with fire, etc. should be made alive again] and with what manner of body shall they come? [this question is answered, v. 37. & c.]
\p
\v 36 . Thou fool, [This the Apostle saith, not to revile, Mat. 5. 22. but to show their ignorance in this matter, Gal. 3. 1.] that which thou sowest, becomes not alive [Gr. is not made alive, i.e. grows not up, brings forth no fruits: for even the growing things of the Earth have their life] except it be dead. [that is, rotten in the Earth. If therefore it be not impossible that a rotten seed or grain spring up again and grow, as we daily see in our fields, and in our gardens, so neither is it impossible that God should make the rotten bodies alive again.]
\p
\v 37 . And that which thou sowest, (thereof) thou sowest not the body that should be, [That is, that shall come forth and grow out of the seed that is sown] but a bare grain, [namely, that seems to be withered and dead] according as it happens [that is, as for example] of wheat, or of any of the other (grains) [or of the other seeds.]
\p
\v 38 . But God gives the same a body [ That is, although in the first creation God gave the Earth power to bring forth herbs, corn and fruits, yet notwithstanding so it is, that he himself by his omnipotence produceth also daily such plants according to his pleasure, Psa. 104. 13, 14. & c. 1 Cor. 3. 7.] even as he will, and to every seed his own body. [that is, being of the same fort, of which the seed is whence from it appears.]
\p
\v 39 . All flesh [Seeing it might be objected, that for as much as the flesh of the other beasts is not raised up, so neither shall the flesh of men be raised up, in regard that it seemeth to be of one kind: the Apostle answereth that there is difference between flesh of men and of other living creatures. The reason is not exprest, but this is the principal, because the flesh of men was enlivened by a reasonable and immortal soul, and the bodies other living creatures by an unreasonable soul, which die and perish with the body: and also because God will forever show his grace and justice according to body and soul on reasonable men, not on unreasonable creatures] is not the same flesh: [that is, of one condition : to that it must go with the one flesh as it doth with the other] but another is the flesh of men, and another is the flesh of beasts, and another of fishes, and another of fowls.
\p
\v 40 . And there are heavenly bodies, [That is, which are in heaven, or endued with heavenly qualities : as be the stars of heaven, and as the glorified bodies of the faithful shall be] and there are earthly bodies, [that is, which either are come forth out of the Earth, or are on the Earth, and subject to earthly qualities] but another is the glory [that is, the shinning or quality] of the heavenly, and another of the earthly,
\p
\v 41 . Another is the glory of the Sun, [That is, there is difference also amongst the bodies themselves which are in heaven as concerning their shining] and another is the glory of the Moon, and another is the glory of the stars: [that is, of the other stars. For the Sun and the Moon are stars also] for (one) star differeth in glory from (another) star.
\p
\v 42 . So also shall resurrection of the dead. [That is, as there is difference between flesh and flesh, and between bodies and bodies in glory; so also in the resurrection there shall be difference betwixt the qualities of our bodies which we now have on earth, and which we shall have after the resurrection in Heaven] The (body) is sown in corruption, it is raised up in incorruption. [that is, these our bodies, which we now have upon Earth, are laid down being now subject to corruption: but the same being raised up shall from thenceforth be incorruptible: remaining indeed the same bodies, but endued with other qualities.]
\p
\v 43 . It is sown in dishonour, [That is, being a dead body, that is ugly and unpleasant to see and handle. See Phil. 3.21. it is raised up in glory. [that is, beautiful and shining as the Stars and the Sun, Mat. 13.43. and 17.2.] It is sown in weakness, [that is, being subject to all kind of weakness, sickness and deformity] it is raised up in power. [namely, to withstand and keep off corruption, and to move itself powerfully and speedily even as man will.]
\p
\v 44 . There is a sown natural body, [Gr. animal, i.e. which is moved by the soul in all natural operations, tending to nourishing, motion, generation and the like] there is raised up a spiritual body. [not in respect of essence, but also in respect of the spiritual qualities wherewith it shall be abandoned, and because it shall be moved by the Spirit of God, the soul being filled with the light of the Spirit] There is a natural body; and there is a spiritual body. [that is, it appears therefore that there are two sorts of bodies ascribed to man, not in respect of the essence but by reason of the qualities: being here a natural body, and shall here after be a spiritual body.]
\p
\v 45 . So it is also written [Namely, Gen. 2.7.] The first man Adam is become a living soul. [that is, after that God had formed his body out of the dust of the Earth, he breathed unto him a reasonable and immortal soul, whereby the body is made alive and is moved: and so besides the understanding, he also received an animal or natural life, like as other living creatures] The last Adam [namely, Jesus Christ, who is also opposed to the first, Rom.5.17.18.19. These words are not here related as written there or any where else, but are by the Apostle opposed to what which is spoken of the first Adam, namely, that like as we have received from the first Adam a natural or animal body, so also by the second Adam, namely, Christ, we shall obtain a spiritual body] a quickening Spirit. [that is, by the union of the humane nature with the eternal divine nature, which is a quickening spiritual body, which is immortal and incorruptible, so shall he also give such bodies unto all of those that are descended from him, not by natural procreation, but by a supernatural regeneration. For each Adam communicates to his posterity such as he hath.]
\p
\v 46 . But the spiritual [Namely, body, ver.44.] is not first, [the Apostle hereby answers that which any one might object, why doth not Christ give us such spiritual bodies as soon as we are regenerated? And saith that all things must be done in order, that the natural must go before, and the spiritual follow after, as the perfect followeth upon that which is imperfect] but the natural, afterward the spiritual.
\p
\v 47 . The first man [Namely, Adam] is out of the Earth [namely, in respect of the dust where his body was made, Gen. 2.7.] earthly; [that is, having a body that was earthly, and since the fall have become mortal and corruptible, Gen. 3.17. Gr. of dust, namely, of the Earth] the second man [namely, Christ who is a true man, and is called the second by reason of the time, because he came after the first, as Mat. 3.11. John 1.27. and was an antitype of the first, Rom. 5.v.14.] as is interpreted in the following verses. Others read is Heavenly out of heaven: the better to give the opposition its full members. But all Greek books read, the Lord out of heaven, and that also agrees well with the opposition; seeing the Apostle here opposeth to each other, not the original of the bodies, but the descent and worthiness of both these persons, each of whom impart such bodies to those of that are descended from them as they have themselves, ver. 48. And he is said to be from heaven, not in respect that his humane nature was produced of any heavenly matter, but in respect that he being man is also true God in one person, who being now in heaven hath a glorified bodywhich is adorned with heavenly and spiritual qualities.]
\p
\v 48 . What manner of one earthly (is) [That is, what manner of the body Adam had after the fall, namely, mortal and corruptible] such also are the earthly; [that is, such body have also all men descended from him in a natural way, as long as they are upon earth] and what manner of one the heavenly (is,) [that is, such a body as Christ now hath in heaven: namely, glorified, immortal, incorruptible, &c.] such also are the heavenly. [that is, such bodies shall all believers have also, after that they shall be raised up from the dead, and shall be taken up into heaven. And from hence it clearly appears that the Apostle speaks not of any diversity in the essence of the bodies, but only in the qualities.]
\p
\v 49 . And like as we have born the image of the earthly, [That is, are here conformable to Adam in mortality and corruptibility, Gen. 5.3.] (so) shall we also bear the image of the heavenly. [that is, so shall we also be conformable unto Christ in glory and immortality, Rom. 8.v.17.18,19. Phil. 3.21. 1 John 3.2.]
\p
\v 50 . But this I say brethren, that the flesh blood [That is, such bodies as are corruptible as flesh and blood is in this life, and that in respect that they are such as is declared in that which followed. See Gal. 1.16. Eph. 6.12. Heb. 2.14.] cannot inherit [that is, obtained as by inheritance, i.e. by grace and not by merit. See Mat. 25.34.] the Kingdome of God, neither doth corruption [that is, a body which is subject to corruption. The Apostle expressed only the quality, to show that he speaketh not of the essence, but qualities of the bodies. See. V.48.] inherit incorruption. [that is, eternal life which is incorruptible and unperishing. Which seeing believers shall posses both in soul and body, then followeth that their bodies also must be immortal. For mortality and immortality are repugnant one to another, and cannot stand together.]
\p
\v 51 . Behold I tell you a mystery, [That is, a thing which hitherto was unknown to all men, even to the Prophets and Apostles] We shall not indeed all [namely, men who then shall live, 1 Thes. 4.17. For the day of Christ’s coming is uncertain] fall asleep, [that is, dye, which doth not contradict that which is, Heb. 9.27. For there is spoken of the ordinary law of nature, and not of that which in the last of the world God will do to some. This change also shall be to such instead of death] but we shall all be changed: [that is, of the mortal become immortal, which shall not only to believers but also to unbelievers: but several ends: to these that they may be subject to eternal death, and to them that they may enjoy everlasting happiness; and also in divers manners, the bodies of believers being cloathed with glory, and of unbelievers with ignominy, Dan. 12.2. John 5.29. And this change shall come to pass not in the essence of the bodies, but in their qualities, v.48.]
\p
\v 52 . In a point (of time) [That is, exceeding speedily and swiftly] in the twinkling of an eye, with the last trumpet, [that is, with a great a fearful sound, as is that of the cornets and trumpets. The sound is called the voice of the Son of God, John 5.28. a cry and a voice of the Arch-angel, and Trumpet of God, 1 Thes. 4.16.] for the Trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, [that is, who shall have dyed before that time] and we shall be changed. [namely, who shall live at that time. See v.51.]
\p
\v 53 . For this corruptible [Namely, body which we now have and bear, Job 19.26,27.] must [the reason of this necessity is shown v. 50.] put on [namely, as a new garment. See 2 Cor. 5. 2. 3. The same essence then shall remain, but they shall lay aside their old mortal condition, and put on immortality as a new garment and ornament. And this shall be the change of which is spoken before] incorruption, and this mortal (must) put on immortality.
\p
\v 54 . And when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall the word come to pass [namely, Isa. 25. 8.] death [this is understood of temporal death in respect of the faithful, and may also be understood of eternal death. But the Apostle applies it here to temporal death, as appears by that which went before] is swallowed up [namely, by Christ, v. 57. i.e. wholly taken away, that there shall be no more death or dying amongst men. See the like phrase, 2 Cor. 5. 4.] unto victory. [that is, that it is wholly overcome, taken away, and abolished, Rev. 21. 4. The Hebrew word which Esay useth here may also be translated for ever.]
\p
\v 55 . O death [This is as a triumphant song which the Apostle sings upon the overcoming of death, taken as it seems out of the Prophet Hosea, chap. 13. v. 14. although with some alteration and addition of words] where is thy sting ? [namely, wherewith thou wast wont to give us men the deadly sting] O bell [or grave, for the Hebrew word Scheol and the Greek word Hades, which are here used by the Prophet and by the Apostle, signifieth both. And it seemeth that here it principally signifieth the grave, seeing the Apostle here treats of the doing away of the temporal death] where is thy victory? [namely, whereby thou hast hitherto held the dead under thy force, which then thou must render again, and not be able any longer to hold under thy power. See Rev. 20. 13, 14.]
\p
\v 56 . Now the sting of death is sin, [For because of sin death hath power over us, and for this cause is as the weapon to kill us, Rom. 5. 12. and 6. 23.] and the power of sin is the Law. [For sin is not known nor imputed but by the Law: and when the Law forbids us any thing, our corrupt flesh strives against it so much the more, to do that which is forbidden. See Rom. 5. 13. and chap. 7, 8, 13.]
\p
\v 57 . But thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory [Namely, of those forenamed & all other enemies] by our Lord Jesus Christ. [who hath brought this victory to pass not for himself but for us, when by his death he perfectly satisfied for sin according to the demand of the Law, and by the power of his resurrection regenerates our souls and at the last day shall raise up our bodies in glory.]
\p
\v 58 . So then any beloved brethren, be ye steadfast [Or, well-grounded, namely, in the faith] unmovable [namely, against the stormy winds or water-floods of temptations] always being abundant [that is, in the work that the Lord by the ministry of the Apostles hath wrought in your hearts, or which he commands us that we shall do, John 6. 29.] as who know [that is, are assured by Gods promises] that your labour is not vain [that is, shall not be without fruit and gracious recompense] in the Lord.
\c 16
\s 1. The Apostle exhorts the Church of Corinth that after the example of the Churches of Galatia they would make a collection for the poor believers in Jerusalem. 2. Showeth them, how the same may be fitly done on the first day of the week, 3. and by whom sent thither, offering also his own service for this purpose. 5. Promiseth that he will come through Macedonia unto them and tarry for a time with them. 8. Gives reason why he must tarry yet at Ephesus until Pentecost. 10. Exhorts them that they should courteously receive Timothy, and let him depart, and that they should take it in good part that Apollo somewhat defers his coming. 13. Adds thereunto a general exhortation to steadfastness in the faith and love, 15. and in particular that they have the household of Stephanus in esteem, seeing he with Fortunatus and Achaicus greatly refreshed him. 19. Salutes the Church of Corinth from the Church of Asia, particularly from Aquila and Priscilla, 21. and salutes them also himself with his own hand. 22. Denounceth a curse to all that do not truly love Christ. 23. Wisheth the faithful the grace of God, and promiseth his love.
\p
\v 1 Now concerning the collection [Namely, of money which was collected of the Church] which (is made) for the Saints [that is, for the poor believers being at Jerusalem, amongst whom there was great want, as well by reason of the death foretold by Agabus, Acts 11. 28. as also because of the hard persecution against that church, which was thereby necessitated to request relief of the churches of Greece which then flourished. Of this collection see also, Rom. 15. 25, 26. 2 Cor. 8. 1. Gal. 2. 10.] even as I have ordained [namely, in what manner and time this collection may fitly be ordered and made] to the churches Galatia, [See of these churches, Gal. 1. 2.] do ye so also. [that is, imitate their example, as well in liberal giving, Rom. 12. 13. as in observing the order in collecting, which is described in the following verse.]
\p
\v 2 . On every first (day) [Gr, one. Hebr. See the like phrase, Gen. 1. 5. Dan. 1. 9. See also Mat. 28. 1. Mark 16. 9. Luke 24. 1.] of the week, [ Gr. of the Sabbaths’, whereby the whole week is often denominated. See Mark 16. 9. John 20. 1. The first day is by John called the Lords day, Rev. 1. 10. because the Lord Christ rose from the dead that day. On this day the Apostles used to hold their assemblies, John 20. 19, 26. Acts 20. 7.] let every one of you [namely, member of your church, who hath any means] lay away (somewhat) [namely to be given for the necessary supply of the poor: for to lay away somewhat now and then doth not burden so much, and many littles make a great] by himself, gathering a treasure, [that is, so in time, bringing as it were treasure together. Or being assured that thereby you shall gather yourselves a treasure in heaven, Mat. 6. 20.] according as he hath obtained welfare, [the Greek word properly signifies to have a good way or journey, as Rom. 1. 10. and is by a similitude taken for all manner of prosperity. Every one must give then according as God hath blessed him, 2 Cor. 8. 12.] that the gatherings may not then (first) be made when I shall be come. [namely, which then in hast cannot be made so conveniently and beneficial for the poor.]
\p
\v 3 . And when I shall be come, whom ye shall judge fit [Namely, faithfully to carry over the gathered alms] by letters, [this by letters may be joined with the foregoing word judge fit, in this sense, whom you your selves by letters unto me shall name and give notice of, that ye judge them fit and faithful for this purpose. Or with the following word I will send, namely with my letters of recommendation to the Church of Jerusalem] the same will I send to carry over your gift [Gr. your grace, i.e. your alms which ye shall give them of mere goodness and mercy, by the grace of God. See 2 Cor. 8. 1.] unto Jerusalem.
\p
\v 4 . And if it may be worth (the trouble) [Or be needful] that I my(self) should go also, [the Apostle offers his service willingly to take that pains if it should be thought needful: which he also did, as appears Acts 24. 17. & Rom. 15. 25.] they shall go with me.
\p
\v 5 . But I will come unto you when I shall have gone through Macedonia, [So then the Apostle when he wrote this Epistle was yet not come into Macedonia, but it appears from ver. 8. and 19. that then he was yet at Ephesus. From whence it followeth that is not certain which is subscribed unto this Epistle, that it should be written at Phillipi, which was a City lying in Macedonia, Acts 16. 12.] (For I shall go through Macedonia.)
\p
\v 6 . And it may be [That is, if God permit it. See ver. 7. Jam. 4. 15.] I shall tarry with you, or also winter (with you) [that is, abide with you the whole winter through, that you may sufficiently make use of my service] that ye [that is, some of your Church, whom you shall appoint thereunto] may conduct me, whither soever I shall travel. [namely, whether it be to Jerusalem, if it be found needful that I my self shall do this service, or shall travel any where else to spread abroad the Gospel.]
\p
\v 7 .For I will not see now in passing by, [Or, as traveling through, without tarrying with you] but I hope to stay some time with you, if the Lord shall permit it. [seeing he by his sprit especially guides our journeys wither so ever he will send us: and by the same also hinders us, that we may not go wither we purposed. See example thereof Acts 16. 7. See also Jer. 10.23. Rom. 1.10. Jam. 4.15.]
\p
\v 8 . But I will tarry at Ephesus [Where he had been two years, Acts 19.ver.10.] until the (day of) Pentecost. [see of this word the annotate. On Acts 2.1. and 20.16.]
\p
\v 9 . For a great and powerful [In respect of the powerful blessing which the Lord giveth for the propagating of the gospel, and the conversion of many] door [that is, here is good opportunity given me to spread abroad the Gospel. See Acts 14.27. 2 Cor. 2.12 Revel. 3.8.] is opened to me, and there are many adversaries. [namely, which seek to hinder the course of the Gospel: wherefore my presence here is yet necessary to withstand the same, and to strengthen the Church against them.]
\p
\v 10 . Now if Timothy come, [See of him, Acts 16.1. and 1 Tim. 1.2. Him Paul had sent with Eraftus to visit the Churches, Acts 19.22.] see that he may be with you without fear; [namely, of the enemies of the Gospel as well of the Gentiles, as of the false brethren, who procured much trouble to the upright teachers of the Gospel and brought them into danger] for he worketh the work of the Lord, [namely, of the preaching of the Gospel , 1 Tim. 3.1.] even as I, [who publisheth the Gospel, and executes the ministry of the word with like diligence and faithfulness as I, Phil. 2.20. although he was no Apostle but an Evangelist, 2 Tim. 4.5.]
\p
\v 11 . Therefore let no man despise him, [Namely, because of his youth, 1 Tim.4.12.] but conduct him in peace [that is, that he may come unto me certainly and prosperously without trouble and danger] that he may come unto me: for I expect him with the brethren.
\p
\v 12 . And as concerning Apollo [See of this Apollo Acts 18 ver.24. etc. and 19.1. 1 Cor. 1.12.] and chap. 3. ver.6.22.] the brother, I greatly [Gr. much] entreated him [or, exhorted him] that he would come unto you with the brethren: but it was altogether not (his) will, [thereof without doubt he had weighty reasons: some think that by his presence he might not harden the party which said I am of Apollo, 1 Cor. 1.12.] that he should come now: but he come when it shall be convenient for him.
\p
\v 13 . Watch, [Namely, against the wiles and snares of Satan, 1 Pet. 5.8.] stand in the faith, [that is, continue steadfast, 1 Cor. 15.58.] carry yourselves like men, [namely, in all troubles and dangers, that you may courageously overcome the same] be strong [namely, in soul, endured with a spiritual strength, thereby to withstand and overcome all temptations.]
\p
\v 14 . Let all your things be done in love. [This exhortation the Apostle propounded before at large chap. 13. and he researcheth the same here in the conclusion of the Epistle, forasmuch as it is very necessary to take away all divisions and schism, which commonly arise for want of love.]
\p
\v 15 . And I beseech you brethren, ye know the house [That is, the household] of Stephanas, [see of him 1 Cor. 1.16.] It seemeth that he was a deacon of the Church of Corinth, and a man of worth] that it the first fruits of Achaia, [that the same was among the first in Achaia who received the Gospel and were converted unto Christ, and baptized by myself, 1 Cor. 16. Epenetus is also called, Rom. 16.5. because lealo was one of the first: who are therefore the mote to be commended and to be held in esteem] and (that) they have fitted themselves [Gr. ordained, i.e. have freely and wholly given themselves to that service; to wit when they were lawfully called thereunto, Acts 6.ver.3.5.] to the service of the Saints. [that is, to serve poor believers by gathering and distributing of alms, and affording them other relief, Acts 6.1. Rom. 15.ver.25.]
\p
\v 16 .That you also submit your selves [Namely, not only by obedience in the things concerning their ministry, but also by reverence for their ministry sake, Eph. 5.21.] to such, and every one that worketh together [namely, with them, in the same or the like ministry, all which must be held in honour for the ministry sake, 1 Thes. 5.13.] and laboureth.
\p
\v 17 . And I rejoice for the coming of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus, [These three had traveled from Corinth to Paul, to make known to him the state of the Church there, whom he, to free them from all evil suspicion commendeth, and declared that their coming was acceptable to him] for these had fulfilled that which (I) lacked in you. [namely, your absence, i.e. I was delighted with their coming, as if in these few I had had all rest of the members of the Church of Corinth with me.]
\p
\v 18 . For they have refreshed [Or given rest, namely by their conferences and informations of the condition of your Church] my spirit, [that is, my soul, my heart] and yours (also) [namely, because I am assured that ye shall understand that my soul is refreshed, yours also will be refreshed therewith] acknowledge [that is, hold in good esteem, repute and love] therefore them that are such.
\p
\v 19 . The Churches of Asia [Therefore the Apostle was then in Asia, and not in Macedonia. See ver.5.8.] Salute you. Aquila and Priscilla [see of these Rom. 16.3.] These were departed with Paul from Corinth to Ephesus, Acts 18.2.] Salute you very much in the Lord, with the Church which is at their house. [See also Rom. 16.5.]
\p
\v 20 . All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss. [See the annotate. On Rom. 16.16.]
\p
\v 21 . The salutation of Paul with my own hand [Namely, with which I have subsigned this Epistle. It seemeth that the Apostle had special manner to subscribe his hand which was known in the Churches, with mine own hand, of Paul. See Col. 4.18. and 2 Thes. 3.17. that his Epistle might be better be discerned from others, and that he used also to set the following Apostolical with ver. 23. under all his Epistles with his own hand.]
\p
\v 22 . If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be a curse, [Gr. Anathema, of which word see Rom. 9.3. Gal. 1.8.] Maranatha. [this is a Chalde or Syriack word, which seems to have been usual then, to express a very great curse, which by the Hebrews is called Cherem. And signifieth as some think the Lord cometh or our Lord cometh. This curse the Apostle pronounced upon impenitent persons, not out of the evil motion of the mind, but out of an Apostolic spirit, and holy zeal. See Jud. Ver.14.15.]
\p
\v 23 . The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you. [This is the ordinary conclusion of all the Epistles of the Apostle.]
\p
\v 24 . My love [Seeing the Apostle propounds some in the Epistle some what hard; therefore he here declares that the same is done not out of ill will, but out of love to them] be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
\p * The first Epistle to the Corinthians, was written from Philipi, [That this is not very credible see the exposition on ver. 5 .8.19. And from hence it appears, as also from some other, that those words which are set after the conclusion of the Epistle of the Apostles, not always firm, and were added thereunto only by the judgment of some men] and (sent) by Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus, and Timotheus.
