\mt2 THE SECOND EPISTLE OF THE APOSTLE PAUL TO THE
\mt CORINTHIANS
\s The Argument of this Epistle.
\p IN this Epistle the Apostle especially vindicates his doctrines and his Apostleship, against the pretences and slanderes of the false Apostles. And after a short introduction contained in the 7. verse of the 1. chapter he declareth in the rest of the Chapter, why according to his promises made in the former Epistle, he was not yet come unto them: namely, noy out of any unconstancy, but by reason of the grievous persecution which had oppressed him in Asia: and because he would give them time to amend the faults which he had reprehended in them: that so he might be with them in kindness. In the 2. Chapter he gives reasons of harsh writings about the tolerating of the incentious person, and exhorts them, that by reason of his grief and godly sorrow they should comfort and receive him again. In the 3. chapter he puts a difference betwixt the doctrine of the false Apostles, who urged the Law: which he calleth a killing letter, and his doctrine which is a doctrine of life and a ministry of the Spirit. In the 4. chapter he declares that they had the sound of this difference to be such amongst them, and that this Gospel was not hid bit to them that perish: and sheweth by his own example how powerful the Spirit of Christ is by this word of the cross, to bear all troubles patently. In the 5. chapter he testifieth that by the same doctrine and the Spirit of Christ we are moved willingly to lay down this Earthly Tabernacle, and to long after the better life: and lays a foundation of this longing, the doctrine of our reconciliation with God by the death of Christ, whereof the Apostles were messengers. From whence in the 6. chapter he draws very earnest and powerful exhortations to patience and godliness, and holds forth the same in his own person, in the end warning them against communion with unbelievers and Idolaters. In the 7. Chapter he testifieth the satisfaction which he had received in his mind when he understood how they had in part received his admonition, and had showed sorrow for the former failings. In the 8 and 9 chapters he treats at large of the contribution and alms, from what ground they must proceed, and to what they must be directed. And in the 10 chapter of his spiritual power which ha had received, not for destruction but for edification: whereto he adds an Apostolical glorying, showing that the false Apostles could glory of nothing, of which he could not more abundantly glory, and that therein he had many advantages above them, unto the end of the 11. Chapter. In the 12. chapter he speaks of the singular revelations, which were made to him by Christ in the third heaven, and testifieth that an Angel of Satan was therefore given him in the flesh for his humiliation: declaring how further he had walked among them as faithful Apostle of Christ, without seeking himself in any thing. Finally in the 13. he warneth them that should be stiffenecked against his admonitions, and threatens them with Apostolic power, if they did not repent. After concludes his Epistle in the 3. last verses with a wishing of all good unto them, and with the accustomed Apostolic salutation, together with an earnest prayer for them.
\c 1
\s 1 After the usual superscription of the Epistle, 3 Paul thanketh God for the consolations which he receive by Christ in all affliction, for an example unto others; 8 and cometh afterwards to the relation of the great persecution which had befallen in Asia, 10 out of which nevertheless he was delivered through their prayers. 12 Testifies that he had conversed uprightly in the world, but most of all among them, 15 and that he had also sincerely intended to come unto them again, 17 although the same was not yet done. 18 Not because his word was yea and certain, 21 and confirmed in us by the Holy Ghost, 23 but testifieth with an oath that he yet delayed his coming unto them, to spare them.
\p
\v 1 Paul [Of the name Paul, his Apostleship and and this whole Apostolic salutation, see the exposition on Rom. 1.v.1,7. and 1 Cor. 1.v.1.2,3.] an Apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Timothy the brother, [forasmuch as Timothy was sent before by him to Corinth, and now was returned unto him again, by whom he was informed the state of the Church, he here joined him with him, to procure him the repute with them, as in the first Epistle he had also joined Sosthenes with him by the same title of brother, 1 Cor. 1.1. See als 1 Cor. 16.v.10,11.] to the Church of God which is at Corinth, with all the Saints which are in all Achaia. [this is the name of a principal province in Greece, in which Corinth lay, and was the head thereof. See 1 Cor. 1.2.]
\p
\v 2 . Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 3 . Praised be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, [That is, God who is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. See 1 Cor. 15.24.] the Father of mercies, [that is, who is himself merciful towards us, and the author of all mercy and consolation in us] and the God of all Consolation.
\p
\v 4 . Who comforteth us from all our tribulation, [Namely, by his Word and by his Spirit, as Christ promiseth, Job. 14.v.16.] that we might be able to comfort those that are in all manner of tribulation, by the consolation with which we our selves are comforted of God.
\p
\v 5 . For even as the suffering of Christ [That is, which we suffer for Christ sake: or that we suffer as members of Christ, after the example of Christ, who accounts the sufferings which are put upon his members as his own, Acts 9.4. Rom. 8.17. Col. 1.24. Gr. sufferings] is abundant in us, even so also by Christ, our consolation is abundant. [namely, wherewith our selves we are comforted: and consequently also get fitness the better to comfort others, See v.4.]
\p
\v 6 . But whether we are afflicted (it is) for your consolation. [namely, not only because you should be strengthened by our example, but also because thereby we get more matter and experience to comfort and strengthen you. See the annotate on Col1.24.] and salvation, which is wrought, [that is, is brought about: or which is powerful by patience. For patience worketh experience of Gods help and faithfulness, and consequently also of hope of salvation, Rom. 5.3,4.] in the enduring of the same suffering, which we also suffer: or whether we are comforted (it is) for your consolation and salvation: [namely, because we being comforted, you also rejoice at it, and we also are the better able to comfort you, and further your salvation.]
\p
\v 7 . And our hope of you [Gr. over you] is firm, as who know that as ye have communion it the suffering, so also (ye have communion) in the consolation.
\p
\v 8 . For we will not brethren, [Here the Apostle begins to come to the handling of the matter it self, and relates the first cause that hindered him from coming to them, the exceeding great affliction in Asia, whereof may be read, Acts 19.] that ye should be ignorant of our tribulation which came upon us in Asia, that we were very exceedingly burdened, above (our) strengthen [that is, so grievously that we should have fainted under it, were it not that the Lord had wonderfully strengthened us, and kept us by his power as is declared in the two following verses] so that we were greatly in doubt, even of life.
\p
\v 9 . Ye we our selves had in our selves the sentence of death, [That is, we had already made account that we should not escape] that we might not trust in our selves, but in God, who raiseth up the dead. [that is, who then much more by the same power can deliver them that are in danger of death.]
\p
\v 10 . Who delivered us out of so great a death, [That is, out of so great a danger of death, Exod. 10.17.] and (yet) delivers: in whom we hope that he will also yet deliver (us.)
\p
\v 11 . Seeing ye also labour together (for us) by prayer, that for the gift [That is, the gracious deliverance] brought to pass on us by many persons, [that is, by the intercession of maybe] thanksgiving may (also) be made for us. [namely, who before had prayed for us. For thanksgiving must follow upon the hearing of our prayers.
\p
\v 12 . For our glorying is, The Apostle speaks thus to prevent slanders of the false Apostles, who sought to make the Apostles suspected of unstedfastness in his promise, and of lightness in all his dealings, because according to his promise in the end of the former Epistle, he was not yet come over them] (namely) the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and uprightness of God [that is, God requires of us, and whereof God is a witness] not in fleshly wisdom [that is, deceitful, such as fleshly men were wont to use, and amongst them also the false Apostles, to seduce others, and to further their own honour and profit] but in the grace of God, [that is, in the power and sincere wisdom which God of grace imparted] we have conversed in the world, and most of all [Gr. more abundantly. This Paul saith not as if he had been less uprightly elsewhere, but in respect of the long time which he have conversed among them more than in other churches, Acts 18.v.11.] with you.
\p
\v 13 . For we write unto to you no other things which ye know, [Namely, by my world and walking, when I was among you. Or read, namely, in the Epistle written to you which is clear and simple] or even acknowledge: and I hope that ye shall also acknowledge them unto the end.
\p
\v 14 . Even as ye have also acknowledged us in part, [This the Apostle saith either in respect of the best part who always willingly acknowledged this, or else in respect of the whole church who had already amended some faults upon his former writing, as appears from chapter 2.7. although they yet gave too ear to some, who too much esteemed outward respect and worldly wisdom] that we are your glorying, [i.e. that we are your teachers of whom ye glory, and by whom ye acknowledge that ye were brought to Christ] as ye also are ours. [namely, of whom we glory in Christ, that we have brought you to the knowledge and communion in Christ, and by whom ye are adorned with many spiritual gifts] in the day of the Lord Jesus. [that is, at the last day, when Christ shall appear to judge ever ones actions: which Paul adds to show, that this and their glorying was not fleshly or vain, but well grounded, and should be approved by Christ himself at the last day.]
\p
\v 15 . And in this confidence, [Namely, that ye are in such esteem with me, and I was with you] I would before come unto you, [namely, according to my writing, 1 Cor. 16.5,6,7.] that ye may have a second grace. [that is, might be more and more strengthened by me in the grace and gifts of Christ, wherewith ye were already graced in my first coming unto you.]
\p
\v 16 . And through your (City) go to Macedonia, and from Macedonia come again unto you, and by you [That is, aby some of you thereunto appointed] be conducted towards Judea.
\p
\v 17 . When therefore I purpose this, did I also use lightness? Or do I purpose it according to the flesh [That is, after the manner of carnal men, or out of fleshly considerations which are unstedfast, and come easily to be altered, 2 Cor. 10.3.] that which I purpose, that with me there should be, yea, and nay? [that is, saying, and denying: or saying and not doing that which we say.]
\p
\v 18 . But God is faithful, [A phrase when men will strongly testify any thing; and is as much as if he should say, as true as God is faithful, our word was not, etc. Or God who is faithful knows that, &c.] that our word which (was passed) to you, [namely, that preached unto you by us. For in these five following verse, the Apostle first gainsays the conclusion of the false teachers, who because the Apostle seemed not to have kept this promise of coming unto them, from thence would conclude that therefore his whole preaching was infirm and not to be relied upon. But unto the promise it self of coming to them he answers hereafter. V.23,24.] was not yea and nay. [that is, infirm and uncertain, as men who now say yea, now nay, about one and the same thing, are unstedfast and uncertain in their words and deeds.]
\p
\v 19 . For the Son of God Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, (namely) by me, and Sylvan us, and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, [namely, in our preaching. As Christ our Saviour is not changeable, but yesterday, today, and for ever the same, Heb. 13.8.So also he was no otherwise preached by us, and the same Gospel of Christ hath always been propounded to the church by us, Gal. 1.6,7,8,9.] but was yea in him. [namely, God. For as he had called him the Son of God, so he testifieth that Christ is yea, that is, stedfastness and truth in God, or in Gods promises, which are mere truth and firmness, as is declared in the following verse.]
\p
\v 20 . For as many promises of God as there be, that are in him yea, and are in him Amen. [Namely, in Christ Jesus; for even as Christ is always the same in Gods promises of our salvation yea, that is, truth, and Amen, i.e. certainly and firmness in Christ, because in the new covenant God neither makes nor fulfills any promises of salvation but in Christ, and through Christ. See John 14.6. Acts 4.12. Eph. 1.3. etc.] to the glory of God by us. [that is, by the ministry of us Apostles Teachers, who in this doctrine also must know none but Christ and him crucified, 1 Cor. 2.2. Col. 2.9,10. etc.]
\p
\v 21 . But he that confirmeth [Namely, in the truth] us with you into Christ, [that is, to seek the fruit and virtue of all Gods promises in Christ, and through communion with Christ]] and he that hath anointed us [that is, hath endured us with the gifts of the Holy Ghost, which is oftentimes in Scriptures compared to oil or pure ointment. See Psa. 45.8. Acts 4.27. and 10.38. 1 John 2.20,27.] is God.
\p
\v 22 . Who hath also sealed us, [That is, as with impression of his seal assured, namely, of our communion with Christ, and consequently of our adoption to children and to be heirs of God, Rom. 8.15,16. 1 Cor. 2.12.] and given us the earnest of the Spirit of our hearts. [Gr. Arrhabon, which word, as also Arrha signifies properly an earnest, which is a part or beginning of the future good which is promised and assured us: as any one hath some ready mony for a beginning and assurance of the payment which is promised. See 2 Cor. 5.5. Eph. 1.13,14. The first gift of the Spirit and of life is earnest of our whole inheritance. So that this anointing, sealing, and giving earnest, serve to one and the same end. But the rehearsal of this benefit serves for this purpose, to show that the same becomes always more powerful and more sure in our hearts.]
\p
\v 23 . But I call upon God for a witness upon my soul, [Namely, that he punish it, if I spoke not the truth. A right manner of a true oath, which the Apostle therefore adjoins, because there lay much upon it that his word should not be accounted unstedfast] that to spare you [that is, that I might be constained to use my Apostolical power in punishing of the disobedient. See 2 Cor. 10.] I came not yet to Corinth.
\p
\v 24 . Not that we Lord it over your faith, [The Apostle speaks thus to molestie that which he had said immediately before of not sparing them, of which the sense is, that he did not say this to threaten them, or Lord it over them, as a Lord over them and their faith. But as a Minister and co-worker with Christ to bring to a right acknowledgement and amendments of their faults, and consequently to true joy with them, before he came to them: and so more and more to strengthen their faith in which they stood, as is declared in the beginning of the following chapter] but we are fellow-workers of your joy: for ye stand by faith.
\c 2
\s I The Apostle proceeds in declaring of the reasons, why he was not as yet come, namely, because he would not be with them in grief but in joy. 4 Testifieth that that which had formerly written unto them concerning the incestuous person, was done with tears, and through love unto them. 6 Commandeth them that by reason of his sorrow they should be now receive him again, and comfort him, lest by great grief he should fall into despair. 12 Relates further how he had preached the Gospel alone in Troas, and afterwards in Macedonia, 14 and testifieth that his preaching everywhere is an acceptable savior to God. As well in them that are saved as in them that perish, 17 in regard that he every where uprightly published the same.
\p
\v 1 But I purpose this with my self that I would not come again to you in grief. [That is, to grieve both you and me by the Ecclesiastical punishments which must be exercised against some among you.]
\p
\v 2 . For if I grieve you [This he saith because when a member of the church must be punished, all other members must grieve for it. See 1 Cor. 5.2.] who is it truly that shall make me joy full, but he that was grieved by me?
\p
\v 3 . And this same [Namely, of taking away and amending the faults among you] I have written unto you [namely, in my first Epistle, chapter 5.] that I coming (thither) might not have grief from them who I should be made glad, [this he saith not only of the incestuous person, but of all the Corinthians who had tolerated these and other defects among them] trusting of you all that my joy [that is, the cause of my joy, namely, the removing of such offences, should also be a cause of your joy, namely, when such an offence should be removed, and the church brought into a good state] is (the joy) of you all.
\p
\v 4 . For I wrote unto you out of much affliction [Or great pressure. This may be understood either of the condition of the time in which he wrote the former Epistle, because in the time of affliction men do more narrowly and better take notice of all things, and with greater commiseration and more mature deliberation write what they write, or of the trouble and grief which the Apostle had in his mind about such an offence as was among them when he wrote the Epistle] and anguish of heart, with many tears, not that ye should be grieved, but that you might understand the love which the love I have abundantly unto you. [namely, which could not endure it, it should be thought that ye should not have a due displeasure at such faults. Or that ye should make your selves guilt of such faults.]
\p
\v 5 . But if any man hath caused grief, he hath not grieved me [Namely, alone] but in part, [that is, in some sort. So the Apostle speaketh of this fault, not too extenuate it, but because this person had now due sorrow for it, and would presently exhort them to the receiving of him again](that I may not burden (him) ) you all.
\p
\v 6 . To such one this reprehension [This some understand of the utmost Ecclestiastical punishment or excommunication the Apostle had commanded to be exercised against this man, 1 Cor. 5.3. and understand the word enough of the short time which he had endured this punishment. But others think of all the circumstances of this text that this man being admonished and seriously reproved by the Governors of the church, by his repentance prevented excommunication; seeing excommunication is the last punishment of the churches, and which must be done not only before men, but before the whole church, and that the Corinthians desired Pauls advice hereabout by Titus, what they should now do further in his business, seeing he was penitent, as appears by the 7. chapter following; wherefore he answers that this reproof given by many, that is, by the governors of the church, whereupon such serious sorrow had followed, was enough, and that henceforward they should receive him again, that by too grief they might not bring him to despair] is sufficient, which was (given) by many.
\p
\v 7 . So that contrariwise ye (must) rather forgive (him) and comfort (him) [That is, proceed no further against him, but receive him again, and discharge him from the highest punishment. This words of Paul had no reference to any power of the church to forgive sins before God, which belongeth to God alone, but according to Gods word to declare that to the penitent their sins are forgiven before God, and consequently to comfort such, and to declare his absolution before the church which was offended by him. See Mat. 18.18. John 20.23.] left such a one through too abundant grief should in any wise be swallowed up. [that is, fall into such grief, that he should thereby come into despair.]
\p
\v 8 . Therefore I beseech you [Or exhort] that confirm the love to him. [namely, which Christ will have to be showed and confirmed towards a penitent sinner, Mat. 18.v.21,22.]
\p
\v 9 For to this purpose also I wrote, that I might understand your reproof, [that is, making proof of you, and thereby understand your uprightness in this point] whether ye be obedient in all things. [that is, in keeping of all the commandments of Christ, wherefore this also is one. See Mat. 16.19. and chapter 18.15.]
\p
\v 10 . Now to whom ye forgive ought [Se the exposition hereof v.7.] (to him) I (forgive) also: for I have also forgive any things, to whom I forgave it ( I forgave it) for your sake, [that is, to show herein my agreement with you in the observation of Christ’s commands and our mutual love] because the face of Christ, as this word is taken in the former chapter V.11. i.e. in the name of Christ. See 2 Cor. 5.v.20.] that Satan may get no advantage over us. [or that we may not be surprised, subdued, possessed by Satan. The Greek word signifies to get or to have more then belongs to one, and is used especially of covetous persons: and is a similitude taken from covetous merchants, who seek all opportunities to deceive men.]
\p
\v 11 . For his thoughts [That is, consolations, or enterprises, 2 Cor. 10.5. who sometimes by too great slackness of Ecclesiastical discipline seeks to lull sinners asleep, and sometimes by too great strictness to bring to despair] are not unknown to us.
\p
\v 12 . Furthermore when I came to Troas [Of this place and journey of Paul see at large, Acts 16.8. etc.] (to preach) the gospel of Christ, and when a door [that is, opportunity. See 1 Cor. 16.9.] was opened to me in the Lord, I had rest for my spirit [namely, to be quiet there very long, although Paul erected a church there also, as appeared by the following verse, and by 2 Tim/ 4.13.] because I found not Titus my brother,
\p
\v 13 . But having taken leave of them I departed to Macedonia.
\p
\v 14 . And thanks be to God who causeth us always [That is, whether we preach the Gospel a long time or a short time in one place] to triumph [or overcome] in Christ, [that is, in the cause of Christ, or by Christ] and maketh manifest the Savior of his knowledge [that is, the rumor or the progress: a similitude taken from the offering of incense in the old Testament, which being kindled by fire, spread itself through the Temple and over the Congregation] by us in all places.
\p
\v 15 . For we are to God a good savour of Christ [That is, acceptable and well pleasing, because Gods mercy is manifested in those that are saved, and his justice in those that perish. See Luke 2.34.] in them that are saved, and in them that perish.
\p
\v 16 . To these indeed a savior of death unto death [That is, which is deadly, and brings death to them. Not that the Gospel of its own nature, brings death to any man, for it is a ministry of life, 2 Cor. 3.6,7. and a power of God unto salvation to all that believe, Rom. 1.16. Because they that are unbelieving, through their own willfulness set themselves against it, and so draw down Gods heavier judgment upon them. See John 3.36. 1 Pet. 2.7, 8.] but to them a savior of life unto life. And who is fit [or, sufficient, namely, of himself or by himself, as is declared hereafter chapter 3.5,6.] for these things?
\p
\v 17 . For we carry not , as (do) many, the word of God to sell, [Or, falsify not the word of God, Gr. Kapeleuontes, which word signifies to set any thing to sale, or carry it to sell by retail, and to sell the same for better, often times to give it another smell or taste, or gloss: and is also by a similitude taken for as it were testing any thing to sell under a false smell or taste, or gloss, which signification here suits well, seeing the Apostle here testifieth that he did not garnish the Gospel, nor bow and wrest it according to men’s will and pleasure, but teacheth the same in uprightness and purity, without regarding the pleasure of men, committing the issue therefore to God] but as of uprightness, but as of God, [that is, of Gods inspiration, and in Gods name, 2 Cor. 5.19.]] in the presence of God, we speak it in Christ. [or of Christ. Seeing Christ is the whole aim and drift to our Gospel 1 Cor. 2.2.]
\c 3
\s I The Apostle gives a reason why he had so highly advanced the Ministry of the Gospel in the end of the former chapter, and appeals first to the experience of the Corinthians themselves, who by this his ministry were converted to Christ, 5 ads that his power was not of him but of God, 6 proves the same further by a comparison of the ministry of Moses, which he calls a killing letter imprinted in Tables of stone, and administration of condemnation, which abideth not: and of the ministry of the Apostles, which he calleth a ministry of the spirit of life, and of righteousness, and abideth always. 13 Declares that there lay a vaile on Moses face, and also in the reading of the Law, so that the Jews understood not the end thereof, 16 which vaile shall be removed from them, when they shall be converted to God, 17 But that the ministry of the new Testament is clear, and a means whereby the Spirit of the Lord is powerful for our renovation.
\p
\v 1 Do we begin [The Apostle here speaks in the plural number, because the Epistle was written not only in his name, but also in the name of Timothy. See chapter 1.ver.1.]again to praise [Gr. to commend] our selves (to you) or do we also need even as some do, Epistle commendatory to you [or, recommendations, to make us and our ministry acceptable unto you and others] or commendatory (Epistle) from you?
\p
\v 2 . Ye our Epistle, [That is, your conversion and other singular gifts, which were wrought among you by our ministry, are witnesses of the dignity of our ministry, as well with you as with others: as is more largely declared in the following verse] written in our hearts, [this the Apostle saith because of the love which he and Timothy and Silvanus bare unto them, and the esteem in which they were with them] known and read of all men, [namely, which observe and understand your conversion and gifts.]
\p
\v 3 . As who are become manifest that ye are an Epistle of Christ, and prepared by our ministry [Gr. administered by us] which is written, not with ink [namely, as men use to write other Epistles] but by the Spirit of the living God, [that is, who hath not only life himself, but also imparts the same to those in whom he worketh by his spirit and writes his Laws in them, Jer. 31.33. Heb. 8.10.] not in tables of stone [Paul here alludeth to the writings of Gods Law in the two tables of the covenant, Exod. 24.12. which outward writing could not converted the hearts of corrupt men. See Rom. 8.3. Gal. 3.21.] but in the flesh’s tables of the heart. [hereby is not understood that which is many times called flesh or fleshly, i.e. corrupt, in the word of God, but is here taken for our hearts which by the spirit of God are made fit and renewed to receive the word of the Gospel by faith, as Ezek. 36.26. and like the good ground whereof Christ speaks, Mat. 13.23. wherefore also the Apostle saith in the Greek sarkinais not sarkikais.]
\p
\v 4 . And such a confidence have we [namely, of the power and of the fruits of our ministry among you] through Christ with God.
\p
\v 5 . Not that our selves [that is, by our own wisdom or natural acuteness] we are fit to think any thing [or, consider. Namely that should be fit to convert the hearts of men, or bring our selves and others to salvation. See John 15.4,5. and Phil. 2.13.] as of our selves: but our fitness is of God.
\p
\v 6 . Who hath also made us fit (to be) ministers of the New Testament, [Or, covenant. So the covenant of grace is called, in which God promiseth his forgiveness of sins and righteousness by faith in Christ, and withal renovation by the Holy Ghost, whose power manifest it self in the hearts of the elect in the preaching of the Gospel, as is promised, Jer. 31.31. Ezek. 36.25. wherefore also the Gospel is called a ministry of the spirit, and of life ver.6.8. and of righteousness ver.9] not of the letter [that is, of the covenant of the Law, which is called Letter, because the Law is written only with letters in the table of stone, as is declared in the following verse] but of the spirit [that is, of the doctrine and preaching of the Gospel whereby the Holy Ghost worketh faith in us. See Acts 16.14. Gal. 3.2,3. etc.] for the letter killeth, [namely, because the Law, although it shows the way to life, yet confers not upon corrupt man the power to keep it, nor any promise to give the sins of transgressor, but curseth every one that continueth not in all that is written, Gal. 3.10. and convinceth us of our transgression, and consequently that we are worthy of death, which is threatened to the transgressors, and subject to the same, Rom. 7.7. etc. Wherefore also the same is called a ministration of condemnation ver. 9. See hereof more at large, Rom. 8.2,3,4. and 10.ver.3,4,5. Gal. 3.5. etc. and 4.ver.21. etc. Heb.8.6. etc. where the Apostle further declares the difference of these two covenants] but the first spirit maketh alive, [that is, the Gospel doth not only show the way to life and salvation by faith in Jesus Christ, but is also accompanied with the power of the holy spirit, whereby faith is wrought and kept in the elect, and they are raised up and quickned from the death of sin.]
\p
\v 7 . And if the administration of death (consisting) in letters, (and) engraved in stones, was in glory so that the children of Israel could not strongly look upon the face of Moses, for the glory of his face [Namely, glory of Moses face, which as it is done away, was also a type that the Law given by him should also be abrogated, see the history hereof, Exod. 34.30. and so following, which the Apostle interprets as a type of the doctrine of Moses consisting in shadows and justifications of the Law] which was to be done away: [this the Apostle saith of the Law of Moses, not only in respect of the ceremonies, which were to endure but until the coming of Christ, but also in respect of the Law of the Decalogue, as concerning the curse which it threatened to transgressors, and the justification which is promised to the doers of the Law: in both which members it must be abolished by Christ death and obedience. See ver.11.]
\p
\v 8 . How shall not much more the ministration of the spirit [See ver.6.9.] be in glory?
\p
\v 9 . For if the administration of the condemnation was glory, much more is the administration of righteousness {that is, of justification, which is every way opposed to condemnation. See Rom. 8.33,34.] abundant in glory.
\p
\v 10 . For even the glorified [That is, the Law which considered in it self hath a special glory, and was given to the people of Israel with glory] it self was not glorified in this part, in respect of this excelling glory. [that is, compared with the excellence glory of the word of the gospel, and its power in our hearts.]
\p
\v 11 .For if that which is done away was in glory, much more (is) is that which remaineth [Namely, the gospel which shall remain, without being subject to alteration, until Christ shall come to judgment, Mat. 28.19,20. 1 Cor. 11.26. Rev. 2.25.] in glory.
\p
\v 12 . Seeing then we have such hope, we use much boldness in speaking: [Namely, joined with clearness as the word is also taken, Mark 8.32. John 10.24. and 16.29.]
\p
\v 13 .And (do) not like as Moses, (who) put a covering on his face, that the children of Israel might not look strongly [With these words is not properly declared Moses meaning in the covering of his face, of which may be read, Exod. 34.33. but the scope of Gods providence, which ordered this to such an end, and caused it here to be declared] unto the end [that is, the most intimate ground, or the mark and scope of the Law and of the ceremonies, which had their aim at Christ and his righteousness. For whole Law was guide unto Christ, Gal. 3.24. which the greater part of the Jews understood not, but would seek their righteousness without Christ in obedience of the Law moral as ceremonial. And this is the covering whereof the Apostle] of that which is abolished.
\p
\v 14 . But their senses were hardened. [Namely, by a judgment of God in this their opinion of the Law of Moses] For until (this very) day, the same covering [that is, the same perverse understanding, that the Law was given them to be justified and sanctified by the same. See Rom. 10.3.] remaineth in the reading of the Old Testament, without being uncovered: which is done away by Christ. [namely, which covering is done away by the knowledge and spirit of Christ, when they shall be converted unto Christ as is declared, v.16. For then are they, as also we, brought to the right understanding of the Law, and convinced in that end, but that they must seek righteousness out of themselves by faith in Christ. See Rom. 10.4. Gal. 3.21. etc.]
\p
\v 15 . But even unto this present (day) when Moses is read, a covering lieth in their heart.
\p
\v 16 . But whensoever it shall be converted unto the Lord, the covering is taken away.
\p
\v 17 . Now the Lord is the Spirit: [That is, Jesus Christ is the quickening spirit, who by the power of his Holy Spirit, and by the preaching of the holy Gospel taketh away the covering, and powerfully converts the hearts to God. Or the Holy Ghost is the Lord whereby we are converted and set a liberty, seeing him by his divine power and by the doctrine of the Gospel, which is a ministration of the Spirit, v.8. worketh this in us; and is sent by the Lord Christ to this purpose, wherefore he is also called the Spirit of the Lord, ver.17,18. Or Christ is the spiritual being, and as it were the soul of the ceremonies of the Law; as the word spirit is also taken, John 6.63. Or the Lord who converts our hearts unto Christ, and taketh away this covering, is the Holy Ghost. Or the doctrine of the Gospel of the Lord Christ, is the Spirit which is opposed to the letter, v.6.] and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. [namely, from the veil of ignorance, from the yoke of the Law, and from slavery of sin and death, Rom. 8.15,16. Gal. 4.7.]
\p
\v 18 . And we all [Namely, who have received the spirit of the Lord] with uncovered fact [here the Apostle again alludes to the example of Moses, who put away the covering from his face when he appeared before the Lord himself, and by this beholding of God, became glorious in his face: so also saith he, we have a bold access to God by the Gospel, which is a clear glass wherein Gods glorious face itself is seen by us, and we are more and more renewed and glorified in our mind after the same image of God] beholding the glory of the Lord (as) as in a glass, are changed in countence (after) the same image from glory to glory, as by the spirit of the Lord, the Spirit, i.e. by the Spirit which is the Lord, namely, of one essence with the Father and with the Son.]
\c 4
\s 1 The apostle testifieth that he set forth the Gospel uprightly and plainly before the conscience of all men, 3 and that if the same be hidden to any, it is hidden to them that perish, and whole minds Satan hath blinded. 5. That nevertheless this power is not from the Ministers but from Christ, and from God who enlightens the hearts. 8 That this power also wonderfully manifests it self in the Apostles of Christ, in the overcoming of all afflictions and tribulations, which daily come upon them. 13 And afterwards lays down diver’s grounds of consolation, with which they do strengthen themselves and others, taken from example of David. 14 From the blessed resurrection. 15 From the thankfulness for such deliverances. 16 From the renewing of the inward man, 17 and finally from the greatness of the eternal glory, which shall follow hereupon.
\p
\v 1 Therefore seeing we have his ministry, [Namely, not of the letter, nor of death, but of the spirit and life, wherefore is spoken in the former chapter, v.6&c.] according to the mercy which is showed us, we do not grow slack: [or faint, or remain not wanting, namely, notwithstanding all the troubles which come upon us in this administration, as appears from v.10. See of this word also, Luke 18.1.]
\p
\v 2 . But we have cast away [Gr. renounced, or denied] the coverings of shame, [or the covered shamefulness: whereby he understands the evasions, garnishings and deceits of the false Apostles, who would frame their preachings according to humane wisdom or according to the inclinations of men to place them, and in the mean time by such cloakings to promote their own ease and honour, as the following words declare] not walking in craftiness, not falsifying the word of God, but by manifesting of the truth, making our selves acceptable [Gr. recommending, namely, that we deal in simplicity therein] to all consciences of men [namely, who judge uprightly and with understanding] in the presence of God.
\p
\v 3 . But if our Gospel be also hid [that is, be dark and seeming strange] it is hid in them that perish.
\p
\v 4 . In whom the God of this age [That is, Satan, who by a just judgment of God obtains such dominion over unbelieving men, as if he were a god of them, and whom they serve as their God. See John 12.31. Eph. 2.2. and 6.12.] hath blinded their senses (namely) of unbelievers, that the illumination of the Gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God [namely, not only in respect of his divine nature, being the eternal word and wisdom of the Father, but also in respect that he is God manifested in the flesh, by whom Gods glory, righteousness, grace, wisdom and power, is as it were in a glass expressed unto us in the Gospel. See Col. 1.15. Heb. 1.3.] should not beam forth [or shine, give light] unto them.
\p
\v 5 . For we preach not our selves, but Christ Jesus the Lord: and our selves (that we are) your servants for Jesus sake.
\p
\v 6 . For God who said [That is, commanded, namely, in the beginning of the creation, when darkness covered Earth, Gen. 1.2,3.] that the light should shine out of darkness, is who hath shined [namely, by his holy spirit] in our hearts, [namely, which were also dark and ignorant by nature. He speaketh here especially of the Apostles, by whom afterwards this light must be spread abroad among all nations] (to give) enlightening of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ. [that is, the glory of God which shined in the face of Moses, and was covered by him, shines now more gloriously in the face of Christ, and is not covered by us, but held forth before all uncovered, to enlighten them thereby.]
\p
\v 7 . But we have this treasure [Namely, of the knowledge of God in the first of Christ] in earthen vessels, [that is, we are weak, despised and tender instruments, in the midst of all persecutions] that the excellency of the power [namely, of this word of the gospel] may be Gods [that is, may be ascribed to God alone; as it is of God alone, and not of us. See 2Cor. 3.5,6.] and not of us.
\p
\v 8 . (As) who in all things are afflicted, yet not distressed: [Namely, so that there is no evading. Otherwise this distressing is also affirmed of believers, Rom. 8.35. 2 Cor. 6.4.] doubtfull-minded yet not despairing:
\p
\v 9 . Persecute, yet not forsaken (there-) in : cast down, yet not destroyed:
\p
\v 10 . Always bearing about in the body the killing of the Lord Jesus, [That is, danger of death for Christ sake. Or persecutions and distresses even unto death for Christ’s sake, and after the example of Christ, and which Christ also accounts to befall himself, Acts 9.4. as is declared in the following verse] that also in the life of Jesus [that is, the quickening power of Christ and of his spirit, which manifest itself here in our ministry, and hereafter shall fully manifest it self for our deliverance, as also the following verse declares. See Rom. 8.v.10,11.] might be manifest in our bodies.
\p
\v 11 . For we that live are always given over unto death for Jesus sake: that the life of Jesus also might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
\p
\v 12 . So then death indeed worketh in us, [that is, the danger of death hangs continually over our heads, and worketh in us by the power of Christ the greater zeal for the diligent execution of our ministry] but life in you, [that is, but ye by our ministry, and all our tribulations and dangers of death, are more and more strengthened in the life of the spirit: so that even all these distresses which fall upon us, make for you good, and conduce to life unto you.]
\p
\v 13 . Seeing now we have the same Spirit of Faith, [That is, the same Faith by the same Spirit, which all believers both of the Old and New Testament are partakers of, 1 Pet. 1.10,11.] as it is written; I believe therefore have I spoken: [this David speaketh, Psa. 116.19. when being in many troubles he testified his confidence in God of his deliverance, or when being delivered out of many troubles, he confessed before every one the confidence which he had in God also for time to come] we also believe, therefore we also speak, [that is, confess and proclaim before every one that which we believe.]
\p
\v 14 . Knowing that he that raised up the Lord Jesus, shall also raise up by Jesus, and shall set us with you. [Namely, at the last day, when Christ shall appear on his judgment-seat, Eph. 5.27.]
\p
\v 15 . For all these things [Namely, which I have rehearsed of the dangers of death upon us, and of the wonderful deliverances which God giveth thereupon] are for your sakes, that the multiple grace [namely, which he sheweth in our wonderful deliverances for you comfort and edification, and for the spreading abroad of Gods honour by your thanksgiving for us] but the thanksgiving of many, be abundant to the glory of God.]
\p
\v 16 . Therefore we grow not slothful: but although our outward man be destroyed [Gr.the man without, i.e. our body with our corporal strength, health and outward welfare] nevertheless the inward [Gr. the man within, i.e. the soul being renewed by the Spirit of God, more and more renewed by the Spirit of God, is daily in the midst of these troubles, more and more strengthened] is renewed from day to day.
\p
\v 17 . For our light affliction, [Gr. the light, or the lightness of our affliction. This the Apostle saith not because affliction is light in it self, but because the Lord by the strengthening and comfort of his spirit makes light to us. See Rom. 5.2. and chapter 8.37.] which very speedily (passeth) away, [namely, as our life is not long. For after this life all tears are washed from our eyes, Rev. 7.16,17.] worketh us [that is, brings forth, not in any merit, but of mere grace for Christ sake, Rom. 8.17,18.] a most excellent eternal weight of glory: [Gr. an eternal weight of glory according to excellency, unto excellency.]
\p
\v 18 . While we observe not [Namely, as a mark at which we aim, as the Greek word properly imports] the things which are seen, [that is, worldly honour or dish our, commodities and dis-commodities of this life, which we daily see before our eyes] but the things which are not seen. [namely, by the eyes of the body, i.e. the spiritual and heavenly glory and joy which is promised, and which we believe and hope for, of which he treats more largely in the following chapter. See Heb. 11.1.] For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.
\c 5
\s 1 The Apostle proceeds in describing of the hope of salvation, whereby we are assured that when this body which is an earthly Tabernacle is broken down, we have an eternal habitation in heaven; 4 wherewith we long to be cloathed over, 6 forasmuch as long as we inhabited in this body, we dwell out from the Lord. 9 That therefore every one must be diligent to please him, 10 because we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ. 11 Therefore also testifieth his diligence among them 12 Not to praise himself, but to give them matter of boasting against the false Apostles. 15 Teacheth that Christ dyed and was raised up for all, that they all might live unto him. 16 Wherefore henceforth he knoweth no man after the flesh, 17 but after the new creation which is of God in Christ. 19 Wherefore they are used as Ambassadors of God, to reconcile unto God in Christ.
\p
\v 1 FOR we know that if our earthly house of this Tabernacle [That is, our weak and immortal body, which we carry on this Earth, is made of Earth, and is compared to a Tabernacle or Tent, which men in traveling easily make up, and their departure break down again or let it fall. See the like Job 4.19. 2 Pet.1.v.13.14.] be broken, [Gr. dissolved, loosened] we have a building of God; [some take this for the heavenly glory, wherewith our bodies shall first be glorified at the last day. But seeing the Apostle here remarkably speaks of a building or house, which we shall have of God after that this Tabernacle is broken, and that in heaven, and as soon as we go dwell out of this body, as appears from v. 6, 8. It is altogether as firstly taken for the heavenly glory in general, wherewith the soul is adorned, and as it were clothed as soon as it lays down this Tabernacle, and wherewith the body shall be cloathed afterward, when it shall be raised from the dead. See of the first Heb. 11. v. 14, 16. Rev. 7. 14. and of the other, 1 Cor. 15. 42, 43. Phil. 3. 20, 21.] a house not made with hands (but) eternal in the heaven.
\p
\v 2 . For in this also we sigh, longing to be cloathed upon with our dwelling, which from heavens.
\p
\v 3 . If also we shall be found cloathed [Namely, with the true wedding garment, i.e. they that shall be found with the righteousness and holiness of Christ in this day of transmigration. For others who are destitute thereof are not to expect this glory. Others translate it, seeing, or forasmuch also as we cloathed, etc. and take it for an exposition of that which goes before] (and) not naked.
\p
\v 4 . For we also who are in the Tabernacle, [That is, who yet live this earthly and mortal body] do sigh, being burdened: [namely, by the load of sin and of afflictions] seeing that we are not willing to be uncloathed [that is, be wholly deprived of our body which we now bear, to want the same eternally. Or in which, namely, Tabernacle being we will not, & c.] but clothed upon. [namely, heavenly glory, in soul presently after death, and in body when it shall be restored unto us at the last day. Some think that Paul doth here with that he might live in this body until Christ shall come to change our bodies, without having need to put them off, which mystery is spoken of, 1 Cor. 15. 51. and 1 Thes. 4. 17. But this is not likely, seeing he saith v. 8. that he had rather go to dwell forth out of the body, namely, for a time, and to inhabit with the Lord] that the mortal [i.e. the mortality wherewith our body is now burdened, and remaineth burdened within the grave] may be swallowed up of life. [that is, may wholly be taken away by the blessed immortality, namely, when Christ shall raise up the same again, and make it comformable to his glorified body, Phil. 3. 21.]
\p
\v 5 . Now he that hath prepared us for this same (thing) [That is, for this glory in our soul, and this immortality in our body. Gr. wrought or adorned] is God, who hath also given us the earnest of the Spirit. [namely, the Holy Ghost for a pledge to assure us hereof. See Rom. 8. 16. 2 Cor. 1. 22. Eph. 4. 30.]
\p
\v 6 . We have therefore always good courage, and know that we in dwelling in the body, dwell forth from the Lord. [Namely Jesus Christ, whose bodily beholding and presence we must so long want, as appears v. 8. and is declared, Phil 1. 23.]
\p
\v 7 . (For we walk by faith [Namely, which properly receives and applies to itself the things which are not seen, Heb. 11. 1.] (and) not by beholding.) [namely, of the things which we hope for. See Rom. 8. 24. and 1 Cor. 13. 12. Although otherwise there is also a beholding of faith, John 6. 40. and chapter 8. 56.]
\p
\v 8 . But we have good courage, and are more pleased to dwell forth out of the body, and to indwell with the Lord.
\p
\v 9 . Therefore we are so very desirous [Gr. ambitious. See also Rom. 15. 20.] whether indwelling, [namely, with him in heaven, as v. 8. See Rev. 7. 17. and 14. 4. Or in the body as v. 6] or out dwelling, [namely, from Christ out of heaven, while we yet bear this mortal body, or out of the body as v. 6.] to be well-pleasing unto him.
\p
\v 10 . For we all must be manifested. [Namely, not only in respect of our persons, but also of thoughts, words and deeds, Rom. 2. 16. Rev. 2. 23. and 20. 12.] before the judgment seat of Christ, that everyone may carry away [namely, for a recompense] that which (is done) by the body, [namely, here in this life, or while we bear this body] according to that he hath done, whether it be good [that is, the reward of good, of grace] or evil. [that is, the reward of evil, or desert. See of both, Mat. 25.v.34,41. Rom. 6.23.]
\p
\v 11 . We therefore knowing the terror of the Lord [That is, the terrible and fearful judgment of the Lord, whereby we must be careful to walk always uprightly before him] move men unto faith, and are become manifest unto God: but I hope also to be manifested in your consciences.
\p
\v 12 . For we praise not our selves [That is, commend] again unto you, but we give you occasion of glorying concerning us, [namely, that we are faithful Apostles of Christ, and that our doctrine is a doctrine which converts the hearts] that ye may have (matter) against them, who glory in the face [that is, only in made and garnished phrases and the like, which have indeed an outward show before men, but touch not the heart] and not ( in ) the heart.
\p
\v 13 . For whether we be out of our wits, [So the Apostle speaks when he must himself and ministry, because it seems to be the work of his distracted and foolish persons to boast one self: and declares that he doth this, not give himself this honour, but to preserve Gods honour unto him] we are so to God, or whether we be sober minded, [So the Apostle speaks when without being necessitated to speak of himself, he simply executes his ministry among them, which he declares to tend also to their good. See 2 Cor. 11.v.1,16,17.&c. as also throughout in the twelveth chapter] we are so to you.
\p
\v 14 . For the love of Christ [This may be understood either of the love wherewith Christ loveth us, or of the love wherewith we love him, because himself for us, which the following verse seems to import, although this love also flows from his love towards us] preseth us. [that is, wholly posseth us, and moveth us to do the same. See also Acts 18.5.]
\p
\v 15 As who judge this [That is, hold it for certain] that if one [namely, Christ] died [namely, to do away their sins] for all [namely, who believe in him, John 3 .16. Acts 10. 43 Rom. 3.22. and 10.4. Heb. 5.9. and 10.14.] then they are all dead. [namely, with him , by his death not only to obtain forgiveness of sins and reconciliation with God, but also to dye to sin, as Rom. 6.6. Heb. 9.26,27,28.] And he died for all, that they that live should no more live unto themselves [that is, for their own ease, profit and honour] but to him [that is, for the service and honour of him] who died and was raised up for them.
\p
\v 16 . So then from henceforward we know no men after the flesh: [That is, according to outward respect kindred, condition, honour, wisdom, or eloquence: but ( he would say) only after the spirit, i.e. according to the spiritual power which is in him, and is wrought by him] and if we also have known Christ according to the flesh: [as Paul testifieth that he also saw Christ, 1 Cor. 9.1.] notwithstanding we know (him) now no more (after the flesh) [namely, to boast thereof, or to seek our esteem thereby as some do.]
\p
\v 17 . So then if any man being in Christ, [Namely, truly know Christ, and be united unto him] he is now a creature, [that is, regenerated by the power and spirit of Christ, without regarding any more those fleshly things, or seeking his happiness therein, Gal. 6.15.] the old is passed away, behold it is all become new. [namely, in the Kingdome of Christ: and here the Apostle hath respect to the Promise of God, Isa. 65.17. and 66.22. where this renewing of all things, which only avails before God, is promised under the Kingdome of Christ: wherefore a part is now fulfilled in true believers, who are renewed by the spirit of God; and that which remaineth shall be fulfilled in the life to come after the resurrection, see 2 Pet. 3.13. Rev. 21.5.]
\p
\v 18 . And all things are of God, [Namely, which concerns this new creation] who hath reconciled [namely, when we were yet his enemies as Paul speaketh, Rom. 5.8. etc.] us [namely, who believe in Christ] to himself by Christ Jesus, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation.
\p
\v 19 . For God [Or, how that God &c.] was in Christ reconciling the world [that is, the elect and believers throughout the whole world as John 6.33.51.] unto himself: not imputing their sins unto them: and hath placed in us [that is, instructed unto us to publish the same in his name] the word of reconciliation.
\p
\v 20 . We are then Ambassadors for Christ, as if God besought us: we pray in Christ’s name, be reconciled unto God. [namely, through faith in Christ and his blood, Rom. 3.25.]
\p
\v 21 . For him that knew sin [That is, who was free from all sin, 1 Pet. 2.22.] hath he made sin for us [that is, a sacrifice for sin as Levit. 7.2. Or sin by imputing of our sins; as he is also said to have been made a curse Gal. 3.13.] that we might become righteousness of God [that is, righteousness before God. Or that righteousness of God might be imputed to us, Rom. 4.ver.4,5. etc.] in him. [namely, Christ, in respect that we are in him, and his righteousness is imputed unto us, Rom. 8.1. etc.]
\c 6
\s 1 Paul exhorts the Corinthians that they should not receive in vain the grace which was ministered unto them by him, as an Ambassador of Christ, 3 and relates how faithfully he had fulfilled his ministry, even in the midst of all troubles and tribulations, 6 with all, with what manner of virtues and power of the spirit his labour jade been accompanied. 11 Declares further his great inclination towards them, 13 and inquires the same of them again towards him. 14 Admonisheth them not to be yoked with the unbelievers, 16 and to have no communion with Idols, seeing the believers are Gods Temple, 17 but to separate themselves from them, 18 seeing God is their Father and they his children.
\p
\v 1 AND we [ He includes with him Timothy: in whose name he also writeth] (as) labouring together [or, working together. Namely, with God as the ministers of the word are also elsewhere called, as being instruments and Ambassadors of God, 1 Cor. 3.9.10.] beseech [or, exhort] you also, that ye may not have received the grace of God [namely, which was offered you by the Gospel and our ministry, and received by you] in vain. [that is, without bringing forth suitable fruits of thankfulness, and increasing in faith.]
\p
\v 2 . For he saith [Namely, Isa. 49.8. where God the Father speaks thus to his Son, and promiseth the building up of his Church by him at his coming] in the acceptable time have I heard thee: behold now [these now are the words of Paul wherewith he expounds the words a foregoing, and applies them to the time of the new Testament] it is the well-accepted time [or, the time of the good pleasure, as the Hebrew word in Esay properly sounds, namely, which God in his pleasure and appointed to call men every where to repentance by Christ and his ministers, and by his spirit powerfully to bring them unto thereunto, Acts 2.16,17. and 17.v.30,31. etc.] behold now it is the day of salvation.
\p
\v 3 . We give no offence in any thing, that the ministry [Namely, of the holy Gospel, which is instructed with us, and of which he spoke it in the end of the former chapter] be not reproached: [or, blamed, reproved, as Greek word properly imports: which uses to be done when the lives of the ministers of the word are not agreeable to their doctrine.]
\p
\v 4 . But we as ministers of God, make ourselves acceptable [Gr. we commend ourselves: or cause the after trial made, we are approved or approve] in all things, in much long suffering, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
\p
\v 5 . In stripes, in prisons, in commotions, [Or, confusions, unsettlements: whereby is understood the state of those that are pursued or driven hither and thither] in labour, in watching, in fasting,
\p
\v 6 . In pureness, [Or, chastise: So from henceforth the Apostle rehearseth the verues and means whereby he overcame the former troubles] in knowledge, in long suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Ghost, [hereby he understands the boldness and joy of the Spirit, who supports us even in the midst of all tribulations, John 16.33. Rom. 5.v.3,4,5. and 14.17.] in love unstained,
\p
\v 7 . In the words of truth, [That is, the preaching of the Gospel, as John 17.17.] in the power of God, [namely, which accompanied this preaching of the Apostles, not only with signs and miracles, Heb. 2.3,4. but also with power to resist & subdue the wicked, as with weapons which were mighty in God on all sides to gain the elect to Christ, and keep away the others from them, 2 Cor. 10. 4,5,6.] by the weapons of righteousness on the right and the left (side) [or, by the right and left weapons of righteousness.]
\p
\v 8 . By honour and dishonour [That is, in the midst of honour and dishonour, namely, honour with the good, and dishonour with ungodly and worldly men. Understands the same difference also in the following oppositions: and see an example in Christ, John 7.12. and in Paul, Acts 17.18,32.] by evil report and good report: as seducers, and (notwithstanding) true:
\p
\v 9 As unknown and (notwithstanding) known: as dying [Namely, according to the judgment of men accounted for dead]and behold we live: [namely, by the special grace and protection of God, Psalm 118.18.] as chastened not killed:
\p
\v 10 . As being sad yet always joyful; [That is, comforted in God, Rom. 5.3. 1 Thes. 5.16.]] as poor, [namely, in respect of worldly riches] yet making many rich: [namely, with spiritual gifts] as having nothing and nevertheless possessing all things. [namely, in Christ and with Christ, 2 Cor. 3.21,22.]
\p
\v 11 . Our mouth is opened towards you, O Corinthians: [That is, I speak boldly and at large with you concerning all my occasion, even as many inclinations and good heart towards you is also great. A Hebrew phrase] our heart is spread forth.
\p
\v 12 . Ye are not narrow in us, [That is, ye posses our heart wholly. We set our hearts wide open for you] but ye are narrow in your bowels. [that is, you do not open your hearts enough, but keep them still in part as it were shut before us.]
\p
\v 13 . Now (to make) the same recompense ( I speak as unto (my) children) be ye also extended. [Namely,in your bowels or heart: to bear the like affection or love unto us.]
\p
\v 14 . Draw not another yoke with unbelievers; {that is, be not yoked or have no communion with them that be of unlike Religion, as the idolatrous Gentiles were. Whereby he doth not forbid all manner of communion, for that should contradict that which he said 1 Cor.5.10. but only such communion, whereby they might also be brought unto communion with their idolatry or other sins, or unbelievers be strengthened in their sins: and is a similitude taken from the Law, Deut. 22.10. where God forbids that in ploughing they should join together an ox and an ass] For what partnership hath righteousness with unrighteousness? And what communion hath light with darkness?
\p
\v 15 . And what agreement hath Christ with Belial? [This is a Hebrew word and signifies one that is without yoke, or profitable to no man. Here it is taken for Satan himself, who hath cast all obedience of God from him, See 1 Samuel 1.16.] or what part hath believer with the unbeliever?
\p
\v 16 . Or what conjunction hath the Temple of God [Namely, which is sanctified for the service of the true God] with Idols? For ye [namely, who believe in Christ, Eph. 2.21,22. 1 Pet. 2.5.] are the Temple of the living God: [that is, who not only liveth himself, but is the author of life unto all, Acts 17.25. and this title is here given to God, in opposition to dumb dead idols] even as God hath said, [these words are taken partly out of Levvit. 26.11,12. partly out of Ezek. 37.26. I will dwell in them, and I will walk among (them) and I will be their God, and they shall be to me a people.
\p
\v 17 . Therefore go out of the midst of them [These words are taken out of Esa. 52.11. so that this exhortation of Paul is out of diver’s places joined together] and separate your selves saith the Lord, and touch not that which is unclean, and I will receive you.
\p
\v 18 . And I will be for a Father to you, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.

\s 1 The Apostle from the former promises of God, draws a new exhortation to sanctification, 2 and again apologizeth for his inclination towards them, yea even in the midst of all tribulations, and assures himself also of theirs towards him, 6 in which opinion he is more strengthened by the coming and testimony of Titus. 8 And although by his serious reproof he had before grieved them, yet he acknowledgeth that nevertheless this grief was a grief according to God, which he reproves by the fruits of the same grief, 13 and by the joy of Titus after his return. 14 who had found all things so with them, even as the Apostle had been confident of them.
\p
\v 1 Seeing then we have these promises, [Namely, whereof is spoken in the end of the former chapter] beloved, let us purify our selves from all defilements of the flesh and of the spirit, [that is, of the body and of the soul: as who dome idolatry etc. defile both body and soul. See 1 Cor. 6.22.] finishing sanctification [that is, accomplishing it more by bringing forth of the fruits of the same. See John 15.ver.1.2.] in the fear of God.
\p
\v 2 . Give us place; [That is, give place to our exhortation. Or give place in your hearts, as we do you in ours. See before chapter 6.ver.11,12,13.] we have wronged no man, [namely, by desire of domination over you] we have corrupted no man, [namely, by false doctrine or evil examples] we have not sought our own advantage by any man. [namely, by flatteries to have gain of you. See of the propriety of this word chapter 2.v.10. And these are the three faults, whereby withal he describes the false Apostles.]
\p
\v 3 . I say not (this) for (your) condemnation. [Namely, as if ye had been unthankful of unfaithful towards me. Or as if I complained of you: but (he would say) to stop the mouth of the false Apostles, who seek to render me suspected unto you, and show my care of you as is declared ver.12.] For I have said before, that ye are in our hearts, to die together and live together. [A phrase whereby is expressed greatest love and favour towards any man; namely, that he is ready to live and die with him.]
\p
\v 4 . I have much boldness in speaking towards you, I have much glorying of you: I am filled comfort I am very abundant in joy, in all our tribulation.
\p
\v 5 . For also when we came into Macedonia, our flesh [That is, our body. Not that the soul hath not its part also in tribulations, but because persecutions are most executed upon the outward man, and in the meanwhile God oftentimes refresheth and comforts the Spirit] had no rest, but we were afflicted in every thing: from without was strife, [namely, which was procured to us by the Gentiles and Jews, which were without the Church] from within fear. [namely, through the care we had concerning the troubles which were risen within the Church, 2 Cor. 11.v.28.29. See the like phrase 1 Cor. 5.v.12.]
\p
\v 6 . But God hath comforted the lowly, comforted us by the coming of Titus. [Namely, who strengthened us against the persecution from without by his presence, and better informed us of the state of your Church from within, and your inclination unto us, as the following verse declares.]
\p
\v 7 . And not only by his coming, also by the consolation, with which he was comforted concerning you, when he related to us your longing, [Namely, after my coming unto you] your lamenting, [namely, for my tribulations and grievances] your zeal for me: [namely, against the disobedient, also in receiving the reproofs and exhortations given you by me in the former Epistle: whereof he treats more at large in the following verse] so that I was gladded the more.
\p
\v 8 . For although I have grieved you in the Epistle, [Namely, by mine earnest writing and reproving you for tolerating of the incestuous person, and other faults among you. See 1 Cor. chapter 5. and the following] I am not sorry for it, although it did make me sorry: [that is, grieved me that I must write so roughly even as it grieves a Father, when he must harshly his reprove his children, although he justly doth so, and for their good] for I see that the same Epistle hath grieved you, although for a little time:
\p
\v 9 . Now I rejoice, not for that ye were grieved, but because ye were grieved to repentance. For ye were grieved according to God; so that ye have suffered hurt by us in no thing. [Or, that ye might suffer hurt by us in no thing.]
\p
\v 10 . For grief according to God [That is, which cometh from God, is acceptable to God, and brings the sinner unto God: is acceptable to God, and brings the sinner unto God: when namely the heart of the sinner is rightly grieved for this, that he hath provoked his Father to wrath by his sin, with a confidence of the forgiveness of the same through Jesus Christ, accompanied with a firm purpose of avoiding sin, as the example of David, the lost son, the woman that was a sinner, Peter, and others do show] worketh a repentance not to be sorrowed for, unto salvation: but the grief of the worldly [that is, which is in worldly men, for those of worldly things or which is occasioned only for fear of Gods judgment, whereupon follows hardening in sin, despair and finally damnation it self, as is to be seen in Cain, Achitophel, Ahab, Judas, and the like] worketh death.
\p
\v 11 . For behold this same that ye were grieved according to God, how great diligence [Or, carefulness, and trouble for the sin that was committed to amend it] hath it wrought in you? Yea apologize, [or excusing, namely, that this was not done out of willfulness, or consent to this the sin committed] yea displeasure, [or heaviness, for the same sin, distaste, dissatisfaction] yea fear, [namely, of divine and Ecclesiastical punishment for that sin, if it were not amended] yea longing, [that is, a willingness and singular desire to amend the amend the same] yea zeal, [namely, in fulfilling of that which the Apostle hath commanded them for removing of the scandal] yea revenge: [this may be understood of the Ecclesiastical punishment it self for this sin, or else of the trouble which they showed for it, which was a revenge upon themselves, that they had been so negligent herein before] in all things ye have showed your selves to be pure [namely, not from all faults, for negligence also is a fault, but from having any satisfaction therein, or having dealt willfully therein] in this matter. [or dealing, deed.]
\p
\v 12 . Although therefore I wrote to you, (that) is not [Namely, so much or principally. A phrase like that 1 Cor. 9.9,10.] for his sake who had done wrong, [that is, the person who had committed incest. Or their who had drawn their brethren before unbelieving Judgers, or wrong them] nor for his sake to whom wrong was done: [hereby some understand the Father of this person, whose wife he had taken unto him. Others understand it of them to whom injury was done before the judgment of unbelieving Magistrates, wherefore he had written, 1 Cor. 6.1. etc.] but that our diligence for us] for you [or to you, i.e. which is laid out or employed for your service] might be manifest unto you in the presence of God.
\p
\v 13 . Therefore we were comforted for your comfort: and were yet more abundantly joyed for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all. [Namely, seeing willing ye were to receive my exhortations and his person, and to show him all good will.]
\p
\v 14 . For I have boasted any thing to him of you: I am not made ashamed: but as we speak all things unto you with truth, so also our boasting which (I boasted) to Titus is become truth: [That is, found true.]
\p
\v 15 . And his inward moving [Gr. bowels, i.e. inclination and love. An Hebrew phrase] are the more abundant towards you, when he calls to mind the obedience of you all, how ye received him with fear trembling.
\p
\v 16 . I rejoice therefore that in all things I may have confidence of you, [Gr. confide you.]
\c 8
\s I. Paul propounds to the Corinthians the example of the churches of Macedonia, who had made a liberal contribution for the poor believers at Jerusalem, 6. and declares that he had given command to Titus to promote the like with them also. 9. sets also before them the example of Christ, who became poor, by his poverty to make us rich, 10. and exhorts them now well to finish that which they had well begun for a year ago. 13. Yet not so that they should distress themselves to ease others, but out of their abundance to supply others wants, 15. as was done in the gathering of Manna. 16. Testifies further that Titus was gone unto them, to bring this over, 18. with one brother more who was chosen by the churches for this purpose, 20. to prevent all slanderous reports, 22. and yet a third whose faithfulness had now been tried divers times, as well by himself as by the churches.
\p
\v 1 Furthermore we make known to you, brethren, the grace of God [That is, the bounty by the grace of God, which moved their hearts, to make so liberal a contribution to the poor at Jerusalem, as the following verse declares] which is given in the churches of Macedonia: [or by.]
\p
\v 2 . That in much trial of affliction, the abundance of their joy [Namely, springing from their faith in Christ, notwithstanding all tribulation. See Rom. 5. 3.] and their very deep poverty [that is, although by their great afflictions they seemed to be come to the extremist poverty, notwithstanding they were abundant in giving] was abundant unto the riches [that is, unto abundant liberality, as the following verse sets forth] of their bounty. [or simplicity, uprightness, namely, in giving.]
\p
\v 3 . For according to ability (I testify it) yea beyond ability, they were willing.
\p
\v 4 . Beseeching us with exhortation [Or consolation] that we would receive [that is, taken upon us] the gift [Gr. the grace, i.e. the benevolent gift] and the communion of this ministration [that is, the care well to dispose of this collection, and to cause it to come to the right hands, as a token of their communion with them] which is done for the Saints. [namely, at Jerusalem. See 1 Cor. 16. 3, 4. Rom. 15. 26.]
\p
\v 5 . And (did) not (only) as we had hoped, [That is, did more than we had hoped or expected] but gave themselves [namely, yet more diligently and abundantly] first to the Lord, and (afterward) to us by the will of God.
\p
\v 6 . So that we exhorted Titus, that like as he had begun before [Namely, to stir you up to all spiritual virtues, as is declared in the following verse] so also he would finish [ that is, would bring to a good end] yet this gift [Gr. this grace, i.e. this gift of liberality, as v. 1, 7, 19.] with you.
\p
\v 7 . So then as ye are abundant in all things, in faith, and in word, and in knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, look that ye be abundant in this gift also.
\p
\v 8 . I say not (this) (as) commanding, [Gr. according to command] but (as) by the diligence of others, [that is, by the example of the diligence and liberality of the churches in Macedonia] proving the uprightness of your love also.
\p
\v 9 . For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that he for your sakes became poor, [Namely, when he made himself as nothing, taking on him the form of a servant, Phil. 2. 5, & c.] when he was rich, [namely, a Lord of all things, see Heb. 1. 2.] that ye by his poverty might become rich. [that is, be made partakers of all his spiritual and heavenly good things, 1 Corinth. 1. 30.]
\p
\v 10 . And I speak [Gr. I give, as 1 Cor. 7. 25.] in this (my) opinion. For this is expedient for you, as who have begun not only the doing, but also the willing [that is, doing with diligence and willingness: for that is more than only to will, or only to do] for above a year ago.
\p
\v 11 . But now finish also the doing: that like as there was the readiness of the mind to will, there may be also the finishing, out of which ye have. [That is, according to the measure of that which ye have.]
\p
\v 12 . For if before there be the readiness of the mind, once is accepted [Namely, by God in the distributing of his gifts. See Mark 12. 43. 2 Cor. 9. 7.] according to that which he hath, not according to that which he hath not.
\p
\v 13 . For (I speak this) not that others should have ease, and you oppression. [That is, that others should obtain abundance by your gifts, and ye have want, or too much straiten yourselves.]
\p
\v 14 . But (that by equality, in this present time your abundance (may be to supply) their want: that their abundance also may be (to supply) your want, [Namely, when in the time of persecution: or otherwise ye also may have need for their help. Others take it for the abundance of spiritual gifts, which they of Jerusalem might the more diligently and the more fitly to impart to the Gentiles, when they should not be necessitated to trouble themselves for a temporal livelihood] that there may be equality. [namely, in giving or receiving according to the need and abundance of every one. Or that the one member do not too much abound, and the other be not too much straitened: which agrees all as well with the following verse]
\p
\v 15 . As it is written [Namely, Exod. 16. 18, in the gathering of the manna. For they that had gathered much, took out of it but each a gomer for their sustenance, they that had little, filled the same gomer out of that which was gathered by others, that which any one brought home more corrupted and perished.] He that (had gathered) much, had nothing over: and he that (had gathered) little, had not too little.
\p
\v 16 . But thanks be to God, who gave the same diligence for you, [That is, this carefulness to exhort and move you also hereunto as the following verse declares] in the heart of Titus.
\p
\v 17 . That he took upon him the exhortation, and being very diligent, willingly traveled unto you. [Gr. went forth.]
\p
\v 18 . And we have also sent with him the brother, [This many ancient Teachers think to have been Luke, who wrote the Gospel of Christ: but seeing here is not spoken of writing the Gospel, but of preaching the same, that is uncertain, as also that it was Barnabas] who hath praise in the Gospel through all churches.
\p
\v 19 . And not only that, but he was also chosen by the churches [The Greek word properly signifies a choice which is made by lifting up or stretching forth of hands: so that Paul had not only ordained this person himself hereunto, but also the churches of Macedonia. See of this word also Acts 14. 23.] to travel with us with this gift [that is, benefit, bountiful contribution, as divers times before] which is administered by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and the readiness of your mind. [that is, for a demonstration of your benevolence and liberality.]
\p
\v 20 . Avoiding this [Namely, by adjoining others who have taken this charge upon them together with us, as that which follows declares] that n o man may reproach us [or blame, burden us with evil suspicion, if we had brought over such abundant alms alone, which might easily have been done by the false Apostles, and other Enemies of the Gospel] in this abundance, which is administered by us.
\p
\v 21 . As who take care for that which is beseeming, not only before the Lord , but also before men.
\p
\v 22 . We have also sent with them our brother, [This some think to have been Apollo’s. But it is also uncertain] whom we have often in many things proved to be diligent: and now much more diligent through the great confidence that (he hath) unto you. [Or that we have]
\p
\v 23 . Whether (therefore) Titus, [Gr. of Titus, i.e. would men know who Titus is] he is my companion, and fellow-labourer towards you: whether our brethren, [namely, who together with Titus are chosen hereunto by the churches of Macedonia, whereof he had spoken, v. 18. 22.] they are Messengers of the churches [Gr. Apostles, as this word is also sometimes taken for all manner of Teachers and Messengers, See Rom. 16. 7.] (and) an honour of Christ. [Gr. a glory of Christ, i.e. such persons whereby the honour of Christ is singularly promoted.]
\p
\v 24 . Show then unto them the demonstration of your love, and of our glorying you, even before the face of the churches. [That is, as who shall have all the churches for witness of this your love and bounty, which shall get notice of it.]
\c 9
\s 1. The Apostle testifies that he is sufficiently assured of the inclination of the Corinthians to the promoting of this collection, 3. and gives reason why he hath sent the forenamed brethren unto them before hand, namely, that all things may be ready when he shall come. 6. Exhorts them to give liberally and willingly by divers reasons, taken from Gods liberal blessing, love, and grace upon them that shall sow liberally, 11. and from the thanksgiving that shall be made for it to God by them who shall be partakers of their liberality, 14 and from the prayers which they shall make for them to God.
\p
\v 1 For concerning the ministration [Hereby may be understood either the contribution itself, or the manner of collecting it, and sending it to Jerusalem, which he leaves wholly to their pleasure, because he knew that they had long since been ready thereunto, and had sufficient prudence to the same well and duly ] which (is done) for the Saints, is it needless for me to write unto you. [namely, more largely or further.]
\p
\v 2 . For I know the readiness of your mind, of which I boast of you to the Macedonians, that Achaia [Of which Corinth was the chief City. See Rom. 15. 26. and 1 Cor. 1, 2.] was ready for a year ago: and the zeal (begun) by you, hath stirred up many.
\p
\v 3 . But I have sent these brethren [Namely, Titus with the two others, of whom mention is made in the former chapter] that our boasting which (we have) of you, should not be made vain in this part: that (as I have said) ye may be ready. [namely, against I come, as the following verse declares.]
\p
\v 4 . (And) left it may be if the Macedonians should come with me [That is, the brethren which were chosen by the churches of Macedonia, for the bringing over of their collection] and should you unready, we (that we say not, you) should be ashamed, in this firm ground of boasting. [Gr. in this substance of boasting, i.e. in my firm confidence and bold boasting of you, namely, that ye would not be wanting.]
\p
\v 5 . I thought (it) needful therefore to exhort these brethren that they should first come to you, and prepare your before-mentioned blessing, [This may be understood either of that which Titus had declared to them from Paul in his return from them; as may be gathered from chapter 7. v. 13. Or of that which Paul had written unto them whereof before in first Epistle in the beginning of 16th chap.] that it may be ready so as a blessing, [that is, as a free and liberal gift, as a blessing hath that property that it proceeds from a well-affected and liberal heart: an Hebrew phrase] and not as a niggardliness. [that is, not as a gift wrung from covetousness, or desire to have more, from which sort of men it can hardly be obtained that they give anything; or if they give ought, it is very unwillingly, and as it were wrung or wrested from them.]
\p
\v 6 . And this (I say) he that soweth sparingly, shall also reap sparingly: and he that soweth in blessings, [That is, freely and liberally, as in the former verse. Understand always, according to what a man hath, as 2 Cor. 8. 12.] Shall also reap [that is, receive abundant recompense from God, Gal 6. 9.] in blessings.
\p
\v 7 . (Let) every one (do) even as he purposeth [ Gr. electeth, chuseth, namely of his own free will] in (his) heart: not of grief or of necessity. [namely, for fear of being blamed if he should do otherwise, or loosing his respect with men] For God loveth a cheerful giver.
\p
\v 8 . And God is able to cause all grace [That is, means to be able to be bountiful towards every one] to be abundant in you: that ye in all things always having all sufficiency, [namely, not only with your selves in your mind, which is great gain, 1 Tim. 6. 6. but also abundance, to be able to relieve others in all kinds of necessity] may be abundant unto every good work.
\p
\v 9 . As it is written, [Namely, Psal. 112. 9. where the Prophet also describes the properties of a godly man in this manner] he hath dispersed, he hath gived to the poor: his righteousness [that is, his bounty by the Hebrews. See Psa. 112. 9.] abideth for ever. [namely, in the remembrance of men, and also of God, to be of grace rewarded for ever, Mat. 25. 34. etc. Luke 12. v. 33. and chapter 16. 9. & c.]
\p
\v 10 . But let him that affordeth seed to the sower, also afford bread for meat, [Others dinstinguish this thus, and also bread for meat, he afford and multiply, etc.] and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness: [that is, liberality as v. 9.]
\p
\v 11 . That ye may be rich in all things unto all bountifulness, [Or simplicity] which by us worketh thanksgiving unto God. [Namely, by the poor and such as suffer want, who are stirred up to thank God, when they receive such benefits from us, as the following verses further declare.]
\p
\v 12 . For the ministration of this service [Gr. Leitourgias, which word signifies indeed all manner of public service, as is noted, Acts 13. 2. but is also sometimes taken for a service of offering, as alms are also called spiritual offerings, Phil. 4. 18. Heb. 13. 16. which signification therefore suits not amiss here also] doth not only supply the want of the Saints, but is also abundant by many thanksgivings unto God.
\p
\v 13 . While by the proof [Or approbation, good opinion] of this ministration, they glorify God for the subjection of your confession under the Gospel of Christ, [That is, that ye hereby openly confess or testify, that ye subject your selves in all things unto the Gospel of Christ, which also especially commendeth the works of charity] and (for) the bountifulness of communication unto them and unto all.
\p
\v 14 . And by their prayer for you [Namely, which the believers at Jerusalem being stirred up by your liberality shall make the more servently for you] who long after you, [or are very desirous after you, namely, that they may daily here of your welfare. It may also be translated, who bear great affection to you] for the excellent grace of God upon you. [that is, because they have understood by us and others, how great grace and what great gifts the Lord hath given to your church, Acts 21. 18, 19.]
\p
\v 15 . But thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift. [Herewith the Apostle concludes this whole discourse, to admonish them that the glory of all the fore-mentioned glorying and gifts, whereof he had spoken, and for which he had praised them, must be ascribed not properly to them, but to God alone, for their humiliation.]
\c 10
\s 1. Paul upon occasion that some false Apostles among the Corinthians said, that his writing was of some worth, but his presence of small esteem. 3. Treats of the Apostolical power which God had given him to coercing of the disobedient in his church, 4. not by carnal or temporal, but by spiritual weapons, which are powerful thereunto through God. 8. Yet that this power was given him for edification and not for pulling down, 10. which he not only being absent by letters, but also being present, was ready to show forth against such. 12. That he being strengthened with this power had spread the Gospel even unto that place. 15. Not where others had laboured before, 16. and that he was resolved to proceed thus, not only among them to strengthen them, but also in the countries lying beyond them. Yet that he saith this, not to boast of himself, but of the grace of God among them.
\p
\v 1 Furthermore I Paul my self entreat [Or exhort] you by the meekness and kindness [Gr. equity, moderation] of Christ, who being present [Gr. according to the face, i.e. present, or according to the outward appearance] am indeed mean [or low. These words Paul relateth as out of the mouth of some false Apostles, who in this wise sought to make the earnest exhortations of the Apostle set down in the former Epistle of none effect] among you, but being absent am bold towards you.
\p
\v 2 . I entreat therefore that being present I may not be bold [That is, may not be constrained by the disobedience of these, being present really to use such boldness in reproving] with that boldness wherewith I am thought to have dealt boldly against some, [namely, in writing and threatening when I am not present] who esteem us as if we walked after the flesh. [that is, used carnal or human ways to get us respect with men.]
\p
\v 3 . For walking in the flesh [That is, in this life, as weak and mean persons. See Heb. 5. 7. ] we war not [So he calls his dealing and walking amongst men in the spreading abroad of the Holy Gospel. See 1 Tim. 1. 18. and 2 Tim. 4. 7.] after the flesh. [that is, after the manner of carnal or deceitful men. See 2 Cor. 1. 17. for so the Apostle is wont to use this word, after the flesh, in several places.]
\p
\v 4 . For the weapons of our warfare [That is, the weapons which we use, by the Gospel of Christ to convert men, and to bring them under the Kingdom and obedience of Christ] are not carnal, [that is, such as natural men are wont to make use of, either by eloquence, or by deceit, or by force to bring others under them] but powerful through God [Gr. powerful to God, i.e. by the power which God joins with it, as well in working of miracles, Mark 16. 20. as in the moving and convincing of the hearts by his spirit Acts 16. 14. and also withal in punishing of them who sought to withstand this . See an example in Barjesus, Acts 13. 8.] to the throwing down of strength. [so the Apostle calls, whatsoever Satan and the world, whether by persecutions, or by worldy wisdom and eloquence, casteth in the way to hinder the course of the Gospel, as the two following verses declare. See also Jer. 1. ver. 10, 18, 19.]
\p
\v 5 . Seeing we cast down [That is, subject to Christ and his word. For human reason must be no Judge over the Gospel, but bow and yield it self captive under it: as the following words also declare] reasonings [namely, which the natural reason of man brings forth, to deprive the Gospel of its esteem] and every height [namely, of reputed wisdom or valour] which lifts up itself against the knowledge of God, and lead captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ. [that is, of the Gospel of Christ which is indeed foolishness to them that perish, but to them that are saved it is the power of God, 1 Cor. 1. 18.]
\p
\v 6 . And have ready (that which serves) to revenge all disobedience, [This the Apostle speaks not of any outward or worldy revenge. For that Christ hath forbidden his Apostles, Mat. 20. 25. and 26. 52. but of the declaration of the wrath of God upon the stiffnecked, and of the exercise of excommunication against them, who giving themselves out for members of the Church, nevertheless reach or live unchristianly] when your obedience shall be fulfilled. [that is, be accomplished, or demonstrated to the full. And this the Apostle saith for mollifying of the foregoing threatening, to move them to prevent this punishment by amendment of such offences: forasmuch as there must also convenient time and means for repentance be given to such, before the last punishment may be used.]
\p
\v 7 . Do ye look on that which is before the eyes? [Gr. the things which hath an outward show before them; or whereof any one would boast outwardly] If any man trust with himself that he is Christ, let him think this again of himself, that even as he is Christ’s, so we also are Christ’s.
\p
\v 8 . For if also should boast somewhat more abundantly of our power, [Namely, which we as Apostles of Christ have received from Christ more than other disciples] use it so, that the sinner may thereby be brought to repentance and not to despair. See 1 Cor. 5. 5. 2 Cor. 2. ver. 6, 7, 8.] and not for your pulling down, I shall not be ashamed:
\p
\v 9 . That I might one seem as if I would affright you by letters. [That is, would make you afraid only by the weightness and authority of letters. And so the Apostle answers another slander of some false Apostles, as is hereafter declared by him more at large.]
\p
\v 10 . For the letters (say they) [Namely, the false Apostles. Others read saith he, as if he spoke of a special one among them] are indeed weighty and powerful, but the presence of the body is weak, and the speech is contemptible. [that is, his speeches and words having nothing of worth or excellency when he is present].
\p
\v 11 . Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word by letters, when we are absent, we are also such indeed [That is, in executing of that which we threaten by letters] when we are present.
\p
\v 12 . For we dare not count [Or, join, i.e. not reckon or judge ourselves to be amongst such] or compare ourselves with some who praise themselves: but these understand not [or, are not wise] that they measure themselves by themselves, [Gr. in themselves, i.e. will be estremed according to their own opinion or self conceits] and compare themselves with themselves. [namely, without looking upon others, to whom the Lord hath imparted greater gifts and power: as were the Apostles of Christ.]
\p
\v 13 . But we will not boast without the measure: [Gr. to or in things which are without measure, i.e. without measure, i.e. without the measure which God hath imparted to us; even as others do] but that according to the measure of the rule, which measure God hath imparted to us; [or, which God hath imparted to us for a measure, that is which God hath prescribed to us, and wherewith he hath bounded our ministry. A similitude taken from them, who divide, each his inheritance to build there, or his field to sow thereon, or his vineyard to plant thereon] we are also come even unto you. [namely, in spreading abroad of the holy Gospel, and planting of the Church of Christ.]
\p
\v 14 . For we stretch not ourselves forth to wide, as who should not come to you: [That is, as if we must not come unto you. Gr. as not coming unto you] for we are also come even unto you in the Gospel of Christ.
\p
\v 15 . Not boasting without the measure [Namely, prescribed or determined to us by Christ] in other (men’s) labour, [That is, where the Gospel of Christ is already spread by others] but having hope when your faith shall be grown [that is, be increased or strengthened] that we shall be abundantly enlarged among you [or, spread forth, namely, in the prescribed bounds of our preaching. Others join these words together thus, when your faith shall be grown or strengthened among you, that we shall be abundantly enlarged, i.e. spread forth] according to our rule: [that is, in the spreading abroad of our prescribed part, so that the word rule is here taken for the limits or the determined portion of Countries & Cities, where each Apostle was to bestow his labour. And this agrees well with the following verse. For this is it which the Apostle here declares, that their weaknesses and defects were yet an impediment, that he could not as yet travel into the countries lying beyond them, to plant the Gospel there; but when they should have amended those defects and be duly strengthened in the faith, that then he might boldly and without suspicion go forward unto others.]
\p
\v 16 . To publish the Gospel in the (places) which are (situate) on the further side of you: not to boast in another rule [That is, where another had already the bounds of his calling and preached. See Rom. 15. 20.] of that which is (already) made ready.
\p
\v 17 . But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. [That is, ascribe all the praise of his labour to the Lord; seeing the power itself to labour, and the fruits thereof, proceed onely from his blessing. See 1 Cor. 3. 5. and 15. 10.]
\p
\v 18 . For not he that praiseth himself, but whom the Lord praiseth, he is approved. [That is, after proof, known, acknowledge and found to be faithful and upright.]
\c 11
\s 1. The Apostle testifies his zeal for the Corinthians, to keep them to the simplicity which is an Christ, 3. and exhorts them that they suffer not themselves to be seduced from it, as Eve was seduced by the serpent, 4. forasmuch as not only no false Apostles, but even no other Apostle of Christ, could contribute anything to them which they had received by him. 6. For that he had not boasted among them as these, but carried himself humbly, and not so much as received maintenance, as he had indeed done of other churches, 11 was not done because he did not love them, 12. but to deprive the false Apostles of their boasting, who changed themselves into Angels of light. 16. And although it be not wisely done to boast much, 18. yet nevertheless he shows that none of these can boast of anything, of which he cannot also boast, 23. yea that in suffer and labouring for the things of Christ he went beyond them all, 28. besides the care that he had for all the churches, 32. and the troubles which in the beginning of his ministry he had endured at Damascus, where he escaped in a basket over the walls of the City.
\p
\v 1 Oh if you would bear with me a little in imprudence: [This the Apostle saith, not because he would do unwisely, but because he would do as the unwise sometimes use to do, who willingly spread abroad their own praise. But the Apostle was constrained to do it here, to stop the mouths of the false Apostles, who lifted themselves up above Paul, that so they might make his Gospel suspected, and commend their own, and might make his Gospel suspected, and commend their own, and might the better gain audience with Corinthians] yea also bear with me. [or but ye also bear with me.]
\p
\v 2 . For I am zealous for you, [Or jealous] with a zeal [or jealousy] of God. For I have prepared you, [ or adorned, fitted, i.e. by the preaching of the Gospel brought you to faith, and by faith to Christ, and as it were betrothed you to him, whereupon the spiritual marriage must follow. See Psa. 45. 10, 11. Ezek. 16. 8. Hos. 2. 18. Eph. 5. 23. etc] (as) a pure virgin to present (you) to one husband, (namely) to Christ.
\p
\v 3 . But I fear lest in any wise as the serpent [That is, Satan by the serpent] beguiled Eve by its Subtlety, [Gr. in, i.e. under show of friendship, and that he would bring them to greater honour and esteem] so your senses should be corrupted to turn away from the simplicity [that is, uprightness, without ostentation of human eloquence, or adjoining of human wisdom, wherewith these false Apostles sought by little and little to seduce them, and to draw them away from Christ] which is in Christ.
\p
\v 4 . For if he that cometh [Hereby some think that he signifieth the principal among them, yet it may also be understood in general for any one whosoever it be] should preach another Jesus, [namely, of whom he should feel the power and fruits greater, then those of the true Jesus, whom I have preached to you: and so in that which followeth. Otherwise the Apostle curseth even an Angel from heaven, who should preach any other thing, Gal. 1. 8. Therefore he speaketh this by way of concession of a thing, which nevertheless cannot be, to bring them to greater consideration] whom we have not preached, or if ye should receive another Spirit, whom ye have not received, or another Gospel which ye have not received, ye might justly [Gr. well] bear with (him).
\p
\v 5 . For I Judge that in nothing I was less than most excellent Apostles. [Some take this as spoken by the false Apostles, who accounted themselves more excellent than the Apostles themselves, But it may also be well be understood of the true Apostles, who excelled amongst the rest, whose authority and imitation these at Corinth falsely pretended, wherefore the Apostle compares himself with these, See the like Gal. 2. 6, 9.]
\p
\v 6 . And if I am also mean in words, [Gr. Idiots. See of this word, 1 Cor. 14. 16. Namely, as these boasters of their eloquence and human wisdom backbite me. For otherwise the simple stile of the Apostle in power and divineness, goes far beyond all human eloquence and writings. See 1 Cor. 1. 25. and chapter 2. v. 4, 5.] yet am I not in knowledge: but every way in all things we are become manifest among you. [or to you, in you, namely, by the virtues, gifts, and operations which ye have received by our gospel.]
\p
\v 7 . Have I committed sin when I humbled my self, [Namely, to maintain my self with mine own hands, without burdening you, Acts 18. 3. And it seems that these false Apostles raised an ill report thence of Paul, as if thereby he had carried himself contemptibly among them, or had not enough esteemed the Corinthians that he would not receive his maintenance from them: unto both which he afterward answers distinctly] that ye might be exalted? Forasmuch as I have declared [Gr. Evangelized] unto you the Gospel of God for nothing?
\p
\v 8 . I robbed other churches, [That is, received from them that which ye ought to have given] taking wages (of them) to minister unto you: [Gr. into your ministry] and when I was present with you, and had want, I became burdensome to no man. [the Greek word properly signifies so to oppress any one that he looseth his feelings as a member that sleepeth or is benumbed. Others translate it, to be idle to any ones hindrance. See of the same word, 2 Cor. 12. v. 13, 14.]
\p
\v 9 . For my want the brethren supplied, [Namely, who were fellow ministers with Paul, 2 Cor. 8. 16. and chapter 9. 3. See also Phil. 4. 15.] who came from Macedonia: and I have in all things kept myself without burdening you, and shall (still so) keep (my self.) [namely, so also henceforward, as the following words declare.]
\p
\v 10 . The truth of Christ is in me, [That is, as true as the truth of Christ is in me. A form of taking an oath. See Rom. 9. 1.] that this boasting shall not be hindered [Gr. stopped, obstructed, or stopped up, as a way is stopped up with a mound or hedge, i.e. hindered or taken away, or suspended. The reason why Paul would do the same no otherwise in Achaia, whereof Corinth is the Chief City, is declared in the 12 verse following] in me, in the coasts of Achaia.
\p
\v 11 . Wherefore? It is because I love you not? [Namely, as if I despised you thereby, as these men would make you believe] God knoweth it. [namely, that I love you.]
\p
\v 12 . But what I do, that will I yet do to cut off occasion from them that would (have) occasion, that in that of which they boast, they may be found even as we. [Some interpret this thus, as if these false Apostles served the churches for naught also as Paul did: but this is contrary to that which is testified of them, v. 20. The meaning therefore is, that Paul would therefore also serve in the churches of Achaia without recompense, left if he should change his doing and receive wages of them, these men should boast that they therein did even as Paul and his (companions) who indeed at the first seemed to have served for naught, when as yet they were become bolder and of greater esteem, took their wages also as well as they: to which boasting he would give them no occasion.]
\p
\v 13 . For such false Apostles are deceitful labourers, changing themselves into Apostles of Christ. [That is, taking upon them the show and appearance of Apostles of Christ, as if they would imitate them.]
\p
\v 14 . And it is no wonder: for Satan himself changeth himself into an Angel of Light. [That is, into the shape of a Holy Angel, which dwelleth with God in the eternal light as on the contrary the Kingdom of Satan is called a Kingdom of darkness, and his habitation, darkness, Colos. 1. 13. 2 Pet. 2. 4. Jud. Ver. 6.]
\p
\v 15 . If is therefore no great thing, if his Ministers also change themselves, as (if they were) Ministers of righteousness: whose end [That is, the final recompense or final or reward. See Mat. 25. 41. so this word also is also taken, 1 Pet. 1. 9.] Shall be according to their works.
\p
\v 16 . I say again, let no man think that I am unwise: [Namely, If I go to compare myself with these men, seeing by their boasting they compel me thereunto] yet if not, [that is, if ye judge that I do not wisely herein, hear me at least in my folly even as ye hear others. A phrase taken by concession] receive me (then) as an unwise one, that I also may boast a little.
\p
\v 17 . What I speak not after the Lord, [That is, not as is worthy of the Lord or his Ministers. Namely, if ye look upon the outward words only, and do not mark the scope or end why I do thus, which is to vindicate my Apostleship among you against these boasters, which I am also bound to do for the Lords sake] but as it were in folly, in this firm ground of boasting. [Gr. substantial ness of boasting, or confidence, boldness. See chapter 9. v. 4.]
\p
\v 18 . Seeing many boast after the flesh, [That is, of things which concern the outward state of man] I will boast also.
\p
\v 19 . For ye gladly suffer the unwise, seeing ye are wise. [That is, think your selves to be wise. A manner of speaking when a man saith one thing and understands the contrary, for the reprehension and amendment of such.]
\p
\v 20 . For ye suffer it, if any man make you bond-men, [This the Apostle saith, as also that which follows, of the false Apostles, who spoke high, and carried themselves as Lords among them, with a great train and pomp, and in the mean time despised and exhausted the church] if any one devour you, if any one take (from you, if any one exalt himself, if any one smite you in the face. [that is, do you the greatest dishonour, despite and contempt: spoken by similitude.]
\p
\v 21 . I speak (this) according to dishonour, [That is, as concerning dishonour, or because of dishonour, or unto dishonour] as if we had been weak; [that is, as if it were true which these say, that we had been weak and contemptible among you. Others translate it, even as we were weak, i.e. we were contemptible among you, which they also backbite us with to our dishonour] but wherein any one is bold. [that is, deals or speaks boldly] (I speak in folly) (therein) am I bold also.
\p
\v 22 . Are they Hebrews? I also : are they Israelites? I also: are they the seed of Abraham? I also:
\p
\v 23 . Are they Ministers of Christ? ( I speak being unwise) I am above (them:) [ That is, I have in the service of Christ, done, suffered and endured more than they, which he proves by the following examples] in labour more abundant, in stripes more exceeding, in prisons more abundant, in (danger) of death [Gr. deaths i.e. notable dangers of death. See the like phrase, 1 Cor. 15. 31. and 2 Cor. 1. v. 10.] oftentimes.
\p
\v 24 . Of the Jews I received five times, forty stripes save one. [Paul here alludeth to the Law, Deu. 25. 3. Where it is commanded that the Judges should not cause more than forty stripes to be given in punishing, which number the Jews that they might not exceed they gave one less.]
\p
\v 25 . Thrice was I scourged with rods [Or beaten with staves. Namely, of the Gentile Magistrates, besides the five times that I was so beaten by the Jews, whereof he spoke in the former verse] I was once stoned, thrice suffered I shipwreck; a (whole) night and day I passed over in the deep.
\p
\v 26 . In journeying often, in perils of rivers, in perils of murderers, [Or robbers.] in perils of (mine own) kindred, [Gr. out of my kindred, namely, of the Jews, as appears by the opposition of the Gentiles] in perils of [Gr. out of] the Gentiles, in perils in the City, [that is, in the Cities: except men should hereby understand the City of Jerusalem, which for its excellency may be so called here] in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the Sea, in perils among false brethren.
\p
\v 27 . In labour and trouble, in watching often, in hunger and thirst, in fasting often, in cold and nakedness.
\p
\v 28 . Besides the things which are from without, [That is, which are done to me by those which are without the churches. Or which are done to me according to the outward man] there falls upon me daily [Gr. my falling upon, which is daily] the care of all the churches.
\p
\v 29 . Who is weak [Or who is distressed, or hath trouble procured to him] that I am not weak? [ He speaks not here of weakness in mind or in the faith, seeing he must comfort and strengthen them all, but of the anguish and compassion which he had in their behalf] who is offended, that I burn not? [namely, with a burning zeal for the glory of God; and the salvation of those that are offended.]
\p
\v 30 . If men must boast, I will boast of the things of mine infirmity. [That is, of mine adversities and distresses: namely, because thereby I am brought to the feeling and experience of Gods grace, which more and more strengthens me therein.]
\p
\v 31 . The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is praised for ever, knoweth that I lie not. [A manner of taking an oath, or calling upon God for a witness of that which he saith, as 2 Cor. 1. 23.]
\p
\v 32 . The Governor of King Aretas [Gr. the ruler of the people. Namely, being stirred up against me by the Jews. See Acts 9. 24, 25.] in Damascus, beset the City of the Damascenes, intending to take me.
\p
\v 33 . And I was let down through a window in a basket over [Or by] the wall, and escaped his hands.
\c 12
\s 1. The Apostle to show how great cause he hath to boast above others, relates how he was drawn up into the third heaven, and they heard that which no man can utter. 7. That therefore for his humiliation an Angel if Satan was given him which buffeted him, 8. against which he had besought the Lord thrice, and received answer that Gods grace must be sufficient for him. 10. That therefore he rather boasts in his infirmity and humility. 11. Excuseth himself that he must boast again true evidences of his Apostleship among them, 12. which notwithstanding they were indeed sensible enough of. 14. Testifieth that now the third time he will come to them in anything, 16. as neither others sent from him; nor yet Titus, were in anything burden some unto them. 20. Warns them finally that they amend the faults of contention, high-mindedness, fornication, & c. among them before he come, that he to sorrow be not necessitated to use his Apostolical power upon such.
\p
\v 1 To boast truly is not expedient for me. [Or suits not well with me. [Namely, because boasting hath a show of self-conceitedness. Understand this then, except I were constrained thereto for the defense of mine Apostleship. See here v. 11, 12.] For I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. [that is, which the Lord hath made or showed me.]
\p
\v 2 . I know a man in Christ, [That is, which is in Christ, or a Christian. So he speaketh of himself in the third person in token of humility, as if it were a thing which were without him. Others take this word in Christ, for by Christ: for a form of an oath, as Rom. 9. 1. and hereafter v. 19.] fourteen years ago, (whether it (was done) in the body I know not: [that is, whether it were only showed me by an ecstasy in my spirit: or that my spirit for a time was brought out of my body up into heaven both body and soul, or with the soul only, that I know not] or without the body, I know not: God knoweth it) that such a one was drawn up even into the third heaven. [that is, into the habitation of the Angels and holy souls, which v. 4. he calleth paradise by a similitude taken from the earthly paradise, see Luke 23. 43. Rev. 2. 7. The cause why this is called the third heaven, is, because the air is accounted the first heaven, the visible heavens in which the stars are, the second, and the heaven above all those heavens, the third. See 1 Kings 8. 27.]
\p
\v 3 . And I know such a man (whether it (happened) in the body or without the body I know not: God knoweth it : )
\p
\v 4 . That he was drawn up into Paradise [See ver. 2.] and heard unutterable words, which it is not lawful for a man to speak. [Or, cannot speak forth. Namely, because they go beyond a man’s capacity in this life : or because God willed not this, seeing these things served Paul alone to strengthen him against all the troubles which pursued him in his ministry. Otherwise, Paul revealed the whole counsel of God concerning the salvation of men, to the Churches. See Acts 20. 27.]
\p
\v 5 . Of such a one I will boast: but of myself I will not boast, but in mine infirmities. [that is, in my troubles and tribulations, which are come upon me, as heretofore chapter 11. 23. etc. and hereafter ver. 9. is declared.]
\p
\v 6 . For if I will boast I shall not be unwise: for I will speak the truth: but I abstain (from it) that no man think of me above that which he seeth that I am, or that he heareth from me.
\p
\v 7 . And that I should not exalt myself by the excellency of revelations, there was given me a sharp thorn [Gr. scolops, which word signifies a sharp stake, or pricking splinter, or thorny wood that sticks in any one’s leg or flesh, when they go through woods or thickets. It signifies also sometimes a caltrop; which is cast before horses or men in their going, or to hinder or retard them. See Numb. 33. 35. Ezek. 28. 24. Both significations agree well with Paul’s discourse] in the flesh (namely) an Angel of Satan [or an Angel Satan, who was a instrument that procured him this trouble for his humiliation, as is to be seen in the example of Job] that he should buffet me, [or should give me blows in the cheeks, i.e. procure me reproach and trouble. Now what trouble this was the Apostle doth not express. Some think that they were the persecutions and tribulations themselves: others some pains and distresses of the body, which sometimes came upon him; others that they were troubles and temptations of the soul, but all is uncertain; this only appears out of the 9. and 10. verses, that it were some special weaknesses of the soul or of the body] that I might not exalt myself.
\p
\v 8 . For this I besought the Lord thrice [That is, divers times] that he might depart from me.
\p
\v 9 . And he said unto me, my grace [Namely, whereby I so strengthen thee against these weaknesses, that thou maist overcome them. See 1 Cor. 10. 13.] (is) enough for thee: for my power is accomplished [that is, brought to an end, or showed to be perfect , as jam. 2. 22.] in weakness. I will therefore much rather boast in mine infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell in me. [or dwell upon me. The Greek word signifies to inhabit or overshadow any thing, as a booth or Tabernacle.]
\p
\v 10 . Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak [Namely, in myself, by all such distresses and troubles] then am I mighty. [namely, through God, who strengthens and comforts me in the midst of them.]
\p
\v 11 . I am (in) boasting become unwise: ye have constrained me: For I ought to be praised by you: for I was in nothing less [namely, by the grace of God, which guided and assisted me, 1 Cor. 15. 10.] then the most excellent Apostles, though I be nothing. [namely, of myself, 1 Cor. 3. 7.]
\p
\v 12 . The signs of an Apostle [Namely, whereby a true Apostle of Christ is known] were showed among you [Gr. wrought out] in all patience, with signs [Gr. in] and wonders, and mighty (deeds).
\p
\v 13 . For what is there wherein ye were less than the other churches, [Namely, which were planted and set up by other Apostles, with whom he here compares himself] other, than that I myself was not burdensome unto you? [namely, by taking maintenance of you, for my self and those that were with me] forgive me this wrong. [a sharp reprehension by a manner of speaking, whereof see 2 Cor. 11. 19. Or this injustice.]
\p
\v 14 . Behold, I am the third time [See hereof chapter 13. 1.] ready to come unto you, and will not be burdensome unto you. For I seek not yours but you. [that is, not yours goods, but your salvation] For the children must not gather treasures for the parents, but the parents for the children.
\p
\v 15 . And I will very willingly be at cost [Namely, to maintain myself and mine among you] and be expended for your souls: [that is, even hazard my life for the salvation of your souls] although I loving you more abundantly, be the less loved.
\p
\v 16 . But be it so, I have not burdened you: but seeing I was crafty [This is a slander of the false Apostles whose words he rehearseth, and afterwards confutes] I caught you with deceit. [or possessed you, i.e. so brought you to me with gentle reins, that afterwards I might make mine advantage of you.]
\p
\v 17 . Have I by any one of those whom I sent unto you sought mine advantage of you? [Or forced anything from you, oppressed by covetousness or pressed any thing from you, as the Greek word imports, so also in the following verse.]
\p
\v 18 . I besought Titus, and sent a brother with him, hath Titus also sought his advantage of you? Have we not walked in the same spirit? [That is, were we not led by the same Spirit of God in our dealing and walking among you] (have we) not (walked) in the same footsteps.
\p
\v 19 . Again, think ye that we excuse our selves unto you?
\p [Namely, only to make our own matters fair unto you, and not much rather for your sake, to confirm you in the truth received] We speak in the presence of God in Christ, [See before the annot. On ver. 2 .] and all this beloved for your edification.
\p
\v 20 . For I fear lest when I shall be come, I shall not in some sort find you such as I would, [That is, many among you going on carelessly in the same faults, as is declared in the end of this verse] and (that) I shall be found of you such as ye would not: [That is, sharper in the exercising of Ecclesiastical discipline, then hitherto ye have experienced] lest any wise there (should be) strifes, envies, wrath, chiding, backbiting, whisperings, puffing up, commotions. [or, uproar, disturbances.]
\p
\v 21 . Least when I shall be come again, my God should humble me among you, [This the Apostle saith because there was nothing that more exalted and rejoiced him, than that his labour had its due fruits among them: and that nothing more humbled and grieved him, than when through sins and scandals his labour seemed to suffer prejudice, interruption. See 1 Thes. 2. 19. 20.] and I should be sorry for many, who have sinned before, [namely, whereof he had written in the former Epistle] and who shall not have repented of the uncleanness, and fornication, and immodesty [or, lasciviousness, wantonness, petulancy] which they have committed.
\c 13
\s 1. The Apostle now again testifies, that if the former sins be not amended, he will come without further delay to punish the committers of them, 3. and to cause them really to find how powerful Christ was in him. 5. Admonisheth them that they should search themselves whether Christ be in them. 7. Wisheth again that they would prevent the punishment by well-doing, 9. and declareth that then he shall rejoice over them, 10. Seeing his power must tend to edification and not to demolishing. 11. Afterwards concludes the Epistle with an exhortation to divers Christian virtues, 12. with the accustomed salutation, 13. and with a prayer for them unto God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
\p
\v 1 This is the third time (that) I come unto you: [This he saith, not that he was thrice at Corinth, but because he having been there once Acts 18. afterward had twice purposed and promised to come: once in the first Epistle chapter 16. 5. and now again here] in the mouth of two or [Gr. and] three witnesses, shall every word stand. [that is, every matter, or truth be confirmed.]
\p
\v 2 . I have said it before, and foretell it as if I were present the second time, and I write it now being absent to them that have sinned before [Namely, of whom he hath written in the former Epistle, and who have not repented] and to all the others, [namely, who have since followed their example] if I come again, I will not spare (them:) [namely, in the actual execution of the threatened punishment, or spiritual discipline and banishment.]
\p
\v 3 . Seeing ye seek a proof [That is, seem to seek: for such a one is said to seek Gods judgment who being warned repenteth not] of Christ who speaketh in me, [or, by me] who is not weak in you, [namely, in the doing of mighty signs, and gifts of the spirit, knowledge of tongues, and other the like] but is powerful among you.
\p
\v 4 . For although he was crucified [That is, as a weak man suffered himself to be crucified, and given up to death for us, whereas nevertheless he was also in the form of God, Phil. 2. 7.] through [Gr. out of, as also in that which follows] weakness, notwithstanding he liveth [that is, is risen and advanced in glory] by the power of God. [that is, by the power of his divine nature, which then manifested itself; although before it kept itself in, John 2. 19. and chapter 10. 18. For that Paul here speaketh of the divine power which is in Christ, appeareth from hence, that he threatens them with this power, which Christ will show forth by him against the rebellious, which he saith is the same, whereby Christ raised himself from the dead. See Rom. 1. 4. and 1 Pet. 3. 18.] for we also are weak [that is, we carry ourselves as if we were but weak contemptible men] in him, [that is, as being his members, and as comformable into him therein] but shall live with him by the power of God in you, [That is, after the example of Christ, we shall show towards you that the power of Christ liveth in us, and shall manifest itself by his punishing hand against the disobedient.]
\p
\v 5 . Search your selves whether ye be in the faith. [Namely, to be certainly convinced in your mind of the truth of mine Apostleship: for so doing ye shall find ye have true faith in Christ, and that Christ liveth in you by Spirit, which ye have obtained by my Gospel] Prove your selves. [namely, by the true proofs and evidences of true faith, & of true union with Christ] Or know ye not your selves that Jesus Christ is in you? Except that in any wise ye are reprovable. [or, are rejected, i.e. be such persons as cannot endure the trial. The word in any wise mollifies this threatening of the Apostle, as if he should say, if ye do not say this, ye are in danger to be reprobable or rejected. For he that sincerely believes in Christ he is well assured that he is elected, John 6. 37. and chapter 8. 47. Rom. 8. 30. etc. but he that embraceth not the preaching of the Gospel by a true faith, and neglecteth or despiseth the grace that is offered, is indeed in danger of being a rejected person, yet we must not despair of him as he liveth: because the Lord sometimes also calleth men at the eleventh hour, Mat. 20. ver. 6, 9. and also in the last moment of their life, as the murtherer on the cross, Luke 23. 40. etc. Heb. 3. 7, 13. Others take this word reprobable nature, until they be made fit by Gods spirit, 2 Cor. 3. 5. And therefore this cannot be taken here.]
\p
\v 6 . But I hope that ye shall understand [Namely, if ye duly search yourselves] that we are not to be rejected. [that is, reprobable or contemptible Apostles, as these backbite us.]

\v 7 . And I wish from God that ye do no evil; not [That is, not so much ] that we might be found [Gr. be manifest, or seem] approved, [that is, faithful and upright: might be found, held and known for faithful Apostles] but that ye might do good, we might be as reprobable. [namely, before the eyes and according to the esteem of men, seeing in such a case we should give no signs of our spiritual power in punishing of sins.]
\p
\v 8 . For we are able to do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. [That is, for defense and confirmation of the truth: under which he here also understands uprightness of life.]
\p
\v 9 . For we rejoice when we are weak, [That is, in tribulation and contempt as diver’s times before] and ye are strong. [namely, in the gifts and grace of God] And we wish this also (namely) your perfecting. [or restoring, erecting, re-edifying.]
\p
\v 10 . Therefore I write these things being absent, that being present I might not use severity, [Gr. severely] according to the power which the Lord both given me for building up, and not for pulling down. [That is, to break or smite down any one by this punishing hand, or to rend him from the body of the church: but thereby to raise him up again, and to reconcile and unite him again unto Christ and his church. See 1 Cor. 5. 5.]
\p
\v 11 . Furthermore brethren be joyful, be perfect [Or set up again, re-edified, namely, unto union one with another] be comforted, be of one mind, live in peace: and the God of love and peace shall be with you.
\p
\v 12 . Salute one another with a holy kiss. [Namely, according to the custom of those Eastern churches, where this was token of unity, and of honour which they did one another. See Gen. 41. 40. Psa. 2. 12. ] All the Saints salute you.
\p
\v 13 . The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ [Namely, whereby he hath reconciled us to God, Rom. 5. 10. ] and the love of God, [namely wherewith he loveth us in Christ Jesus, and receiveth and keepeth us as his children, Rom. 8. 39.] and the communion of the Holy Ghost, [namely, whereby we are more and more strengthened in this grace and love, and are assured thereof, Rom. 8. 15. So that here is a clear testimony of the Holy Trinity: although the order of the persons is not set down here, as Mat. 28. 19.] be with you all. Amen.
