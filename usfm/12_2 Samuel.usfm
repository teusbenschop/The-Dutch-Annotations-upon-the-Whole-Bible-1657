\mt2 THE SECOND BOOK OF
\mt SAMUEL
\s THE ARGUMENTS OF THIS BOOK
\p In this book are described the passages, after Sauls death, under the Kingly Government of David. And therein is lively portrayed the incomprehensible grace and favour of God shew to David, not onely in blessings temporal and corporal, exalting him, to the comfort of his people, after much suffering, by his divine providence and direction to the Kingly office, first over Juda, then over all Israel, and further endowing him with many sons, under propping him likewise with stout officers and Commanders, and many valiant brave warlike Champions, adorning him with heroic valour, establishing, increasing, and enlarging his kingdom, and granting him very many and wonderful victories against all his foreign and domestic enemies: but also effectually in blessings spiritual and eternal: guiding him by the spirit of faith and adoption, of Prophecy, extraordinary, religiousness and godliness, wisdom, righteousness, meekness, humility, patience, and other very commendable virtues, which continually appeared in all his actions and government: making him besides (upon occasion. That he had a purpose to build God an house) those exceeding glorious promises of the spiritual, and everlasting Kingdom of the Messiah, our LORD and saviour Jesus CHRIST, that should proceed from his seed according to the flesh, and whose type God made both him, and also his Son and Successor Salomon.
\p On the contrary, there are also not concealed, but very circumstantially described, the grievous sins, whereby this most worthy servant and man of God, sometimes transgressed against his most bountiful God, by the seduction of Satan, and the weakness of his own flesh, especially in the matter of Uria the Hethite, and the presumptuous triumphing of the people: for which he indeed by true and hearty repentance found grace and mercy with God, but notwithstanding was chastised with sharp and smarting rods for his own and the Churches benefit; as appeareth by the great grief and hear take which he suffered from his children, wives, and subjects, and especially by that abominable and most dangerous conspiracy and rebellion of his own son Absalon, before whom he was said to flee in his old age. Although the LORD did not forsake him in this, and in all other troubles, nor cast him away from his presence; but withal strengthened him with an holy confidence and patience, and evermore gave him a good issue and event. A clearer evidence, that he is a faithful and holy God, who notwithstanding the manifold wants and unworthiness of his of children, yet faithfully keepeth his gracious Covenant; but in the mean while no way approveth or liketh of their sins. This Book containeth the history of about fourty years, Chap.5.4. Namely, from the beginning of David’s Kingdom, to the end of it; also, the last conspiracy of his son Adonia, together with his death, which are not described in this book, but in the beginning of the following first Book of the Kings.
\c 1
\s David being Ziklag, receiveth tiding of Saul and Jonathans death, vers.1,&c. For which he had and those that were with mourn, he causeth the messenger, that bragged he killed Saul, to be put to death,13. David’s lamentation for Saul and Jonathan, 17.
\p
\v 1 Moreover, it came to passé after Sauls death, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, [Heb. from smiting Amalek. See the history, 1 Sam.30.] and David had tarried two days at Ziklag: [See 1 Sam.27.6.]
\p
\v 2 . Then it came to passé on the third day, that behold, a man came out of the host, from Saul, whose clothes went rent, [In token of mourning, and grief of heart. See Genes.37.on vers.29.] and earth was upon his head: [Compare Jos.7.6. 1 Sam.4.12. and below chap.13.19. and 15.32. Job 2.12. Thus was in mourning a token of shame, unworthiness, and deep humiliation] and it came to pass, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and bowed himself down.
\p
\v 3 . And David said unto him; Whence comest thou? and he said unto him; I am escaped out of the Host of Israel.
\p
\v 4 . Moreover, David said unto him; What is the matter? [Or, properly what was the matter, or the business?] relate it to me, I pray thee: and he said, That the people were fled out of the battle, and that there were also many of the people fallen and dead, that also Saul, and his son Jonathan were dead.
\p
\v 5 . And David said unto the lad [i.e. youth, young man. See Genes.22.on vers.5.] that brought him the tidings: bow knowest thou that Saul is dead, and his son Jonathan?
\p
\v 6 . Then said the young man, that brought him the tidings; I came by chance [Heb. meeting I met, or, coming by chance I came by chance] upon the mountain of Gilead; [Lying in Issaschar, on the South-borders. See 1 sam.20.1. and 31.1.] and behold, Saul leaned upon his spear: [i.e. thrusted to make the head of his spear to pierce thorow his body] and behold the charets, and the Captains [Heb. the masters, or, lords of the Horseman] held close upon him. [Heb. clave, or, stuk close to him.]
\p
\v 7 . Then he looked behind him, and saw me: and he called me, and I said, Behold, (here) am I.
\p
\v 8 . And he said unto me; Who art thou? and I said unto him; I am an Amalekite.
\p
\v 9 . Then he said unto me; stand, I pray thee, by me, [Or, against me, upon me: or, stand up against me: so v.10.] and slay me, for this coat of mail [Or, eyed, or, embroidered military coat. The Hebrew word is thus only found in this place, and cometh from a word, which signfieth embroidering, or making work full of eyes, also compassing about, inlaying of precious stone in ouches eases, or, scutcheons. Therefore some translate it, this compassing about, bemming in, straitening (of the Horsemen) also terror, anguish, hath caught hold of me] hath kept me up, [That the spear could not pierce thorow into my body] for my life yet whole in me. [As if he should say, I have strongly endeavoured to take away my life with my spear, but it would not be, my life is yet whole in me]
\p
\v 10 . So I stood by him, and slew him, for I knew that he would not live after his fall: [After he was fallen upon his spear, and by means thereof was fallen down. This he addeth to excuse himself of being the cause of Sauls death, and to confirm, and put out of doubt the tidings which he brought. The Reader may compare this whole relation with 1 Sam.31. and judge of the matter] and I took the Crown that was upon his head, and the Bracelet that was upon his arm, and have brought them hither unto my Lord. [viz. David: i.e. unto thee. The Reader may compare this whole relation with 1 Sam.31. and judge what truth there is in the thing.]
\p
\v 11 . Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them [As above vers.2.] likewise also all the men that were with him.
\p
\v 12 . And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until the evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel, because they were fallen by the sword.
\p
\v 13 . Moreover, David said unto the Lad, that had brought him the tidings; whence art thou? and he said; I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.
\p
\v 14 . And David said unto him: How? wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand, to destroy [i.e. to slay, smite down, kill. Compare Judge.20.on vers.21, 25, 35, 42. and elsewhere] the LORDS anointed? [See 1 Sam.10.1. and 1 Kings 1.24.]
\p
\v 15 . And David called one of the Lads [His servants, or, courtiers] and said; Go near, fall upon him: and he smote him, that he died.
\p
\v 16 . And David said unto him; Thy blood be upon thine head: [See Judg.9.on vers.24. and Levit.20.on v.9.] for thy mouth hath witnessed against thee, saying: I have killed the LORDS anointed.
\p
\v 17 . Now David’s lamented (with) this lamentation, [which beginneth, ver.19.] over Saul, and over Jonathan his son;
\p
\v 18 . When he had said, [i.e. commanded, given order] that they should teach the Children of Juda [From which tribe David himself was descended, and who had the promise of God concerning the Kingdom, and valour in war, Genes.49.8, 9, 10.] the bowe: [To wit, the use or handling of the bow, to grow experienced archers and souldiers, after the example of Saul and Jonathan. See vers.22. This David did in the first place to raise up the people of God after the death of their King, and to encourage them that they might not be daunted by his following lamentation] behold, it is written in the book of the upright. [Of this book, see Jos.10.on v.13. This may be understood thus, that in this book was written, what order David had given concerning them, so as to make the use and exercise of arms a thing common to his tribe.]
\p
\v 19 . Ornament of Israel, [Thus he calleth God, from whom all Israels glory and ornament descended. Compare Deut.4.7, 8. and 33.29. Others apply it to Saul, or the Land of promise] he is smitten upon thy high places: [viz. Upon the mountains of Gilboa (vers.21. and 1 Sam.31.8.) which he calleth Gods high places, because they specially pertained to God, as lying in Israel] how are the champions fallen?
\p
\v 20 . Relate it not at Gath, publish it not the streets of Askelon: [Gath and Askelon were both inhabited by the Philistines, lying in the South west of the mountains of Gilboa by the Sea, Gath in Dan, and Askelon in Simeon. See Judg.14.on vers.19. and below chap.21.20, 22.] lest the Daughters of the Philistines rejoice, [blasp eming and mocking God and his people: as Judg.16.23, etc.] lest the Daughters of the uncircumcised [See judg.15.on vers.18.] leap up for joy. [By outward gestures and token of joy ascribing the praise of this victory unto their Gods]
\p
\v 21 . Ye mountains of Gilboa, let neither dew, nor rain be upon you, nor fields of heave-offerings: [i.e. let there be no fruitful fields upon these mountains, whereof heave-offerings might be made. Or, upon the heaved, or, lifted up fields, high fields. Heb. fields of heavings, or, liftings up. This serveth to move and stir up the Israelites at the things, that there happened. Compare Judg.5.23. Job 3. And elsewhere] for there the shield of the mighty is reproachfully [Or, loathsomely, vilely, contemptibly] cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil, [viz. Saul, who fell so shamefully and contemptibly, that it was pitful for one that was the Lords anointed to fall so. Others apply it to Sauls shield: as they were wont in those times to anointed the shields (that were covered with lether) with oil. See Isa.21.5. Oth. Without the anointed with oil: i.e. severed from the anointed, etc. viz. from Saul.]
\p
\v 22 . From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan was not driven back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty. [The meaning is, Jonathans bow, and Sauls sword were wont ever to hit sure, so that they turned not back without having felled to the ground the stoutest and valiantest souldiers of the enemy, though it have now (alas) happened quite otherwise]
\p
\v 23 . Saul and Jonathan, those beloved and close lovely (ones) in their life, were neither separated in their death: they were lighter [i.e. swister] then Eagles, they were stronger then Lions.
\p
\v 24 . Ye Daughters of Israel weep over Saul: who cloathed you with scarlet; [Protecting the Land against the enemies, so that it flourished in peace and abundance of all kind of riches, whereof this was a token] with delights [i.e. pleasantly, lovely, tenderly, that it was de lightful to behold. Oth. With (all manner of, or, with other] delights] who made you wear ornaments of gold upon your apparel. [Heb. who made ornaments of gold some up upon your apparel, by reason of the cause mentioned in the fore-going annotation, as also in regard of the prey, which he took from the enemies]
\p
\v 25 . How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle? Jonathan is slain upon thy high places. [See vers.19.]
\p
\v 26 . I am distressed for thy sake, my brother Jonathan; very lovely hast thou been unto me: thy love [Which thou barest to me] was more wonderful to me, then the love of women. [viz. where with men love women: i.e. it excelled the greatest love and friendship that can be among men, being for David’s comfort kindled, and preserved by the Holy Ghost in the heart of Jonathan]
\p
\v 27 . How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war [Or, instruments of war: viz. Saul and Jonathan, who were as Israels weapons and means, whereby Israel was defended and protected. It may also be properly understood of the weapons of war, which the Philistines got for a prey] lost?
\c 2
\s David at Gods command, removeth with his household and people to Hebron, vers.1,&c. Where those of Juda anoint him King over them, 4. He commendeth and comforteth the citizens of Jabes in Gilead, for burying Saul, 5. On the contrary Abner installeth Ishoseth Sauls son, King over Israel, 8. And leadeth forth his armed men against David’s men by Gibeon, 12. Where after a terrible and bloody fight of four and twenty young champions, he is put to flight by Joab, 17. Asahel pursueth him, and is thrust thorough by him, 19. Abner and Joab at length part again from another, 26. Asahel is buried, 32.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD, [See 1 Sam.23.6, 9. and 30.7, 8. and Judge.1.on v.1.] saying; shall I go up into one of the Cities of Juda? And the LORD said unto him; Go up: and David said; Whither shall I go up? and he [i.e. the LORD] said; unto Hebron. [Lying in Juda, not far from the Western mount, and allotted to the children of Aarob. See Genes.13.18. Jos.21.10, 11, 12. From whence may be gathered, that David indeed for his own person in particular dwelt and kept Court there, but that his people or souldiers abode in the next adjacent Cities and places, (as below v.3.) that the Priests and Levites, to whom this City was given by the tribe of Juda, might not be straitened in their possession.]
\p
\v 2 . So David went up thither, as also his two wives, Ahinoam the Jizreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal [Understand, that had been Nabals wife. so 1 Sa.30.5. See 1 sam.25.39, etc. and compare below, chap.12.15.] the Carmelite.
\p
\v 3 . David also made his men that were with him, [Understand the warlike men, that had followed him in his banishment. See 1 Sam.22.2.] go up every man with his household: and they dwelt in the Cities of Hesbron. [i.e. which lay about Hebron, and belonged there unto]
\p
\v 4 . After that came the men of Juda; and there anointed David king over the house of Juda: [David was first by Gods appointment secretly anointed King by Samuel, 1 Sam.16.13. Here he is again anointed by his own tribe, the tribe of Juda, who undoubtedly knew the will of God. The third time he is anointed by all Israel, below chap.5.3. This all tending to the strengthening and encouraging of David, and establishing of his calling, as also typifying and shadowing out of the anointing of our LORD Jesus Christ. See 1 Kings 1.on vers.34.] Then they told David. [Who had asked or inquired, what was become of Sauls dead body, desiring to bury it, if it had not been done] saying; They are the men of Jabes in Gilead, that have buried Saul. [See 1 Sam.31, 11.12, 13.]
\p
\v 5 . Then David sent messengers to the men of Jades in Gilead: and he said i.e. sent word] unto them; Blessed be ye unto the LORD, [See Genes.24.on v.31. Ruth.2.20. and 3.10.] that ye [Or, who] have shewed this kindnesse unto your lord, unto Saul, and have buried him.
\p
\v 6 . So now the LORD shew kindnesse and faithfulnesse unto you: and I also, I will do this good (deed) to you, [i.e. requite, or, in this sense: as the LORD will requite it unto you, so will I also do it. Oth. according to this good (deed) or, goodnesse] because done this thing. [Or, who have, &c.]
\p
\v 7 . And now, let your hands be strong, and be valiant [Heb. children, or, sons of valour, or, courage. See below chap.3. on vers.34.] seeing your lord Saul is dead. [As if he should say, Let not your courage abate, although your lord and King be dead] and also they of the house of Juda have anointed me King over them. [Heb. The house of Juda have, &c. So that basides the willingnesse and readinesse, I have also the power and ability to help and succour you in all occasional straits. Although David was assured of Gods purpose and counsel, yet nevertheless he useth these lawful and commendable means, by welldoing to gain the hearts of the Israelites, and to wait with considence and patience for the issue or event.]
\p
\v 8 . Now Abner [Called also Abiner. See 1 Sam.14.50, 51.] the son of Ner, the Captain General, that Saul had, took Isboseth, [Heb. Isch-boscheth] Sauls son, and tarried him over to Mahanaim. [i.e. over the river Jordan, where Mahaniam lay, by the brook Jabbok, not far from Jabes in Gilead: See Genes.32.2. Abner seemeth to have done this, to get the Gileadites, to whom David had sent his messengers, to side against David, and to break the friendship and favour that he there might have obtained.]
\p
\v 9 . And made him King [Although he was not ignorant of the Lords will, as appeareth chap.3.9, 10, 18.] over Gilead, [See of Gilead, Numb.32.] and over the Ascharites, [Hereby is meant by most Interpreters the tribe of Ascher, being the uttermost in the North of Canaan, by the Sea. Heb: the Ascharite] and over Israel; [The City lay between half Manasseh and Issaschar, on the borders: the valley of Jisreel lay in Issaschar, almost in the midst of Canaan, under which the next adjacent Zebulon, Naphtali, and half Manasseh are likewise understood: as besides Ephraim, Dan and Simeon lay partly in Juda] and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel. [Excepting Juda, as followeth.]
\p
\v 10 . Ishoseth Sauls son was fourty years old, when he was King [Heb. reigned: i.e. was King, or began to reign; and so often in these Histories of the Kings] over Israel; and he reigned the second year: [See 1 Sam.13.on v.1. Or, had reigned: for the sense seemeth to be, that he had reigned two full years, when the battle mentioned, vers.12,etc. happened. see further below chap.3.on v.1. although it followeth not hence, that they let David’s he quite at peace in these two fore-going years] only those of the house of Juda, followed after David. [Heb. were after David.]
\p
\v 11 . Now the number of days, that David was King at Hesbron, over the house of Juda, is seven years and six months.
\p
\v 12 . Then Abner the son of Ner went forth, [To war against David and Juda] with the servants of Ishoseth the son of Saul, from Mahanaim to Gibeon. [Lying in Benjamin, Jos.chap.9. and 10. This City lay not far from the Frontiers of Juda, and was given to the children of Aaron, Jos.21 17.]
\p
\v 13 . Joab [This was David’s Captain General, as Abner was Isboseths. Zerujah was David’s sister. See 1 Chro.2.16.] and the servants of David went forth also, and they met one another by the pool of Gibeon: [Which was without Gibeon, on the South-side of it] and they abode, these on this side of the pool, and those on the other side of the pool.
\p
\v 14 . And Abner said unto Joab, Let now the young men [Certain lusty young soudiers] get up, and play [i.e. skirmish trying one another at their weapons. It seemeth that Abner, after the manner of rough souldiers, lightly esteemed the death of certain young champions: for which he felt his punishment in the end of this combate. See vers.17.26, 27.] before our face, [In our presence, before our eyes, for a sight or shew; that we may only sit still look on, and leave them alone to themselves] And Joab said, Let them get up.
\p
\v 15 . Then there got up and went over [Or, a longest, viz. the pool, whereso vers.13.] by number, [i.e. by equal number on both sides] twelve of Benjamin, to wit, for Isboseth Sauls son, and twelve of David’s servants.
\p
\v 16 . And the one caught the other [Heb. the man his neighbour, or, his fellow companion: so in the following words] and (thrust) his sword in the others side: and they whence that place was called Chelkath, Hazurim, [i.e. part, piece of land, or, field of rocks; i.e. of Champions, who were unmoveble like rocks, and every one kept his standing: or, of points, edges, because they fell one another down by the point or edge of the sword] which is by Gibeon.
\p
\v 17 . And there was a very sore battle that day: But Abner and the men of Israel were smitten before the face of David’s servants.
\p
\v 18 . Now there were three sons of Zerujah, Joab, and Abisai, and Asahel: and Asahel was light of his feet, [i.e. very swift in running. Compare above chap.1.23.] as one of roes, that are in the field.
\p
\v 19 . And Asahel pursued after Abner: and he turned not aside to the right hand, or to the left, from going after Abner.
\p
\v 20 . Then Abner looketh behind him, and said; Art thou this, Asahel? And he said; I am he.
\p
\v 21 . And Abner said unto him; Turn (thee) aside to thy right hand, or to thy left hand, and lay thee hold on one of those, and take for thee their habit: [i.e. their apparel, or weapons, or both. Compare Judg.14.19.] but Asahel would not turn aside from after him.
\p
\v 22 . Then Abner proceeded further, saying to Asahel; Turn aside from after me. Wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? How then should I hold up my face before Joab thy brother? [As if he had said, Why wilt thou hazard thy self? Thou will so urge me, that I shall not be able to spare, which otherwise I would willingly do for thy brothers sake, who is a valiant and brave Commander]
\p
\v 23 . But he refused to turn aside; so Abner smote him with the hindermost (part) of the spear, [Or, he thrust him with sharp, which was at the under most, or hindermost part of the spear] on the fifth rib, [Or, by near, under. This by many is meant of that place of the right side, where the liver lieth, or neer the brest-bone, and where is the use or root of the liver-vein: where (as learned and experienced Physicians do affirm, and the same was likewise not unknown to the ancient hearthens) the would that is there given, bringeth speedier death to a man, then any other would whatsoever. Some understand it of the left side, where the heart lieth, or the hypochondrias under the short ribs which are five in number, which seemeth to be confirmed by the effusion or pouring out of the bowels, happened by the same wound, whereof below chap.20.10. Compare below chap.3.27. and 4.6. and 20.10.] that the spear come out behind him; and he fell (down) there, and died on his place? [i.e. he lay dead on the place, where he had stood, or where he was thrust thorough.] And it came to passé, that all that came to the place, where Asahel fell (down) and died, stood still.
\p
\v 24 . But Joab and Abisai pursued after Abner, and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Amma, which is before Giach, by the way of the wildernesse of Gibeon.
\p
\v 25 . And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abnor, and became one heap: [Or, close joined together troop. Heb. properly bundle] and they stood on the top of an hill. [They put themselves in battelaray upon the top of an hill, the better to defend themselves.]
\p
\v 26 . Then Abner called to Joab, and said; shall then the sword devour for ever? [i.e. without ceasing] knowest thou not that it will be bitternesse in the latter end? [i.e. that it will yield at last a bitter and sorrowfull event] and how long wilt thou not say unto the people, that they return from pursuing their brethren? [Heb. from after their brethren.]
\p
\v 27 . And Joab said; (as true as) God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then from the morning the people had been conveyed away, every one from pursuing his brother. [Heb. from after his brother. As if he should say, if thou hadst not at first set them on to sighting, and so occasioned the battle; See above vers.14. I would have caused the people to retire betimes to day.]
\p
\v 28 . Then Joab blew with the trumpet, and all people stood still, and pursued no more after Israel, and proceeded no further to fight.
\p
\v 29 . Abner then and his men went all that night over the plain field: and they passed over Jordan, and walked thorough all Bihron, [Or, all the Land-partition, the separated, or, divided part of the Land, which lay over or beyond Jordan, and thereby was severed or divided from Canaan. Thus Cant.2.17. they are called Hills of Bather; i.e. of Separation, because they lay in Gilead, and were separated or divided from Canaan by the river Jordan] and came to Mahanaim. [From whence they went forth, or, set out, vers.12.]
\p
\v 30 . Joab also returned from after Abner, and gathered all the people together: and there were lacking of David’s servants, nineteen men, and Asahel.
\p
\v 31 . But the servants of David’s had smitten of Benjamin, and among Abners men: (so that) there died three hundred and threescore men.
\p
\v 32 . And they took up Asahel, and buried him in his fathers sepulchre, which was at Bethlehem: now Joab and his men went all night, (so) that the light arose to them at Hebron.
\c 3
\s The war between the house of Saul, and the house of David, ver.1,etc. A list of David’s sons, that were born to him at Hebron, 2. Abner being had in great respect in Sauls house, is incensed against Isboseth for some affront offered him, and treateth with David for an agreement, 6. He bringeth Michal Sauls Daughter, again to david, according to his desire,13. And having communed with the Eldest of Israel, visiteth David at Hebron, becometh friends with him, and departeth in peace, 17. Joab coming from abroad, and hearing of this, blameth David for it, overtaketh Abner without David’s privity, and murdereth him treacherously, 22. For which David is greatly incensed and declareth publickly his innocency, burieth Abner in a stately manner, proclaimeth his valour, lamenteth over him, and excuseth himself for not punishing at present the authors of this murther, 28.
\p
\v 1 And there was a long war between the house of Saul and between the house of David: [This war seemeth to have lasted five years. For at the time of the first battle (whereof chap.2.12.etc.) David and Isboseth, both of them, had reigned two years, as appeareth from chap.2.10. compare with v.4.and 9. of the same chapter: from whence may be gathered, that they both began to reign at one and the same time. Now David reigned at Hebron seven years and six moneths, chap.2.11. until such time that Isboseth being slain, (below chap.4.6, 7.) he was anointed King over all Israel, chap 5.3. So that this war seemeth to have lasted the five remaining years and certain months] but David’s went and grew stronger, [Heb. was going, and growing strong: i.e. grew stronger] but those of the house of Saul went and grew weaker. [Heb. the house of Saul were going and growing weak, or, thin, exhausted: i.e. those of the house of Saul grew smaller and smaller, or lesse powerful. See Gen.26.on v.13. Jon.1.on v.11.]
\p
\v 2 . And unto David were sons born at Hebron: Now his first-born was Amnon, of Achinoam, the Jizreelitesse.
\p
\v 3 . And his second was Chileab, [Otherwise called Daniel, 1 Chron.3.1.] of Abigail, the wife of Nabal, [see above chap.2.on vers.2.] the Carmelite: and the third Absalom, [Heb. Abslom] the son of Maacha [Being converted to the true Religion] the Daughter of Thalmai, King of Gesur: [Heb. Geschur, as below, chap.13.37, 38. & 14.13. & 15.8. A city lying in the North, on the frontiers or borders of Gilead, in the sore-part of the division of Syria, called Trachonites. See Deut.3.14. Jos.12.5. below chap.15.8. There were also Gestures on the South-side of Canaan, toward Egypt, 1 Sam.27.8. from whom David, being at Ziklag, fetched great store of prey.]
\p
\v 4 . And the fourth Adonia, the son of Haggith: and the fifth Sephatia, [Heb. Schepatia] the son of Abital:
\p
\v 5 . And the sixth, Jithream, by Egla, David’s wife: [There be divers opions concerning the question, why this woman only is called in this place David’s wife, whereas all the rest before mentioned were his wives like-wife? Some conceive that she was the most excellent and chiefest of all David’s wives; others, that she was the meanest, and of lowest condition among them all, and known by nothing peculiar and special, but that David had taken her to wife. But the truest and most probable opion seemeth to be this, that it’s possible there might have been another woman of the same name, and that this was distinguished from that other by this appellation, or addition] these were born to David at Hebron.
\p
\v 6 . While that war was between the house of Saul, and between the house of David, it came to passé, that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul. [Getting by his great courage, and valiant acts, special power, authority, and respect, even with King Isboseth himself, as appeareth in the following verses. Oth behaved himself valiantly for Sauls house.]
\p
\v 7 . Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpa, the daughter of Aija: [Of this woman, see below, chap.12.8,10,11, etc.] and (I boseth) said unto Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone unto my fathers concubine? [i.e. hast layen with her. It seemeth that Isboseth had a shrewd suspicion of Abner, as if he asired after the Crown.]
\p
\v 8 . Then Abner was much incensed [Heb. kindled to Abner greatly; viz.anger, wrath. See Genes.4.on vers.5.] for Isboseth’s words, and said; Am I a Dogs heads, [i.ee. base and contemptible, of no worth, value, esteem. Compare 1 Sa.24.15. and Deu.23.18. below c.9.8. and 16.9.] I who against Juda do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, [Oth. that I should be of, with, or, for Juda? Should I this day, etc. i.e. as if I held with Juda, or had revolted to Juda, or, belonged to Juda? whereas on the contrary I have done thus and thus, and yet still do, etc.] and have not delivered thee into the hand of David [Heb. have made to be found; i.e. have made to fall, or, delivered into David’s hand] that thou searchest on me the iniquity of a woman? [i.e. committed with a woman, or with this woman. Or, thou layest to my charge, visitest me to day (for, or, because of) etc. or, visitest upon me: i.e. thou wilt examine me, and bring me to a trial, and punish me, for a fault which I should have committed toward this woman? Whereas thou should have connived and wink at it: or reprovest me, as if it were true: Is this my reward for all my true and faithful services? So intolerable was this reproof unto him.]
\p
\v 9 . Let God do so to Abner, and let him so add thereunto, [Of this manner of swearing, see Ruth 1.on v.17. and 1 Kings 19.on v.2.] surely, according as the LORD hath sworn to David, [Notwithstanding that he knew this full well, yet nevertheless he had assisted the house of Saul, and resisted or opposed David. See also v.18.] even so will I do to him;
\p
\v 10 . Transforming the Kingdom from the house of Saul, and setting up [Or, establishing] the throne of David over Israel and over Juda, from Dan to Berseba. [These were the uttermost borders of Canaan. Dan in the North, and Berseba in the South. See 1 Kings 4.on v.25.]
\p
\v 11 . And he [viz. Isboseth] could not answer Abner a word more, because he feared him. [Fearing, if he should be roughly dealt withal, he would do that in good earnest, which he only seemed to threaten in his passion: and that in regard of his power, and the authority which he had, above verse.6.]
\p
\v 12 . Then Abner sent messengers to David in behalf of himself, [Or. In his stead; i.e. in stead of coming himself, or, in his own name, but not the name of King Isboseth, or the Kingdom. Oth. instead of that: i.e. therefore, in that respect, regard] saying; whose is the land? [As if he should say, the Kingdom of Israels Land, belongeth indeed to no man, but to thee, to whom it was promised by God] saying (further;) Make thee a league with me, and behold, my hand shall be with thee, to turn about all Israel unto thee.
\p
\v 13 . And he [viz. David] said, well, [Or, ‘tis well, ‘tis good: i.e. thy project pleaseth me well; I accept of it] I will make a covenant with thee: but one thing I reuire of thee, saying; [i.e. to wit this, etc.] Thou shall not see my face, [Compare Genes.43.3.] unless thou first bring in Michal, Sauls daughter, [David’s first wife, of ehom the Scripture witnesseth, that she loved him, and had been faithful to him, 1 Sam.18.20, 28. and 19.11, 12.] When thou comest to see my face.
\p
\v 14 . David also sent messengers unto Isboseth, the son of Saul, [Thus to give occasion to Abner, to fulfil his promise without the least suspicion of Isboseth] saying: Give (me) my wife Michal, whom I have espoused unto me, with a hundred foreskins of the Philistines. [According to Sauls bargain, who by that means thought to have destroyed David by the hands of the Philistines. See 1 Sam.18.25, 27.]
\p
\v 15 . Then Isboseth sent forth, [Without doubt, being over-ruled and perswaded by Abner, whom through fear he durst deny nothing] etc took her [i.e. caused her to be taken by the messengers sent by him] from (her) husband, from Paltiel, [called also Palti, to whom Saul gave this Michal to wife, after David was sted, 1 Sa. 25.44.] the son of Lais.
\p
\v 16 . And her husband went with her, going and crying after her unto Bahurim: [Lying in Benjamin, below cha.19.16. hard by the borders of Juda, as the Maps do shew.] Then said Abner unto him; return; depart, return; and he returned.
\p
\v 17 . Now Abner had words with the eldest of Israel [Heb. Abners word, (or, dealing, advice) was, or, had been with,&c. Compare 1 Kings 17. and Numb.31.16.] saying: Ye desire David long ago [Heb. also yesterday, also ere yesterday] to (be) King over you.
\p
\v 18 . Therefore do it now: for the LORD hath spoken unto David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will deliver my people of Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and from the hand of all their enemies.
\p
\v 19 . And Abner also spake before the ears of Benjamin, [As he had done with the Eldest of Israel] moreover, Abner went also his way, to speak before the ears of David at Hebron, all that was good in the eyes of Israel, and in the eyes of the whole house of Benjamin. [Meaning the greatest part: for as yet many were addicted to the house of Saul, because Saul came of the tribe of Benjamin. See 1 Sam.16.and10.20, 21. 1 Chron.12.29. Compare this phrase with Matth.3.5.and Phil.2.21,&c. To speak before the ears of David,&c. i.e. to report unto David all that Israel, and especially Benjamin had found good and declared]
\p
\v 20 . And Abner came to David to Hesbron, and twenty men with him; and David made Abner, and the man that were with him, a feast.
\p
\v 21 . Then said Abner unto David; I will get me up, and go my ways, and gather all Israel together unto my Lord the King, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy soul desireth: [Or, according to all, or, altogether as, &c. i.e. according to thy hearts wish, and desire] So David let Abner go, and he went in peace.
\p
\v 22 . And behold David’s servant, and Joab came from a band, [Or, a troop, a company of roving Souldiers, whom they had overtaken and plundered] and brought with them great prey: now Abner, he was not with David at Hebron; for hre had let him go, and he was gone in peace.
\p
\v 23 . Now when Joab, etc all the host that was with him, were come, then they told Joab, saying; Abner, the son of Ner, is come to the King, and he hath let him go, and he is gone in peace.
\p
\v 24 . Then Joab went in to the King, etc said; what hast thou done? Behold, Abner is come unto thee; now, why hast thou let him go, that he is gone so free away? [Heb. going is gone]
\p
\v 25 . Thou knowest Abner, the son of Ner that he is come to thee; [i.e. To seduce thee with sweet flattering words. See Judg.14.on v.15.] and to know thy going out, and thy coming in, [i.e. thy dealing & conversation thy managing of affairs both at home & abroad, within doors and without doors. See Deut.28.on vers.6.] yea to know all that thou doest.
\p
\v 26 . And Joab went forth from David, and sent messengers after Abner, [As if the King had yet something further to say to him: although it was without the Kings privity, as followeth] which brought him again from that well of Sira: [Or, fountain, or, well, pit, or pool of Sira: laying Northward off from Hebron, close by the way that goeth from Hebron to Jerusalem and Benjamin, as the Maps do shew] but David knew it not.
\p
\v 27 . Now when Abner returned to Hebron, then Joab led him aside in the midst of the gate, to speak with him quietly: [Or, peceaceably, as if he had something to tell him in a confident manner, secretly and in private] and he smote him there on the fifth rib, [As above chap.2.23.] that he died for his brother Asahels blood. [i.e. slaughter, which he had committed on his brother Asahel: above chap.2.23.and below v.30. See Gen.4.9, 10.]
\p
\v 28 . Afterward when David heard that, he said; I am guiltless, and my Kingdom, with the LORD, [Heb. From, with the LORD: as if he had said, I am free from punishment before the Lord, who will not impute this murder to me, nor to my Kingdom] for ever from the blood [Heb. bloods: as Gen.4.9,10,&c.] of Abner the son of Ner.
\p
\v 29 . Let it [viz. Blood: see Judg.9.on ver.24.] rest on the head of Joab, and on all his fathers house: and let there not be out off from the houser of Joab, that hath an issue, [see Lev.15.2,&c.] and is leprous, and that leaneth on the staff, [i.e. that is crasie, weak, seeble, or lame] and falleth by the sword, and lacketh bread, [i.e. let there be ever in Joabs house some person that is subject and liable to these plagues, or some of them.]
\p
\v 30 . Thus Joab and Abisai his brother slew Abner, [Hence it appeareth, that Abisai was privy to this murther, although he be not named in the foregoing verses] because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle. [and consequently in a murderous way, as Joab had done Abner: see above chapter 2. 20, 21, 22, 23.]
\p
\v 31 . Then David said unto Joab, and to all the people that was with him, Rent your garments, [See Gen.37.on v.24.] and gird you with sacks, [see Gen.37.on vers.34.] and mourn before Abner: [i.e. before the corps, as is declared in the following words. Compare Luke 7.14.] and King David went after the Bier. [or, Corps, Heb. Bed; i.e. wherein Abner lay and was carried.]
\p
\v 32 . Now when they buried Abner at Hebron, then the King lift up his voice, and wept at Abners grave; also all the people wept.
\p
\v 33 . And the King made a lamentation over Abner, and said; Did then Abner die, as a fool dieth? [As if he had said, Is it not a sad thing that such a valiant champion hath been said to lose his life in such a piteous way, as if he had been one of the vilest persons that are living, or some one person, that shall foolishly suffer himself to be murthered without any opposition at all. But (as if David should say) that shall in no wise pbscure his military praise.]
\p
\v 34 . Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into copper fetters. [Intimating, that Joab should have found, that he had to deal with a souldier, that could use both hands and feet, if he had fought with him hand to hand] (but) thou art fallen, as they fall before the face of children of perverseness: [or, sons of perverseness, iniquity, craftiness: as below chap.7.10. i.e. most perverse men; whereby David openly hits Joab and his brother thorough, and upbraids them with that base and shameful murder. Touching the phrase (children) or, sons of perverseness the same is often elsewhere used in Scripture. Also children of Belial; i.e. of vice, or looseness, stiffneckedness, Deut 13.13. children of transgression, Isa.57.4. children of disobedience, Ephes.2.2. children of darkness, 1 Thes.5.5. as on the contrary, children of courage, or, valour, above chap.2.7. children of light, Ephes.5.8. and the like. Compare below chap.12.on ver.5.] then all the people wept yet more [or, again. Heb. all the people went on, or, added to weep] over him.
\p
\v 35 . After that all the people came to cause David to eat bread, [i.e. To exhort, or perswade him, to take some victuals to refresh and strengthen himself with meat] while it was yet day: but David sware, saying, Let God do so to me, and let him do add thereunto; [as above verse 9.] if I taste bread, or ought else before Sun-setting! [For so was the manner of aright Fast, that they abtained from all manner of food whatsoever until evening: so above chap.1.12, &c.]
\p
\v 36 . When all the people perceived this, it was good in their eyes: [i.e. It pleased the people well] all, so as the King had done, was good in the eyes of all the people.
\p
\v 37 . And all that people, and all Israel, observed that day that it was not of the King, [i.e. That it was in no wise the Kings counsel and will] that they had slain Abner, the son of Ner.
\p
\v 38 . Moreover, the King said unto his servents: Know ye not, that a Prince, yea a great (man) is fallen this day in Israel? [And that consequently, the murderer of such a person, for the example and terror of others, ought to be secretly punished?]
\p
\v 39 . But I am this day tender, [i.e. I am yet mean in power: a comparison taken from a young child] and anointed King; [i.e. I am yet weak and young in my Kingdom; I am indeed anointed by Samuel King over all Israel, but yet have indeed and in truth no tribe under me, but Juda onely,] and these men, the sons of Zeruja, are harder then I, [i.e. Mightier, stronger, or firmer, that I should dare, or be able to punish them, according to desert, in regard of the great sway and respect they bear among the souldiery. Thus David (who had so many experiences of Gods gracious help and assistance) seemeth to have yielded too much to human policy, and carnal respects, putting off the punishment till further opportunity, which notwithstanding in his lifetime he found, or (at least) leaving at last the vengeance to his son Salomon, 2 King.2.5.] the LORD shall reward the evil-doer according to his wickedness. [as if he should say, Because I for the present do want power, therefore the Almighty God shall punish him, or grant me yet the power to do it, or to cause it to be done. See the beginning hereof, below chap.19.14. the progress, 1 King.2.5, 6. and that full and perfect execution or accomplishment, 1 King.2.34.]
\c 4
\s Isboseth and his party are astonished at Abners death, v.1. Two Captains murder Isboseth, and bring his head unto David, 2. Who caused them to be put to death, and hanged up; but Isboseths head to be buried, 9.
\p
\v 1 Now when Sauls son [viz. Isboseth] beard, that Abner was dead at Hebron, his hands grew feeble, [i.e. He fainted and left all courage to war against David. Compare below chap.17.2. Ezra.4.5. Isa.13.7. and 35.3. Jer.38.4. & 47.3. & 50.43. Zephan.3.16.] and all Israel was terrified. [or, troubled; because Abner having treated with them, to bring the Kingdom unto David, was now dead, so that knew not what would become of the matter. The rest that sided with Sauls house, were astonished at the loss of this great Commander, on whom Sauls house relied.]
\p
\v 2 . And Sauls son had two men, Commanders of Bands: [Of plundering, ranging, and roving souldiers; as above chap.3.22.] the name of the one was Baena, [Heb. Baanas] and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: for Beeroth, [see Jos.18.25.] also was reckoned to Benjamin: [although the Benjamites after Sauls defeat (as is related in the sequel) were fled thence, and possibly the Philistines had taken this place, as they had done others, see 1 Sam.31.7.]
\p
\v 3 . And the Beerothites were fled to Gitthaim, [Neh. 11.33. There is a city of this name mentioned to be in Benjamin. Some conceive that there was yet another place of the same name by the South-borders of Juda, whither they were fled for safety, and found themselves so well there, that thought not at all of returning, until the affairs of Sauls house were thus transacted, and this here mentioned was written at such time when it was but newly done] and were strangers there unto this day.
\p
\v 4 . And Jonathan, Sauls son, [Who died in the battle with his father Saul] had a son that was smitten [i.e. lame; as followeth: so below chap.9.3.] on both feet: be was five years old, [Heb. he was a son of five years] when the rumour came of Saul and Jonathan [i.e. the tidings came of the defeat of Saul and Jonathan] out of Jizreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled; and it came to pass, when she made hast to flee, that he fell, and became cripple, and his name was Mephiboseth [Heb. Mephiboscheth: otherwise called Merik-baal, 1 Chron.8.34.]
\p
\v 5 . And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baena, went their ways, and came to the house of Isboseth [Perceiving that Isboseths affairs, after Abners death, were grown low, and of small appearance, and that David undoubtedly should come to the Crown, because Mephiboseth being lame (as in the former verse is related) was unsit to succeed, and so no cause to fear his vengeance, therefore they attempted this murder, to curry favour with David] when the day was grown hot: [or, about the heat of the day] and he lay on the Couch at noon. [To rest himself, or to take an afternoons sleep. Compare below chap.11.2.]
\p
\v 6 . And they came in thither, into the midst of the house (as) intending to fetch wheat; [Feigning and demeaning themselves, as if they had been Corn-merchants, or Corn-porters] and they smote him on the fifth rib: [as above on chap.2.23.& 3.27] and Rechab and Baena his brother escaped.
\p
\v 7 . For they came into the house when he lay on his bed, in his bed-chamber, and smote him, and slew him, and cut off his head: [Heb. Put away, or, off his head] and they took his head, and went their way on the plain field [of Mehanaim (where Isboseth kept Court, above chap.2.8, 29.) having passed Jordan, they went speedily over the plain fields of Jericho to Hebron] all night.
\p
\v 8 . And they brought the head of Isboseth unto David to Hebron, and said unto the King; Behold, there is the head of Isboseth, the son of Saul, thine enemy, who sought thy soul: i.e. Who sought thy life, who attempted to take away thy life. See Exod.on ver.19. 1 Sam.20.4. and 23.15. 2 Sam.10.11. Psal.63.10,&c. Elsewhere this phrase signifieth also, to seek to preserve a mans life, Prov.29 10.] thus the LORD hath given vengeances to my Lord the King this day, of Saul, and of his seed.
\p
\v 9 . But David answered Rechab and Baena his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them: (As true as) the LORD liveth, who hath delivered my soul out of all distress:
\p
\v 10 . Seeing I took hold of him, that told, saying; Behold, Saul is dead; [Adding withal, that he himself had holpen to slay Saul at his request, above chap.1.10.] whereas he was in his (own) eyes, [i.e. he thought so, he perswaded himself so, he had such a good opinion of himself] as one that brought good tidings; yet notwithstanding I took hold of him, and slew him [i.e. I caused him to be apprehended and put to death. See above chapter 1.15.] at Ziklag: although he (thought) that I would have given him a messengers reward. [Oth. which was the messengers reward, which I ought to give him.]
\p
\v 11 . How much more [viz. Ought I to do it] when wicked men have slain a righteous man [That had no way deserved it at their hands] in his (own) house upon his bed? Now then should I not require his blood of your hands, and take you away from the earth? [By punishing you, because ye have shed his blood, and are not able to restore it, as likewise unto the man his life. See Gen.9.on ver.1. Psal.9.12, 13. Ezek.3.18, 20. & 33.8.]
\p
\v 12 . And David commanded his youths, [i.e. Servants Ministers, Courtiers, Officers, Pages] and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up by the pool at Hebron: but they took the head of Isboseth, and buried it in Abners Sepulchre at Hebron.
\c 5
\s David is anointed King over all Israel, vers.1,&c. The years of his reign at Hebron and Jerusalem, 4. He subdueth the strong hold of Zion, and dwelleth there, 6. Horam maketh a league with him, and sendeth him wood and work-men to build an house, 11. David taketh more wives, and getteth more children, 13. The Philistines march up against him, and are twice smitten by him, 17.]
\p
\v 1 Then all the tribes [Understand Ambassadours sent from all the tribes: see ver.3.] of Israel came to David to Hebron: and they spake, saying; Behold, we are thy bone, and thy flesh. [i.e. we are of one blood, both descended from the Patriarch Jacob, and consequently brethren: such a person God had commanded them to choose for their King, Deut.17.15. concerning the phrase, see Gen.29.on v.14.]
\p
\v 2 . Besides, heretofore, [Heb. Yesterday, also ere yesterday,] when Saul was King over us, thou wast leading out, and bringing in Israel: [i.e. He that led the souldiers, and brought them off from the enemy, went every where before them, and had the chief command and managing of War, and in that respect, as an experienced Commander, is most for the Kingdom. See 1 Sam.18.5, 16. and compare Numb.27.on v.17.] Also the LORD said unto thee; [viz. At the time of thine anointing by Samuel, described 1 Sam.16. vers.11, 12, 13. Although these words be not there mentioned] thou shalt feet my people Israel, [i.e. govern them with such care, affection, and faithfulness, as a good shepheard (as thou art) leadeth, feedeth, governeth, taketh care of, and protecteth his sheep: see Psal.78.70, 71. and below chap.7.7.] and thou shalt be a Goer before [or, thou shalt be Leader, Duke, see above chap.6.21.] over Israel.
\p
\v 3 . So all the Eldest of Israel [See Exod.3.16. and compare Lev.4.15.& 9.1.] came to the King to Hebron; and King David made league with them [whereby they were bound on both sides by oath to perform their duties to each other] at Hebron before the face of the LORD: [i.e. in the presence of the Priest clothed with the Ephod, or in a stately Assembly, and solemn meeting, with calling upon the Name of the Lord. Compare Juda.11.on ver.11.] and they anointed David King over Israel. [This was David’s third anointed. See above chap.2.on v.4.]
\p
\v 4 . David was thirty years old, [Heb. A son of thirty year] when he was King: he reigned fourty year. [And six months, as appeareth from the following verse. Of such an use of a round and complete number, see Judg.11.on v.26. Others understand six months less then fourty years. But the verse following, and 1 King.2.11. (where the same years of David’s reign at Hebron are only mentioned without the six months) seem to import, that the six months of his reign at Hebron, are over and above the fourty years.]
\p
\v 5 . At Hebron he reigned over Juda seven years, and six months; and at Jerusalem he reigned three and thirty years over all Israel and Juda.
\p
\v 6 . And the King went [Without doubt by the advise and counsel of God, and with the consent and approbation of the Ambassadors and Eldest of Israel, that had been with him, vers.3.] with his men. [i.e. souldiers; as often in the former chapter is declared] to Jerusalem, [formerly called Jebus, Judg.19 10. and Salem, Gen.14.18. Psal.76.2, 3. being the place chosen by God, to set his Name there, and to erect the throne of the Kingdom over all Israel, belonging to Juda (David’s tribe) and Benjamin] against the Jebusites, [who hitherto had possession of Jerusalem, or at least of the greatest and strongest part thereof, to wit, of the strong hold, or castle. See Judg.1.on ver.8.and 19.on vers.12.] who dwelt in that land: and they spake unto David, saying; Thou shalt not come in hither, but the blind and cripple shall drive thee away, [to whose custody and protection (according to the opinion of some) they had committed the strong hold, to the spite and scorn or disgrace of David & had given the strong hold to keep, intimating thereby, that the place of it self was so firm and strong, that even cripple and blind persons were able to keep and defend it against David. Oth. Except thou take away, or, put away those blind and cripple ones: whereby some understand the idolatrous images of the Jabusites, whom they as Protectors entrusted with the keeping and guarding of the strong hold, calling them blind and cripple, according to the opinion of David and Israelites; but imagined, that they would find them otherwise then so Others understand by the blind and cripple the souldiers of David, whom they so upbraidingly reviled; as if they had said, They must be other kind of souldiers that must do it then thy men are] that is to say, David shall not come in hither.
\p
\v 7 . But David took the strong hold of Zion, the same is the city of David. [See verse 9.& 1 King.2.on verse 10.]
\p
\v 8 . For David said on that day; Whosoever smitteth the Jebusites, [Meaning, he that shall be the first and foremost in smiting the Jebusites: see 1 Chron.11.6.] and getteth up to that gutter, [or, channel, pipe, water-course, sluce; that is, within the strong hold, wherein this gutter, together with the blind add lame lay, or where the Idols were set up.] and (to) those cripple, and those blind (ones), that are hated of David’s soul, [Because of the scorn and contempt offered by the Jebusites, above verse 6. Or, it may be meant of the Idols of the Jebusites, whom David’s soul hated and abhorred. Oth. for the cripple and blind are hated of David’s soul. i.e. David loveth no lame and Blind people, but valiant and stout souldiers] (he shall be an head, and a Commander:) [These words are here inserted out of Chron.11 6. To fill up David’s speech or saying. Some conceive that it may be here so taken, as that the promise of reward may be concealed, as is most usual in swearing and otherwise] herefore its said: [i.e. in remembrance of this remarkable passage doth this Proverb remain] a blind and cripple (person) shall not come into the house. [Or, there is a blind and lame (one), i.e. there are blind and lame (ones) he shall not enter therein; That slout and jeer a careless person, or those who being proud and bragging of idle and vain help, find themselves deceived as the Jebusites did, in their boasting of the blind and cripple against David. Some are of opinion that it was concluded at that time for remembrance hereof, to suffer no blind and lame persons to come any more into the strong hold of Zion. Some conceive this to be the meaning, that they must be stout and valiant souldiers, that shall take or subdue a strong place.]
\p
\v 9 . Thus David dwelt in the fort, and called that city, The City of David: And David built round about from Millo, [Of Millo, see 1 King.9.on verse 15.& Judg.9.on verse 6.] and inward. [And Joab built the rest, 1 Chron.11.8.]
\p
\v 10 . Now David went on constantly, and became great: [Heb. Went going and growing great; i.e. grew from time to time the longer the stronger] For the LORD, the God of Host, [see 1 King.18.on verse 15.] was with him. [See Gen.21.on verse 22. And 26 on verse 24. Num.14.on vers.9.]
\p
\v 11 . And Hiram [Heb. Chiram] the King of Tyrus Heb.Tsor: a very famous, mighty, royal, merchantable city, lying at and in the Sea by the Western borders of the tribe of Aser. See also Jos.19.on ver.19.] sent messengers to David, and cedar-wood, and carpenters, [Heb. masters, or, artificers of wood] and masons; [Heb. artificers, or, masters of stone of the wall, or, wall-stone] and they built David an house.
\p
\v 12 . And David perceived, that the LORD had established him King over Israel: [i.e. He was by experience of Gods gracious blessing and assistance both in spiritual and corporal things, more and more strengthened, and assured to his calling to the Kingdom over Israel] and that he had exalted his Kingdom, for his people Israels sake. [i.e. for the good of his Church.]
\p
\v 13 . And David took more concubines, [Of Concubines, see Gen.22.on verse 24.] and wives from Jerusalem, after that he was come from Hebron: and (there) were more sons and daughters born to David.
\p
\v 14 . But these are the names of those that were born at Jerusalem; Schammua, [Called also Schima, 1 Chron.3.5.] and Schobab, and Nathan, and Salomo: [Heb. Schelomoh.]
\p
\v 15 . And Ibchar, and Elischua, [Called also Elischuna, 1 Chron.3.6.] and Nepheg, and Japhia:
\p
\v 16 . And Elischama, and Eljada, [Called also Beeliada, 1 Chron.14.7.] and Eliphelet.
\p
\v 17 . Now when the Philistine heard, that they [viz. The Israelites] had anointed David King over Israel: then all the Philistines marched up to seek David: [i.e. To fall upon him betimes, as upon a dreadful and terrible enemy, and with united strength and power to smite him. Compare herewith the repetition of this passage, 1 Chron.14.8,&c.] and David hearing that, marched down, [viz. with his souldiers, forces] to the Fort. [To abide with his Camp by the fort, until he should have determined some certain thing upon a sure ground.]
\p
\v 18 . And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. [Or, of the Giants. See Genes.14.on verse 5. This valley lay in Juda, Jos.15.8. or on the Northern borders of Juda, in Benjamin, Westward from Jerusalem.]
\p
\v 19 . So David enquired of the LORD, [Compare 1 Sam.23.9. & 30.7. & 2 Sam.2. 1, &c.] Saying; shall I march up against the philistines? Wilt thou deliver them up into mine hand? and the LORD said unto David; March up, for I will surely deliver [Heb. giving give, or, delivering deliver] the Philistines into thine hand.
\p
\v 20 . Then David came to Baal-Perasim; [Afterward so called by David, as in the following words is declared] and David smote them there, and said; The LORD hath rent mine enemies before my face, as a rent of water; [or, the LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies, before my face, as a water-breach, or, incursion, breaking thorough of waters. The sense seemeth to be, that God by his power, and David’s service (1 Chron.14.11.) had fallen upon the Philistines, and overthrown them, as waters do with force and violence break thorough, and over-run all things, and cast them down: or as easily as water passeth away, or is divided and scattered, so easily hath God scattered the Philistines one from another] therefore he called the name of that place Baal-Perasim. [i.e. LORD, or, master, Possessour of rents, breaches, breakings thorough: i.e. the plain, or, even (ground) of rents, the place of rents]
\p
\v 21 . And they [viz. The Philistines, who had taken their Idols along with them, imagining by their presence surely to get the victory] left their Idols [the Hebrew word signifieth pains, smarts, griefs, because these are the fruits of Idolatry, see 1 Sam.31.on ver.9.] there: And David and his men took them up, [to burn them with fire, according to David’s order, and Gods command, Deut.7.25. as expressly is mentioned, 1 Chron.14.12. Otherwise, burnt them, Let them ascend in the fire.]
\p
\v 22 . After that the Philistines marched up again: [Heb. Added, or, went on again, or, more times to marched up.] and they spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. [as before; see above v.18.]
\p
\v 23 . And David enquired of the LORD, [See above on ver.19.] who said; Thou shalt not march up: (but) fetch a campass behind them, that thou mayest come upon them over against the Mulberry-trees.
\p
\v 24 . And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going; [i.e. (as some understand it) a noise as it were of marching: whereby may be understood the presence of the holy Angels] in the tops of the Mulberry-trees, then bestir thyself: [get thee up with the souldiery, to fall upon the Philistines] for then is the LORD gone out: [see Judg 4.on ver.14.] before thy face, to smite the host of the Philistines.
\p
\v 25 . And David did so, according as the LORD had commanded him: And he smote the Philitines from Geba, [Otherwise, ever called Gibea, Lying in Benjamin. See Judg.19.on verse 13. and 20.on verse 10. 1 Chron.14.16. Its called Gibeon] until thou come to Gezer. [Lying in Ephraim, in the West toward the sea: see Jos.16.10.]
\c 6
\s David fetcheth the Ark of the Covenant with much people and great joy out of the house of Abinadab, ver.1,&c. viz a presumptuously laying hold of the Ark, is slain of God, 6. At which David being grieved, causeth the Ark to be set in the house of Ooed Edom, 8. Afterward fetcheth it most solemnly from thence, danceth before it, and is despised for it by Michal, 12. He causeth the Ark to be put in its place, offereth unto God, blesseth the people, and giveth them Presents, 17. Is mocked by Michal, and pleadeth with a holy zeal against her in his own defence, 20. Michals barrenness, 23.
\p
\v 1 After that David gathered again together [It seemeth that he had made the like gathering before, when he was to go forth to battle against the Philistines, above chap.5.7,&c. Some conceive that this hath relation to the former gathering; whereof above chap.5.1,3.] all the chosen (men) in Israel, thirty thousand. [Compare this History with 1 Chron.13. where the same is repeated.]
\p
\v 2 . And David gat him up, [viz. When he was come from Jerusalem to Baalim Juda, i.e. Kiriath-Jearim] and went his way with all the people that were with him, from Baalim Juda, [see 1 Chron.13.6. & 1 Sam.7.1. & Jos.15.10, 60.] to bring up from thence the Ark of God, [i.e. which was ordained of God for his peoples comfort] by which the Name is called upon, the Name of the Lord of hosts [compare Levit.24.on ver.11. and Deut.28.on ver.58. Oth. whose (viz.) Gods Name is called, the Name, &c. See further 1 King.18.on ver.15. & 2 King.8.29.] that dwelleth thereupon [viz. upon the Ark] between the Cherubins: [see Gen 3.on ver.24.]
\p
\v 3 . And they carried the Ark of God on a new Cart, [Having forgotten, or not thinking on the command of the LORD, who had commanded the Priests to bear the Ark, Numb.4.14. & 7.9. It seemeth that they herein followed the Philistines example: see 1 Sam.6, 7, 8, &c.] and fetched it [Heb. lifted it, took it up] out of the house of Abinadab, which is upon an hill, [upon an high place which was by or in Kiriath-Jearim. Heb. Gibea, so 1 Sam.7.1.] And Uza, and Ahio, [Heb. Achio,] Abinadabs sons, led the new Cart.
\p
\v 4 . Now when they carried it away out of the house of Abinadab, which is upon the hill, with the Ark of God, then Ahio went along before the Ark; [viz. To lead the Oxen that drew the Cart: see ver.6. Some take the former words thus: Now when they carried it (viz. the Ark) away out of the house of Abinadab, which was upon the hill with the Ark of God. Some understand the word him, of Uza, that they took him to go next to the Ark.]
\p
\v 5 . And David, and all the house of Israel played before the face of LORD, on all manner of (stringed instruments) of fir-wood; as on Harps, and on Lutes, and on Tabreis, also on Spels, [otherwise Trumpets, Cornets] and on Cymbals.
\p
\v 6 . Now when they came to Nachons threshing-floor, [Heb. Goren Nachon, 1 Chron.13. 9. called Chidons threshing-floor] then Uza stretched forth (his hand) these words are mentioned, 1 Chronicles 13.9.] to the Ark of God, and held it (fast), for the Oxen [that drew the Cart with the Ark that was in it] stumbled. [or, trod side-ways, but glided. Oth. shacked (the Ark) that it seemed to be in danger of falling down.]
\p
\v 7 . Then the anger of the LORD kindled against Uza, and God smote him there, for this inconsiderateness: [Or, This fault, errour, imprudence, transgression, presumption: for God had expressly commanded, that no man but the Priests should touch the Vessels, on pain of death, Numb.4. 15.] and he died there by that Ark of God.
\p
\v 8 . And David kindled, because the Lord had rent a rent on Uza: [Heb. unto David it kindled, viz. his mind, or anger with grief, for the sin and punishment of Uza, whereby his publick joy was as it were rent and interrupted: see further, 1 Chron.15 2,3.] and he called that place Perez-Uza, [i.e. the rent, or, breach, gap of Uza] unto this day. [viz. that name continueth.]
\p
\v 9 . And David was afraid of the LORD that day: [Being terrified, and standing in awe of Gods Majesty, Holiness, righteous severity, and jealousie, he durst not proceed any further, being solicitous and troubled, how he might accomplish and sinish this work. So as the same might be well-pleasing unto God] and he said; How shall the Ark of the LORD come unto me? [As it he had said, it seemeth as yet not to be the LORDS will, (in regard of this sad rent) that I should fetch it unto me: or, there must needs be yet something lacking, which I am ignorant of, and whereof I must be said to expect Gods revelation]
\p
\v 10 . David then would not (suffer) the Ark of the LORD to be brought unto him in the city of David: but David caused it to turn aside into the house of Obed-Edom, [Who was a Levite, one of the Potters and Singers, see 1 Chron.15.18, 21.] the Gethite. [From Geth, or, Gath, a Royal Metropolis, or chief City of the Philistines, distinguished (according to some Maps) from Gath-Rimmon, lying near it, and allotted to the Levites, Jos.21.24, 25. Some are of opinion, that Obed-Edom fled thither with David in Sauls time, 1 Sam 21.
\p
\v 11 . And the Ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obed-Edom, the Gethite, three months: and the LORD blessed Obed-Edom, and all his house.
\p
\v 12 . Then they told King David, saying; The LORD hath blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that he hath for the Ark of Gods sake: So David went his way, and brought up the Ark of God out of the house of Obed-Edom into the city of David, with gladness. [Gathering and considing both from this, and other blessing of the LORD, set down in order, 1 Chron.14. that the LORD was appeased with him and his people. The manner of this fetching in the Ark is described more at large, 1 Chron.15.]
\p
\v 13 . And it came to pass, when they that bare the Ark of the LORD, [Meaning the Priests and Levites, see 1 Chron.15.2, 12, 13, 14.] had gone on six paces, [see 1 Chron 15.26. oth. had gone six goings] that he [viz. David, by the Priests] offered Oxen and fatted (cattle). [to praise God both in general, and also in particular, for his grace and mercy, that there was no rent made as formerly, and that the bearers of the Ark were strengthened of God, and preserved from all disaster or sad accident that might have befallen them. This Offering possibly was performed upon some Altar cast up in haste, according to the command, Exod.20.24. compared with 1 Chron 15.26.]
\p
\v 14 . And David skipped [The Hebrew word cometh from or, signifying a Lamb, which in going onward skippeth, and leapeth. Understand this not carnally, or, according to the manner of the children of this world: but out of meer holy, spiritual joy, or gladness, which the Holy Ghost kindled in his heart, at the settling of the pure worship of God, and the divine (or godly) types and tokens of the saving grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, who should proceed from his seed, according to the flesh] before the face of the LORD [who was present above the Ark, and manifested himself there: see 1 Sam.4.4.] with all (his) might: And David was girt about with a linen upper-garment. [Heb. Ephod.i.e. he had a light linen upper garment on; see 1 Sam.2.18. And this to evidence his humility and abasement before the LORD See ver.21, 22.]
\p
\v 15 . Thus David, and all the house of Israel [See 1 Chron.15.3, 25. and above verse 1.] brought up the Ark of the LORD; with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpets. [see 1 Chron.15.24.]
\p
\v 16 . And it came to pass, when the Ark of the LORD came into the city of David, that Michal, Sauls daughter, [See above ch.2.13, &c.] looked out at the window; Now when she saw King David leaping [or, strengthening himself (as we say) composing himself for it with his utmost might]and skipping [i.e. skipping with all (his) mighty, as verse .14]before the face of the Lord, [as above verse .14 and below verse .17,21.]she despised him in her heart.[judging unholy and carnally of David holy spiritually work]
\p
\v 17 .Now when they brought in the Ark of the Lord, they it in its place, in the midst of the Tent, which David had pitched or it :[viz. Before he forth to fetch the Ark .See 1 Chronicles .15.1. This he did by inspiration and instinct of the of Holy Ghost, to serve till such time that another house of the LORD should be built ,which he to have it done , but the God`s command and appointment was formed by Salomon.The other Tent set up by Moseh, was at Silo, 1 Sam.1.3, &c. and 14 3. at Nob. 1 Sam.21.1, &c. and at Gibeon, 1 Chronicles 16.39, 40. and David offered burnt-offerings, and thank-offerings before the face of the LORD.
\p
\v 18 . When David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, and the thank-offerings, then be blessed the people [As a Prophet and godly King he wished unto the people from God all corporal and spiritual welfare, or happiness] in the name of the LORD of hosts. [See above v.2.]
\p
\v 19 . And he dealt out to all the people, to all the multitude of Israel, from the man women, to every one a cake pf bread, and a fair peece (of flesh), [The Hebrews understand this of such a portion, or part of the beast, as friends use to entertain one another withal at great Feasts, or Banquets. Some conceive that the Hebrew word Eschpaz, is a compound, signifying fire and leck; but that is waste-beef] and a bottle (of wine): Then all the people went away, every one to his house.
\p
\v 20 . Now when David returned to bless [See on ver.18.] his house, Michal, Sauls daughter, went forth to meet David, and said; How was the King of Israel glorified to day, who uncovered himself to day before the eyes of the hand-maids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows, [i.e. Of the basest and vainest people, see Judg.9.4.] shamelessly uncovereth himself? [Heb. uncovering uncovereth himself, or, being uncovered is uncovered. She speaketh this in a slouting and jeering way; intimating, that David had as it were prostituted and exposed it himself to shame and disgrace, behaving himself not as a King, but as one of the vilest and contemptiblest among the people.]
\p
\v 21 . But David said unto Michal, Before the face of the LORD, [As above ver.14, 16, 17. Intimating, that he did all this to the honour of God, and to manifest his thankfulness for Gods incomprehensible mercy and favour, both spiritual and corporal; yea, that he (as it followeth) was yet much more bound to do it, and would do it] which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, passing by thy father, and thy fathers house [instituting me a Leader; as 1 Sam.9.16. & 10.1. & 13.14. & 25.30. Heb. Commanding, or, enjoyning me a Leader, understand, to be, i.e. appointing, or ordering me a Leader. Compare below chap.7.on ver.11. and 1 Sam.13.14.] over the people of the LORD, over Israel; yea, I will play before the face of the LORD.
\p
\v 22 . Also I will behave myself yet meaner then thus, and I will be low in mine (own) eyes, and with the handmaids, of which thou hast said, with the same shall I be glorified. [Accounting it to be no disgrace for me (as thou imaginest) but an honour in the sight of God, when I do honour and glorifie him with the least and meanest of his people, and make myself therein equal with them.]
\p
\v 23 . Now Michal, Sauls daughter, had no child, until the day of her death. [i.e. As long as she lived, never. Compare 1 Sam.15.35. Mal.1.25, &c.]
\c 7
\s David having attained to rest, is desirous to build the LORD an house, which the Prophet Nathan commandeth, ver.1, &c. But God straightway forbiddeth him by the same Prophet to do it, annexing a relation of the great mercies and favours bestowed on him in time past, and a Promise of yet greater for time to come, to wit, a son, Salomon, that should build God an house, and of the Messiah, that should proceed of his seed, according to the flesh; 4. Whereat David much admiring and rejoicing, maketh a very hearty and solemn thanksgiving unto the LORD, 17.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass when the King [Compare this whole Chapter with 1 Chron.17.] sat in his house [dwelling quietly, and being at rest, as followeth] and the Lord had given him rest from all his enemies round about; [who were so afraid of David, that they durst not make any more war against him: although David afterward of his own motion, made divers ways, to put Israel in possession of the right and freedom, that was promised them by God. See below chap.8. ver.11, 12, 13, 14. 1 Chron.18.3. & Gen.15.18.]
\p
\v 2 . Then the King said unto the Prophet Nathan; Behold now, I dwell in an house of Cedar, [See above chap.5.11.] and the Ark of God dwelleth in the midst of Curtains. [According to Gods command, Exod.26.1, &c. intimating, that it became not him to have better dwelling then Ark had; and that therefore he purposed to build God an house of Cedar. See verse 7.]
\p
\v 3 . And Nathan said unto the King; Go thy ways, do all that is in thine heart: for the LORD is with thee. [Nathan speaketh this in haste of his own accord, thinking no otherwise, but that David’s purpose pleased God, without expecting revelation from him in this weighty matter. See the like concerning Samuel, 1 Sam.16.6.]
\p
\v 4 . But it happened that night, that the Word of the LORD came unto Nathan the Prophet, saying:
\p
\v 5 . Go, and say unto my servant, unto David; Thus saith the LORD: shouldest thou build me an house, [God speaketh thus, because he manifested himself in this house, and above the Ark, by his gracious presence] for my dwelling?
\p
\v 6 . For I have not dwelt in any house, since that day that I brought [Understand thereupon, thou shalt not do it] the children of Israel out of Egypt, unto this day, but I have walked [Heb. I have been walking] in a Tent, and in a Tabernacle.
\p
\v 7 . Whithersoever I have walked with all the children of Israel, spake I indeed a word with one of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feel my people Israel. [See above chap.5.on verse 2. Out of which I now and then took, or raised a Judge or Ruler] saying, why build ye not me an house of Cedar? [The meaning is, that the LORD never complained, that the Rulers of Israel built him no house of Cedar.]
\p
\v 8 . Now then, thus shalt thou say unto my servant, unto David; Thus saith the LORD of hosts; [As above chap.6.on ver.2.] I took thee from the sheep-coat, from after the sheep, to be a Leader over my people, over Israel. [The following rehearsal of Gods special favours manifested unto David, and to be manifested in time to come, served to prevent the seruple and doubt, which David might have drawn thence, that God would have no house for himself built by him: whereby he might have fallen into this surmise, as if he were not accepted of God, or that he esteemed him not worthy to do it.]
\p
\v 9 . And I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have destroyed all thine enemies before thy face: and have made thee a great name, as the name of the great (ones) that are on the earth.
\p
\v 10 . And I have appointed [Oth. I will appoint] a place for my people, for Israel, and planted him, that he may dwell in his (own) place. [i.e. in his own peculiar land] and be no more driven to and fro; and the children of perverseness [see above chap.3.on verse 34.] shall no more oppress him, [Heb. shall not add, or go on to oppress him (Israel) understand all this, on condition obedience, see Deut.28.] according, as at the first. [this may be understood of the oppression in Egypt.]
\p
\v 11 . And from that day, that I commanded [i.e. By my command, counsel and word raised and appointed. See above chap 6. verse 21.] Judge to be over my people Israel; But I gave thee rest from all thine enemies: [since that Israel being brought into and planted in the land of Promise by Josua, was served and protected by Judges, Judg.2.on verse 16.] Also the LORD maketh known to thee, that the LORD will make thee an house, [In stead, that thou purposest to build the LORD an house, he giveth thee to understand that he will build thee an house; i.e. establish and continue thy Kingdom in thy Posterity, and (that which is far more) raise up out of thy seed (according to the flesh) the Messiah, who shall be an everlasting King over his people. This Prophecy is so be understood, that it partly looketh at Salomon, as a type of the Lord Christ, partly at Christ himself, whole type he was: and that some things suit or agree to Salomon onely some onely and properly to Christ, some to them both.]
\p
\v 12 . When thy days shall be fulfilled, and thou shalt be fallen asleep with thy fathers, [See Deut.31.on verse 10. Act.13.36.] then will cause thy seed [i.e. thy son, or one of thy sons, meaning Salomon, and the Messiah our Lord Jesus Christ, whose type and figure Salomon was. See 1 Chron.28.6 & Heb.1.5. & Act.13.22, 23. Rom.1.3, &c.] to arise after thee, that shall proceed out of thy body, [Heb. out of thy bowels] and I will establish his Kingdom.
\p
\v 13 . He shall build an house [Salomon the Temple of the Lord, Jesus Christ the spiritual house, that is, the Church of God] for my name, and shall establish the throne of his Kingdom for ever. [The Kingdom of Salomon and David continued indeed a long time, but this is properly to be understood of the spiritual Kingdom of Jesus Christ, forasmuch as the same above is properly everlasting: below verse 16. See Luke 1.32, 33.]
\p
\v 14 . I will be to him father, [To him; i.e. to Salomon, by grace, viz. through adoption in Christ: but to the Lord Christ himself by nature, he being mine own, eternal, onely begotten son. See Job.1.18. Act 13 33. Heb.1.3, 5. Rom.8.3. 1 Job.4.9 &c.] and he shall be the Lord Christ was altogether without sin. See Isa.53.9. Heb.4 5. 2 Cor.5.21. 1 Pet.1.19. although he hath taken our sins upon him, and as our surely paid for them] then I will punish him with a rod of men, and with plagues of the children of men. [i.e. Fatherly and moderately, as a man useth to chasten his child: but will not cast him off, as in the following verse is set forth.]
\p
\v 15 . But my loving kindness shall not depart from him; according as I have taken (the same) away from Saul, whom I have taken away from before thy face.
\p
\v 16 . But thine house, and thy Kingdom shall be established forever, [See above on verse 13 and compare Luke 1.32, 33.] before thy face: [i.e. Thou shalt live to see the beginning of the accomplishment of these Promises in thy son Salomon: from whence thou shalt be confident of the rest, as if thou now beheldest the accomplishment with thine own eyes. See 1 King.1.48. & 2 4.] thy throne shall be established forever.
\p
\v 17 . According to all these words, and according to all this vision; so did Nathan speak unto David. [i.e. Nathan delivered faithfully unto David, all that was revealed to him from the LORD, without dimishing from, or adding any thing thereunto.]
\p
\v 18 . Then King David went in, [viz. Into the Tent, which he had called to be made for the Ark of the Covenant, above chap 6.17.] and continued before the face of the LORD: [see above chap.6.on ver.13.] and be said, Who am I, LORD, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?
\p
\v 19 . Moreover, this [Which thou hast hitherto done by me] was yet little in thine eyes, Lord LORD , but thou hast spoken also over thy servants house for a great while to come: [i.e. of things which shall not happen till after a long time; and this (accordingly) the law of men, i.e. as men are wont to dispose their house, goods, and posterity. Oth. according to an instruction of men; i.e. very freely, familiarly, and friendly, as men are wont to speak with men, and to teach and instruct them. Oth. Is this a manner of men? i.e. thus to deal with men? The meaning will be thus: Are men worthy, that thou shouldest speak to them in such a friendly and samiliar way of such great and weighty things to come, which are determined in thy counsel? Tis too much, and too great!] Lord LORD.
\p
\v 20 . And what shall David speak yet more unto thee? for thou knowest thy servant, Lord LORD.
\p
\v 21 . For thy words sake, [i.e. For thy promise sake. Or, understand by the WORD the eternal Son of God, who is the substantial Word of the father, in whom all the Promises of God are Yea and Amen: see 1 Chron.17.on verse 19. Hag. 2.on verse 6.] and according to thine heart, [i.e. gracious good pleasure, counsel, or favourable affection toward me] hst thou done [David speaketh by Faith, and according to the manner of the Prophets, of things to come, as if they were already fulfilled, by reason of the certainty of Gods promises] all these great things; [Heb. all this greatness] to make (them) known to thy servant. [or, making (them) known to thy servant]
\p
\v 22 . Therefore thou art great, LORD God; for there is none like thee, and there is no God then thou alone, [Or, except, or, besides thee] according to all that we have heard with our ears. [i.e. according to the demonstration of all, &c.]
\p
\v 23 . And who is like thy people, like Israel, an onely people upon earth, which [Or, that, because] God went forth [Heb. ELOHIM went forth. See of this phrase Gen.20.on ver.13.] to redeem for a people to himself, and to make himself a Name, [i.e. to the honour of his holy Name] and to do for you [to wit, O Israel] these great and terrible things, [Heb. these greatness and terribleness, or, fearfulness] to thy hand [O God] before the face of thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, (expelling) [this word is here unserted from 1 Chron.7 21.] the heathen, and their Gods. [oth. thus: before the face of thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee, from Egypt, from the Nations, and their Gods.]
\p
\v 24 . And thou hast established to thy self thy people Israel (to be) a people unto thee forever: [Understand Israel, according to the flesh, till the coming of Christ, but the spiritual Israel (that is, the Church of God, consisting of believing Jews and Gentiles) to all eternity] and thou, LORD, art become, [or, hast been] a God unto them. [See Gen.17.on verse 7. Levit.18.on verse 2.]
\p
\v 25 . Now then, LORD God, establish forever, which thou hast spoken over thy servant, and over his house; and do according as thou hast spoken.
\p
\v 26 . And let thy Name be magnified forever, that it may be said; The LORD of host is God over Israel, and the house of thy servant David shall be established before thy face.
\p
\v 27 . For thou LORD of hosts, thou God of Israel, thou hast revealed (before) the ear of thy servant, [i.e. Thou hast caused me to hear, revealed to me, made Known, that which formerly was hidden from me. See the like phrase, Ruth 4 4. & 1 Sam.9 15. See there] saying; I will build thee an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee. [Heb. hath found his heart, or, found with, or, by his heart, &c. i.e. he found himself so moved in his heart at it, that he purposed to utter this prayer before thee, as an evidence of his faith and thankfulness.]
\p
\v 28 . Now then, Lord LORD, thou art that God, and thy words shall be truth: and thou hast spoken this good unto thy servant.
\p
\v 29 . So let it now please thee, and bless the house of thy servant, that it may before thy face: for thou lord LORD hast spoken (it), and with thy blessing shall thy servants house be blessed forever. [By these words David testifieth his Faith, whereby he received these promises of God, being strongly confident, that they shall be fulfilled.]
\c 8
\s David subdueth the Philistines, ver 1. as also the Moabites, 2. Smitteth likewise Haladezer King of Zoba, 3. and the Syrians of Damascus that came to help him, 5. placeth a Garrison in Syria of Damascus, 6. is honoured with sumptuous Presents by king Thoi, which he dedicateth to God, with a great prey, 10. Smitteth the Edomites, and placeth a Garrison in their Land, 13. a relation of David Government, and his chiefest Officers, 15.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after that, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: And David took Meleg-Amma [i.e. The Bridle of Amma, or, of the Elbow. It seemeth altogether, that hereby is meant Gath, which was the Royal City, or Metropolis of the Philistines, expressly mentioned, 1 Chron.18.1. and (as some conceive) lying upon a mountain called Amma, and here called a bridle, because by its strength and power it bridled and kept in law the circumjacent places, and hindered the inroad of the enemies] out of the Philistines hand.]
\p
\v 2 . He smote also the Moabites, and measured them with a line, [i.e. He divided their Land by measuring it, which was done at that time with lines or cords, destroying by lot two parts of the Inhabitants, but saving one full part alive: or, he divided the people into three equal parts, by casting lots so equal, as if they had been measured with lines, &c. God indeed had commanded to spare Ammon and Moab (the Posterity of Lot) Deut.2.9, 19. but because they had exercised bitter enmity against the people of God, and had combined with their enemies, therefore David dealt in an hostile manner with them. See Numb.22.2, 3, 4.&c. & 24.17. & 25.17, 18. & 31.2. Judg.3.14 21, 28, 30. 1 Sam.14 47. And below chapter 10.4, 7, &c.] causing them to lie town on the ground: [in a contemptible manner casting them down to the ground: or, so beating them, that they bowed (as it were) down to the ground, being wearied out, and conquered] and he measured (with) two lines, to put to death, and (with) one full line to keep alive: thus the Moabites became servants to David, bringing Presents. [In token of subjection. So below verse 6.]
\p
\v 3 . David smote also Hadadezer: 1 Chron.18.3.] the son of Rechob, the King Of Zoba; [see 1 Sam.14.47. This is thought to have been that part of Syria, which is called Saphene, these words Zoba, or Zova, and Soshene, agreeing very neer together. See also below chap.10.6.] when he [viz. David; or, as some conceive, Hadadezer] went his way to turn his hand to the river Phrat. [i.e. to stretch out his hand, &c.] Oth. to set, or recover his borders, (Heb. to cause to return, or, to bring back) at the river Phrat: i.e. Euphrates, which border was promised Israel by God, and consequently was to be allotted to them: compare 1 Chron.18.3. and see Gen.15.18 &c.]
\p
\v 4 . And David took from him a thousand (Charets,) [This is here inserted from 1 Chron.18.4. where this History is repeated] and seven hundred horsemen, [understand (as some take it) troops or companies of horsemen, each troop or company consisting of ten, which make together seven thousand horsemen, which number is expressly set down, 1 Chron.18 4. Compare below chap.10.on v.18.] and twenty thousand foot-men; and David houghed all [except the hundred, which he kept, as followeth] the charet-horses, [or, charets: see Jos.11.6.] and reserved thereof an hundred charets.
\p
\v 5 . And the Syrians of Damascus [Heb. Aram; i.e. Syria: see Gen.10.on ver.22. & 22.on ver.21. whereby the Syrians are understood. Syria of Damascus was indeed the chief part of Kingdom, among all the parts, Lands, Provinces, or Kingdom (whereof some are rehearsed below, chap.10.6.) which were comprehended under Syria: being for difference sake called Syria of Damascus, from the name of the Metropolis, or chief City of this Kingdom] came to succour Hadadezer, King of Zoba; but David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
\p
\v 6 . And David put Garrisons in Syria of Damascus, and the Syrians became servants unto David, bringing Presents: [As above ver.2.] and the LORD preserved David [or gave David salvation, or conquest, victory: for which the Hebrew word may be stilt taken in Martial, or warlike affairs: so below v.14. and 22.on v.51. and 23.v 10, 12. Psal.20 6. Prov. 21 31, &c.] whithersoever he went.
\p
\v 7 . And David took the golden shields, that were with the servants [i.e. Officers] of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 8 . Besides, King David took exceeding much Copper from Bethach, and from Berothat, [Called Tibehat, and Can, 1 Chron.18.8.] Cities of Hadadezer.
\p
\v 9 . Now when Thoi [Called also Thou, 1 Chron.18.9.] King of Hamath [see Numb.13.on v.22.] heard, that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer.
\p
\v 10 . Then Thoi sent his son Joram [Called Hadoram, 1 Chron.18.10.] unto King David, to ask him concerning (his) welfare, [Heb. concerning the peace; i.e. to salute him in a friendly manner: see Gen.43.on v.27.] and to bless him, [i.e. to salute him, and to bid him joy, in regard of the victory obtained, that is, to congratulate him, as weuse to lay] because he had warred against Hadadezer, and smitten him; (for Hadadezer, and smitten him; (for Hadadezer made war continually against Thoi:) [Heb. was a man of wars of Thoi: i.e. he made continual war against him, was his enemy, and fought against him, who never left him unmolested: see Gen.9 on v.20. & compare Judg.12.on v.2. below chap 18.on v.20. & 2 Chron.35.on v.21. Psal.41. 10] and in his hand were silver vessels, and golden vessels, and copper vessels; [i.e. Joram the son of Thoi had these Gifts of Presents by him ready at hand, as we use to say: see the like phrase, 1 Samuel 9.8. 2 King.5.5 &c.]
\p
\v 11 . Which also King David hallowed unto the LORD; with the silver, and the gold, which he had dedicated, of all the Hea hen, which he had subjected (unto himself.)
\p
\v 12 . Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amlek, and of the prey of Hadadezer, the son of Rechob, the King of Zoba.
\p
\v 13 . Also David gat (him) a name, when he returned, after that he had smitten the Syrians in the valley of salt, [viz Got him a name, or (smiting) in the valley of salt, &c. whereof 2 King.14.7. The Valley lay at the south-end of the salt-sea, at the East end of the mountain of the Edomites, or Seir] eighteen thousand. [of the Edomites: see 1 Chron.18.12. whereunto agreeth the following verse: compare also Psl.60.on v.2.]
\p
\v 14 . And he put Garrisons in Edom, in all Edom put he Garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David: [And his Posterity, until the time of Joram, the son of Josaphet: see 2 King.8.22.] and the Lord preserved David [as above v.6.] whithersoever he went.
\p
\v 15 . Thus David reigned over all Israel; and David did [Heb. was doing] right and justice [see Gen.18.on v.19.] unto all his people.
\p
\v 16 . Now Joab, the son of Zeruja, was over the host [i.e. Captain General, or Commander in chief] and Josaphat, the son of Achilud, was Chancellour. [see 1 King.4.on v 3.]
\p
\v 17 . And Zadok [Of Aaron line or race, by Eleazar 1 Chron 6.4, 8. & 24.3. see of this man below chap.15.24. & 20.25. 1 Chron.16.39. & 24.3. &29. 22. also 1 King.1.8, 32, 38. & 1 King.2.35.] the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech, [of Aarons line or race, by Ithamar, and Eli, 1 Chron.24.3.] the son of Abiathar, were Priest: [of the orders of the Priests: see Numb.3.on v.32. & 2 King.23.on v.4.] and Seraja was the Scribe. [see 1 King.4 3.]
\p
\v 18 . There was also Benaja, the son of Jojada, with the Crethi, and the Plethi: [Over whom Benaja was Commander or Governour: see 2 Sam.20.23. 1 Chron.18.17. Of the Crethi and Plethi, see 1 King.1.on v.38.] but David’s sons mere Princes. [or, head-officers, chief Rulers. Of the Hebrew word (which otherwise generally signifieth Priests) see Gen.41.on v 45. Here it cannot signify Priests, because David’s sons were of the tribe of Juda, not of the tribe of Levi. This word is thus expounded, 1 Chron.18.17. David’s son were the first on the Kings hand: or, ready at hand for the King, as we use to say.]
\c 9
\s David, calling to mind his promises made to Jonathan, causeth Mephiboseth, the son of the said Jonathan to besought for, and brought before him, ver.1, &c. Giveth him all Sauls estate, and appointeth Ziba to be Governour over the same, but ordereth Mephiboseth to sit at his table.7.
\p
\v 1 And David said, Is there yet any one, that is left of the house of Saul; that I may shew kindness to him, for Jonathans sake? [See above chap.1.26. & 1 Samuel 20.]
\p
\v 2 . Now the house of Saul had a servant, [A Purveyor of the house; as Steward, Gen 15.2, 3. Compare below v.10.] whose name was Ziba; [Heb. Tsiba] and they called him unto David: and the King said unto him; Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant. [i.e. I am Ziba, at thy service, or ready to do thee service.]
\p
\v 3 . And the King said; Is there not yet any one of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God [See 1 Sam 20.14, 15, 16, 17.] unto him? Then said Ziba unto the King; There is yet a son of Jonathan, that is smitten on both feet. [as above chap.4.4. i.e. lame, cripple, as below v.13.]
\p
\v 4 . And the King said unto him; Where is he? And Ziba said unto the King, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel at Lodebar. [Lying beyond Jordan, in the Land of Gilead, not far from Mahanaim: see below chap.17.27.]
\p
\v 5 . Then King David sent forth; and he took him [i.e. Sent for him, caused him to be fetch] out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel from Lodebar.
\p
\v 6 . Now when Mephiboseth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came in to David, he fell on his face, and bowed himself down; and David said, Mephiboseth! and he said, Behold, thy servant is (here.)
\p
\v 7 . And David said unto him, Fear not, for I will surely slew kindness unto thee, [Heb. I will doing do, etc.] for Jonathan thy fathers sake, and I will restore [Foreasmuch as Isboseth, and others of Sauls house had warred against David, their estates therefore were forfeited to the King, who restoreth them now unto Mephiboseth] unto thee [and thy son, below v.9 & 12.] all the fields, [or, all the ground, land] of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually. [i.e. daily eat and drink with me: board, or table with me: see above chap.3.35.]
\p
\v 8 . Then he bowed himself, and said; What is thy servant, that thou hast looked about toward such a dead Dog, [A Proverb among the Jews, whereby a mans nothingness and contemptibleness is expressed: see 1 Sam.24.15. and below, chap.16.9. Compare above chap.3.on vers.8.] as I am?
\p
\v 9 . Then the King called Ziba, Sauls servant, [i.e. Who had been Sauls servant] and said unto him; I have given unto thy Lords son, [viz. Mephiboseth; as some conceive, Micha (ver.12.) to live upon: but by this the Father was not excluded, or shut out; as ver.7.] all that Saul hath had, and all his house.
\p
\v 10 . Therefore thou shalt till the land for him, thou, and thy sons, and thy servants, and shalt bring in (the fruits,) that thy Lords son may have bread to eat; and Mephiboseth thy Lords son, shall eat bread at my table continually: now Ziba had fifteen sons, and twenty servants.
\p
\v 11 . And Ziba said unto the King; According to all that my Lord the King commandeth his servants, so shall thy servant do: Also Mephiboseth should be eating at my table, as one of the Kings sons. [Intimating, that he himself also (if it had been the Kings pleasure0 would have entertained and feasted Mephiboseth at his own table, as well as if he had been Court. Others take them to be the Kings words, thus: but Mephiboseth (said the King) shall eat at my table, as one of the Kings sons.]
\p
\v 12 . Now Mephiboseth had a little son, whose name was Micha; and all that dwelt in the house of Ziba, [Heb. all, the whole dwelling of the house of Ziba] were Mephiboseths servants.
\p
\v 13 . Thus Mephiboseth dwelt at Jerusalem, because he did eat continually at the Kings tables: and he was cripple (or lame) on both his feet. [Or, although he, &c.]
\c 10
\s David sendeth Ambassadors to the King of the Ammonites, with presentation of his favour. Ver.1, 2, &c. But the same King entreateth the Ambassadors most shamefully, 3. And gathereth a great Army together against David, 6. Against whom David sendeth forth Joab and Abisai, who smite the Ammonites, and the Syrians that came to succour them, and return to Jerusalem, 7. The Syrians gathering themselves again together against David, are smitten and subdued by him, 15.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after that, that the King of the children of Ammon [See of this King, 1 Sam.11. where he is called Nahas, as also here in the following verse] died: and Hanun [Heb. Chanun] his son was King in his stead. [Compare this Chapter with 1 Chron.19.]
\p
\v 2 . Then said David: I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahas, [Heb. Nachasch] according as his father shewed kindness unto me; [When and wherein this was done, is not mentioned in the holy Scripture. It’s possible that he shewed the like kindness to David at the time of his banishment, as the King of the Moabites did, 1 sam.22.4.] So David sent forth to comfort him by the Ministery [Heb. hand] of his servants, [i.e. his Officers, or Courtiers, whom as Ambassadors he sent unto him] touching his father: [i.e. his fathers death] and the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon.
\p
\v 3 . Then said the Princes of the children of Ammon unto Hanun their Lord: Doth David honour thy father in thine eyes, [i.e. In thy opinion or judgement: the meaning is, thinkest, thou, or seemeth ot unto thee, that David doth this to honour thy father?] because he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David therefore sent his servants unto thee, to search this city, and to spy it out, and to ruin it? [intimating, that he did it for that very end and purpose: see of such kind of questions, Judg.4.on ver.6.]
\p
\v 4 . Then Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved their beard half off, [Heb. The moiety, or, one half of their beard] and cut their garments half off, [or, through the half, or, midst] unto their buttocks, and he let them go.
\p
\v 5 . When they let David know this, then he sent to meet them; for these men were greatly ashamed: and the King said; Tarry at Jericho, [Meaning the place, or there abouts, where Jericho had formerly been built: for Jericho was not built up again till Ahabs time, 1 King 9.24.] until your beard shall be grown, [Heb. shall grow, bud forth. A compassion taken from herbs and trees, that sprout forth, green, bud, blossom] then return.
\p
\v 6 . Now when the children of Ammon saw, that they had made themselves stick [See Gen.34.on ver.30.] with David, the children of Ammon sent forth, and nired [viz. To serve them as souldiers in this war. This is the first History in the holy Scripture, wherein we read of mercenary souldiers that were hired for money, to serve other Lords and Masters in the Wars] of the Syrians [see above chap.8.on verse 5.] of Beth-Rechob, and of the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand foot-men, and of the King of Maacha a thousand men, and of the men of Tob [see Judg, 11.on verse 3.] twelve thousand men.
\p
\v 7 . When David heard this, he sent Joab forth, and all the Host, with the Champions, [See of David’s Champions, or Worthies, below chap.23.8, &c.]
\p
\v 8 . And the children of Ammon marched forth, and put the Battalias before the door of gate: [Of the City Medela, see 1 Chron.19.7. This they likewise did to secure the City, and (if need were) to retire in thither: (below verse 14.) leaving the succour by themselves apart in the field, to set upon Joab on the other side] but the Syrians of Zoba, and Rechob, and the men of Tob, and Maacha, they were by themselves in the field.
\p
\v 9 . Now when Joab saw that the field [Heb. face] of the Battle-aray was against him, before and behind, then he chose out of all the choices (men) of Israel, and put them in aray against the Syrians: [Heb. in the meeting of Syria: and so in the following verses, 10, 17.]
\p
\v 10 . And the rest of the people the gave under the hand of Abisai his brother, who put them in aray against the children of Ammon.
\p
\v 11 . And he said; if the Syrians shall be too strong for me; then thou shalt come to deliver me, [Heb. be a Deliverer] and if the children of Ammon shall be too strong for thee, then will I come to deliver thee.
\p
\v 12 . Be strong, [i.e. Be of good courage, and play the men] and let us strong for our people, and for the cities of our God: now the LORD do [or, will do that which is good in his eyes. [that which pleaseth him.]
\p
\v 13 . Then Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before his face.
\p
\v 14 . When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians fled, they fled also before the face of Abisai, and came into the city: and Joab returned from the children of Ammon; and came to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 15 . Now when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before the face of Israel, then gathered themselves (again) together.
\p
\v 16 . And Hadarezer sent forth, and caused the Syrians to come out, that are on the other side of the River, [viz. Euphrates] and they came to Helam: [Heb. Ghelam, This place is no where mentioned in the Holy Scripture, but in this History] and Sobach, [called also Schophach, 2 Chron.19 16.] Hadarezers Commander in chief, (marched) along before their face.
\p
\v 17 . When that was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and went over the Jordan, and came to Helam: and the Syrians put (the battle-aray) against David, [Heb. in the meeting, etc, as above vers.9.10] and fought with him.
\p
\v 18 . But the Syrians fled before the face of Israel, and David slew [Heb. smote dead] of the Syrians seven hundred charets [understand with their horse-men, which sought from the charets, on which they were carried. And hereby may be understood sevenhundred troops or companies of horse-men, each troop or company on a charet, consisting of ten horse-men, which make together seven thousand. Which number is expressly set down, 1 Chron.19.18. See above chap.8.on v.4.] and fourty thousand horse-men: [for this is put, 1 Chron.19.18. foot-men, or foot: which may be thus compared, that besides the asore-mentioned cahrets and horse-men, the great part of the army, both horse and foot were slain, so that here the number of horse, and 1 Chronicles Chap.19. a like number of foot is mentioned, that these nations were wont to go forth to battle with huge multitudes, (as also David himself therefore went forth with all Israel) is clear and evident by the Holy Scripture. Others understand in this place seven hundred great and eminent charets, and the whole number of charets together, both great and small, to be seven thousand, 1 Chron.19.18.] Besides, he smote Sobach, their Commander in chief, that he died there.
\p
\v 19 . Now when all the Kings that were Hadarezers servants [i.e. which were subjects to him, or under his protection, or which ha had used for his service in this Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them: [i.e. were subject and obedient unto them. Compare 1 Sam.4.9. and elsewhere often] and the Syrians were afraid to deliver [i.e. to assist, aid, help, succour, come to deliver] the children of anymore.
\c 11
\s While Joab at David’s command besiegeth the city of Rabba, v.1. David at home committeth adultery with Bath-seba, 2. and hearing that she was big with child, he sendeth for Uria her husband out of the camp to cover his shame, 5. which miscarrying, he sendeth Uria again into the camp, with a letter unto Joab, whom he commandeth to order the matter so, as that Uria may fall by the Enemies hand, 9. which so happeneth; and word being sent unto David by Joab, David marrieth the same Bathseba, 17.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass with the return of the year, at the time when Kings go forth, [i.e. when the year was expired or gone about, and the summer time of the ensuing year came on, when Kings were wont to march into the field to make war: the weather then serving to get provision and necessaries both for men and beasts. See 1 Kings 20.22, 26. and 1. Chron.20.1. and 2 Chron.36.10.] that David sent away Joab and his servants, [i.e. his officers, or commanders with the souldiers] with him, and all Israel, to destroy tyhe children of Ammon, and besiege Rabba; [the metropolis, or chief city of the Ammonites, lying beyond Jordan on mount Gilead, by the house of the brook Jabbok, See also below chap.12.26, &c.] But David tarried at Jerusalem.
\p
\v 2 . So it came to pass towards evening-tide, that David arose from off his bed; [Whereon he had taken his after-noons rest. Compare above chap.4, 5, 7.] and walked upon the roof [see of the situation of roofs, Deut.22.on v.8.] of the Kings house, and beheld from the roof a woman washing of herself: now this woman was very beautifully of countenance.
\p
\v 3 . And David sent forth, and inquired after this woman: and they said, [Hebr. he said, i.e. some one of his family, court] is not that Bathseba, [otherwise called Bathsua, 1 Chron.3.5. Intimating that it was surely Bathsua. See of such kind of questions, Judg.4.on v.6. and above chap.10.3.] the daughter of Elium, [otherwise called Ammiel, 1 Chron.3.5.] the wife of Uria the Hethite? [but converted to the true Religion, and being therein zealous, as appeareth below v.11. Compare 1 Sam.26.6. Some think that he was called an Hethite, because he had dwelt among the children of Heth. Of this people, see Gen.23.3, &c.]
\p
\v 4 . Then David sent forth messengers and caused her to be fetch; [Heb. took her; i.e. caused her to be taken and brought. Although he had understood that she had a lawfull husband] and when she was come in unto him, he lay with her; (now she had purified [Hebr. hallowed, i.e. purified, cleansed. See hereof Lev.15.19, 20, 21, &c.] her self from her uncleanness:) after that she had returned to her house.
\p
\v 5 . And the woman conceived: so she sent away, and let David know, [Perceiving that she was with child by David] and said, [i.e. sent him word] I am with child.
\p
\v 6 . Then David sent to Joab, (saying); Send Uria the Hethite unto me: and Joab sent Uria unto David.
\p
\v 7 . Now when Uria came to him, then David asked after the welfare [Heb. after the peace; and so in the sequel, see above chap 8.on v.10. and Gen. 43.on v.27.] of Joab, and after the welfare of the people, and after the welfare of the war.
\p
\v 8 . After that David said unto Uria; go down to thy house, and wash thy feet; [see Gen.18.on v.4.] and when Uria departed out of the Kings house, (there) followed after him a mess of the King. [Hebr. a mess of the King went forth after him. Meaning a mess from the Kings Table, whereby David would stir up Uria to make merry with his wife, and to lie with her: thus to make the world believe that Uria was the child’s own father, and so to hide his adultery from the eyes of men.]
\p
\v 9 But Uria laid himself down before the door of the King's house, with all the servants of his Lord: and he went not down into his house.
\p
\v 10 . And they made it known unto David, saying; Uria is not gone down into his house: then said David unto Uria; comest thou not from the journey? [Heb. way] why art thou not gone down into thine house?
\p
\v 11 . And Uria said unto David; The Ark, [Which they were wont to take along with them in great wars, to enquire of the Lord in time of need, as appeareth Num.31.on v.6. 1 Sam.4.4. and 14.8. although the same was vain and fruitless in respect of hypocrites, who being unfaithful, do in vain rely on the outward tokens of grace] and Israel, and Juda, abide in tents; and my Lord Joab, and the servants of my Lord are camped in the open Field, [Heb. face of the Field] and should I go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? (As true as) thou livest, [see Gen.42.on v.16.] and thy soul liveth, if I shall do this thing. [whereupon must be understood, then God do this and that to me. Of such abrupt phrase used in swearing, see Gen.14.on v.23. These zealous and Religious speeches of Uria ought to have moved David, to sin no more against this godly man.]
\p
\v 12 . Then said David to Uria; tarry here also today, so I will send thee away tomorrow: Thus Uria tarried at Jerusalem that day, and the next day.
\p
\v 13 . And David invited him, so that he did eat and drink before his face, [i.e. in David’s presence at his table] and he made him drunk, [David made Uria drunk, all this tending to the same end, whereof mention is made v.8.] after that he [viz. Uriah] went forth in the evening, to lay himself down on his bed, with the servants of his Lord, [viz. David] but went not down into his house. [Though he was drunk, yet he continued stedfast in his resolution and purpose, mentioned, verse 11.]
\p
\v 14 . Now it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, [When he perceived that the first assay, to hide and cover his adultery by Urias lying with Bathseba, miscarried, he attempted to cause the good man to be destroyed in such a way, as that the carriage and practise (as he thought) should no waies be perceived: falling thus, being blinded by his own flesh, and seduced by the Devil, from one grievous sin into another] and he sent (it) by the hand of Uria.
\p
\v 15 . And he wrote in that letter, saying; [i.e. thus in this manner] Set [Heb. give, bring] Uria before over against the strongest battle, [Heb. over against the face of the strongest battle, i.e. where the stoutest and valiantest souldiers of the Enemy are, as is mentioned in the following verse, that being forsaken by you, he may without fail be slain and perish] and retire from him that he may smitten and die.
\p
\v 16 . So it came to pass, when Joab had observed [viz. to perceive where the besieged imployed their valiant souldiers, and to set Uria in the front against them. Others, had set watch against] the city, [viz. Rabba, which he had besieged, above v.1.] that he put Uria in the place, whereof he knew that there were warlike men.
\p
\v 17 . Now when the men of the City marched forth, and sought with Joab, there fell of the people, [i.e. there were some slain] of David’s servants: And Uria the Hethite died also.
\p
\v 18 . Then Joab sent away, and let David know the whole transaction of this battle.
\p
\v 19 . And he charged the messenger, saying; When thou shalt have made an end of uttering the whole managing of this war unto the King.
\p
\v 20 . And it shall be, if the Kings wrath arise, and he say unto thee; wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the City to sight? Know ye not, that they would shoot [viz. with arrows, or other instruments of war, as was usual in those times, see v.24.] from the wall?
\p
\v 21 . Who smote Abimalech, the son of Jerubbeseth? [Otherwise called Jerubbaal, i.e. Gideon. See Judg.7.1.] did not a woman cast a piece of a mil-stone upon him from the wall, that he died at Tebez? [see Judg.9.52, 53.] why went ye nigh the wall? Then shalt thou say; Thy servant Uria the Hethite is dead also.
\p
\v 22 . And the Messenger went his way, and came in, and made Known to David all that Joab had sent him forth for.
\p
\v 23 . And the messenger said unto David; Those men [Of the besieged City of Rabba] were surely too strong for us, and narched out unto us into the field: but we were against them unto the [or because the men (of the city) behaved themselves manfully or valiantly against us and marched out against us into the field, therefore we, etc.] door of the gate. [i.e. we beat them back to the very entrance of the City gate, insomuch that through the sierceness of the battle, we coming somewhat too near, lost some of our men.]
\p
\v 24 . Then the Archers shot from off the wall upon thy servants, (so) that there are (some) of the Kings servants dead: and thy servant Uria the Hethite is dead also.
\p
\v 25 . Then David said unto the messengers, thus shalt thou say unto Joab; let not this thing be evil in thine eyes, [i.e. let not this displease thee, let it nor seem strange to thee] for the sword devoureth a swell this (man) as that; [Heb. according to that and according to this: or so as thus] strengthen thy battle against the City and overthrow it: strengthen him thus. [David chargeth the messenger to strengthen Joab thus, and in the Kings name to be speak a good courage in him. His History is prosecuted, chap.12.26.]
\p
\v 26 . Now when Uria’s wife heard that her husband was dead, then she mourned for her Lord. [Ur husband. Compare Gen.20.3. and see Exod.21.3.]
\p
\v 27 . And when the mourning was past, David sent thither and took her [Heb. gathered her. See Judg.19.on v.15.] into his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son? But this thing, which David had done, was evil in the eyes of the LORD. [i.e. this whole business of David displeased the Lord exceedingly.]
\c 12
\s The Prophet Nathan, by Gods command, setteth before David’s eyes his grievious sins, under a certain parable sharpely reproving his unthankfulness, and threatening heavy judgements against him, v.1. &c. David confesseth his sins, and obtaineth pardon of God for them, yet with an addition of sharp chastisement, 13. he prayeth and fasteth, and mourneth grievously for the sick child, while it yet lived, but is cheared again, when it was dead, 15. of which being demanded, he giveth a reason, 21. obtaineth after that by Bathseba the promised son Solomon, who is called Jedidja, 24. David subdueth Rabba, and punisheth the Ammonites grievously, 26.
\p
\v 1 And the LORD sent Nathan [The Prophet, as above cha.7.2.] unto David: When he came in unto him, he said unto him; there were two men in one city the one rich, and the other poor. [by means of this parable and the exposition thereof it pleased God first to bring his servant David to this, that he ignorantly passed sentence against himself, and the next place awaked out of the sleep of his sins, laid to heart the abomination and odiousness thereof, and obtained and manifested true sincere repentance for the same.]
\p
\v 2 . The rich (man) had exceeding many sheep and oxen.
\p
\v 3 . But the poor (man) had nothing at all, save one only small ew-lamb, which he had bought and had nourished it up, that it was grown great with him, and with his children likewise: it did eat of his (own) morsel, and drink of his (own) cup, and slept in his bosom, and it was unto him as a daughter.
\p
\v 4 . Now when (there) came a traveller unto the rich man, he spared to take of his (own) sheep, and of his (own) oxen, to dress (something) for the way-faring man, that was come to him: and he took the poor mans ew-lamb, and dressed that for the man, that was come to him.
\p
\v 5 . Then David’s anger kindled greatly against that man: [Meaning the rich man] and he said unto Nathan; (as true as) the LORD liveth, that man that hath done that, is a child of death. [i.e. he is guilty of death, he hath deserved death: in regard of the circumstance of the merciless cruelty used toward that poor man. Compare with this phrase, Deut.25.on v.2. Gen.20.3. Eph.2.3. and above chap.3.on v.34.]
\p
\v 6 . And he shall restore that ew-lamb four fold, [According to the Law of God, Exod.22, 1.] because he did this thing, and because he hath not spared.
\p
\v 7 . Then said Nathan unto David; thou art that man: [i.e. thou art like that man, having commited so much the grosser, and more abominable fact; as it is a far greater crime to take any mans wedded wife from him, then to take from any man an only lamb: and yet besides to put the guiltless man to death] Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul:
\p
\v 8 . And I gave thee thy Lords house, [i.e. Sauls house. Heb. the house of thy Lords, in the plural number, which in the Holy Scripture is wont to be used for the singular number. See Gen.39.on v.2. Some retain in the translation the plural number thus: of thy Lords; that is, of those that were greater and mightier then thou: and so in the following words; understanding that the match or marriage between David and Sauls wives (in respect of the assinity) was unlawfull. Some understand by Sauls wives, not his wedded wives, but other Ladies of honour] besides thy Lords wives [not that God approved of the plurality of wives, but tolerated or suffered it in the old Testament, without punishing the same] into thy besome [see Gen.16.5. Deut.13.on v.6. Others understand, into thy bosome, that is, into thy power: yet so, as that he might not abuse them against the Law of God. Compare 1 Sam, 24.11.] yea I gave thee the house of Israel and of Juda, [i.e. the Kingdom of all my people] and if it be little, I would do moreover such and such (things) for thee, [or if (this haf seemed too) little (for the), I would moreover have done such and such (things) for thee. Heb. as, or, according to those and according to these things. Intimating that God who had done him so much good, was able further to provide for him according to his own hearts desire, if any thing should be lacking unto him: So that he had no cause at all to provoke his so good and gracious God in such a manner as he had done; and to satisfy his wicked and sinful by such base and shameful means.]
\p
\v 9 . Wherefore (then) hast thou despised the word of the LORD, [viz. the sixth, seventh and eighth commandement of the Law of the Lord] doing that which is evil in his eyes? Thou hast smitten Uria the Hethite with the Sword, [procuring him by Joabs means, to be slain by the Ammonites, as in the following words is declared. See above chap.11.14, 15, 16, 17.] and thou hast taken thee his wife to wife: and thou hast slain him with the Sword of the children of Ammon. [which were uncircumcised, and Enemies of God and his people.]
\p
\v 10 . Now then the Sword shall not depart from thine house for ever; [i.e. in a long time, or all thy life time, as 1 Sam,1.on v.22. See also Deu.15.on v.17.] because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uria the Hethite (to be) thy wife.
\p
\v 11 . Thus saith the LORD, behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine (own) house, [Meaning by David’s own sons, Ammon, Absalom and Adonia, as in the following chapters, and 1 Kings 1. is related . By their wickedness did God, in his just and unrebukable judgement, severely punish and chasten David for his sins. See on the following verse] and will take thy wives before to hear and believe it to thy grief and sorrow of heart, as if thou hadst beheld it with thine own eyes, aswell as all Israel. See below chap.16.22.] and will give them unto thy neighbour: [namely, Absolom] he shall lie with thy wives before the eyes of this Sun, [i.e. in broad day-light, evening while the Sun shineth. Thus often mention is made of these creatures, as if they had hearing, sight and understanding. See Deu.32.on v.1.]
\p
\v 12 . For thou didst it secretly; but I will do this thing take David’s wives, and give them unto Absalom, etc. Is God then the Author of Absaloms abominable sins? God forbid. Yet he faith here expressly, that he will do this thing, etc. Did he then not pour this sin and wickedness into Absalom. But he so ruled and ordered Absaloms, Achitophels, and the divers wilfull wickedness, (which they had of themselves) by his holy providence, that they practised and used the same to David’s grief and sorrow, which so little favoureth the Devil, Absalom, and Achitophel (who sought to fulfil their own hatred and wicked lusts) as Gods counsel of delivering up to death his well beloved Son for our salvation, did or could favour Judas the traitor, the Jews and Pilate. The work of Absalom, &c is wicked and devilish, but the work of God is holy and good: for he intended to chasten his servant David by evil instruments for his own glory and David’s good, to discover Absaloms and Achitophels wickedness, and to punish the same to the glory of his own righteousness. The holy Scripture every where aboundeth with such examples of Gods over-ruling providence in and concerning evil. And this David knew and Acknowledged full well, and therefore did heartily humble himself before God. See Gen.45.on v.5.] before all Israel, and before the Sun.
\p
\v 13 . Then said David unto Nathan; I have sinned against the LORD; [See the declaration of this confession in the 51. Psalm] And Nathan said unto David; the LORD hath also taken away [Heb. caused to pass over, pass thorow, pass by, i.e. forgiven, pardoned, remitted. So below chap.24.10. Job 7.21. Compare Mich. 7.18. and 1 Chron.21.8. Prov.19.11. Amos 7.8. Zach.3.4.] thy sin, thou shalt not die. [i.e. I will not punish thee with death for this sin, either temporally, or eternally, although thou hast well deserved it, according to thine own sentence, v.5. and my justice.]
\p
\v 14 . Yet, because by this thing thou hast caused the Enemy of the LORD greatly to blasphem, [Heb. blaspheming hast caused to blasphem. First, the Ammonites, who having slain Uria and others of thy servants, have praised their Gods, after the manner of the heathen, and blasphemed the God of Israel, as void of power; and in the second place, generally all Enemies round about, who speak evil of God and his people, making much of such a King, who commited such soul acts upon his good subjects. Or thou hast given them occasion to speak blasphemously, when they shall hear of this, compare Rom.2.24. and elsewhere] also the child that is born unto thee, shall die the death. [Heb. dying die.]
\p
\v 15 . Then Nathan went unto his house; and the LORD smote the child, which the wife of Uria [i.e. which had been Uria’s wife. Compare above chap.2.on v.2.] had born unto David, (so) that it was very sick.
\p
\v 16 . And David sought God for the child: [That is to say in this place, he prayed servently unto God for the child’s health. See 2 Chron.20.3, 4. Psa.27.8. and 34.5. and 77.3. Isa, 26.26. and 31.1. Jer.50.4, etc.] and David fasted a fast, and went in, [i.e. into his inne5r chamber, or closet] and lay all night on the ground. [Heb. he over-nighted, and lay on the ground.]
\p
\v 17 . Then the Eldest of his house [i.e. his chiefest Officers and Courtiers, who in the following verse are called his servants] gat them up to him, to make him rise up from the ground; but he would not, and did eat no bread [see above chap.3.on v.35. and elsewhere often] with them.
\p
\v 18 . And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died: and David’s servanrs feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said; behold, when the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, but he hearkened not to our voice, how shall we then say unto him, the child is dead? For it might hurt. [i.e. this might vex and grieve him yet more then formerly.]
\p
\v 19 . But David saw that his servants whispered; so David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants; Is the child dead? and they said; it is dead.
\p
\v 20 . Then David arose from the ground, and washed, and anointed himself, [See Ruth 3.on ver.3.] and changed his apparel, and went into the house of the LORD, [Meaning the Tent, which David had caused to be made for the Ark; see above chap.6.17.] and worshipped: after that he came into his house, and required (bread), and they set bread [as above ver 7. And in the following verse] before him, and he did eat.
\p
\v 21 . Then said his servants unto him; What thing is this, that thou hast done? For the living child’s sake thou didst fast and weep; but after the child is dead, thou doest rise up and eatest bread.
\p
\v 22 . And he said; When the child yet lived, I fasted and wept: for I said [viz. By my self; I thought] Who knoweth, the LORD might be gracious to me, that the child might remain alive.
\p
\v 23 . But now it is dead, wherefore should I now fast? Shall I be able yet to fetch him again [viz, Into life] I shall indeed go to him, [viz. to the child, to the body into the grave, to the soul into heaven] but he shall not return [into this life] to me.
\p
\v 24 . After that David comforted his wife bathseba, and went in unto her, and lay with her: And she bare a son whose name he called Salomon, [Heb. Schelomoh. This name David gave him according to Gods command. See 1 Chron.22.9.] and the LORD loved him.
\p
\v 25 . And sent forth, [viz. The LORD. Oth. he (viz. David) sent (him) under the hand of Nathan the Prophet, (i.e. to be taught and directed by Nathan in the fear of the Lord) who called his name Jedidjah] by the hand [i.e. by the Ministery] of Nathan the Prophet, and called his name Jedid Jah, [i.e. beloved of the Lord. Heb. Idjide-Jah] for the LORDS sake. [i.e. because the Lord loved him, as is said ver.26. and because he should be a type and figure of the Lord Christ, who is the well beloved Son of God, the builder of his Church, and the right King of peace. See above chap 7.13, &c. 2 Chron.22.9, 10. Psa.45. Canticles, Math.3.17. Luke 1 32, 33. Heb.3.6. Isa.9.5, etc.]
\p
\v 26 . Now Joab warred against Rabba of the children of Ammon: [Here is now prosecuted the History, which was begun above chap.11.] and he took the Royal City. [Heb. the City of the Kingdom. Whereby may be understood that part of the City, where the Kings Court was, which perhaps lay by the water side, or was compassed about with waters. See the following verse.]
\p
\v 27 . Then Joab sent messengers to David, and said; [i.e. Sent him word] I have warred aginst Rabba, I have also taken the Water-city. [See on the former verse.]
\p
\v 28 . Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and besiege the City, and take it; lest if I should take the City, my name be called out upon it. [or, named upon it: i.e. that thou mayest have the honour, and not I, who should have the honour, is they should say, Joab hath taken Rabba.]
\p
\v 29 . Then David gathered all that people [i.e. The rest of the people, as was said in the former verse] together, and marched to Rabba: and he warred against it, and took it.
\p
\v 30 . And he took their Kings Crown from off his head, the weight [Oth. price, value, worth,] whereof was a talent of gold, [See Exod.25.on ver.39. a civil talent amounted to threescore and two pound and an half, the pound consisting of twelve ounces, which maketh six and fourty pounds (each pound consisting of sixteen ounces, haver de pois) and fourteen ounces] with precious stones, and it was (set) upon David’s head: he carried also a very great booty out of the City.
\p
\v 31 . Now he brought forth the people, [Meaning as many of them as were needful to be exposed to exemplary punishment. Below chap.17.27. mention is made of one Sobi, whom some conceive to have been the King of also crowned King by David in Hanun his brothers stead] and he put them under saws, and under iron harrows, and under iron axes, [i.e. he called them to be sawed a sunder, to be brused in pieces (like corn) with iron-harrows, or threshing-catts tackt together, and to be cut in twain with axes, or hatchets] and made them pass thorow the brick-klin: [i.e. to be burnt in brick-klins, or brick-ovens. Oth. thorough the furnace of Malchen, (that is, of Molech) unto which Idol they were wont to offer up their children, causing them to pass thorough the fire. See 2 King.16.3. & 23.10. Item, Levit.18.21. & 20.2, &c. David inflicted these hard and grievous punishments usual and common (as it is conceived in those Eastern Countrys) upon the Ammonites, because they had so basely misconstrued his friendly intent and act, and so disgracefully entreated his Ambassadors against the Law of Nations. See above chapter 10.2, 3, 4. And moreover were abominable Idolaters, Blasphemers, and enemies of God and his people, who without all question had tyrannically inflicted such kinds of deaths upon the people of God. Compare above chap.8 on ver.2. Amos 1.3. & Heb.11.37. and see of the tacked iron harrows, or threshing-carts, Deut.25.on ver.4.]
\c 13
\s Amnon loveth his sister Thamar, and deflowreth her, by means of Jonadabs crafty counsel, but presently driveth her away, ver.1, &c. Which Absalom Thamars own brother, both by father and mother, some two years after, cruelly avengeth, causing his brother Ammon to be treacherously murdered, 23. These things trouble and grieve David exceedingly, 21, 36. Absalom fleeth to Gesur, 37.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after that, Absalom, David’s son, [By Maacha, the daughter of Talmai, King of Gesur, above chap.3.3. By this woman David had also Thamar: Absalom and Tamar, being both born of one father, and of one mother] having a fair sister, whose name was Thamar, that Ammon, David’s son, [by Ahinoam, above chap.3.2.] loved her.
\p
\v 2 . And Amnon was so troubled, that he fell sick for his sister Thamars sake, for she was a virgin; [And consequently so narrowly looked to, that it seemed impossible for Amnon to talk with her in private, and to prevail with her. Compare Prov.30.19.] so as that it was grievous [or, impossible. Heb. properly wonderfull, hidden. Compare Gen.18.14.] in Amnons eyes to do any thing to her.
\p
\v 3 . But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab a son of Simea, [See 1 Sam.16.9. and below chap.21, 21.] David’s brother: and Jonadab was a very wife man, [i.e. in this place, very crafty and cunning, to invent evil counsel, as he here did; whereas he ought rather to have reproved, and disswaded Amnon from this fact; and, if need required, to have told the King of it Compare below chap.14.2. Psal.58.6.]
\p
\v 4 . The same said unto him, Why art thou so lean [Heb. so thin, consumed, wasted away] from morning to morning, [Heb. in the morning, in the morning, or, on the morning, on the morning; i.e. every morning, every morning, every day from day to day. As if he should say, What aileth thee, that thou looketh daily so lean?] thou Kings son, wilt thou not make it known to me? Then Amnon said unto him; I love Thamar, my brother Absaloms Sister.
\p
\v 5 . And Jonadab [Heb Jehonadab] said unto him; Lay thee (down) upon thy bed, and make thy self sick: [Or, feign thy self sick; that is, behave thy self so, as if thou were sick] when therefore thy father shall come to see thee, then thou shalt say unto him; I pray thee, let my sister Thamar come, to feed me with bread, [i.e. as followeth, to dress me some meat, or victuals] and dress the meat before mine eyes, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.
\p
\v 6 . Then Amnon laid himself down, and made himself sick: Now when the King came to see him, Amnon said unto the King; I pray let my sister Thamar come, that she may dress two cakes [or, make pancakes. There be two words in the Hebrew, both derived from one word, which signifieth the heart; as if he should say, heartily make, or, dress heartily (cakes); i.e. bake some cakes (for which the Hebrew word is taken) so, as that the baking and dressing may please me, and cherish my heart, as well as the meat it self] before mine eyes, that I may eat at her hand.
\p
\v 7 . Then David sent home to Thamar, saying: Go thy ways now [i.e. He sent her word] into thy brother Amnons house, and dress him some meat.
\p
\v 8 . And Thamar went her ways into her brother Amnon house, (he was now laid down) [viz. upon his couch, or, bed; as above verse 5.] and she took dough, and kneaded it, and dressed cakes before his eyes, and did bake the cakes.
\p
\v 9 . And she took a pan, and poured them out [Or, shaked them] before his face; but he refused to eat: and Amnon said: Cause all (or, every) man to go forth from me: and all (or, every) man went forth from him.
\p
\v 10 . Then said Amnon unto Thamars; Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand: so Thamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
\p
\v 11 . Now when she brought them nigh unto him to eat, then he took hold of her, and said unto her; Come, lie with me, sister.
\p
\v 12 . But she said unto him; Nay, my brother, do not force [See Gen.34.on ver.7.] me, for thus they do not do in Israel: [being an holy people, and making profession of Piety] do not this folly.
\p
\v 13 . For I, whither should I bring my shame? and thou, thou shouldest be as one of the fools in Israel: now then, I pray thee, speak unto the King; for he will not with-hold me from thee. [‘Tis conceived, that she spake this to get away from Amnon for the present, not doubting but that the King would afterward find out means to hinder such marriage, which was forbidden in the Law of God, Lev.18.9, 11.]
\p
\v 14 . But he would not hearken to her voice; but being stronger then she, he forced her, and lay with her.
\p
\v 15 . After that Amnon hated her with a very great hatred, for the hatred, wherewith he hated her, was greater then the love, wherewith he had loved her: and Amnon said unto her, Go thee up, go away.
\p
\v 16 . Then she said unto him; There be no causes to drive me away; this evil would be greater than the other, which thou didst unto me: [Oth. let there be no causes; that is, give nocause for anew evil to arise, whence more evil would ensue then from the former: for the thing as yet might be kept secret, but if thou doest onely thrust me away from thee with thee with shame and disgrace, Gods name will be blasphemed by enemies, his people offended, thou and I publikely disgrace, the King angered, and my brother Absalom provoked to be avenged on thee for this fact. Unto this request of Thamar, the words following do sitly agree, where Amnon rejecteth her suit] but he would not hearken to her.
\p
\v 17 . And he called his youth that served him, and said; Put now this (woman) [hatefully and shamefully spoken] forth from me, and bolt the door after her.
\p
\v 18 . Now she had a coat on of many colours; [See Gen.37.on ver.3.] for so were the Kings daughters, that were virgins apparelled with mantles: and his servant brought her forth, and bolted the door after her.
\p
\v 19 . Then Thamar took [i.e. She took and cast, and strewed] ashes upon her head, [compare above chap.1.on ver.2.] and rent the coat [see Gen.37.on verse 29.] of many colours, which she hade on: and she laid her hand on her head, [after the manner of mourning women: see Jerem.2.v.37.] and went fast away, [Heb.went going; to wit, to her brother Absalom, as followeth] and cried: [i.e. going and crying. Compare below chap.16.5.]
\p
\v 20 . And her brother Absalom said unto her: Hath Aminon [Some conceive that Absalom here thus changeth his mothers name out of scorn and contempt: for his name was Amnon] thy brother [i.e. half brother: see above on verse 1.] been with thee? then, my sister, hold thy peace, [For the honour of our house] he is thy brother; set not thy heart upon this thing; [i.e. take it not too much to heart, do not vex at it] thus Thamar remained, and was desolate [as being ashamed, shunning the company of men, and being visited by none: or, dismayed in her brother Absaloms house.]
\p
\v 21 . When King David heard all these things, then he kindled greatly. [Heb. it kindled greatly him, viz. anger: see Gen.4.on ver.5.]
\p
\v 22 . But Absalom spake not with Amnon, neither evil or good [Heb. from the evil to the good. Compare Gen.24.50. & 31.24. The meaning is, that although Absalom was exceedingly incensed against Amnon, yet he did not let it appear, but waited for an opportunity of revenge] but Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Thamar.
\p
\v 23 . And it came to pass after two full years, [Heb. two years of days] that Absalom had (sheep) shearers at Baalhazor, [Heb. Baal-Chatsor. Oth. in the level or, plains of Hazor, lying on the borders of Ephraim and Benjamin, where also the City of Ephraim lieth, otherwise called Ephren, as the Maps do shew] which is by Ephraim: so Absalom invited all the Kings sons. [as in those times they were wont to make great feasts at the shearing of sheep. See 1 Sam.25.2, 4. 7.36. & Gen.38.on ver.12.]
\p
\v 24 . And Absalom came to the King, and said; Behold now thy servant hath (sheep-) shearers: let the King, I beseech thee, and his servants, [i.e. Officers, Courtiers] go with thy servant. [i.e. with me]
\p
\v 25 . But the King said unto Absalom; Nay, my son, let us not go now altogether, lest we be burden some to thee: [For the presence of the King, and his Officers, or Courtiers, would have been very chargable and burdensome unto Absalom]: and he [viz. Absalom] was instant with him, howbeit he [viz. the King] would not go, but blessed him. [i.e. wished him all happiness; as above chapter 6, 20, etc.]
\p
\v 26 . Then said Absalom; If not, I pray let my brother Amnon go with us: but the King said unto him, why should he go with thee?
\p
\v 27 . When Absalom was instant with him, then he let Amnon and all the Kings sons go with him.
\p
\v 28 . Now Absalom commanded his youth, saying; Mark now, when Amnons heart is merry [Heb. good. See Judg.16.on ver.25.] of wine, and I shall say unto you, smile Amnon, then ye shall kill him, fear not, because I have commanded you (to do) it? [or, is it not (so) that I have commanded, &c. i.e. ye do it not of your own accord, but by my command and appointment therefore I shall answer for it, and not you: therefore fear not] be strong and be valiant. [Heb. children, or, sons of courage, or, valour. See above chap.3.on v.34.]
\p
\v 29 . And Absaloms youths did unto Amnon according as Absalom had commanded: then all the Kings sons arose, and rode every one upon his Mule, and fled.
\p
\v 30 . And it came to pass, when they were upon that way, that the rumour came to David, that they said Absalom hath smitten all the Kings sons, and there is not one of them left.
\p
\v 31 . Then the King arose, and rent his garments, [As above chap.12.16.] likewise all his servants stood with rent garments. [or, all his servants, that stood there, had rent garments, or, all his servants, that stood there, rent (their) clothes. Heb. were rent in clothes.]
\p
\v 32 . But Jonadab, the son of Simea, [See above vers.3.] David’s brother answered, [i.e. spake, began to speak. See Judg.18.on ver.14.] and said; Let not my Lord say, [viz. with himself; i.e. let him not think, imagine] that they have slain all the young men, the Kings sons; for Amnon onely is dead: for it was intended by Absalom, [or, it was done at, or, by Absalom command: or, it was appointed, determined, set on foot by Absaloms command: or, it was an appointment of Absalom. Oth. by Absaloms mouth; i.e. word, saying, or, command] from the day that he forced his sister Thamar.
\p
\v 33 . Now therefore let not my Lord the King take [Heb. lay, put, set,] the thing into his heart, thinking; [Heb. saying, to wit, by himself; i.e. thinking; as verse 32.] all the Kings sons are dead: for Amnon onely is dead.
\p
\v 34 . Now Absalom fled; and the youth that kept the Watch, [And when he perceived any thing, gave a token thereof with the Trumpet, or came and told it, or told him that asked him, that which he saw,] lift up his eyes, and looked; and behold, there came much people by the way, on the side of the hill behind him. [viz. Absalom, who was gone that way to Baal-hazor, and now fled thence to Geissur.]
\p
\v 35 . Then said Jonadab unto the King: Behold, the Kings sons come; according to the word of thy servant, so it come to pass. [i.e. As I said, so it is. See verse 32.]
\p
\v 36 . And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, behold, then came he Kings sons, and lift up their voices, and wept: and that King also, and all his servants, wept a very great weeping.
\p
\v 37 . (Absalom then fled, and went to Thalmai, the son of Ammichur, [Heb. Ammichur. This Thalmai was Absaloms Grandfather by the Mother side. See above chap.3.3.] King of Gesur:) [See above chap.3.on verse 3. and below chap.15.8.] and he [viz. David] mourned for his son, all those days. [i.e. many days, viz. the three years that Absalom was at Gesur, as followeth. For after that the King left mourning. Oth. this is generally understood of all the days of (his) life; which words of (his) life, are oftentimes added thereunto.]
\p
\v 38 . So Absalom fled, and went to Gesur, and he was there three years.
\p
\v 39 . Then the (soul) of King David lingered [Or, fainted, was consumed. Item, the desire of lusting or, longing consumed David. The Hebrew word is put in the feminine gender, so that it agreeth not to David, but rather to his soul: which word is here inserted out of Psal.84.3. & 119.81. where the like phrase is found thus full and entire. See also Job 19.on v.27.] exceedingly to go forth unto Absalom: [This may be understood of causing to go forth, that is, to send some body forth to bring Absalom back again] for he had comforted himself concerning Amnon that he was dead, [i.e. ha had given over, or, laid aside mourning for Amnons death. See gen.37.35. & 38.12.]
\c 14
\s Joab brings Absalom again into favour with David, by means of a wife woman of Thekoa, verse 1, etc. David gives Joab leave to bring Absalom back again to Jerusalem, but will not consent that he should come in to his sight, 21. Absalom's beaty, long hair, and children, 25. At last he compels Joab to get leave for him to come into his father's presence, 29.
\p
\v 1 Now when Joab the son of Zeruja, perceived, that the Kings heart was toward Absalom, [i.e. That his heart was enclined toward him, that he would sain see him brought back again, but that he might want a fit opportunity, or honest pretence, therefore he plotteth or contriveth a cunning way for it, which is mentioned in the sequel.]
\p
\v 2 . Then Joab sent away to Thekoa, [A City lying upon an hill, on the Northen borders of Juda, not far from Jerusalem. See 2 Chron.11.6.] and took thence a wise woman [compare above chap.13.on v.3.] and he said unto her; I pray thee, feign thyself, as if thou didst mourn, and put on now mourning-apparel, and anoint not thy self with oil, [see Ruth 3.on verse 3.] and be as a woman that now hath mourned many days for a dead (person):
\p
\v 3 . And go in unto the King, and speak unto him, according to this word: and Joab put the words into her mouth [i.e. He told her the very words, which she afterwards should utter, or speak to the King. Compare Exod. 4.on v.15.]
\p
\v 4 . And the Thekotish woman said unto the King, when she was fallen on her face to the ground, [In token of humble reverence; as Ruth 2.10. 1 Sam.20.41. & 25.23, 24. Below v 22. 1 King.18.7, etc.] and had bowed her self down: [see Gen.18.on ver.2.] then she said; help [or, deliver, give salvation] O King.
\p
\v 5 . And the King said unto her, What aileth thee? and she said; Surely, I am a widow woman, and my husband is dead.
\p
\v 6 . Now thine hand-maid had two sons, and these both strove (together) in the field, and there was no Parter, [Deliverer: and consequently none could witness of the case of the offence was. See Deut.19.15, &c.] between them; so the one smote the other, and killed him.
\p
\v 7 . And behold, the whole family is risen against thine hand-maid, [To execute the Law of revenge of bloud against the slayer. See Numb.35.19. Deut.19.12.] and have said; Deliver here him, that hath smitten his brother, that we may put him to death for the soul [i.e. life, or person] of his brother, whom he hath slain, and destroy the heir also: thus shall they quench my cole that is left, [i.e. put mine onely son that is left to death, whereby the family might be planted and preserved, as from a coal a fire may be raised and preserved] that they may leave [Heb. put] mine husband no name nor remainder upon the earth. [Because this son was onely to bear his fathers name, and to be their heir. See Deuteronomy 25.6. Ruth 4.5, 10.]
\p
\v 8 . Then said the King unto this woman; Go to thine house, and I will give charge for thee [Over thee, or, about thee, concerning thee. The meaning is, I will give charge, that no hurt come to thy son. Or, (as some would have it) I will cause the matter to be examined by Judges.]
\p
\v 9 . And the Thekotish woman said unto the King: My Lord (O) King the iniquity, [If there may be any in this sentence of thine] be on me, [i.e. I take the same upon me, as being assured of my sons innocency, or the equity of thy sentence] and on my fathers house: on the contrary, the King and his throne be guiltless.
\p
\v 10 . And the King said; If any man speak against thee, then bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more. [Heb. not add, or, proceed to touch thee; i.e. To vex thee, trouble thee, molest thee.]
\p
\v 11 . And she said, I pray let the King remember the LORD thy [i.e. His] God, [It seemeth, that she looks at the Law given by God, Numb.35.11, 12. Some conceive, that by these words she requireth an Oath of the King. Others, that she looketh on the example of Kain that murdered his brother, whom God spread] that the revenge of blood may not be multiplied to destroy, lest they destroy my son: [The meaning is, seeing there be many next Kinsmen and avengers of blood, it would be requisite, that the King should not onely give charge to one, but to all: Otherwise one or other having received no charge to the contrary, might easily slay my son] then said he; (As true as) the LORD liveth. [Understand withal; I which also do that which I have said] If there shall one of the hairs of thy son fall on the earth. [Understand withal: Then let God do this and that to me. See of such kind of Oath, Gen.14.on ver.23. The meaning of the words is this, as if David had said, I will take order, that thy son shall not be damnified in the least. See 1 Sam.14.45. 1 King.1.52. Act.27.34. & compare Mat.10.30.]
\p
\v 12 . Then said this woman; I pray let thine handmaid speak one word unto my LORD the King: and he said speak (on.)
\p
\v 13 . And the woman said; Wherefore then hast thou thought such a (thing) [viz. Which thou hast but even now condemned in the sentence thou passedst; as being unjust and unbeseeming] against the people of God? [which long for Absaloms return, that he may join for their good in his old fathers stead] for thence, that the King hath spoken this word, [i.e. the former speech or sentence in my sons case] he is a guilty (person), seeing the King doth not fetch back again his banished. [namely, Absalom, whose case (she would say) is like her sons case: although there was great difference between both, in that Absalom had not slain his brother in the fight , nor unawares, but had caused him to be treacherously murdered: see above chap.13.28.]
\p
\v 14 . For we shall die the death [Heb. dying die: to wit, if Absalom return not. Others understand this and the words following, of the natural death; as if he had said, Do not hasten Absaloms death, he will yet die soon enough, as all of us must die once, and not rise again till the last day] and be as water, which being poured forth on the ground, is not gathered up again: [i.e. cannot be brought together again, when it is once poured forth on the ground] God then [For his peoples sake, lest being deprived of Absalom, we should after thy death be without an head and Protector, and become a prey unto our enemies] will not take away the soul, [or, hath not taken away (his) soul; i.e. Absaloms life. Oth. and God will not accept any person; viz. that any man should avoid death] but he will think thoughts, [i.e. and he (to wit, the King) will think thoughts, &c. devise, or find out means, order the matter, meaning, so as that after his death the Kingdom may be provided of a successor] so as not to expel the expelled [viz. Absalom] from him. [so that he should not return to Gods people.]
\p
\v 15 . Now then, that I am come, to speak this word unto my Lord the King (is) because the people [Speaking daily in the former verse is related, for fear that Absalom should tarry quite away] made me afraid: so thine hand-maid said; [viz. by her self; i.e. thought: so ver.17.] I will now speak unto King; peradventure the King will perform the word [i.e. the counsel, advise, fore-cast] of his hand maid.
\p
\v 16 . For the King will hear, to deliver his hand-maid out of the hand of the man (that intendeth) to destroy me and my son together from Gods inheritance. [i.e. from Gods people, they being s dear unto him, as any mans inheritance can be unto him: and consequently in like manner must do to his son Absalom, in regard of the likeness of both these cases.]
\p
\v 17 . Moreover thine hand-maid said; [i.e. Thought as v.15.] the word [i.e. the sentence, the judgement passed] of my Lord, the King be for rest; [spoken in a desiring, or, wishing manner: or, shall now be for rest; i.e. shall serve for comfort and rest; not onely to me and my son, but also unto Absalom, the King himself, and all the people, that long for Absalom] for as an Angel of God, [so wise, as, &c. see v.24.] so is my Lord the King, to hear good and bad; [i.e. to understand, to discern, to judge what is good, or what is bad: so below chap.19.27.] and the LORD thy God will be with thee. [or, be with thee]
\p
\v 18 . Then the King answered, and said unto the woman; Hide not now the thing from me, which I shall ask thee: and the woman said; Let my Lord the King speak, I pray.
\p
\v 19 . And the King said; Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? [i.e. Doest thou not all this by Joabs order and direction] and the woman answered, and said; (As true as) thy soul liveth, my LORD (the) King. If any man could turn away to the right hand, or to the left, from all that the King hath spoken; [Oth. If there be (any) turning away to the right hand, or to the left, etc, Intimating, that it was impossible to cousin the King with liars, seeing he straightway perceiveth the meaning of the thing] for thy servant Joab he bade me (do) it, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine hand-maid: [as above v.3.]
\p
\v 20 . That I should thus turn about the form [Heb. face] of this thing, [first speak of mine own case, and having had the Kings sentence or judgment passed upon it, then fetch the matter about, and apply it to Absalom] thy servant Joab hath done this: but my Lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an Angel of God [as above vers.17.] to perceive all, that is upon the Earth. [or, (that happeneth or passeth) in this land.]
\p
\v 21 . Then the King said unto Joab; behold now, I have done this thing: [I have granted the request, which thou hast made unto me by the woman of Thekoa: Or, thou hast done this thing; that is, so ordered or managed it] Go thee thy ways, fetch the young man [Heb. Lad: although he was a man. See of the Hebrew word Gen.22.on ver.5.] Absalom again.
\p
\v 22 . Then Joab fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself, and humbled [Heb. blessed] the King: and Joab said; to day thy servant [i.e. I] hath perceived, that I have found grave in thine eyes, my LORD, (O) King, because the King hath done that word [i.e. the request, the counsel, advice] of his servant. [oth. of thy servant.]
\p
\v 23 . So Joab gat him up, and went to Gesur: [See above chap.3.on v.3. and chap.13.37.] and he brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 24 . And the King said; let him [viz. Absalom] turn to his (own) house, and let him not see my face [see Gen.43.on v.3. This served partly to put Absalom the more in mind of his fault, and partly to avoid the offence and trouble that might have risen among the godly, and the Kings children, if Absalom had been straightway put again into equal degree with his brethren] so Absalom turned into his own house, and saw not the Kings face.
\p
\v 25 . Now in all Israel there was no man so beautiful, as Absalom, much to be praised: from the sole of his foot unto the crown of his head there was no default in him.
\p
\v 26 . And when he shaved [i.e. caused to be shaved or shorn, and so in the following words] his head, (now it happened at the end of every year [Heb. from the days to the days; i.e. from year to year, or every year. See Lev.25.on v.29.] that he shaved it: because it was too heavy for him, therefore he shaved it;) then the hair of his head weighed two hundred shekels, according to the Kings weight. [i.e. according to the common civil shekel, and not the shekel of the sanctuary. See Gen.20.on v.16. Heb. according to the Kings stone, i.e. according to the Royal weight. See Lev.19.on v.36. and Deut.25.13.]
\p
\v 27 . Also unto Absalom (there) were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Thamar: this was a woman fair of countenance,
\p
\v 28 . Thus Absalom remained two full years [Heb. two full years of days. See Gen.41.on v.1.] at Jerusalem, then he saw not the Kings face.
\p
\v 29 . Therefore Absalom sent unto Joab, to send him to the King, but he would not come to him: so he sent again the second time, nevertheless he would not come.
\p
\v 30 . Then he [viz.Absalom] said unto his servant; behold the parcel of Joabs Field is at the side of mine, [Heb. at rain hand, i.e. side. The meaning is, at the side of my field] and he hath barley upon it; go your ways, and set nit on fire: and Absaloms servants set that part of the field on fire.
\p
\v 31 . Then Joab gat him up, and came to Absalom into the house, and said unto him; why have thy servants set the parcel of the field, which is mine, on fire.
\p
\v 32 . And Absalom said unto Joab; behold, I sent unto thee, saying; come hither, that I may send thee to the King, to say; wherefore am I come from Gesur? it were Good for me, that I were there still: now then let me see the Kings face: [Absalom speaketh this now unto Joab] and if there be any fault in me, then let him kill me, [he speaketh so boldly, because he well knew the Kings gracious goodness.]
\p
\v 33 . Then Joab went in unto the King, and acquainted him with it; [viz. that which Absalom had given in charge] then he called for Absalom, and he came in unto the King, and bowed himself before him on his face to the ground, before the Kings face: and the King kissed Absalom. [in token of perfect reconciliation and favour. Compare gen.27.on v.26.]
\c 15
\s Absalom having stolen the hearts of the people by subtitle practises, ver.2. &c. goeth under pretence of a vow, with his fathers leave, to Hebron; but maketh there, with Achitophels aid, a great conspiracy, aspiring to be King, 7. David hearing thereof, flyeth in haste with all his men out of Jerusalem, leaving there only some of his concubines, 13.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after that, that Absalom caused to be prepared for him a charet and horse; and fifty men running along before his face, [which were his footmen, life-guard, pages, lackeys, &c, as 1 Kings 1.5. See also 1 Sam.8.11. Thus Absalom assayed to put himself in a new kind of way, to make the people believe, that he carried himself as the heir apparent to the crown: Ammon the first born being dead, and perhaps Chilead, the second son likewise, or at least of no account. It’s possible also, that he intended hereby to prevent Solomon, of whose succession (it may be) he had understood Gods counsel, and his fathers intent and purpose.]
\p
\v 2 . Also Absalom got him up early in the morning, and stood beside the way of the gate: [Of the Kings court] and it came to pass, that Absalom called all (or every) man, that had a controversy, to come to the King for judgement, unto him, and said; of what city art thou? when he then said; thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel; [i.e. of this or that city, lying in this or that tribe.]
\p
\v 3 . Then said Absalom unto him; behold, thy matters are good and right, [Or consinder thy matters, they are good and right][ but thou hast no hearer (deputed) of the King. [i.e. there is no man deputed or appointed of the King, to examine thy cause duely, and to help thee to right.]
\p
\v 4 . Moreover Absalom said; O that they would appoint me Judge in the Land, [Heb. who will make me, etc. A manner of wishing. Compare Judg.9.on v.29.] that all (or every) man, which hath a suit or cause might come unto me, that I might do him justice.
\p
\v 5 . Also it came to pass, when any man drew near, to bow himself before him, then he reached forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.
\p
\v 6 . And according to that manner [Hebr. According to this word, or according to this thing, i.e. thus on this manner] did Absalom to all Jerusalem, that came to the King for Judgement: thus Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel. [i.e. he won and drew to him the affection of the Israelites. Compare Gen.31.on vers.20.]
\p
\v 7 . Now it came to pass at the end of fourty years, [How or from whence these fourty years are to be counted, is very uncertain, seeing the Holy Scripture maketh no mention of it, and divers opinions there are touching the same] that Absalom said unto the King, I pray thee let me go my ways, and pay my vow, [he covereth his mischievous conspiracy with a shew of holiness, to deceive his Father, and to hide his ambition from the common people] which I have vowed unto the LORD, at Hebron. [a place very well known in Israel by reason of many remarkeable things. See Gen.32.2. above chap.2.4. and 5.1, &c.]
\p
\v 8 . For thy servant [i.e. I] hath vowed a vow, when I dwelt at Geshur [see above chap.13.37, 38.] in Syria; saying; If the LORD shall surely bring me again, [Heb. bringing again shall bring again] then I will serve the Lord. [i.e. perform a special service unto God, in offerings, and praising God for his mercy shewed to me, as my vow importeth.]
\p
\v 9 . Then said the King unto him; go in peace; so Absalom gat him up, and went to Hebron.
\p
\v 10 . Now Absalom had sent forth spies [To prepare and encourage the people that were enclined to Absalom, v.2. to fall off from David, and to follow Absalom] to say: when ye shall hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom is King [or reigneth] at Hebron.
\p
\v 11 . And there went with Absalom out of Jerusalem two hundred men, being invited [To be present at Absaloms feast of thanksgiving, without being in the least privy to his conspiracy, as followeth] but going in their simplicity; for they knew not (of) any thing.
\p
\v 12 . Absalom sent also Achitophel the Gilmite, David’s counsellor out of his city, (to fetch him) out of Cilo, [A city in Juda, Jos.15.51.] when he offered offering: And the combination grew strong, and the people went, and increased with Absalom.
\p
\v 13 . There came also a messenger unto David, saying; The heart of every one in Israel (followeth) after Absalom.
\p
\v 14 . Then David said unto all his servants, that were with him at Jerusalem; get ye up, and let us flee, for there will be no escaping for us from Absaloms face: [If we should tarry long here, he will surprise us? we shall not be able to escape his hand] make hast to depart, left peradventure he make hast and overtake us, and bring [Heb. bring on] evil upon us, and smite this city [i.e. the inhabitants of Jerusalem] with the edge [Heb. at the mouth] of the sword.
\p
\v 15 . Then the Kings servants said unto the King; according to all that my Lord the King shall choose, behold, (here) thy servants are. [i.e. we re ready and willing to following thee, and to do what pleaseth thee, what thou commandest. Compare below chap.19.38. and Psa.25 on v.12. See also Gen.22.on ver.3.]
\p
\v 16 . And the King went forth with all his house, on foot: [Heb. upon, or with his feet; and so in the following verse. Compare v.30. Oth. at his feet, i.e. after him] but the King left ten concubines [Heb. ten women, concubines] to keep his house.
\p
\v 17 . Now when the King was gone forth with all the people on foot, then they tarried in a remote place (that was) far off [Heb. in an house (i.e. place) of remoteness. The meaning is, when they were gone a good way of from the city, then they stood still to place themselves in order, and so to march over the brook Kindron.]
\p
\v 18 . And all his servants [i.e. Officers and Courtiers as often] marched on beside him, also all the Crechi, and all the Plethi [his life guard. See 1 King 1 on v.38.] and all the Gethites, six hundred men, which were come on foot [Heb. upon his feet. The meaning is, that every one of them came on foot] from Gath, [see above chap.6.on v.10 and chap 8.on v.1] marched on before the Kings face.
\p
\v 19 . Then the King said unto Ithai the Gethite [The chief Commander of the six hundred men that were come from Gath unto David, who kept Garrison (as some conceive) in the city of Gath, which David had taken from the Philistines. See above chap.8.on v.1. This man was also used by David as a commander, below chap.18. 2.] why shouldest thou also go with us? return, and abide with the King; [viz. Absalom, who was now held by the people to be their King] for thou art a stranger, [so that Absalom can have no cause to subject thee, and consequently thou shalt, with Absaloms leave, have free liberty to return to Gath; whereas thou, abiding with me, wilt hazard thine estate and the people that are with thee] and also thou shalt return to thy place.
\p
\v 20 . Thou camest yesterday, [i.e. lately] and should I lead thee about to day to go with us? seeing I must now go, whither I may go: return, and bring back thy brethren; kindness be with thee. [i.e. the like kindness and faithfulness happen to thee, as thou hast shewed to me. Oth. reward thy brethren, that are with thee, (with) kindness and faithfulness.]
\p
\v 21 . But Ithai answered the King, and said: (as true as) the LORD liveth, and my Lord the king liveth; surely in the place, where my Lord the King shall be, be it for death, be it for life, there also shall thy servant be.
\p
\v 22 . Then said David unto Ithai; come then and pass over: [Over or thorough the brook Kidron, as is related in the sequel] So Ithai, the Gethite, passed over, and all his men, and all the children that were with him.
\p
\v 23 . And all the land [i.e. all the inhabitants of the land, lying about Jerusalem] wept with a loud [Hebr. Great] voice when all the people passed over: [or passed thorough; as some conceived that there were shallow places, where they might pass thorough on foot] the King also passed over the brook Kidron, [running east-ward by Jerusalem, along the foot of the mount of Olives. Our Saviour Jesus Christ himself went also over this brook, when he was to be apprehended and to suffer for us, Jos.18.1.] and all the people passed over straight toward the way [Heb. toward the face of the way] of the wilderness. [Lying between Jerusalem and the Jordan, otherwise also called the plain field. See below v.28. and ch.16.2. and 17.16. Item above chap.29.]
\p
\v 24 . And so, Zadok [See above chap.8.on v.17.] was there also, and all the Levites with him, bearing the Ark of the covenant of God, and they set down the Ark, and Abjathar [see of this man, 1 Sam.22 20 &c. and 30.7, 8. below chap 28.25. 1 Kings 1.7. and 2.26, 27.] went up, [it may be, to spy from the top of the mount of Olives, when all the people that followed David out of Jerusalem, were passed over the brook Kidron and that there were none more to be expected. Compare Jos.3.17.] until all the people of the city had made an end of passing over.
\p
\v 25 . Then the King said unto Zadok; bring back the Ark of God into the carry if I shall find grace in the eyes of the Lord, then he will bring me back again, and will let me see it, together with his habitation. [Oth. with her habitation, namely, the Arks. Understand the Tabernacle, wherein the Ark was placed at that time, and consequently where God in a special manner was present with his grace. See above chap.6.17.]
\p
\v 26 . But if he shall say thus, I have no delight in thee, behold, (there) am I, [See Gen.22.on v.3.] let him do so as it is good in his eyes. [i.e. so as it shall please, or seem good unto him. As if he had said; if on the contrary it please him to chastise me further, I am ready to submit to his will.]
\p
\v 27 . Moreover the King said unto Zadok the Priest; art not thou a Seer? [i.e. a Teacher, that must look to the people? Oth. thou art the Seer, i.e. as a Prophet: (See 1 Sam.9.9.) because he enquired of the Lord by Urim and Thummim, and received answer from him: it may be also that he was a Prophet besides. Some take it thus: seest thou not, viz. how affairs go, and what is needful] return into the city in peace: also both your sons, Ahimaaz, thy son, and Jonathan, Abjathars son.
\p
\v 28 . Behold, I will tarry in the plain fields of the wilderness, until there come a word [i.e. some intelligence of what happeneth at Jerusalem, or is attempted by Absalom] from you, to be certified to me.
\p
\v 29 . So Zadok and Abjathar brought the Ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.
\p
\v 30 . And David went up to the ascent of the Olives [That stood in great quantities upon the mount of Olives] going up and weeping, and his head was wound about, and he himself went bare-foot, [these were tokens of mourning, shame and humiliation. See also of covering the head, below chap.19.4. Esih.6. 12. Jer.14.3, 4. and chap.31.15. and of going bare-foot, or unshod, Isa.20.2, 3, 4. Jer.2.25.] and all the people that was him, had every man his head covered, and went up, going up and weeping.
\p
\v 31 . Then they told David, saying; [Oth. then David declared, saying] Achitophel is among those, that have conspired with Absalom: therefore David said; O Lord I pray turn the counsel of Achitophel into foolishness [Heb. make foolish, besot. Compare below chap.16. 23.]
\p
\v 32 . And it came to pass, when David came to the top, [viz. of the mount of Olives, from whence he might behold the city, and the habitation of the Lord, wherein the Ark (a type of the Messiah Jesus Christ) abode, and whither Believers of the Old Testament, being absent or banishment, were wont to direct their faces in praying, in token that they grounded their prayers on the merits of the Messiah. Compare 1 Kings 8.44, 48. Dan.6.10.] that he worshipped God there, behold, then Husai, the Archite, met him, having his coat rent, and Earth upon his head. [see chap.1.on v.2.]
\p
\v 33 . And David said unto him, if thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me. [Heb. be a burden upon me.]
\p
\v 34 . But if thou return into the city, and say unto Absalom; thy servant, [An Abrupt speech, as we now also use to say, for I am thy servant, I will be thy servant] I will be the Kings: I have been indeed thy Fathers servant heretofore, [Heb. from that time] but now I will be thy servant: [oth. O king: I will be thy servant, as I have been formerly thy fathers, so will I now be thy servant] then thou shalt defeat for me the counsel of Achitophel.
\p
\v 35 . And are not there with thee Zadok and Abjathar the Priests? [i.e. they are surely there. Of such kind of questions see Judg.4.on v.6. and elsewhere often] So therefore it shall come to pass, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the Kings house, thou shalt make known to Zadok and Abjathar the Priests.
\p
\v 36 . Behold, both their sons are there with them, Ahimaaz Zadocks (son), and Jonathan Abjuthars (son): so by their hand [i.e. ministry] ye shall send to me what thing soever ye shall hear.
\p
\v 37 . So Husai David’s friend, came into the city; And Absalom came to Jerusalem.
\c 16
\s Ziba by presents and false information, getteth of David all his master Mephiboseths estate. v. 1, &c. since revileth and curseth David, 5. Abisai would revenge it but David taketh it very patiently, 9. Absalom cometh with Achitophel to Jerusalem, 15. Husai complyeth prudently with Absalom, and Absalom lyeth with his Fathers concubines, in the sight of all Israel, according to Achitophels counsel, 20. which in those days was highly esteemed, 23.
\p
\v 1 Now when David was a little past the top, [Of the mount of Olives] behold, then Ziba met him, Mephiphoseths lad, [i.e. servant or minister. See of this man above chap.9.2. &c.] with a couple of sadled [oth. girt, or loaden] asses, and upon them two hundred (loaves of) bread, with an hundred pieces pf raisors, and an hundred (pieces) of summer-fruits; and a lether-sack of wine.
\p
\v 2 . And the King said unto Ziba; what wilt thou (do) with these? [Heb. what (shall) they (do) to thee] And Ziba said; the asses are the Kings house to ride on, [there being some women, and also friends and courtiers of the King besides the King himself, that went on foot, above chap.15.16, 17, 30.] and he bread, and the summer-fruits, for the youths to eat, and the wine, that those that be faint in the wilderness [see above ch.15.on v.23. and below chap.17.29.] may drink.
\p
\v 3 . Then said the King where is then thy Lords [viz. Jonathans] son? [viz. Mephiboseth] and Ziba said unto the King, behold, he abideth at Jerusalem, for he said; to day shall the house of Israel restore me the Kingdom of my Father. [a shamefull disloyalty to word his Lord with a bold lie, which David, without further search or inquiry, too soon believed. See above chap.19.26, 27.]
\p
\v 4 . Then said the King unto Ziba; behold, all that Mephiboseth hath: [see above chap.9.7, 9.] shall be thine [a rash judgement of so wise a King. See below chap.19.27, &c.] and Ziba said; I bow my self down, [in token of reverence and thankfulness, as above chap.14.22. This was all that Ziba aim’d at, to make David’s necessity serve his own particular profit] let me find grace in thine eyes, my Lord, (O) King.
\p
\v 5 . Now when King David came to Bahurim; [See above chap 3.on v.16. and below chap.19.16.] behold, there came thence out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Simei, [Heb. Schimi] the son of Gera; he went still on, and cursed. [Heb. he went, or came forth, going forth, or coming forth, and cursed, i.e. going and cursing. Compare above chap.13.19. and below v.13.]
\p
\v 6 . And he cast stones at David; and likewise at all the servants of King David: although all the people, and all the champions were at his right hand and on his left. [He attempted so bold a fact, not withstanding that all these marched by David’s side.]
\p
\v 7 . Now thus said Simei in his cursing: [Or when, or while he cursed him, to wit, David] come out, come out, thou man of blood, [Heb. man of bloods, i.e. thou murderer, thou blood-thirsty person, see Psa.5.on v.7.] and thou man of Belial. [see Deut.13.on v.13.]
\p
\v 8 . The Lord hath caused to return upon thee all the blood [See Judg.9.on v.24.] of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned: [he reviles David, as the Author of Abners and Isboseths murder, intimating, that by that means David came to the Crown & Kingdom of all Israel] now the Lord hath delivered the Kingdom into the hand of Absalom, thy son: behold, now thou art in thy mischief, [Heb. evil, i.e. misery, punishment of thy sins] because thou art a man of blood.
\p
\v 9 . Then said Abisai, the son of Zeruja, unto the King, why should this dead dog [see above chap.9. on v.8.] curse my Lord the King? Let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.
\p
\v 10 . But the King said; what have I to do with you, [Heb. what (is) to me and to you? Or what have I and ye? viz. to do one with another. As if he had said: why do ye always vex me with your wrath and hastiness, whereby ye are prone to be straightway smitten with the sword. So below chap.9.22. and Judg.11.12, &c.] the sons of Zeruja? yea, let him curse; for the LORD hath now said unto him, curse David: [understand this not properly, as if God had commanded it either outwardly by his word, or inwardly by his holy Spirit: but by comparison from the secret guidance and providence of God, whereby he delivered up this same Simei unto Satan, and to his own wicked lusts, and so over-ruled his wickedness, which he had of and from himself , that he now exercised it against David, to chastice and humible him as a gracious and loving father, and then justlytp punish Simei’s wickedness. Compare 1 Sam.18.10, 11 1 Kings 22.21, 22. 1 Chron.21.1. and above ch.12.11,12, below chap.24.1.] who shall then say; [viz. unto the Lord. Although God at this time did David no wrong, yet Simei committed a grievous crime, who Judge David to be worthy of punishment. See 1 Kings 2.9.] wherefore hast thou done so?
\p
\v 11 . Moreover, David said to Abisai, and to all his servants; behold, my son which came forth of my body, seeketh my soul; [i.e. hunteth after my life. See above chap.4.on v.8.] how much more then this son of Jemini? [i.e. this Benjamite, as Judg.19.16 Simei was of Sauls family, above v.5. and Saul was of the tribe of Benjamin. See above chap.3.on v.19.] and below chap.19 16.] let him alone, let him curse, for the LORD hath said it to him. [see on the former verse.]
\p
\v 12 . It may be the LORD will look on my misery: [Oth. mine eye, i.e. my tears] and the LORD will recompense good unto me, for his curse, this day. [i.e. wherewith Simei curseth me this day, or it may be God will also even this very day allot me out some good for this curse.]
\p
\v 13 . So David with his men went on the way: and Simei went on [Heb. went, going] along the bills side over against him, [viz. David] and cursed, and threw with stones from over against him, [or at him] and dusted with dust. [i.e. he raised dust and kick it up, and cast it upon David and his men: or he threw lumps or pieces of Earth, so that David and his men were all bedusted with it.]
\p
\v 14 . And the King came in, and all the people that were with him, being weary: and he refreshed himself there.
\p
\v 15 . Now Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Achitophel with him. [viz. Absalom.]
\p
\v 16 . And it came to pass, when Husai, the Archite, David’s friend came to Absalom, that Husai had said unto Absalom; let the King live, let the King live. [i.e. I wish the King health and happiness with a long life.]
\p
\v 17 . But Absalom said unto Husai; is this thy kindness tp thy friend? Why wentest thou not with thy friend.
\p
\v 18 . And Husai said unto Absalom; nay, but whom the Lord chuseth, and all this people, and all the men of Israel, his will I be, and with him will I abide.
\p
\v 19 . And again, whom shall I serve? Should I not be before the face of his [viz. David’s] son? according as I have served before thy Fathers face, so will I be before thy face.
\p
\v 20 . Then said Absalom to Achitophel? Give counsel among you, what shall we do?
\p
\v 21 . And Achitophel said unto Absalom: go in unto thy Fathers concubines, [i.e. lie with them, see Gen.6.on v.4.] which he hath left to keep the house: then all Israel shall hear, that thou art become stinking before thy Father, [see Gen.34.on v.30. i.e. hearing that, they will understand and perceive, that thou goest in good earnest against thy father, and carest not for him, so that they need not fear that thou wilt be reconciled to thy father, and they then be in danger of punishment] and the hands of all that are with thee shall be strengthened. [i.e. they will take heart and courage, to go on stoutly and without fear with thee against thy father. As on the contrary, the hands growing slack, signifieth to lose all courage and valour. See above chap.4. 1.]
\p
\v 22 . So they spread Absalom a tent upon the roof: [See Deu.22.on v.8. and above chap.11.2.] And Absalom went in unto his fathers concubines, before the eyes of all Israel. [without either shame or fear of God or men did he follow this shamefulness and detestable counsel, because it proceeded from Achitophel, whose counsel was so highly esteemed, as followeth. And thus is that fulfilled which God had foretold David by Nathan, above chap.12.11, 12.]
\p
\v 23 . And the counsel of Achitophel, which he had counselled in those days, was as if they enquired at the word of God; [i.e. so much and so highly esteemed, as if the counsel came from God himself. So that David had cause enough to pray unto God, as he did above ch.15.31. Now how God heard David, and commended. Both Achitophel and his counsel, see thereof in the following chapter.]
\c 17
\s Achitophels counsel to invade David with all speed, is by Gods disposal rejected, and Husai’s counsel followed v.1. &c. Husai certifieth David thereof, and adviseth him forthwith to march on, 15. So David passeth over Jordan, 22. Achitophel taketh this so to heart, that he hangeth himself, 23. David cometh to Mahanaim, and Absalom passeth over Jordan , making Amasa his commander in chief, 24. David’s good friends furnish him at Mahanaim with all kinds of necessities, 27.
\p
\v 1 Moreover Achitophel said unto Absalom: let me now chuse out twelve thousand men, that I may get me up, and pursue after David this night.
\p
\v 2 . So I will come upon him, where he is weary and feeble of hands [See above chap.4.on v.1.] and will make him afraid, and all the people that are with him shall flee: then will I smite the King only.
\p
\v 3 . And I will cause all the people to return unto thee, the man whom thou sleekest, is as the returning of all; so all the people shall be in peace. [Heb. shall be peace. Compare 1 Sam.25.6. below chap.29. Job 21.9, &c. As if he should say, thou only aimest at David; thou wouldst sain draw the people to thee. Now when I shall have made David away, there will be an end of the business, then i’le easily bring the people to thee: yea his death is in every degree the returning of all the people, which will be quiet, and embrace thee for their King, when David is dispatch. Oth. when they all return, (he is yet) the man whom thou sleekest (so) all the people shall be quiet.]
\p
\v 4 . Now this word [Or, this thing, this advice] was right in Absloms eyes, [i.e. pleased Absalom well, seemed to him to be right and good] and in the eyes of all the Eldest of Israel.
\p
\v 5 . But Absalom said; call now Husai the Archite also: and let us hear what he likewise saith. [Heb. what he likewise (hath) in his mouth.]
\p
\v 6 . And when Husai came in to Absalom, then spake Absalom to him, saying; thus [Heb. according to this very word: that is, thus in this very manner] hath Achitophel spoken: [hath he counselled, advised] shall we do his word? If not, speak thou. [give thou also thine advice.]
\p
\v 7 . Then said Husai unto Absalom: the counsel that Achitophel hath counselled at this time, is not good. [As if he had said: he is otherwise a wise counsellours, but herein he hath failed.]
\p
\v 8 . Further Husai said; thou knowest thy Father and his men, that they be champions, that they be bitter of mind, [Heb. soul, as Judg.18.25. i.e. bitterly incensed] as a bear that robbed of (her) whelpes in the field: Besides thy Father is a man of war, and will not overnight with the people. [but sequester himself from them, and hide and secure himself somewhere in some secret and unknown place, as he often did in his banishment in Sauls time.]
\p
\v 9 . Behold, he hath now hid now hid himself in one of the holes, or in one of the places: [Which have been known to him since the days of Saul] And it shall come to pass when there shall fall some among them [i.e. among those that pursue David. Oth. by them, i.e. might be slain by David’s souldiers] at the first, that every that shall hear it, will then say, [Heb. the hearing shall hear, and say] there is a slaughter made among the people which follow Absalom.[Heb. are after Absalom.]
\p
\v 10 . Then should he that is also a valiant man [Heb. a son, or, hild of valour, courage. See above chap.3.on v.34.] so in the following words] whose heart is as the heart of a lion, quite melt: [Heb. melting, melt, i.e. be quite discourage and disheartened. See Duet.1.on v.28.] for all Israel knoweth, that thy father is a champion, and that they are valiant men that are with him.
\p
\v 11 . But I counsel, that all Israel be in all haste gathered [Heb. being gathered be gathered] unto thee, from Dan to Berseba, [the two uttermost borders in the North and South] as the sand that is by the sea in multitude: and that thy person [Heb. face] go along withy them into the battle.
\p
\v 12 . Then we will come to him in one of the places, where he is found, and easily fall upon him, [Or, besiege him, or, be against him] as the dew falleth on the ground: and pf him and of all the men that are with him, there shall not also be left one.
\p
\v 13 . And if he shall get into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will pull it down into the brook, [i.e. into the ditch] until (there) be not also one small stone [viz. lying upon another] found there. [as if he should say, we will easily and wholly destroy the city.]
\p
\v 14 . Then said Absalom, and all (or, every) man of Israel; The counsel of Husai, the Archite, is better then the counsel of Architophel: But the LORD had commanded [i.e. So willed, ordained, appointed, and by his divine providence so ordered and disposed for the good of David: compare above chap.16.10, 11, 12. and see Levit. 25.on ver.21. Amos 6.11. & 9.3. Nahum.1.14. Item, Psal.33.9. & 111.9. & 148.5.] it, to defeat the good counsel of Architophel, [as more useful or serviceable for Absalom, to surprise David, and to give him no breathing time at all: although this counsel in it self was most unjust] that the LORD might bring evil (i.e. the deserved punishment, whereof mention is made in the following chapter] upon Absalom.
\p
\v 15 . And Husai said unto Zadok, and to Abjathar, the Priests; Thus and thus hath Achitophel counselled Absalom, and the Eldest of Israel: but thus and thus have I counselled.
\p
\v 16 . Now then, send away quickly, and tell David, saying; Overnight (or lodge) not this night in the plain fields of the wilderness, and also speedly pass over: [viz. Over the Jordan, as is shewed in the following verses, Heb. passing over pass over] left the King be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.
\p
\v 17 . Now Jonathan and Achimaaz stood by the fountain Rogel; [i.e. They hid themselves there, and waited for tidings, to carry over unto David. See of this place; Jos.15.7, & 18.16.] and a maid servant [that without the least suspicion might be sent to a fountain, to wash something, or to fetch water] went her ways, and told them, and they went their ways, and told King David: [see above ch.15.27, 28.] for they might not be seen to come into the city. [i.e. they durst not come into the city, and then go out again to David, for fear of giving any suspition.]
\p
\v 18 . Nevertheless, a Lad saw them, and told Absalom: But they went both (of them away) quickly, and came into a mans house t Bahurim, which had a well in his court, [meaning an open place by his house] and they went down into it.
\p
\v 19 . And the woman took and spread a covering over the open (place, or mouth) [Heb. face] of the well, and strewed ground corn thereon: Thus the thing was not known.
\p
\v 20 . Now when Absaloms servants came to the woman into the house, they said; Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them; They be gone over that water-brook: [Or, water-ferry] and when they had sought and not found them, they returned to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 21 . And it came to pass, after they [viz. Absaloms servants] were departed: then they came up out of the well, and went their ways, and told it King David: and they said unto David; Get you up, and pass quickly over the water, [viz. the Jordan, as followeth] for thus [as is mentioned above] hath Achitophel counselled against you.
\p
\v 22 . Then David gat him up, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the Jordan: By the morning light there lacked not one, that was not gone over the Jordan. [They all passed over by night, so that by morning there was not one left on the other side.]
\p
\v 23 . Now when Achitophel saw, that his counsel was not done, he sadled the ass, and gat him up, and went to his house into his city [Caled Gilo, above chap 15.12.] and gave command to his house, [or, gave order, put in order, took order, settled his house in order, disposed of it; i.e. his household, goods, or estate: which is as much to say, as he made and declared his last Will and Testament: compare 2 King.20.1. Isa.38.1.] and hanged himself: Thus he died, and was buried in his fathers Sepulchre.
\p
\v 24 . Now David came to Mahanaim: [See above chap.2.on v.8.] and Absalom marched over the Jordan, he, and all the men of Israel with him.
\p
\v 25 . And Absalom had put Amasa over the host in Joabs stead: now Amasa was a mans son, whose name was Jethra, the Israelite, [Heb. Jithra the Israelite, otherwise called Jether, 1 Chron.2.17. where he is called an Ismaelite: From whence is gathered by some, that he was an Ismaelite by descent: but being converted, was embodied with the people of God, and in that regard called an Israelite. Others think that was an Israelite by descent, but that he had dwelt and conversed among the Ismaelites, and from thence likewise was so called] that was gone to Abiga, [i.e. that had lain with her: see Gen.6.on v.4. Abigail. 1 Chron.2.16, 17. she is called Abigail. This woman was David’s sister, as also Zeruja was] the daughter of Nahas, [as some conceive, the wise of Isai, David’s father. Others are of opinion, that Isai himself was otherwise called Nahas. Heb. Nachasch] sister of Zeruja, Joabs mother.
\p
\v 26 . Now Israel and Absalom camped themselves in the Land of Gilead. [Where also Mahanaim lay, to compass David about on all sides, according to Husai’s counsel.]
\p
\v 27 . And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Sebi, [Heb. Schobi. Some conceive that this was a brother of Hanun, whereof mention is made, chap.10.1, &c. and that David having deposed Hanun, or it may be also put him to death, when he took Rabba, (above chap.12.30, 31.) made this brother of his King in his stead, who shewed his thankfulness there unto David for it] the son of Nahas, of Rabba, of the children of Ammon, and Machir, [see above chap.9 4, 5.] the son of Ammiel of Lo-Debar, and Barzillai, [see below chap.19. 31, 32 &c. 1 King.2.7.] the Gileadite of Rogelim.
\p
\v 28 . Brought beds, and cups; and earthen vessels, [Heb. Vessels of the maker; i.e. of the Potter] wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched (corn); and beans, and lentils, also parched, [viz. beans and lentils]
\p
\v 29 . And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kin unto David, and unto people, that were with him, to eat: for they said, [viz. within themselves, that is thought] this people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty in the wilderness. [or, from the wilderness. Hearing of David’s slight from Jerusalem, and speedy passage thorough the wilderness, that without doubt they must needs have wanted all things there: therefore they brought this provision to them, to refresh them.]
\c 18
\s David mustereth his men, and putteth the battle in aray, but himself (at the peoples request) tarrieth at Mahanaim, ver.1, etc. giveth order to favour Absalom, 5. Absaloms men are smitten, and Absalom himself hanging on an Oak by his long hair, is thrust thorough by Joab, and cast into a pit, a great heap of stones being laid upon it, 7. Of Absaloms Pillar, which in his life-time he had caused to be set up for his Monument, 8. Absamaaz and Cuschi bring David tidings, 19. Who maketh great moan for Absalom, 33.
\p
\v 1 And David mustered the people, that were with him: And he set Commanders of thousand, and Commanders of hundreds over them.
\p
\v 2 . Moreover, David sent the people forth, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abisai, the son of Zeruja, Joabs brother, [See above chapter 15.on v.19.] and a third part under the hand of Ithai, [see above chap.15.on ver.19.] the Gethite: And the King said unto people; I; I will surely go forth with you my self also.
\p
\v 3 . But the people said, Thou shalt not march forth; for if we should quite flee (away), they would not set the heart upon us, [i.e. Not care for it, be much troubled at it, make much ado about it; for they do not mind or regard us, but thy person onely] yea if the (one) half of us should die, they would not set the heart upon us; but (thou art) now as ten thousand of us: [i.e. thy person is of more concernment, then many thousands of us. Compare herewith the words of Achitophel, above chap.17.2, 3. Oth. Though (there were) ten thousand times more of us, according as we (are) now] so it will be now heither, for thee to be a succour to us [heb. for thee to help. or, succour: when we should be in a strait] out of the city. [viz. Mahanaim; as above chap.17.24, 27.]
\p
\v 4 . Then said the King unto them; I will do that which is good in your eyes: [i.e. That which pleaseth you, or seemeth good unto you] now the King stood by the side of the gate; [or, on the place, between the two gates, below ver.24. Heb. Properly hand: but of such use of this word, see Deut.23.on verse 18. and else-where] and all the people marched forth by hundreds, and by thousands.
\p
\v 5 . And the King commanded Joab, and Abisai, and Ithai, saying; (Deal) me gently with the young-man, with Absalom: and all the people heard it, when the King charged all the Commanders concerning the matters of Absalom.
\p
\v 6 . So the people marched forth into the field, to meet Israel: [i.e. Absalom and his men, who are constantly called Israel in this place, in regard the far greater part of Israel were joined with him] and the battle happened by the wood of Ephraim. [this wood lay not far from Mahanaim, or the East-side of the Jordan, in Gilead, in the tribes of Gad; but received the name of Ephraims wood (as some conceive) from the defeat of Ephraim, in the time of Jephte the Gileadite: see Judg. 12.1 4, 5. The Land of Ephraim was on the West side of the Jordan, in the Land of Canaan.]
\p
\v 7 . And the people of Israel were smitten there before the face of David’s servants; and there happened that day a great slaughter of twenty thousand. [Of the Israelites, which were smitten by David’s men.]
\p
\v 8 . For the battle was there spread over all that Land: And the wood devoured more of the people that day, then the sword devoured. [i.e. Those that fled into the wood, or were driven thither, perished in the wood, entangling and wounding themselves in one bush or other, and falling into pits and bogs, perhaps also being rent of wild beasts, and dying of hunger and thirst. Heb. The wood multiplied, to devour, &c.]
\p
\v 9 . Now Absalom met before the face of David’s servants; and Absalom rode upon a Mule, and when the Mule came under the thick [Heb. The thickness] boughs of a great Oak, his head was fastened to the Oak, [in regard his long hair (whereof above chap.14.26.) slipped about the thick bough s of the Oak, and caught hold thereon] (so) that he continued [Heb. was given] hanging between the heaven, and between the earth; and the Mule that was under him, went away.
\p
\v 10 . When a man saw that, then he certified Joab thereof, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging on an Oak.
\p
\v 11 . Then said Joab unto the man that certified him thereof; Behold now, thou sawest it, why then didst thou not smite him there to the ground? seeing it (appertained) to me, to give thee ten silverlings, [see Gen.20.on v.16.] and a girdle.
\p
\v 12 . But that man said unto Joab; And though I might weigh a thousand silverlings on mine hands, [i.e. Being weighed unto me, received them in mine hands, or tell them] I would not lay mine hand on the Kings son; for the King charge thee, and Abisai, and Ithai, before our ears, saying; Beware, whoever (thou art) of [meaning, touching or hurting] the young man, of Absalom, [Heb. Properly keep thy self, consider, lay hold of, take it into consideration, look to it, (as we say) whosoever, to, or, toward the young man, to Absalom. The meaning is, whosoever, or he that hurteth him, him will I, &c. ‘Tis an abrupt kind of speech or sentence, much in use even among us; or look to it, that no man hurt him. Oth. let every man consider the young man, Absalom.]
\p
\v 13 . If I should have dealt falsly against mine (own) soul, yet nothing would be bid from the King: [i.e. If having slain Absalom, I should fasly deny it, yet it would not be hid from the King, and then should I go in danger of my life. oth. his soul, i.e. toward, or against Absaloms life or person] also thou thy self wouldest set thy self against (me). [i.e. thou wouldest forsake me, and stand aloof off, without helping me. Compare Psal.38.12. oth. oppose.]
\p
\v 14 . Then said Joab, I will not tarry thus here with thee [Heb. Before thy face: as if he should say, ‘Tis no time to stay long herewith you. I’ll do as I please] and he took three arrows, [meaning darts, javelins, small lances, or any such like sharp weapon, used in war in those times] and thrust them into Absloms heart, [i.e. into the midst of his body, about the heart; for it appeareth v.15. that he lived yet a while] where he was yet alive in the midst of the Oak. [Heb. in the heart of the Oak. See Deut.4.on v.11.]
\p
\v 15 . And ten Lads, Joabs armour-bearers, compassed (him) about, and they smote Absalom, and killed him.
\p
\v 16 . Then Joab blew with the trumpet, and all the people turned away from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held the people back.
\p
\v 17 . And they took Absalom, and threw him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: [An other kind of Monument, set up by Gods righteous judgment, then that which he had caused to be set up for himself in his life-time: see the following verse] and all Israel [viz. which had followed Absalom] fled every one to his tent. [i.e. dwelling place.]
\p
\v 18 . Now Absalom in his life-time had taken, and reason up for himself a Pillar, which is in the kings dale; [See Gen.14.17.] for he said, I have no son, [hence appeareth that Absaloms sons (whereof mention was made above chap.14.27.) were dead at this time] to cause my name to be remembered: and he called that Pillar after his (own) name, therefore it is called unto this day, Absaloms hand. [i.e. Monument, or, hand; i.e. his work: some conceive that it was a Pillar, so called from the fashion of an hand. Tooth place, or, room: see above on v.4. compare 1 Sam.15.on v.12.]
\p
\v 19 . Then said Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok; Let me, I pray thee, run, and ber the King tidings, that the LORD hath done him right, [i.e. Doing right, hath delivered him: so below v.31. compare the annotate. Judg.2.on v.16.] from his enemies hand.
\p
\v 20 . But Joab said unto him; Thou shalt be no bringer of tidings [Heb. No man of errand, or, tidings: compare above chap.8 on v.10.] this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: now this day thou shalt not bear tidings, because the Kings son is dead. [As if he should say, Thou wilt carry such news or tidings, which will not please the King. Oth. for it would be of the Kings dead son.]
\p
\v 21 . And Joab said unto Cuschi; [Or, the Blackamore, or Arabian: (see Numb.12.on v.4.) being also one of David’s servants, as appeareth by v.29. Joab seemeth to have made choice of this man, because he was a stranger. Some conceive it to be a proper name] Go thy ways, and tell the King what thou hast seen; and Cuschi; bowed himself before Joab, and ran his ways.
\p
\v 22 . But Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, proceeded yet on, and said unto Joab; What ever it be, [As if he should say, be it what it will: Let there issue from, what will issue: so in the following verse. It seemeth, that he imagined a better thing then Joab had said] let me, I pray thee, run also after Cuschi: and Joab said; Wherefore shouldest thou now run, my son, [i.e. good young man, whom I love, as my son. Thus persons that are elder and greater, are wont to speak in a loving and friendly way to the younger and meaner sort: see Gen.43.on v.29.] seeing thou hast no fit tidings. [Heb. finding tidings: i.e. pleasant, sit,well agreeing, suitable: compare Numb.11.22. Oth.seeing it would be no profitable tidings for thee; or, seeing it would bring thee nothing in: i.e. no messengers reward or favour, but the contrary. Or thus: seeing no good tidings is offered unto thee, or, offers it self unto thee.]
\p
\v 23 . Whatsoever it be, (said he) [viz. Ahimaaz] let me run my ways; then he [viz. Joab] said unto him, Run thy ways: and Ahimaaz ran the way of the plain field, and out went Cuschi.
\p
\v 24 . Now David sat between the two gates: And the Watch-man went up to the roof of the gate unto the Wall, and lift up his eyes, and behold, there ran a man alone.
\p
\v 25 . So the Watch-man cried, and told the King; and the King said; If he be alone, then there is tidings in his mouth: and he [viz. Ahimaaz, whom the Watch-man saw first] went on and drew near. [Heb. he went going.]
\p
\v 26 . Then the Watch-man saw another man running, and the Watch-man cried to the Porter, and said, Behold there runneth (yet) a man alone: Then said the King, he is also abringer of tidings.
\p
\v 27 . Moreover, the Watch-man said; I spy the running of the foremost, as the running of Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok. Then said the King; That is a good man, and will come with good tidings.
\p
\v 28 . Then Ahimaaz called, and said unto the King, Peace, [i.e. All is well; as if he should say, I bring good news] and he bowed himself before the King with his face to the ground; and he said, Praise [Heb. blessed] be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up [or, shut up, viz. in the hand of David’s men; so 1 Sam.24.19. & 26.8. and elsewhere] the men that lifted up their hand against my Lord the King.
\p
\v 29 . Then said the King; Is it well with the young man, with Absalom? [Heb. Hath be peace? So below v.32.] And Ahimaaz said; When Joab sent away the Kings servant, [viz. Cuschi] and (me) thy servant, I saw a great tumult [or, a great multitude] but I know not, what. [Having further considered of Joabs words, he concealeth the news concerning Absalom.]
\p
\v 30 . And the King said, Turn aside, set thy self here: so be turned aside and stood still.
\p
\v 31 . And behold, Cuschi came, and Cuschi said; Tidings is come to my Lord the King; that the LORD hath done thee right, [as above v.19.] this day of the hand of all them that rose up against thee.
\p
\v 32 . Then said the King unto Cuschi; Is it well with the young man, with Absalom? [As ver.29.] and all that rise up against thee for evil, be as that young man.
\p
\v 33 . Then the King was much troubled, and went up to the upper room of the gate, and wept, and in his going he said thus; My son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! O that I, I, had died for thee, [Heb. Who will give, or, O that any man would give, that, etc. See of such phrase or manner of speaking in wishing, Exod.16. on verse 3. Deut.5. on verse 29, &c.] Absalom my son, my son! [David had sundry causes or occasions to be heartily grieved for his mishap, especially when besides his sons temporal death, he might fear his eternal ruin and destruction.]
\c 19
\s Joab, by hard threatings, moveth David to give over mourning for Absalom, and to shew himself to the people, ver.1, &c. David is restored unto his Kingdom, and maketh Amasa Commander in chief in Joabs room, 13. Simei sueth to David for mercy, and obtaineth it, 16. David restoreth took back unto Mephiboseth, upon proof of his innocency, the half of his estate, 24. Is desirous to have good old Barzillai with him at Court, but he desiring to be excuseth, he taketh his son Chimham in his room, 31. The other tribes contend with them of Juda, for their hastiness in bringing back, and conducting the King; 41.
\p
\v 1 And it was told Joab: Behold, the King weepeth, and mourneth for Absalom.
\p
\v 2 . Then the deliverance [Or, Salvation, Conquest, Victory] became that day mourning unto all the people [i.e. The joy which the people should have shewed for the Victory, was turned into sorrow and mourning] for the people had heard say that day; It grieveth the King for his son. [or, the King is very much grieved.]
\p
\v 3 . And the people came that day by stealth [Heb. The people stole themselves to come, or, coming] into the city: [viz. Mahanaim] according as people steal away, that are ashamed, when they fled in battle.
\p
\v 4 . Now the King had his face wound about, [Or, covered. In token of great mourning: see above chap.15. on v.30.] and the King cried with a loud voice: My son Absalom, Absalom my son, my son! [see above chap.18.on v.33.]
\p
\v 5 . Then Joab came into the house to the King, and said; Thou hast shamed this day the face of all thy servants, which have this day freed thy soul, [Tha is here, thy life, or person, as elsewhere often] and the soul of thy sons, and of thy daughters, and the soul of thy wives, and the soul of thy concubines.
\p
\v 6 . Loving them that hate thee, and hating them that love thee: for thou declares this day, that Commanders and servants are nothing with thee; for this day I perceive, that if Absalom lived, and all we were dead this day, that it would then be right in thine eyes.
\p
\v 7 . Now then arise, go forth, and speak to the heart of thy servants: [See gen.34.on ver.3.] for I swear by the LORD, when thou goest not forth, if there overnight one man with thee this night! [Understand with all, then God do this and that to me; kind of oath as often] and this will be worse unto thee, then all the evil that hath befallen thee from youth, until now.
\p
\v 8 . Then the King arose, and sat himself (down) in the gate: and they let all the people know saying: Behold the King sitteth in the gate: Then all the people came before the Kings face, but Israel [viz. who had followed Absalom] was fled, every man to his tents. [i.e. dweilling places.]
\p
\v 9 . And all the people, in all tribes of Israel, were contending among themselves, [With sorrow and shame condemning themselves] saying; The King hath delivered us from the hand of our enemies, and he hath freed us from the hand of the Philistines, and now he is fled out of the Land from Absalom!
\p
\v 10 . And Absalom, whom we had anointed over us, [i.e. Whom we had chosen to be King, and intended to cause him to be anointed] is dead in the battle: Now then, why do ye hold your peace [or, are still quiet: see Judg.18.on verse 9.] of bringing the King [viz. David, our lawful and bountiful King] back.
\p
\v 11 . Then King David sent to Zadok, and to Abiathar, the Priests, saying; [i.e. To send word to them] speak unto the Eldest of Juda, saying: Why should ye be the last, to bring the King back into his house? [i.e. into the Royal Court or Palace at Jerusalem] (for the speech of all Israel [related in the former verses] was come to the King in his house.) [viz. at Mahanaim.]
\p
\v 12 . Ye are my brethren, ye are my bone and my flesh. [See above chap.5.on v.1. so in the following verse] Why then should ye be the last to bring back the King?
\p
\v 13 . And ye [Priests, Zadok and Abiathar] shall say unto Amasa; Art thou not my bone and my flesh? [For he was David’s sister son: see above chap.17.on v 25.] Let God do so to me, and let him so add thereunto, [Of such kind of swearing, see Ruth 1.on v.17.& 1 King.19on v.2.] if thou shalt not be chief Commander before my face, all days, in Joabs room. [see above chap.3.on verse 39.]
\p
\v 14 . So he [viz. David; some apply it to Amasa] bowed the heart of all the men of Juda, as of one man; [That they were so unanimous, of one accord, as one man: see Judg.20.on v.1.] and they sent forth to the King, (saying); Return, and thou and all thy servants.
\p
\v 15 . Then the King returned, and came to Jordan; and Juda came to Gilgal, to go to meet the King, to conduct the King over the Jordan.
\p
\v 16 . And Simei, the son of Gera, a son of Jemini, [i.e. a Benjamite: see above chap 16.on v.11.] which was of Bahurim [see above chap 3.on verse 16. & chap.16.5.] made haste, and came down with the men of Juda, to meet King David.
\p
\v 17 . And a thousand men of Benjamin with him; also Ziba the servant [Heb. Lad: so above chap.2.9.on vers.1. & chap.16.1, &c. This man feared that David would come to know (as indeed he did) of his deceitful dealing with Mephiboseth: therefore he sought by this serviceableness of his to mollisie and soften the Kings heart against it, by way of prevention; which also happened unto him] of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons, and his twenty servants [as above chap.9.10.] with him; and they went readily over the Jordan, [or, they made the Jordan ready; i.e. they made all things fit and ready for the King his household, to pass over] before the King. [i.e. before the King was come to the Ferry of Jordan, to pass over, they were all got over, and had got all things ready.]
\p
\v 18 . Now when the Wherry [Or, Hulk, Ferry-boat] went over, to fetch over the Kings house, [i.e. the King with his household] and do that which was good in his eyes; then Simei, the son of Gera, fell down before the Kings face, when he went over the Jordan: [Oth. when he was come over, or, should go over.]
\p
\v 19 . And he said unto the King; Let not my Lord impute the iniquity unto me, neither remember, what thy servant did perversely that day, when my Lord the King went out Jerusalem, that the King should take it to heart. [i.e. Regard it, mind it, and cause me to be punished according to my desert. Heb. put it in, or, to his heart.]
\p
\v 20 . For thy servant [i.e. I] Knoweth assuredly, (that) I have sinned: but be hold, I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph, [Hereby he understandeth not onely Ephraim and Manasseh, but also Benjamin (of which tribe he was, ver.16.) because Joseph and Benjamin were entire brethren, both of one father and mother; so that Benjamin also marched up under the standard of Ephraim, Numb.10.22, 23, 24. Some understand, that he would say, that he came sooner then any man of the ten tribes, or Ephraim and Manasseh; but it seemeth that here by the house of Joseph, are meant the Israelites in general, opposed to the house of Juda] to go down to meet my Lord the King.
\p
\v 21 . Then Abisai, the son of Zeruja, answered, and said; should then Simei not be put to death for this? [That he sueth for mercy, and is come to meet the King] seeing he hath cursed the LORDS anointed. [Compare 1 Sam.24.7. of David’s anointing King, see 2 Sam.5.on v.3.]
\p
\v 22 . But David said; What have I to do with you, [See above chap.16.on ver.10.] ye sons of Zeruja, that ye should this day be Sathan [i.e. adversary, oppose, that hiners me, and crosseth me in mine intent and purpose; compare Matth.16.23. see further, Job 1.on verse 6.] should any man be put to death this day in Israel? [compare 1 Sam.11.13.] for do not I know, that I am this day made King over Israel? [as if he should say again, as it were a new, &c.]
\p
\v 23 . And the King said unto Simei, Thou shalt not die: [Meaning this day, and so on ward during my reign, I will not cause thee to be punished: yet in regard Simei’s fault was very scandalous and gross, and did likewise much concern the Publike, therefore David would not that he should altogether, or forever go unpunished: see 1 King.2.9, 10.] and the King sware unto him.
\p
\v 24 . Mephiboseth, the son of Saul, [i.e. His Grandchild. For Mephiboseth was Jonathans son, above chapter 9 3, 6, &c.] came also down to meet the King: and he had not made his feet clean, nor shaved his muchato-beard, that is, (as this word elsewhere is often taken) dressed himself, sitted, or ordered. Compare especially Deut.21.on ver.12.] nor washed his clothes, [these were all tokens of great grief and sorrow, that Mephiboseth took at David’s misfortune, who had done him so much good. Compare above chap.12.20.] from that day, that the King was departed, [viz. from Jerusalem, fleeing from Absalom] until that day that he came again in peace.
\p
\v 25 . And it came to pass, when he cane to Jerusalem to meet the King, [After the King was come into Jerusalem: It seemeth he found no opportunity by the way, or was afraid to speak to the King. Oth. when Jerusalem (that is, the inhabitants of Jerusalem) came to meet the King, among whom Mephiboseth joined himself, to meet the King at the Jordan] that the King said unto him; Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephiboseth?
\p
\v 26 . And he said; My Lord (O) King, my servant [viz. Ziba] deceived me: for thy servant said; I will saddle me an ass, and ride thereon, and go to the King, for thy servant is cripple.
\p
\v 27 . Beside, he hath falsly accused thy servant unto my Lord the King: [See above chap.16.3.] but my Lord the King is as an Angel of God; [as above chap.14.17.] do then that which is good in thine eyes.
\p
\v 28 . For all my Fathers [i.e. My Grand father Sauls] house was nothing, but as men of death [i.e. they had all deserved death: compare Gen.20.on ver.3. &2 Sam. 12.on ver.5.] before my Lord the King, yet thou didst set thy servant among them that eat at thy table: [see above chap.9.7, 10, 13.] what have I then more to cry for justice unto the King? [to complain of the wrong that my servant hath done me.]
\p
\v 29 . Then said the King unto him; Why speakest thou more (of) thy matters? I have said; [viz. When I called to mind, that Ziba had done thee wrong: or I say, that is, ordain, and appoint. So much had Ziba by his cunning plots and devices prevailed with this, otherwise most wise King, that he obtained a reward or gratuity, in stead of a punishment, which he had most justly deserved, by reason of his shameful unfaithfulness shewed towards Mephiboseth, and his lying and falsehood whereby he had consented and cheated the King] Thou and Ziba divided the Land.
\p
\v 30 . And Mephiboseth said unto the King; Let him also take all away: forasmuch as my Lord the King is come in peace into his (own) house. [As if he had said, It sufficeth me, that the publick thriveth: As for mine own particular, I weigh it not; or, I’ll bear that loss patiently, considering the Public prospereth so well]
\p
\v 31 . Barzillai the Gileadite [See above chap.17.27. and 1 Kings 2.7.] came down also from Rogelim; [Before the King passed over the Jordan] and he went with the King over the Jordan, to conduct him over the Jordan.
\p
\v 32 . Now Barzillai was very old, a man [Heb. a son] of fourscore years: and he had sustained the King, when he abode at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man. [In power or means. As 1 Sam.25.2.]
\p
\v 33 . And the King said unto Barzillai, come thou over with me, and I wil sustain thee with me at Jerusalem.
\p
\v 34 . But Barzillai said unto the King. How many will the days of the years of my life be, that I should go up with the King to Jerusalem? [As if he had said: I have now but a little time to live, why then should I undergo that troubled?]
\p
\v 35 . I am this day fourscore years old; [Heb. a son of fourscore years] should I be able to distinguish between good and evil? Should thy servant be able to taste what I eat, and what I drink? Should I be able to hearken (any) more to the voice of singing-men, and singing-women? and why should thy servant be (any) more a burden unto my Lord the King? [Intimating that he was too old, to take delight in all those things; that it besitted him better to be hear his grave, and to prepare himself for his dying day]
\p
\v 36 . Thy servant shall go but a little (way) over the Jordan with the King: why now should the King make me such a recompense? [for a small courtesie give so great a reward]
\p
\v 37 . Let thy servant, I pray, turn back again, that I may die in mine (own) city, by my fathers and mothers grave: but behold, there is thy servant Chimham, [Called Chihan, below vers.40. One of Barzilla’s sons, as appeareth by 1 Kings 2 7.] let him go over with my Lord the King, and do to him, that which is good in thine eyes.
\p
\v 38 . Then said the King; Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him, that with is good in thine eyes: [That which shall be acceptable and well-pleasing unto thee] yea all that thou shalt desire of me [Heb. shalt chuse, to wit, for to desire of me, or, whatsoever shall please thee, whatsoever shall be delightful and acceptable unto thee. See above chap.15.on vers.15.] will I do unto thee.
\p
\v 39 . Now when all the people had passed over the Jordan, and the King also had passed had over, [With the wherry or ferry-boat. As v.18.] the King kissed Barzillai, [Taking his leave of him, with thanksgiving and wishing him all happiness. See Genes.29 on vers.11.] and blessed him; so he returned unto his (own) place [i.e. Barzillai returned to Rogelim]
\p
\v 40 . And the King went on to Gilgal, and Chimhan went on with him: and all the people of Juda had brought the King over, [Or, conducting the King: and so in the following verse] as also one part [Heb. the half: which is sometimes taken for a part] of the people of Israel, [i.e. Of the other tribes]
\p
\v 41 . And behold, all the men of Israel came unto the King: and they said unto the king: Why have our brethren, the men of Juda, stolen thee, [i.e. going alone by themselves as it were by stealth, without sending for us] etc have brought [Or, conducted] the King and his house, and all David’s men with him [i.e. David’s Officesr and souldiers were all with David, and held with them of Juda, who had moved David himself to it, above v.11.12, 14. Therefore those of Juda spake the bolder. Or, All David s men (were) now by him; to wit, by the King, who had all his officers and souldiers by, or, about him] over the Jordan.
\p
\v 42 . Then all the men of Juda answered the men of Israel, Because the King is near of kin to us: [Heb. me; viz, the tribe of Juda,] and wherefore are ye naow angry for this matter? Have we eaten at all [Heb. eating eaten] of The Kings (cost,) [Heb. of the King] or hath he given us a gift? [As if they should say, Do ye think that the King hath bought or bribed us with good chear, or with gifts and presents to do it?]
\p
\v 43 . And the men of Israel answered the men of Juda, and said; We [Heb. I; to wit, Israel: and so in the following words] have ten parts [Heb. hands. They say this, because they were ten tribes, and in that regard had ten voices] in the King [i.e. in the King in general, or in the Kingdom, and also in this Kingdom, and also in this King David, whom we with our common vote have chosen, 2 Sam.5.1.] and we have also more (right) in David then ye: why then did ye dis-esteem us, that our word was not the first, to bring our King back, again? [i.e. that we had not the first voice, or led on the van in this business] But the word of the men of Juda, was harder then the word of the men of Israel. [i.e. it was stronger, mightier, more powerful, so that those of Israel could not prevail, but were sain to desist.]
\c 20
\s Wicked Seba, by occasion of this strife, stirreth up Israel to sedition and revolt from David, vers.1, etc. How David dealt with the Concubines, that were abused by Absalom, 3. David dealt with the Concubines, that were abused by Absalom, 3. David sendeth forth Amasa, to assemble Juda against Seba, 4. But while thisman lingred a while, he dispatcheth forth Abisai with forces etc men, 6. Amasa meeteth them by the way, and is treacherously thrust thorough by Joab, 8. Joab and Abisai pursueth after Seba, and besiege him in Abel Beth-Maacha, 13. Where the Citizens by the advice of wise woman, cut. Off Seba’s head, and cast it over the wall unto Joab, whereby this sedition and war is ended, 16. A Catalogue or lift of the chiefest Officers, and Commanders in David’s Kingdom, 23.
\p
\v 1 Then was there by chance a man of Belial, [See Deut.13.on vers.13.] whose name was Seba, [Heb. Schobi] a son of Bichri, a man of Jemini: [see above chap.16.on vers.11.] he blew with the trumpet, and said; We have no part in David, neither have we any inheritance in the son of Isai; every man to his tents, [Understand withal, depart, get him] O Israel. [He speaketh to those of Israel, that were at strife with Juda, and complained, that they were wronged. See chap.19.41, 43.]
\p
\v 2 . Then all (or, every) man of Israel went up from after David, after Seba, the son of Bichri: [i.e. they left David, and followed after Seba] But the men of Juda clave unto their King, from Jordan to Jerusalem. [i.e. They left him, not as the other tribes had done, but continued with him, conducting him on to Jerusalem]
\p
\v 3 . Now when David came into his house at Jerusalem, the King took the ten women, (his) concubines, whom he had left to keep the house [See above chap.15.16.] and put them in an house of custody, [the cause hereof see above chap.16.22.] and maintained them, and went not in unto them: [see Gen.6.on v.4.] and they were shut up [Heb.bound, that is so shut up, as if they had been imprisoned and bound: it may be they had consented to Absaloms fact] unto the day of their death, living as widows, [(in) a widow-estate, that is, living as widows, or being as widows all their life long, or widows whose husband were yet alive.]
\p
\v 4 . Moreover, the King said unto Amasa; call me the men of Judah together, against the third day: [Or, within three days. Heb. the third of the days] and thou, set thy self (then) here; [that is, come in then, and keep by me, to receive charge from me; for David had made him Captain General in Joabs room, above chap 19.13.]
\p
\v 5 . And Amasa went his way to call Juda together: But he stayed behind the set time, [Others he caused (them) namely, those of Juda, to carry, that is, he gave them longer time] that he [David] had appointed him.
\p
\v 6 . Then said David unto Abisai; [Joabs brother, being also a commander. See above chap.18.2. whom David herein useth, that he might give no occasion to Joab (who otherwise should have been the next) to intrude himself into the place of Amasa, with the offence of Amasa, with the offence of Amasa, to whom the king had promised and confirmed by oath the Generals place] Now shall Seba, the son of Bichri, do us more harm then Absalom: Take thou thy Lords servants, [that is, my officers and souldiers. Some understand here Amasa, who at this present, as General, is called Abisai’s Lord] and pursue after him, left peradventure he find fenced cities before him and withdraw himself from our eyes.
\p
\v 7 . Then (there) went out after him Joabs men, [That is, joabs souldiers, as alos Joabs himself] and the Crethi and the Plethi [see 1 Kings.1.on vers.38.] and all the champions: These marched forth from Jerusalem to pursue after Seba, the son of Bichri.
\p
\v 8 . Now when they were by the great stone, which is by Gibeon, [See Jos.10.] then came Amasa before their face; [i.e. he came directly to meet them, returning from the journey whereon the King had sent him; or he came before or beside them, or along the way, where ir may be they baited] and Joab was girt about upon his garment [or, souldiers coat, cassock, souldiers cloak; a garment (as some conceive) much used in war, and well known in those times] which he had on [Heb. of his cloathing] and upon it was a girdle, where the sword was fastned upon his loines in its shealth; and when he [to wit , Joab] went on, [stepping aside from his rank, or the place where they baited to salute Amasa] then it fell out . [to the sword: so that Amasa having seen the sword fall, suspect not that Joab had taken it with his left hand, as some do gather from the next verse.]
\p
\v 9 . And Joab said unto Amasa; is it well thee [Heb. (art) thou peace, as 1 Sam.25.6. and above ch.17.3.] my brother? [that is, cousin, kinsman; they were two sister children, 1 Chron.2.16, 17. See also above chap.17.25.] and Joab took hold of the beard of Amasa with (the) right hand [Heb. Joabs right hand took hold of the heard of Amasa] To kiss him. [as was usual in saluting, Gen.29.on v.11.]
\p
\v 10 . And Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joabs hand, therefore he smote [That is, stabbed] him therewith in the fifth rib [see above ch.2.on v.23.] and he shed out his bowels to the ground, and he smote him not the second time, [Heb. he doubled, or repeated not on him, to wit, the blow, i.e. he stabbed him not the second time, because he died presently of the first stab as followeth. Com.1 Sam.26 8. Job 29.22.] and he died: then Joab and his brother Amasa pursued after Seba the son of Birchri.
\p
\v 11 . But a man of Joabs lads [That is servants] stayed by him: and he said; who is there that hath a mind to Joab; and who is there that is for David; Let him follow Joab. [Heb. (let him be) after Joab: as above often, and in the sequel. The meaning is, let all those that side with Joab and David follow Joab. Compare Deut.20.5. Thus Joabs by means of the souldiery thrusteth himself straightway into the office or place of General in Amasa’s room, whom for that very intent and purpose he had murdered.]
\p
\v 12 . Now Amasa lay wallowing in blood, in the midst of the street, when that man [Mentioned in the former verse] saw that all the people [that passed by that way, as in the end of this verse is declared] stood still, then he removed Amasa out of the street into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, because he saw, that all (or very one) that came by him, stood still.
\p
\v 13 . Now when he was removed out of the street, all (or every) man marched on after Joab, to pursue after Seba, the son of Bichri:
\p
\v 14 . And he [viz. Joab] marched on thorough all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, [He persued Seba fleeing thorough Ephraim, Issaachar, Zebulon and Naphtali, unto Abel, where he now was] to wit, Beth-maacha, [by this sir-name was this city of Abel called, to distinguish it from another city of the same name, this city lay in the tribe of Naphtali, on the North-end of Canaan, over against Syria, where was a part of Syria called Maacha. See also 2 Kings 15.29. and here the following verse] and all Berim: [a country lying by Abel] and they [viz. the Israelites] gathered themselves together and went also after him. [of the fore-mentioned places followed Joab likewise.]
\p
\v 15 . And they came and besiege him [viz. Seba the rebel] in Abel Beth-Maacha, and they cast up [Heb. they poured out] a wall [an earthen bank raised up high: that is, a bulwark or wall. So 2 Kings 19, 32. Jerem.32.24. and 33.4.] against the city, (so) that it stood on the outward wall: and all the people that were with Joab, spoiled the wall, to throw it down. [Heb. were spoiling, to throw the wall down, i.e. hewing, pushing, breaking, battering perhaps also undermining; for from the Hebrew word here used, is derived another, which also signifieth a ditch.]
\p
\v 16 . Then there cryed a wise woman out of the city: [from the wall of the city] here, here, say, I pray unto Joab; come near hither, that I may speak to thee.
\p
\v 17 . Now when he came neer unto her, the woman said; art thou Joab? And he said, I am: and she said unto him; hear the words of thine hand-maid, and he said, I hear.
\p
\v 18 . Then she spake, saying; they spake commonly [Heb. speaking they spake] in former time, saying; they shall undoubtedly enquire [Heb. enquiring they shall enquire, or asking counsel they shall ask counsel] at Abel, and so they accomplished it. [i.e. when the counsel of this city was followed, things went well. Or so they ended the difference, or controversy. Oth. so they shall accomplish, or, end the matter. It seemeth to have been an old proverb, used to the honour of the inhabitants of this city, because wise and understanding people were found there, as appeareth here by the example of this woman.]
\p
\v 19 . I am one of the peaceable of the faithful (ones) in Israel [She speaketh in the name of the city of Abel] and thou sleekest to slay a city, which is mother in Israel; [heb. a city and a mother, etc. i.e. a metropolis or chief city, having under it other small towns and villages. Or understand by the mother, the inhabitants of a city, which is as it were a mother of others, which she is wont to go before good and wise counsel, as a mother doth her children] why shouldest thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD? [i.e. his people, whom he loveth as a man doth his inheritance.]
\p
\v 20 . Then Joab answered, and said; far be it far be it from me, that I should swallow up, and that I should destroy! [Hebr. If I shall swallow up, etc. Understand withal, the let God do this and that to me: as is used in swearing.]
\p
\v 21 . The matter is not so; but a man of the mount of Ephraim, whose name is Seba the son Birchi; [As if he should say, I am not come for that intent, but to have Seba] hath lift up his hand [hath risen up, and raised rebellion] against the King, against David; deliver him only, then I will depart from this city; Then said the woman unto Joab; behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.
\p
\v 22 . And the woman came into all the people with her wisdom, [Moving the inhabitants withy wise and solid found arguments, to perform that which she had promised Joab] and they cut off the head of Seba the son of Bichri, and threw it unto Joab: Then he blew with the trumpet, and they [viz. the besiegers] scattered themselves from the city, every one to his tents, Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the King.
\p
\v 23 . Now Joab was over all the host of Israel; [After Amasa’s death he was restored to his former place. See above on v.4.] and Benaja the son of Jojada, over the Crethi and over the Plethi. [see above v.7.]
\p
\v 24 . And Adoram was over the tribute: [Oth. leavy. See 1 Kings 4.on vers.6.] and Josaphat the son of Ahilud was Chancellour. [see 1 Kings 4.on v.3.]
\p
\v 25 . And Seja [Heb. Scheja: called above chap.8.17. (according to the opinion of some) Seraja] was Scribe: and Zadok and Abjathar were Priests. [see Num.3.on v.32. and 2 Kings 23.on v.4.]
\p
\v 26 . And also Ira the Jairite, was David’s chief officer. [Heb. Cohen. See above chap.8.on ver.18. These Officers are here the second time, because David was now as it were a new restored to his Kingdom, above chap.19.22. and because there seemeth to have happened some alteration, and likewise some addition. Compare above chap.8.17, 18.]
\c 21
\s David enquireth of God concerning the cause of the three years famine, and understand that it was because Saul had persecuted and slain the Gibeonites, he delivereth the Gibeonites at their request, seven persons of Sauls family, (sparing the son of Jonathan) whom they hung up, v 1 &c. Rispa preserveth the dead bodies, 10. David causeth the bones of Saul and Jonathan, as also the bones of them that were hung up, to be buried in Sauls sepulchre, 12. A relation of four wars of David against the Philistines, wherein four of the Philistines Giants are slain by David’s champions, 15.
\p
\v 1 And there was a famine in the days of David, three years; and David sought the face of the LORD: [To know of God by Urim and Thummim the cause of this death, and then to use convenient means to pacify Gods wrath. See Num.27.21.] and the LORD said; it is for Sauls, and for (his) bloody house sake, because he slew the Gibeonites. [contrary to the promise made to them, and ratified by Oath, as followeth. See Jos.9.15, 18, etc. For this offence all the land is punished, because the people had commanded Sauls perverse zeal, or at least (as it often happeneth) had not hindred it, nor any satisfaction was hitherto made to the Gibeonites for the same. Of this fact of Saul the holy scripture hitherto is altogether silent.]
\p
\v 2 . Then the King called the Gibeonites, and said unto them: (now the Gibeonites they were not of the children of Israel; but of the remnant of the Amorites, [i.e. remaining of the former heathenish inhabitants of the Land of Canaan, whom God had commanded to destroy, and are generally called Amorites. Otherwise they were Hivites, Jos.9.7. and 11.19.] and the children of Israel had sworn unto them, [see Jos.9.19.] but Saul sought to smite them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Juda). [understand an irregular and feigned zeal, whereby he thought to mend that which by Josua and other godly Governours (according to his opinion) was neglected, to ill done. But it was directly against the oath, made by Gods name, by his special providence. For which thing God was now greatly provoked, as by this plague upon the land, and Gods answer appeareth.]
\p
\v 3 . Then David said unto the Gibeonites; what shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that he [Heb. that they; to wit, your husband-men] may bless the inheritance of the LORD. [i.e. that ye may no more complain to God, but that ye may help to deprecate, or pray away this judgement from the people of God, (as chap.20.19.) and pray for all good to happen unto thee.]
\p
\v 4 . Thenn said the Gibeonites unto him; we (require) not silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house, neither (do) we (require) any man to be killed in Israel: [excepting. Sauls house, as followeth] And he [viz. the King] said; what do ye say then that I shall do for you.
\p
\v 5 . And they said unto the King; The man [i.e. Saul, so disdainfully they speak of him] that reduced us to nothing, and devised [intended, purposed, plotted, practised] against us, that we should be destroyed, without being able to subsist in any border of Israel;
\p
\v 6 . Let seven men of his sons, [i.e. of his posterity, children, or children’s children, &c. pertaining to Sauls bloody house, mentioned ver.1.] be delivered to us, that we may hang them up unto the Lord [i.e. to his honour, by whose name the oath was made to spare us, or to pacify him] at Gibea of Saul, O thou chosen of the LORD: [as in tyhe former verse they spake contemptibly of Saul, so on the contrary in this verse they speak very reverently unto David. Oth. of the chosen of the LORD, understanding it of Saul whom they so called, to aggravate his offence committed on them against the oath of God] and the King said; I will deliver them.
\p
\v 7 . But the King spared Mephiboseth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the LORDs oath that was between them, between David, and between Jonathan, the son of Saul. [see 1. Sam.18.3. and 26.15, 16, 17, 42. and 23.18.]
\p
\v 8 . But the King took the two sons of Rispa [Sauls concubine: above ch.3.7. and below v.11.] the daughter of Aja, whom she had born unto Saul, Ammoni and Mephiboseth: besides the five sons of Michals (sister), [viz. Merah, who had been married to this Adriel here mentioned, 1 Sam.18.19. Thus the word brother is inserted below ver.19. and son, Jerem.32.12. Some understand here by Michals sons, her sister Merabs sons, whom Michals bred up, and in that respect was called their mother. Compare Ruth 4.17.] Sauls daughter whom she had born unto Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite. [Heb. Mecholathite; of Manasseh on the west-side of Jordan, where Abel-mohela lay. See Judg.7.on v.22. to distinguish him from Barzillai the Gileadite, David’s friend, above chap.19.31, &c.]
\p
\v 9 . And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, who hanged them upon the hill [At Gibea of Saul, as above v.6. not far from Silo, Gibeon and Nob in which places the tent of the congregation was. See above chap.6.on v.17.] before the face of the LORD, and those seven fell [i.e. perished] all together: And they were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first (days), in the beginning of barley-harvest.
\p
\v 10 . Then Rispa the daughter of Aja, took a sack, [i.e. course cloth, like a rent, to abide under it both by night and by day, out of a motherly affection, by the dead bodies of the children, which otherwise by the Law, Deut.21.23. were usually taken down, and burned the same day. But it seemeth, that these were said to hang still, until God shewed by the rain, that he was appeased with the Land, forasmuch as God had occasioned the dearth or famine by immoderate drought] and stretched it out [oth. spread it] for her upon a rock, from the beginning of harvest, until there dropped water upon them [i.e. the dead bodies] from out of heaven; and she suffered not the fowls of heaven to rest upon them by day, nor the beast of the field by night. [preserve the dead bodies entire and unviolated for burial.]
\p
\v 11 . And it was told David, what Rizpa, the brother of Aja, Sauls concubine had done.
\p
\v 12 . Then David went his ways, and took the bones of Saul, and the bones Jonathan, his son, from the Citizens Of Joabs in Gilead, who had stolen them from the tree of Beth-San, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul on Gilboa. [viz. Mount-Gilboa. See the story, 1 Samuel 31. 10, 11, 12, 13.]
\p
\v 13 . And he brought up from thence, the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan, his son; [After that their bones were burnt, as may be gathered from 1 Sam.31.12. see there] they also gathered the bones of them that were hanged.
\p
\v 14 . And they buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the Land of Benjamin at Zela, [See Jos.18.28.] in the Sepulchre of his Father Kis, [see 1 Sam.9.1, 2.] and did all that the King had commanded: Thus after this God was intreated for the Land. [i.e. the Israelites, the inhabitants of the Land, that he took away the judgement of famine, and gave rain again with fruitfulness. Compare below chap.24.25.]
\p
\v 15 . Moreover, the Philistine had yet a war against Israel: [Oth. had had, etc. meaning that these wars against the Philistines are here onely related as a conclusion of David’s Victories, but were transacted long before] and David marched down, and his men with him, and fought against the Philistine, (so) that David waxed weary.
\p
\v 16 . And Isbi Benob, who was of the children of Rapha; [Oth. Of the Giant, that dwelt at Gath, below ver.22. so in the sequel] and thw weight of his spear, [or. of the iron sharp, or, the head of his spear] (was) three hundred weight of copper, [see 1 Sam.17.on verse 5.] and he was girded with a new [or, a new; i.e. armed in a new manner, or fashion, not used heretofore in War] (sword) This (man) thought [Heb. said, viz. by himself; i.e. thought; as elsewhere] to smite David.
\p
\v 17 . But Abisai, the son of Zeruja, succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him: Then David’s men sware unto him, [i.e. David’s Officers and souldiers sware unto David] saying; Thou shalt no more march forth with us to battle, lest thou quench the Lamp of Israel. [or, candle, light, lanthorn of Israel; i.e. lest thou, who bearest the light before Israel, perish. See more of this excellent comparison, 1 King.11.on v.36.]
\p
\v 18 . And it came to pass after that, that there was again a war at Gob, [Lying by Gezer, where this happened, 1 Chron 20 1. in Ephraim, by the borders of Benjamin, toward the Philistines Land] against the Philistines: Then Sibbechai, the Husathite, [Heb. the Cuschatite] smote Saph, [called also Sippai, 1 Chron.20.4.] who was of the children of Rapha.
\p
\v 19 . Moreover, there was yet a war at Gob, against the Philistines; and Elhanan [Heb. Elchanan] the son of Jaare Oregim, [called Jair, 1 Chron.20.5.] smote Beth-Halachmi, (who was) with Goliath [whom David slew, 1 Sam.17. Oth. (brother) of Goliath: which some insert here out of Chron.20.5. where he is called Lachmi: which place the Reader may compare with this] the Gethite, the wood of whose spear was, as a Weavers beam.
\p
\v 20 . There was also yet a war at Gath: [A known city of the Philistines, lying neer the mid-land sea] and there was a very tall man [Heb. a man of measure; i.e. great above, or, beyond measure. Compare Numb.13.33.] that had six fingers on his hands, and six toes on hia feet, four and twenty in number, [Heb. the fingers of his hands, and the fingers of his feet (were) six and six, four and twenty (in) number] and this (man) was also born to Rapha.
\p
\v 21 . And he defied Israel, [Compare 1 Sam.17.10.] but Jonathan, the son of Simea, [Heb. Schima, called also Schamma, 1 Sam.16.9.] David’s brothers, smote him.
\p
\v 22 . These four were born to Rapha at Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, [As Goliath also was formerly slain by David, 1 Sam.17. who was also here their Head and Leader; wherefore that is likewise ascribed to him, which his servants did. Otherwise, and; i.e. to wit] and by the hand of his servants; [i.e. his Officers and Champions.]
\c 22
\s A very excellent Song of praise and thanksgiving made by David, wherein he with all the strength of his spirit, extolleth his God to the highest, setting forth very lively his extreme necessities and dangers, wherein he was, by reason of the bitter persecution of all his enemies who hated him, wrongfully and continually sought his ruin and destruction: besides, describing in very lofty terms, the incomprehensible mercy and almighty power of God, who ever most wonderfully delivered his, (that were innocent, and walked in uprightness before him) and lifted him up, quelled and subdued all his enemies, and at length brought him to rest and peace. In the mean while he pointeth by the Spirit of Prophecy, at the stable, everlasting, and unconquered Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, whole type or figure he was, witness the future calling of the Gentiles to the obedience and fellowship of the Lord Christ and his Church.
\p
\v 1 And David spake unto the LORD the words of this Song. in the day when the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul. [i.e. Especially out of the hand of Saul, whose persecution was the most dangerous of all unto David: compare Mark 16.7.]
\p
\v 2 . He said then: The LORD is to me my Rock, [See Deut.32.on ver.4, and 31. So below ver.47.] and my fortressed, and my helper. [Compare the 18. Psalm with this Song.]
\p
\v 3 . God is my rock, [Heb. The God of my Rock] I will trust in him: [or, to him for refuge: so verse 31. Compare Ruth 2.on verse 12.] my shield, and the horn of my salvation, [i.e. who by his power sighteth for me, defendeth and laveth me. A comparison taken from horned beasts; that defend and protect themselves with their horns: compare Numb.32.22. & 24.8. Deut.33.on ver.17.] my high retiring place, [Heb. properly height, high place: as a height, where I hide my self, and am secure and safe. These and other comparisons are borrowed from the means, which they used in those times to hide and defend themselves from the violence of the enemies, as on Rocks, Heights, Towers, Fortresses, strong Holds &c.] and my refuge, my deliverer, thou hast delivered me from violence.
\p
\v 4 . I called on [Heb. properly will call on; and so in the following verses. The Hebrews use many words in relating of former passages, or things already past & done, which otherwise do properly signifie the time to come: as they do also sometimes use them for the present time, or something that continually and commonly happeneth] the LORD, who is to be praised, [or, that is praised,] and I was delivered from mine enemies.
\p
\v 5 . For Waves of death had compassed me about; brooks of Belial [i.e. Of wretched and vicious crew, or of the Devil and his instruments: see Deut.13.on v.13.] made me afraid.
\p
\v 6 . Bands of hell [Or, of the grave: i.e. anxieties, that threatened death. oth. pains of hell] environed me: snares of death encountred me. [David doth intimating by these elegant and often flourishing speechs, that his necessities were such, that without Gods wonderful and powerful delivetance, he had been a lost and undone man for ever.]
\p
\v 7 . When I was in distress, I called upon the LORD, and cryed to my God: and he heard my voice out of his Palace, [i.e. Out of Heaven, from whence he sent the following Wonders for David’s deliverance. Others, Temple; i.e. Tabernacle: see Psal.5.on v.8.] and my cry (entred) [this word is here inserted out of Psal.18 7.] into his ears.
\p
\v 8 . Then the earth shook and trembled, [This is a figurative description of the Earth-quake and fearful Tempest, whereby God, being called upon by David, fought for him and his people against their enemies. Compare Judg.5.on ver.20, 21. Psal.29.5, 6, 7, & 144.5, 6, 7.] the foundations of heaven moved, and shook, [of the foundations, pillars, and powers of heaven, see Job 26.on ver. 11.] because he was kindled. [Heb. because to him was kindled, to wit, anger.]
\p
\v 9 . Smoke went up out of his nose, and a fire out of his mouth devoured, coals were kindled by it. [Or, by him, to wit, the Lord.]
\p
\v 10 . And he bowed the heaven, and came down, [Spoken of God after the manner of men, in regard of his workings in the air, whereby he doth manifest his special presence, in stormy winds, sweeping rains, thunder lightning, hail, &c. as followeth] and darkness was under his feet.
\p
\v 11 . And he rode upon a Cherub, [i.e. Angel, (see Gen.3 on verse 24.) whereby the Angelical Hosts are understood, which God useth for his service, according to his good pleasure] and flew: and was seen upon the wings of the Wind.
\p
\v 12 . And he made darkness for tents round about him; a binding together of the waters, clouds of heaven. [God holdeth the waters in the thick black clouds, as if it were bound up together, loosening and pouring down the same at his pleasure: see Job 26.8.]
\p
\v 13 . Through the brightnes of him were coals of fire kindled. [A description of the Lightning; as verse 10.]
\p
\v 14 . The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice. [The sound of the Thunderclaps: see Psal.29.on v.3.]
\p
\v 15 . And he sent forth arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and made them afraid. [Or, discomfited them, undid them, destroyed them, to wit, the enemies.]
\p
\v 16 . And the deep gulphs of the sea were seen, [Through the terrible tempests, as followeth] the foundations of the world was discovered, by the rebuking of the LORD, [see Psal.9.on v.6.] from the blast of the wind of his nose. [or, of his anger. Gods anger, or wrath, is so described by comparison taken from men: compare Job 4.9. Psal.74.on v.1.]
\p
\v 17 . He sent from on high [viz. His help, or his holy Angels: or, he put forth, to wit, his right hand, when a man and pullet him up out of the water] he took me; he drew me out of great waters. [or, many violent waters: i.e. out of deep dangers and distresses, into which I was as it were sunk, which overwhelmed me as a strong flood, and threatened to swallow me up, or carry me away. See likewise this comparison, Job 22.11. Psal.32.6. and 66.12. & 69.2, 3. & 124 4. Isa.43.2. Ezek.26.19, &c.]
\p
\v 18 . He delivered me from my strong enemy; from my haters, because they were stronger then I.
\p
\v 19 . They had encountered me in the day of my disaster, [compare 1 Sam.23.24, 25, 6. The Hebrew word signifieth otherwise damp. Gen.1.6. whereunto (as also unto darkness) miseries and perils are not unsitly resembled] but the LORD was a stray unto me.
\p
\v 20 . And he brought me forth into the large place, and pulled me out: for he had a delight in me.
\p
\v 21 . The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness; [i.e. The innocency or righteousness of my cause. Fro David’s enemies were in the wrong, hating and persecuting him wrongfully, or without cause: Whereas on the contrary, he was careful not to sin in any wise, even against his most bitterest enemies,or for their sakes, as notoriously appeareth in his carriage and dealing towards Saul, and in the sequel is related. Otherwise David knew full well, that he was a sinner, and was to Obtain his salvation from God, out of Free-Grace, by the Promised Seed, the Messiah, according to his own manifold acknowledgement and confessions, even here in the 24.ver. of this Chapter. See above chap.11, & 12. and Psal.51, &c.] he recompensed me according to the cleanness of mine hands. [see Gen.20.on v.5.]
\p
\v 22 . For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God. [Oth. I have not dealt wickedly (in departing) from my God.]
\p
\v 23 . For all his judgements were before me, and (as for) his Statutes, I departed not from them.
\p
\v 24 . But I was upright before him; and I kept myself from mine iniquity. [That I might not be seduced by the corruption and wickedness that is in me, to do any unrighteous thing.]
\p
\v 25 . So the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness, before his eyes. [Which he knew full well, which was known to him]
\p
\v 26 . With the bountiful thou behaves thy self bountiful, with the right valiant (person) thou behaves thy self upright.
\p
\v 27 . With the pure thou behavest thy self pure, with the perverse thou behaves thy self as (one) turned about. [Or, as a Wrastler; by wonderful, unlook for, and incomprehensible ways, ensnaring, catching, casting down, and so justly punishing the wicked, who walk in wicked and perverse ways against thee and those that be godly. oth. unsavoury; i.e. wayward, unpleasant, according to the opinion of those that understand, that here is used another word in the Hebrew, then in Psal.18.27. compare further, Lev 26.24, 27, 28.]
\p
\v 28 . And thou deliverest the afflicted people; but thine eyes are against the haughty, [i.e. Proud, lofty persons] thou wilt bring them down.
\p
\v 29 . For thou art my Lamp, [Or, Candle, Light, Lantern: i.e. the cause and author of all my prosperity, joy, and comfort] O LORD; and the LORD causeth my darkness [i.e. adversity, sorrow, grief, misery. See Gen.15.on ver.12.] to clear up. [Heb. properly he causeth my darkness to shine, he maketh it shining, or, glistering.]
\p
\v 30 . For with thee [i.e. By thy mighty, powerful help] I do run thorough [oth. I break, or, break thorough] a band, with my God, I leap over a wall.
\p
\v 31 . Gods way [see Gen.18.on ver.19.] is perfect; [Heb. God, his way is perfect. Oth. God is perfect (in) his way] the word of the LORD is refined: [as metal, that by Goldsmiths at purified and refined from all dross and silth. See Psal.12.7. & 119. 140. Prov.30.5.] he [viz. the LORD] is a Buckler to all that truth in him.
\p
\v 32 . For who is God, save the LORD? [See Deut.32.39. 1 Sam.2.2. Psal.86.8. Isa.45.5.] and who is a rock, save our God? [as above ver.1, 3.]
\p
\v 33 . God is my strength (and) power; [Or, (in the) host] and he hath perfectly opened [Heb. loosened] my way. [my passage, that I could pass in spite of mine enemies, whereas I seemed to be shut up]
\p
\v 34 . He maketh my feet as the Hinds (feet), [viz. Swift and light in running: compare above chap.1.23.] and setteth me upon mine high places. [whereunto Iretired, to be safe and secure from mine enemies; as in Sauls time he was said to do often. Otherwise this may be compared with Deut.32.13. & 33.29. understanding it of the Forts and strong holds, which God enabled David to subdue.]
\p
\v 35 . He teacheth mine hands to fight, [i.e. Maketh them fit for battle] so that a bow of steel [or copper] is broken by mine arms.
\p
\v 36 . Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation; [i.e. Thy saving, conquering, delivering shield; or thy salvation which was as a shield unto me] and (by) thine humble, thou hast made me great. [i.e. by that adversity, which otherwise would have destroyed me, hast wonderfully exalted me, made me great and mighty. Oth. by thy hearing, etc. i.e. in that thou hast heard my prayer. For this it’s said, Psal.18.36. by thy gentlesness, or, meekness.]
\p
\v 37 . Thou hast made room for my foot-step [Or, going, treading] under me; [So that I went on my way freely and firmly to mine enemies, and to put thy people in safety; as in the following words is declared] and my ankles have not wavered.
\p
\v 38 . I pursued mine enemies, [Oth. I will pursue, &c. and so in the following verse] and destroyed them, and turned not again until I had destroyed them.
\p
\v 39 . And consumed them, and thrust them thorough, that they rose not again; but they fell under my feet.
\p
\v 40 . For thou girdedst me about with strength for battle; thou madest them bow down under me, that rose up against me.
\p
\v 41 . And thou gavest6 me the neck of mine enemies, of my haters; [That they fled before me: or, thou hast as it were held forth their neck unto me, that I might cut it off. See Genes.49.on verse 8. Exod.23.27.] and I destroyed them.
\p
\v 42 . They looked out, but there was no deliverer; unto the LORD, but he answered them not.
\p
\v 43 . Then did I beat them (as) small, as the dust of the earth; I stamped them, I spread them abroad, as the mire of the streets.
\p
\v 44 . Thou hast also helped me out from the strivings of my people, [Which Israel had, partly with the Heathen enemies lying round about, which now are ended by my Victories; partly (whereto this seemeth chiefly to look) with my self, in the time of Saul, Isboseth, Absalom, and Seba, who all perished miserably, and Israel did submit themselves with one accord unto me] thou hast kept me (to be) an Head of the Heathen: [i.e. in so many dangers preserved me for the Kingdom] the people (which) I knew not, hath served me.
\p
\v 45 . Strangers [Heb. sons, or, children of a stranger so in the followeth verse] have dissemblingly submitted unto me: [Heb. have lied unto me, feigned, dissembled, played the hypocrites, as hypocrites are wont to do in the prosperity of the godly; see Deut.22.on v.29. The meaning is, strange Nations, that are estranged from God and his people, have vowed obedience and serviceable unto me out of fear, although they meant it not from the heart] Assoon as (their) ear heard (of me), [Heb. at the hearing, or, with the hearing of the ear: as soon as they had heard what God had done for me] they obeyed me.
\p
\v 46 . Strangers did fade away, [As leaves and flowers do wither and fall off] and did gird themselves out of their strong holds. [To encounter me out of their fences, or forts, or came trembling with their weapons out of their close places, being dismayed, and doubting. Oth. did quake; as Psal.18.46.i.e. ran away with quaking and trembling.]
\p
\v 47 . The LORD liveth, and praised [Heb, blessed] be my rock, and exalted [i.e. highly praised] be God, the rock of my salvation:
\p
\v 48 . The God that giveth me perfect vengeance, [Heb. Vengeances; i.e. perfect vengeance] and casteth down the Nations under me.
\p
\v 49 . And that bringeth me firth from mine enemies; and thou exaltest me above them rise up against me, thou deliverest me from the man of all violence. [Heb. of violances, to wit, from Saul, who hath continually hunted after me with wrong and violence; and from others, who with malicious and bold attempt rose up against me. See Psal.5.on v.7. & 140.2, 5.]
\p
\v 50 . Therefore, O LORD, I will praise thee among the Heathen, and I will sing Psalms unto thy Name. [Here David prophesieth of the calling of the Gentiles to the fellowship of the Lord Christ, Rom.15.9. as undoubtedly many other things in this Psalm of praise do look at the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, whose type, or, figure David was.]
\p
\v 51 . (He is) a tower [Oth. That maketh great, as Psal.18.51.] of salvations, [or, victories, see above chap.8.on v.6.] of this King, [i.e.of David] and he sheweth mercy to his anointes, [compare Psal.2.2.] to David, and to his seed [i.e. to David, who was atype and ancestor (according to the flesh) of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is also called David, Jer.30.9. Ezek.34.23, 24. Hos.3.5. and sprung from his seed, Act.13.23. Rom.1.3. having also his own spiritual seed, that is, the children, whom God hath given him, Heb.2.13.] forevermore. [Compare 2 Sam.7.12.13.]
\c 23
\s The last words of David, wherein he testifieth of his Calling by God, to the Kingly and Prophetical Office, vers.1, 2. He prophesieth of the Messiah Jesus Christ, and the happiness under his Government, with the acknowledgement of the faults of his house, and a confession of his confidence in Gods everlasting Covenannt of Grace, 3, etc. Lastly, denounceth everlasting destruction to the Wicked, 6. A relation of David’s Worthies, and their valour, 18.
\p
\v 1 Moreover, these be the last words of David: [Before his death: according to the example of Jacob, Gen.49. and Moseh, Deut.32. and 33.] David, the son of Isai, saith; and the man that was raised up on high, anointed of the God of Jacob, [Lifted up out of low condition and anointed King over Gods people] and pleasant (in) Psalms [which by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost he endited for the church of God] of Israel, saith;
\p
\v 2 . The Spirit of the LORD hath spoken by me, and his speech hath been upon my tongue.
\p
\v 3 . The God of Israel hath said, the Rock [As above chap.22.2. Compare 1 Cor.10.4.] of Israel hath spoken unto me: [oth. of me, meaning that David here relateth the Prophecies, which God had related concerning his person, Kingdom and house, partly to David himself, partly to the prophets, Samuel, Nathan, etc.] (there shall be) a Ruler over men, a righteous ( person), [see Isa.53.11. Jer.23.5, 6. and 33. 15, 16. Zach.9.9. with the annotate.] a ruler (in the) fear of God. [compare Isa.11.2, 3. Understand by this ruler our everlasting spiritual King and Lord Jesus Christ. Whose type David (as also Solomon) was, and of whom God had revealed to him, that he should proceed from his feed, according to the flesh. See Psal, 2.8. and 72.8. Jerem.30.21. Mich.5.1. Others take it as a description of the vertues and duties of Rulers or Governours, applying thereunto also the following resemblance, ver.4. as whereby is signified the graciousness and usefulness of such Rulers, as David and Solomon were, through desective in many things.]
\p
\v 4 . And he shall be as the light of the morning, (when) the sun riseth: of the morning without clouds (when) by the clear shining after the rain, the (tender) grassplants (spring) out of the Earth. [i.e. the coming of the Messiah, and the executing of his soul-saving office, will be so pleasant, acceptable, profitable and fruitful for his church, as the things specified in this resemblance, are for the earth and her increase. Compare herewith Hos.6.3. Psa, 110.3. Item Mal.4.2. Isa.60.1, 2. Luke 1.68. and also Isa.44.3, 4, etc and 55.10, 11, etc.]
\p
\v 5 . Although my house is not so with God, yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, [In these words, and the rest of the verse, David confesseth his own sins and unworthiness, and also the sins and unworthiness of his house. Compare 2 Sam. 7.18, 19, etc. and see 2 Sam. Chapters 11.12, 13, 15, etc. and extolleth on the contrary Gods undeserved bounty shewed to him in the everlasting and changeable covenant of grace, being founded on the Messiah, whose day David (as also Abraham) having seen by faith, thereupon comfortably and Joyfully fell asleep in the LORD. Compare 2 Sam.22.51. and Psa.72.20. with the annotate.] which is well ordered and kept in all things: [i.e. which in Gods everlasting counsel is determined and fore-ordained, to his own glory and the salvation of his people, with all means thereunto belonging, and shall be so firmly kept and preserved to the final fulfilling thereof, that the very gates of hell shall not be able to prevail against it. Compare Mat.16.18. and Acts 13. 23, 32, 33, etc. Eph.1.3, 4, etc. 1 Pet.1, 5, 10, 11, etc.] surely all my salvation is (in it), and all (my) desire, although he make it not (yet) to spring forth. [although the promised sprout or spring of Isai and David, the mediatour of the covenant, the Messiah be not yet come. Compare Isa.4 2. and 11.1 Jer.23.5. and 33.15. Zach.3.8. and 6.12. Some conceive that David in th fourth and fifth verses opposeth one against another, the transitoriness of things related vers.4. and the everlastingness of his Kingdom and House in the Messiah, that should sprout forth from his seed: and translate these two verses thus: 4 and as a light of the morning, (when) the Sun riseth; in the morning (it) being without clouds, by the brightness, by the rain, the grass-shoots (spring) out of the Earth: 5 That ny house will not be so with God: for he hath made me an overlasting covenant, in all things well prepared and kept: surely all my salvation and delight is, that he will not cause it to spring forth, (as which is now already sprouted forth, and shall never perish.)]
\p
\v 6 . But the (men) of Belial, [i.e. reprobate, wicked wretches, despisers and enemies of the Kingdom of Christ. See of this word Deut.23.on v.13.] they shall be all as thornes that are cast away; because they cannot be taken hold of with the hand:
\p
\v 7 . But every man that shall touch them, furnisheth himself with iron and the wood of a spear; [Heb. is filled, etc. that is, he filleth his hand, he furnishethhimself first with some instrument, whereby he may handle the thornes without hurting himself] and they shall be utterly burnt [Heb. burning be burnt] with fire in the same place. [where they grow, or were cast, where they lie. Heb. properly in the sitting place, or place of abode: or seat.]
\p
\v 8 . These are the names of the champions, [Thus are David’s chiefest Officers and Commanders here called, in respect of their special valour, stoutness, undauntedness in the wars. The order appointed by David among them according to their valour and deservings, is very remarkable. See 1 Chron.11.11.] whom David had: Joscheb Baschebeth [1 Chron.11.11. he is called Jascobham] (the son of Tachkimoni [the word son is here inserted out of Chron.11.as also chachmoni is there put for Tachkimoni] the chiefest [Heb. the head] of the commanders. This was Adino the Eznite, (who set himself) against eight hundred, [oth. (who had the upper hand) over, or against, etc.] which were slain (by him) at one time. [compare 1.Chron.11.11. Some conceive that of these eight hundred there died but three hundred upon the place, because this number is only mentioned in the book of Chronicles. Others hold it to be two several victories.]
\p
\v 9 . And after him was Eleazar, the son of Dodo, the son of Ahohi: [1 Chron.11.12. the Ahohite] (this (man) was) among the three champions with David, when they mocked the philistines [or spited, defied them by daring, challenging them, &c. Oth. when they ventured themselves, or despised, or contemned (their souls) against the Philistines, i.e. when they ventured, or hazarded their lives or persons. See Judg.5.18. where that phrase is found so full and entire] (that) were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away.
\p
\v 10 . This (man) arose, and smote among the Philistines, until his hand grew weary, yea his hand clave to the sword; And the LORD wrought a great salvation [Or a great victory, so v.12. and above chap.22.on v.51. see there] that day; and the people returned after him, only to plunder. [i.e. the people that readily run away, turned back again, and followed him, not to sight, (for he had fought and gotten the victory himself alone) but to rob and plunder.]
\p
\v 11 . After him was Sammer, the son of age the Hararite: when the Philistine were gathered together in a village, [Oth. in an heap, or troop, as below v.13.or for forage,provision, to fetch in provision] and there was a piece of ground full of lentils, [as also barley, 1 Chron.11.13. which it may be the Philistines would carry away, or set on fire] and the people fled before the face of the Philistines.
\p
\v 12 . Then he put himself into the midst of the piece, and delivered that, [Or. kept that in] and smote the Philistine; And the LORD wrought a great salvation.
\p
\v 13 . Also three of the thirty heads, [Or, (these) three the chiefest above the thirty] went down and came to David in the harvest-(time), into the cave of Adullam: [see 1 Sam.22.1.] And the Philistines heap [for this is put camp, 1 Chron.11.15. Of the Hebrew word see Psa.68.on v.11.] had camped themselves in the valley of Rephaim. [or, of the Giants. See above chap.5.on v.18.]
\p
\v 14 . And David was then in a strong hold; [See 1 Sam.22.4, 5. Some understand here the foot or tower of Zion, from whence David (having taken it formerly) marched forth to Adullah against the Philistines] And the Garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem.
\p
\v 15 . And David, longed, and said; who will give me to drink water out of the well of Bethlehem, which is in the gate? [i.e. Oh. That any man, etc. a manner of wishing in use among the Hebrews, as elsewhere often.]
\p
\v 16 . Then those three champions brake thorough the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, which is in the gate, and carried it, and came unto David: but he would not drink the same, but poured it out before the LORD;
\p
\v 17 . And said, be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this (I drink) [This is here inserted out of 1 Chron.11.19.] the blood of the men, that went in jeopardy of their lives? [Heb. with, or on their souls. Oth. thus: (Is it not) the blood of the men, that went in jeopardy of their lives] And he would not drink it: This did those three Champions.
\p
\v 18 . And Abisai the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruja, he was also an head of three: [viz. Commanders] and he list up [or tossed, wielded, shook, threw, cast, etc.] his spear against three hundred, who were slain (by him) and he had a name among those three. [whose head he was, but not of the three first that are named verse 8.9.]
\p
\v 19 . Was he not the most honourable of those three? Therefore he was their Chieftain: but he attained not to the (first) three.
\p
\v 20 . Moreover, Benaja, the son of Jojada, the son of a valiant man, great in deeds, of Kabzeel: [Heb. Kabseel. A city lying in the South-end of Juda, Jos.15.21.] he slew two strong lions [Heb. Ariel, i.e. lion of God Some understand by this word properly lions; some men like lions. Others two strong places, called Ariel, which he took, and smote the Garrison thereof] of Moab: he went down also, and smote a lion in the midst of a pit in snow time. [when the wild beasts are most hungry and cruel.]
\p
\v 21 . Besides, he smote an Egyptian man, a man of regard [In respect of great stature, and otherwise eminent. See 1. Chron.11.23.] and in the Egyptians hand was a spear, [see 1 Chron.11.23.] but he went down to him with a staff; and he plucked the spear out of the Egyptians hand; and killed him with his (own) spear.
\p
\v 22 . Those things did Benaja, the son of Jojada: therefore he had a name among the three Champions.
\p
\v 23 . He was the most honourable of the thirty, but he attained not to those (first) three, over his hearkening, or obedience; that is, over the men of his obedience. Understand the guard that were to be continually with and about him, to hear and obey his commands. Some understand here the Kings guard, called the Crethi and the Plethi. See above chap.8.18. and 20.23. Compare 1 Sam.22.14.]
\p
\v 24 . Asahel, the brother of Joab, was among the thirty: Elhanan, the son of Dodo, of Bethlehem.
\p
\v 25 . Samma the Harodite, [See Judg.7.on v.1.] Elike the Harodite.
\p
\v 26 . Halez, the Paltite. Ira, the son of Ikes; the Thekoite. [See above chap.14.on v.2.]
\p
\v 27 . Abiezer, the Anethothite [See Jos.21.18. 1 Kin.2.26. Jer.1.1. and 11.21.] Mebunai, the Husathite.
\p
\v 28 . Zolmon, the Ahohite. Maharai, the Netophathite.
\p
\v 29 . Heleb, the son of Baena, the Netophathite: Ithai, the son of Ribai, of Gibea [See Judg.19. & 20.] of the children of Benjamin.
\p
\v 30 . Benaja, the Pirhathonite. [See Judg.12.on v.13.] Hiddai, of the brooks [or, dales, valleys] of Gaas, [A mountain lying in Ephraim, where Josua was buried, Judg.2.9. and one or more brooks sprung, which ran into the midland sea, as the Maps shew.]
\p
\v 31 . Abi-Albon, the Arbathite, Azmaveth, the Barhamite.
\p
\v 32 . El Jachba, the Saalbonite; of the sons of Jasen, Jonathan.
\p
\v 33 . Summa, the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sarar, the Harorite.
\p
\v 34 . Eliphelet, the son of Ahasbai, the son of a Maachathite: Eliam, the son of Achitophel, the Gilonite. [See above chap.15.12.]
\p
\v 35 . Hezezrai, the Carmelite. Paari, the Arbite.
\p
\v 36 . Jigal, the son of Nathan, of Zoba. Bani, the Gadite.
\p
\v 37 . Zelek the Ammonite: Naharai the Beerothite, [See above chap.4.2.] the armour bearer of Joab, the son Zeruja.
\p
\v 38 . Ira, the Jethrite. Gareb the Jethrite.
\p
\v 39 . Uria the Hethite, seven and thirty in all. [Joab who was Captain General, and the next man to the King, being likewise comprehended in this number (according to the common opinion of Expositors) although it hath not pleased the Holy Ghost to set down his name among them. 1 Chron.11. a great number is mentioned then here, because it may be some are placed in the room of the deceased, or also otherwise added.]
\c 24
\s By a just judgement of God David is stirred up through pride to number the people, v.1.2. Joab and other disswade him from it, but in vain, 3. After that David is sensible of, and acknowledgeth his sin, 10. God by the Prophet Gad propoundeth three judgements to him, to chuse one, 11. At which being greatly distressed, but chuseth the pestilence, which sweepeth away a great number of the people, 14. God commandeth the destroying Angel to cease, wherefore also David, seeing the Angel, humbleth himself and prayeth most devoutly, 16. Gad chargeth David in Gods name, to rear an altar and offer sacrifice on the threshing-floor of Arauna, 18. David buyeth the threshing-floor, and furniture for the offering of Arauna, and offereth there, so the plague ceased, 19.
\p
\v 1 And the Anger of the LORD went on [This seemeth to look at the fore-mentioned three years famine, whereof above chap.21.1. &c.] to kindled against Israel, and be [viz. the Lord] stirred up David against them [to wit, against the Israelites, i.e. for a punishment of the Israelites. Not that he Inspired it unto David, but because in his just judgement, by his secret over-ruling providence, he suffered Satan to do it, and used him as an instrument to punish the Israelites deservedly, and to chastise and humble his servant David, as appeareth by comparison 1 Chron.21.1. where this History is repeated. Oth. among them] saying; [see above chapter 16.on ver.10. and compare 1 Sam.26.19. and 1 Kin.22.22.] go, number Israel and Juda.
\p
\v 2 . The King then said unto Joab the commander in Chief, who was with him: go now about thorough all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Berseba [The two uttermost borders of Canaan, Dan in the North & Berseba in the South] and number the people, [thou and thy company, which thou shalt take along with thee, shall number all that are sit for battle, from twenty years old and upward. See Num.1.3. and below v.9. But some conceive that David’s sin consisted chiefly therein, that David also gave command to number those that were under the age of twenty of years and were sit for war: from whence also (according to their opinion) ariseth the difference of the number, mentioned here v.9. and 1 Chron.21.5.] that I may know the number of the people. [hereby David seemeth, that he was led hereunto by meer curiosity and pride, which Joab and other Officers perceiving, laboured to draw and dissuade David from it. Compare 1 Chron.21.3, 6. and 27.23.]
\p
\v 3 . Then said Joab unto the King; Now the LORD thy God add unto this people so as those and these now are, [so as every tribe now is] an hundred times more, that the eyes of my Lord the King may behold it: But why hath my Lord the King a desire to this thing?
\p
\v 4 . But the Kings word prevail against Joab, and against the commanders of the host: So Joab went out with the commanders of the host, from the face of the King, to number the people Israel.
\p
\v 5 . And they passed over the Jordan, and camped themselves by Aroer, on the right hand of the city, which is in the midst of the brook of Gad, [Aroer lay in the tribe of Gad, in the midst between the two brooks of Arnon, whereof the one ran down into the Jordan, the other into the dead sea. See also Deut.2.36.] and at Jaeze. [lying on the brook Arnon, where it runneth from the North to the South.]
\p
\v 6 . They came also into Gilead [Extending from the brook Arnon unto the Northern borders of Canaan] and in the low land Hodsi [Heb. the land Tachtin Chodschi; which some translate, the land of them that dwell in the low grounds, lately (inhabited, or gained) to wit, in Sauls time as some conceive. See 1 Chron.5.10. Others apply it to the land of the Ammonites and Moabites, whereof above chap.8.2. and 12.v.29, 30, 31. Some hold it to a proper name of certain country] they came also to Dan-Jaan [this is held to be the city of Dan, the Northern border of Canaan, mentioned v.2. formerly called Luis, and Leschen, Jos.19.47. Judg.18.29.] and round about by Zidon. [see Judg.18.on v.7.]
\p
\v 7 . And they came to the strong hold of Tyrus, [See Jos.19.on v.29.] and all the Cities of the Hevites, and of the Cananites: And they went out of the south of Juda at Berseba.
\p
\v 8 . Thus they went about thorough all the Land; and they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
\p
\v 9 . And Joab gave (up) the sum of the people that were numbred [Heb. of the numbring] unto the King: And in Israel were eight hundred thousand warlike men, [viz. (according to the opinion of some) besides the number of those that were ordinary and known souldiers, which amounted to 288000 with their Officers and Commanders, each Commander having under him 24000 as is related, 1 Chron.27. 1, &c. These being likewise reckoned or cast up among this number, we find there or there about the greater number specified, 1 Chron.21.5. See further on v.2.] that drew the sword, [see Judg.8.on v.10.] and the men of Juda were five hundred thousand men. [the ordinary appointed souldiery of Juda (as some conceive) being also reckoned among them, which are left out, 1 Chron.21.5. (because they were already reckoned among the eleven hundred thousand) and whose Commanders are mentioned above chap.23.8, &c. ‘Tis also worthy of observation, that Joab would not number the tribes of Levi and Benjamin, and perhaps neither the city of Jerusalem. See 1 Chron.21.6. and 2.24.]
\p
\v 10 . And David’s heart smote him, [For grief and sorrow, when he thought on his sin commited. See the like phrase 1 Sam.24.6. with the annotate.] after that he had numbred the people: And David said unto the LORD, I have greatly sinned (in) that which I have done, but now O LORD, I beseech thee take away [see above chap.13.on v.13.] the iniquity of thy servant, for I have done very foolishly.
\p
\v 11 . Now when David rose up in the morning, then the word of the LORD came unto the Prophet Gad, [See of this man, 1 sam.22.5.1. Chron.29.29.] David Seer, [see 1 Sam.9.9.] saying;
\p
\v 12 . Go thy waters, and speak unto David; thus saith the LORD; I offer thee [Or lay upon thee] three things: chuse thee one of them, which I may do to thee. [i.e. I offer or propound three judgements unto thee, that which thou shalt chuse, I will lay upon thee, or send thee.]
\p
\v 13 . So Gad came to David, and made him acquainted with it, and said unto him: shall a famine of seven years [The former three years (whereof above ch.21.1.) and the fourth (wherein this happened) being reckoned there with, are the seven years: withal comprehending here under the time, in which the famine ceased; otherwise but three, which number is specified 1 Chron.21.12. Some take seven years for a long time, for which three years are mentioned in the Chronicles. Some conceive that God in dealing with David at first, pronounded seven years, and after that mitigating the same, pro pounded fewer, to wit three] come unto thee in thy land? Or (wilt) thou flee three months before the face of thine Enemies, that they may pursue thee? [Heb. that he (to wit, every one of thine enemies) may pursue thee: Understand withal, & overtaking thee, dealing cruelly with thee. See 1 Chron.21.12.] or that there be three days pestilence in thy land? Now consider and look to (it) what answer I shall carry back to him, that sent me?
\p
\v 14 . Then said David unto Gad: I am in a great straint, let us fall I pray into the hands of the LORD, [So that he himself may chastise us without the intervening of men] for his mercies are many, [or great] but let me not fall into the hand of men. [Heb. of a man, to wit, of mine enemies, with whom I have found no mercy at all.]
\p
\v 15 . Then the LORD gave a pestilence in Israel, from the morning unto the time appointed: [Which God had specified by the Prophet Gad, to wit, for three days together. Some understand by the appointed time, the time of the Evening-offering of the first day: so that the time of David’s repentance and prayers (whereof mention is made in the sequel) was shortened by God] and there died of the people, from Dan to Berseba, [That is, thorough out the whole land; as v.2.] seventy thousand men.
\p
\v 16 . Now when the Angel [Whom God had sent forth for that intent, 1 Chron.21.15.] stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroyed it, [viz. by the pestilence] it repented the LORD [see Gen.6.on v.6.] of that evil, and he said unto the Angel that made the destruction among the people, it is enough, withdraw now thine hand: now the Angel of the LORD was by the threshing floor of Arauna [called below v.18. Arauja, and 1 Chron.21.22. Ornan] the Jebusite. [but converted to the true religion. Jerusalem was formerly called Jebus, and inhabited by the heathenish Jebusites. See Judg.19.10, 12. and 1.21. and above chap.5.6.]
\p
\v 17 . And David when he saw the Angel [For the Angel appeared in the shaped of a man, between heaven and earth, having a drawn sword in sword in his hand, 1 Chron.21.16.] tha smote the people, spake unto the LORD, and said; behold, I, I have sinned, [in numbering the people] and I, I have dealt unjustly, but what have these sheep done? [he meaneth the people, who indeed were innocent as touching this sin of David, but otherwise had justly deserved this punishment] Let thine hand I pray be against me, and against my fathers house. [i.e. my kinsmen that have also advised me, or at least not disswaded me.]
\p
\v 18 . And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him; go up [Out of thy strong hold, to the mount called Morija, where Arauna dwelt, where Abraham was commanded to offer up his son, Gen.22.v.14. and afterward the temple was built. See 2 Chron.3.1. and 1 Chron.22. etc.] rear an altar unto the LORD, on the threshing-floor of Arauja [above and below called Arauna] the Jebusite.
\p
\v 19 . So David went up according to the word of Gad, according as the LORD had commanded. [By the Angel whom God had charged to inform the Prophet Gad thereof, 1 Chron.21.18.]
\p
\v 20 . And Arauna looked and saw the King and his servants coming over to him; so Arauna went out and bowed himself before the King with his face toward the ground.
\p
\v 21 . And Arauna said; wherefore cometh my lord the King unto his servant? [i.e. unto me] and David said; to buy of thee this threshing-floor, to build an altar unto 16 48.] from the people.
\p
\v 22 . Then said Arauna unto David; Let my Lord the King take and offer (up) that which is good in his eyes, [That which pleaseth him] behold there (be) the oxen [for Aurana was busy with threshing, whereunto oxen were used, that drew about the threshing-cart, or fledge over the corn: see Deut.25.on ver.4.] for burnt-offering and the sledges, and the instruments of the oxen for wood. [to set the offering on fire.]
\p
\v 23 . All these things did Arauna the King [Some think that he is called a King, because he himself here so bountiful, as if he had been a King. Others conceive, that he was a King of the Jebusites, before David took the hold of Zion. Others think, that his surname was King] give [as much as concerning him: but David would not accept of it] unto the King: moreover, Arauna said unto the King; The LORD God take delight in thee, [i.e. Manifest, that he doth graciously behold and accept thee, and also thy ways and offerings in the Messiah: whereof a clearer evidence appeared by the fire, which God sent from heaven upon the Altar of burnt-offering, 1 Chron.21.26.]
\p
\v 24 . But the King said unto Arauna; Nay, but I will surely buy [Heb. buying buy] it of thee for the price, for I will not offer burnt-offerings unto the LORD my God for nothing: [Which are given me by another for nothing, but of that which is mine own] so David bought the threshing-floor, and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. [This is to be understood of the price of the Oxen, and of the other furniture: for he bought the whole place or parcel of ground for six hundred shekels of gold, 1 Chron.21.25. Some conceive that here is spoken of the bargain of the threshing-floor, and of the Oxen; but 1 Chronicles 21.29. of the bargain of the whole place, or plat of ground, whereon the Temple was built. Of shekels of gold, see Gen.24.on v.22.]
\p
\v 25 . And David built there an Altar unto the Lord, and offered burnt-offerings and thank-offerings: So the LORD was entreated fro the Land, [i.e. Reconciled to the inhabitants of the land, by the means of Prayers, made in Faith on the Messiah, and his onely Proprietary sacrifice, whereof these Offerings were a Type and Figure.]
