\mt2 THE
\mt REVELATON
\mt2 OF JOHN THE THEOLOGUE, OR DIVINE
\p THEOLOGUE, [That is, such a one as speaks of God and Divine things. Thus John is called here, according to the opinion of many ancient Doctors, because, that as well in the beginning of his Gospel and First Epistle, as also in this Revelation, he doth most plainly and abundantly speak of the Godhead of Christ; as likewise, that all this Book of his is full of Divine Visions and Mysteries. So that those are much mistaken, who by reason of this Attribute, would have us believe, that not the Apostle, but another John, was the Penman of this Book; When as the ancientest Doctors in Christendom, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Clemens, Origenes, Hieronymus and many others, never scrupled it, and the universal Church, ever held it to be the same Evangelist’s work. As also his being sent into the Island Patmos, and his own name several times set down here, by itself, without any additions, after the example of the Prophets, sufficiently showeth, besides his calling of Christ the Word of God, chapter 19. Which is peculiar to this Apostles style and writing. The divinity of this book itself also, and the fulfilling of many of its prophesies, already manifested to the whole world, are sufficient proofs, that none but an Apostle of Christ and inspired by his Spirit, could have written this book.]
\s THE ARGUMENT OF THIS BOOK
\p This Book addressed unto the Church by way of an Epistle, is the last book of the New Testament, and as it were the Obsignation or sealing up for the same, and was written by the Apostle john, according to testimony of the ancient Writers, about threescore and four years after the Ascension of Christ into heaven, towards the latter end of the Emperor Domitian his reign, by whom, besides many other persecutions of the Christians under him, John himself also was banished into the island Patmos, where this same Revelation was made unto him, for the comfort and warning of the Christian Church, as himself intimateth, chapter 19. And though some of the ancient Doctors, are of opinion, that John wrote his Gospel after his deliverance out of Patmos, at the request of the Churches of Asia; yet it seems more probable, from the second verse of the first chapter, and otherwise, that this Revelation was penned by him last of all: and in regard of the matters therein contained, both John himself and the Christian Church after him, found good, with this book to end and conclude the whole new Testament, as also the strict warnings towards the end of this book, of adding or abating any thing, chapter 22. 18, 19. Do import. This writing, though (as a prophetical book, treating much of prophetical matters) it abounds with many passages difficult to the understood; yet it is full also of divine instructions, serving to confute many Heresies sprung up already, and especially to inform the Church of Christ what troubles they were to expect in after-times from the Devil and his instrument, chiefly from Antichrist and his ministers, as also of the heavy punishments which from time to time, especially in the last judgement, should light upon the enemies of the Church; together with the wonderful deliverances which God likewise from time to time would show to his Church, and principally the happy issue out and overcoming of all their adversities and adversaries, and the unspeakable glory and blessedness, which after the coming of Christ to judgement, they should for ever enjoy in the heavenly Jerusalem,. This book may fitly be divided into three parts. The first is the preface, contained in the beginning of the first chapter To ver. 9. The second is a relation of prophetical Visions and Predictions of things that were to happen to the Church of Christ, from that time forwards unto the end of the world, from the 9. Verse of chapter 1. Unto the 6. Verse of the last chapter, from whence unto the end of the chapter you have the sealing up of the book, as also of the whole new Testament. As for the Predictions beginning chap.1. ver. 9. And ending chapter 22. Ver. 6. They are held forth by several Divisions and prophetical visions, whereof some of like nature are to be found likewise in some of the Prophets of the Old Testament, viz. Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Zacharias and others, as shall be showed in the Annotations: as it hath pleased God to hold forth things to come, sometimes in plain terms, other whiles under obscure shadows and visions, as well the more to stir up our diligence in searching after the same, as also the better to show forth the greatness and weight of them: so doth he likewise especially by John here, because that in this prophecy there are many things foretold, concerning the plagues and changes of the Roman Empire, which, if matters have been too plain, might have taken occasion thence, to have persecuted the Christians more grievously. Which was the reason also that Paul handling the same matter, 2 Thes. 2. He makes use of covert expressions. The visions contained in this Revelations are especially seven. The first begins from chapter 1. Ver. 9. And ends with the third chapter, holding forth Christ unto us in his Kingly and Priestly estate, walking among the Seven Candlesticks or Churches: together with his commands or precepts to be sent in writing unto the Seven Churches of Asia, with whom John had most conversed, and the writings or letters to them all respectively in that behalf. The second Vision is a Vision of the glory of God’s sitting on his Throne, and of the Lamb, standing upon the Throne, encompassed with the 24. Elders, and 4. Beasts, together with the book sealed with seven seals; and the wonderful things which happened in the world at the opening of every Seal, which Vision extends to the end of the Seventh chapter. The third Vision is the apparition of the Seven Angels with their Trumpets succeeding one another, ending with chapter 11. The fourth Vision is that of the woman in travel, persecuted by the Dragon into the wilderness, and of the two beasts persecuting the Saints, and withstood by the Lamb, standing on mount Sion, accompanied with 124000 followers, chapter 12, 13, and 14. The fifth vision is that of the seven Vials, and so many plagues poured forth thence upon the throne of the Beast, described chapter 15, and 16. Whereupon follows in the Sixth Vision, the Description of the whore of Babel, sitting upon a beast with seven heads, that is to say, the City built on seven hills, and the heavy judgement of God upon her, and upon the beast; together with the song of triumph sung by the heavenly host, accompanied with Christ their head, upon their victory, chapter 17, 18, and 19. The seventh vision sets forth the binding of Satan for a thousand years, together with his being let loose again for a short time, and the fulfilling of all things ensuing thereupon, by the last judgement of God past upon the Devil, death, and all the wicked, and by the coming down of the heavenly Jerusalem, to be a glorious and everlasting habitation of all the elect, contained in the 20, 21. And first part of the 22. Chapter.

\s John, having related from and by whom he received this Revelation, 1. And how blessed those are which read and keep the same. 3. Wisheth grace and peace to the seven Churches in Asia, from God, from the seven spirits, and from Jesus Christ; whose person, Benefits and Coming to judgement, (wherein this Book is to end) he describeth more at large: 4 after that he comes to the Revelation was made unto him, 9. And setteth down the voice of him, that gave him charge to write this, 11. Then he relates the first vision of the Seven golden Candlesticks, 12. And of the Person of Christ, in a very glorious condition, 13. As also how greatly he was terrified at this vision, and how Christ revived him, 17. And charged him to write , 19. Together with a declaring, what is to be understood by the seven Stars and Candlesticks, 20.
\p
\v 1 The Revelation [Gr. Apocalypsis, which word is retained both in the vulgar Latine, and divers other Translations, signifying a Revelation or Discovery of secret or hidden things, as this word is generally taken for a Revelation of things to come yet in after times, as is used here, as the Title of the Book, in manner as the Prophets we want to prefix the like before theirs. See Isa. 1. 1. Hos. 1. 1. Joel 1. 1. Mich. 1. 1.] of Jesus Christ which God [viz. the Father, as appears by the sequel] gave him [viz. to Jesus Christ, as Mediator, and in respect of his human nature. For as eternal God he is of one and the same Essence and Omniscience with the Father: but, as Mediator, he receiveth order and command from the Father, and according to his human nature, the knowledge of those things themselves, which were requisite for the execution of his Mediatorship, and for the salvation of his church. See John 1. 16. And chapter 3. 3, 32, etc.] for to show, [viz. not only by words, but also by visions and represantations] the things which must soon come to pass: [this is said, in regard of the beginnings of those things, which were thenceforward to hold on their courses, unto the last day. 2 Pet. 3. 8, 9.] and which he sent by his Angel, and made known to his servant John:
\p
\v 2 . Who [viz. John] testified the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, and all that he saw. [i.e. that testimony of Jesus Christ his person, preaching, miracles, suffering, dying, and glorification. See the like also in Peter, 2 Pet. 1. 16. etc. Some indeed apply all this to matters ensuing in this Revelation; but, it seeming more probable, that John saith this to win the more credit to what he holds forth here, and that the ensuing prophecy, may find the better reception and entertainment; therefore others take it to have respect to his former Evangelical and Apostolical preachings and writings, Christ, as he speaketh also in his Gospel, chapter 19. 35. And 21. 24. And in his first Epistle, chapter 1. V. 1. And as it is said of the Apostles in general, Luke 1. 2. Yet it may well be understood here both ways.]
\p
\v 3 . Blessed is he who readeth this, and are they that hear the word of this prophecy, and who keep that which these things shall begin to come to pass, and that the faithful shall therefore have cause to take comfort in the judgements of God against their oppressors, and in the happy issue of their Tribulations; which are the two main things, set forth throughout this book; near at hand, they being to come and surprise men on a sudden, unawares. See Mat. 24. 43, etc. 1 Thes. 5. 2, 4. 2 Pet. 3. 10. Rev. 3. 3.]
\p
\v 4 . John, to the seven Churches, which are in Asia: [Meaning the lesser Asia, called Anatolia now, or Natolia, wherein all those cities lay, from whom these churches were denominated, here spoken of, and called by their, proper names, below v. 11. Being first instituted by Paul, and afterwards further built up, and more and more confirmed by John, as the longest-lived of all the Apostles, as well the old Ecclesiastical histories testify, and that he died at Ephesus. Yet under these seven all the rest of the Churches of Christ are likewise to be understood, seeing that some of those Churches perished or were destroyed not very long after the time of this Apostle; which also is the reason, why in the conclusion of every one of the Epistles written to them in this book, this Memento is added, He that ears hear, let him hear, what the Spirit saith unto the Churches] Grace be unto you, and peace, from him, that is and that was and that shall come: [hereby is understood the eternal unchangeable Godhead of the Father; withal the Apostle elegantly expresseth thereby the name of Ehejeh, that is, I shall be, which God doth give unto himself, Ex. 2. 14. And the name of Jehova, whereby the self-subsisting unchangeable God is called throughout the old Testament] and from the seven Spirits, which are before his throne. [some understand hereby the seven Angels, several times mentioned in this book, and joined here with God, in this with of grace and peace, as instruments of God, and the means whereby God doth safe-guard and protect his Church, and often imparts his grace to men, as Paul, 1 Tim. 5. 21. Bears record, before God and his Elect Angels: Yet forasmuch as in this wish for grace and peace, the same thing is prayed in the same terms from seven spirits, as it is prayed from God; and afterwards from Christ, and which no mere creature is able to give, Isa. 42. 8. Jam. 1. 17. Therefore by these seven spirits here there must be understood the Holy Ghost, who is also himself a giver of this Gospel-grace and peace, 2 Cor. 13. 13. And therefore called seven spirits, from the pouring out of his gifts upon those churches, in that abundant manner, as if he were seven spirits, or a sevenfold spirit. And this exposition is evident also by this, that these seven spirits, chapter 4. 5. Are expressly called seven lamps of fire, burning before the Throne. That is, the manifold wisdom and gifts of the Holy Ghost, which in a singular manner illustrated and adorned the Throne: As also chapt. 5. 6. The horns and eyes, i.e. the Power and wisdom of the Lamb: and that they are put here in one and the degree between God and Christ. And the Holy Ghost with his gifts is therefore put here between the Father and Christ, because the Apostle was to enlarge himself in the sequel about Christ, his benefits and qualifications.]
\p
\v 5 . And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness the first-born from the dead, [He namely, that brought the Gospel unto us, out of the bosom of the Father, and sealed it by his death, John 1. 18. 1 Tim. 6. 13.] loved us and washed from our sins, in his blood, [i.e. by his bloody death and sacrifice, Heb. 9. 14.]
\p
\v 6 . And that made us Kings and Priests to God and his Father: [Namely, to reign spiritually over sin and the world, and to offer up unto God the spiritual sacrifices of thanksgiving for our deliverance. See 1 Pet. 2. 5, 9.] unto him (I say) be the glory and the power into all eternity, Amen.
\p
\v 7 . Behold, he cometh [i.e. he shall come] with the clouds, [viz. at the last day, in his glory, for to judge all men, sitting in the clouds, as in his Tribunal or Judgement-seat. See Dan. 7. 13. Wherewith he shall conclude the fulfilling of this book] and every eye shall see him, [i.e. not only the true believers, but the unbelievers also, as appears by the sequel] even those that pierced him through: [i.e. that crucified him and put him to death, so as the Jews and Gentiles dealt with him in his person, and daily continued his church-members. This passage is taken out of Zach. 12. 10. Where the same words are Prophetically spoken of God, which here are applied unto the son of God, viz. unto Christ, that same God] and all the families of the Earth shall mourn over him: [or, for him. These words seem to be onely applyable in Zachary, unto the Tribes and Families of Israel: but it is well known, that under them are generally to be understood and comprehended the Gentiles also, such as were to be called to the Church of Christ under the New Testament; and therefore this place may well be understood of all Nations, both Jews and Gentiles, some whereof being converted with grief and sorrow for their former sins and transgressions against Christ and his Church, should likewise show forth their conversion at the coming of Christ, with cheerfulness; when as the obstinate remainder should be terrified to see him come to judgement; as the words of Zachary also may well be understood of both] yea, Amen. [i.e. even so be it, or let It come to pass. And by this double asseveration there is expressed the earnest and vehement desire of that Prophet and the rest of the faithful, and by the change of the languages, Greek and Hebrew, there is not unfitly intimated, that the wish foregoing doth appertain in common to all the believers both the Greek or Gentile, and the Hebrews or Jews. See below ch. 22. 20.]
\p
\v 8 . I am the Alpha and the Omega, [This kind of speaking is taken from the Greek Alphabet, in which Language John wrote this book, A, called Alpha by them, being their first letter, and their great O, which they call Omega, the last, as is declared also in the Text itself] the beginning and the end, [viz. of all thing, which is said of God, not onely, because he was before all creatures from eternity, and for all their altering or perishing, continueth the same still, Heb. 1. 11, 12. But also because he is the Author and the end of all, all things being of him, and for his glory, Prov. 16. 4. Rom. 11. 36. See also Isa. 41. 4. And 44. 6.] saith the LORD, that is, and that was, and that shall come, the Almighty. [i.e. the Lord Christ, revealing himself here unto John, and being spoken of before v. 7. Unto whom, as to the only true God, these attributes are expressly also ascribed below vers. 11 and 17. And chapter 22. 13.]
\p
\v 9 . I John, [Here beginneth the Revelation it self, and the Apostle expresseth his name, after the manner of the Prophets, Jeremy, Daniel and others, who were wont in such like predictions, to set down their name sometimes, as also the places and occasions wherein such Revelations were made unto them, for further confirmation of the things] that am your brother also, and partaker in the affliction and in the kingdom, and (in) the patience of Jesus Christ, was in the Island Patmos, [lying in the Mediterranean and Egean Sea, one of those which are called the Cyclades, into which the Apostle John was banished by the Emperor Dominion, as it is left recorded, by Eusebius, hist. Eccle. 3. C. 16. And Hieron. In Catal. Script. Eccl. For the Gospel’s sake, as followers in the Text] for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 10 . (And) I was in the Spirit, [i.e. an Extasis, or rapture of senses, by the holy spirit, such as happened to Peter, Acts 10. 10. And to Paul, by his own relation, 2 Cor. 12. 2. And to the Prophets also generally] on the Lord’s day [i.e. on the first day of the week, so called, because that Christ arose on that day, and because that the service of God was there already used among the Christians on that day instead of the Sabbath, as all the ancient Doctors witness, and is to be gathered besides from Act. 20. 7. And 1 Cor. 16. 2. Upon this day then consecrated to the service of God, John being in a place, where it seems there were no Congregations as yet, this Revelation was made unto him] and I heard from behind me a great voice, as of trumpet: for that it was a speaking voice, appears by the sequel.]
\p
\v 11 . Saying, I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, [See hereof above v. 8.] and, that which thou seest, write the same in a book, [or little book] and send it to the seven Churches, which are in Asia, (namely) at Ephesus, [this was the Metropolis, or chief city in the lesser Asia, situate in the Jonian Sea, where Paul preached a long while, Act. 19. 1., etc. and to the church whereof he write that famous Epistle to the Ephesians] and to Symrna, and to Pergamus, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea. [these six cities lay likewise in the same lesser Asia. Of Syrmna and Pergamus there is no further mention made in the Scripture, nor of Sardis and Philadelphia, but of Thyatira we read, Act. 16. 14. Concerning the conversion of Lydia the Purple dealer; and of Laodicea, in the Epistle to the Colossians, chapter 4. 15, 16. Pliny reports that some of these Cities not very long after the time here treated of perished by an Earth-quake.]
\p
\v 12 . And I turned myself about, for to see the voice, that had spoken with me: [i.e. him whose voice I heard in speaking] and having turned my self about, I saw seven aforesaid Churches, which were as precious as gold to men in God’s sight, as is explained below verse 20. And this similitude is taken from the Golden Candlestick, that was in the Holy place of the Tabernacle, and which the Priests were to furnish night and day, wwith oil in the Lamps thereof, Lev. 24. 2. The same similitude, you find also, Zach. 4. 2. And thereby are represented, the gifts and enlightnings of the holy Ghost, and by the watchfulness and diligence of the Priests, the dispensing of the Word and Sacrements in the Church; whereof all the care and honour is ascribed here alone to Christ, as the only Priest of the New Testament.]
\p
\v 13 . And in the midst of the seven Candlesticks, one, being like unto the Son of man, [i.e. to Christ Jesus, called son of man throughout all the Gospel, and here vision, and not in his person; and that in such a shape, as is not natural to him, but suitable only to his attributes and operations, which are the things here aimed at, As elsewhere he is represented as a Lamb, elsewhere as sitting or horse-back, elsewhere otherwise in this very Revelation. And he is called the son of man, not only, because he is true man, made of a woman, but also because he is the same, of whom Daniel prophesied, ch. 7. 13. And who appeared likewise unto Daniel in the shape. Or, one that was like to a son of man, i.e. to a man] clothed with a long garment (down) to feet. [which was properly a priestly habit, Exod. 28, 4. 40. And 39. 27.] and girded about on the breasts with a golden girdle: [the being girt showeth the readiness of administering his office, the gold his worthiness.]
\p
\v 14 . And his head and hair was white, like unto white wool, like snow: [Thereby is signified the wisdom and eternity of Christ, as also the same attributes of God the Father are thus shadowed forth, Dan. 7. 9.] and his eyes like to a flame of fire: [this and the following similitudes are mostly taken out of Dan. 10. 8. Where a vision much like to this appeared unto Daniel. By the flame of fire is understood his omniscience and all penetrating eye, looking into the very hearts of men, as is to be gathered from Rev. 2,18, 19, 23.]
\p
\v 15 . And his feet were like unto shining-brass, [Gr. Chalkolihano, that is to say metal out of Libanon, or, fine Copper, the like is mentioned in the vision, Ezek. 1. 7. And Dan. 10. 6. Whereby is set forth the steadfastness and invincible strength of Christ, which none can venture upon without hurt to himself, and whereby he can subdue all things] and glowed as in an oven: And his voice, as a voice of many waters. [viz. such as come running down from Rocks with such force and abundance, that they cannot be stopped. This represents the voice of Christ, passing through all Tongues and Nations; according as this word waters is explained by the Angels themselves, bel. Ch. 17. 15.]
\p
\v 16 . And he had seven stars in his right hand: [These stars are bel. v. 20. Explained to be the Angels, or Overseers of the Churches, likened unto stars, because they ought to shine before the Churches with their good life and doctrine, as the stars do before men in their travels and voyages. And they are said to be in the right hand of Christ, forasmuch as he doth send, govern and protect them, and by them is powerful in the hearts of men, and mighty also, in case they do not duely mind and attend their charge, to punish them; as may be seen chapter 2, 1, etc.] and out of his mouth (there) went a two edged sword: [the sword of this word, holding forth his promises on the one side, for the comfort and protection of the godly, and his threatening on the other for the terror and punishment of the disobedient, as is declared ch. 2. 16. And 19. 15.] and his countenance was as the Sun shineth in his strength. [hereby is set forth the glory of Christ, as also of the faithful hereafter in the life to come, Mat. 13. 43. Who nevertheless have non but from Christ and by Christ.]
\p
\v 17 . And when I saw him, I fell (down) as dead, to his feet: [viz. partly out of reverence, and partly being terrified; the like happened to Daniel, chapter 8. 18. And 10. 8, etc. and to others also] and he laid his right (hard) upon me, saying to me; fear not: I am the first and the last: [see above on v. 8. And 11.]
\p
\v 18 . And that am alive, and I have been dead: [Oth. And I was the living (one) and was dead: For Christ being dead after the flesh, remained alive nevertheless after the Spirit, that is to say, according to his divine nature; as now also he liveth for ever according to both] and behold I am alive into all eternity. Amen. And I have the keys of Hell and Death: [i.e. the power to deliver thee from Death and Hell, and to cast the Enemies into them. See Mat. 10. 28.]
\p
\v 19 . Write that which thou hast seen, [viz. in this vision. Others take it more at large, for all that the Apostle had seen in the church of Christ, until the time of Christ’s ascension into heaven. But the first verse of this chapter, as also the first of the fourth, make against this opinion] and that which is, [i.e. the present state and condition of the seven churches, and that which I am now about to charge thee with for to write unto them, which is performed in the two following chapters] and that which shall come to pass after this. [viz. the rest of this Revelation from the fourth chapter to the end of the Book.]
\p
\v 20 . The mystery of the seven stars, which thou sawest in my right (hand), and the seven candlesticks. The seven stars, are [i.e. signify, betoken, represent, as Gen. 41. 27. And frequently in holy writ. Of these seven stars and seven candlesticks, see the annotate above on v. 12. And 16.] the Angels of the seven churches: [i.e. the Teachers or Overseers of the seven churches, even as the Priests and Prophets are sometimes also called Angels, they being sent forth by God, for to teach Gods way unto the people to exhort, and warn and comfort them. See Judg. 2. 1. Hag. 1. 13. Malach. 2. 7.]
\c 2
\s Christ chargeth John to write, first, to the Angel of the church of Ephesus, 1. Whom he commendeth for his care and diligence, in withstanding the bad, and for divers other virtues, 2. But reproves him for the remissness of his first zeal and love, 4. Promising to the overcomers, to give them of the Tree of Life, 7. Secondly, to him of Smyrna, whom he likewise commends for sundry virtues, 8. But warns him of the afflictions that should come upon him, with a promise of the crown of life unto the overcomers, 10. Thirdly, to him of Pergamus, whom he commends for his steadfastness of withstanding the followers of the doctrine of Balaam and the Nicolaites, 12. Promising nevertheless unto the overcomers, the hidden Manna, with a white Electing-stone, 17. Fourthly, to him of Thytira, whom he commends for his growth in good things, 18. But rebukes him for suffering Jezebel to prophecy, 20. Threatening to punish her, with her adherents and children, 22. And warning such as did not embrace those depths of Satan, to keep close to that which they had, 25. With promise to the overcomer, to give him power over the heathen, and the morning star, 26.
\p
\v 1 Write to the Angel of the church of Ephesus, [i.e. to the Overseer, Inspector, or Pastor of that church, as it is explained, chapt. 1. 20. And this is set down here in the singular number, either in regard of their whole College, as Malach. 2. 7. Under the name of Angel in the singular, the whole College of the Priests was to be understood, or because that some one of them had the precedence among them in order, by whom it was to be communicated to the rest, as appears by Acts 20. 17, 28. That there were more Elders or Overseers in this church of Ephesus, whom Paul chargeth in his last farewell, to take heed unto themselves, and to the whole flock, over which the Holy Ghost had made them Episcopous, that is to say, Overseers, for to feed the flock. So that it is groundless to infer from hence an Episcopal authority of one person above the rest. For the very matter itself, written here to the Angel of the church, is written for a warning to the whole church, as appears by v. 7. Here, and above chapter 1. 11.] this saith he, that holdeth the seven stars in his right (hand), [viz. Christ, to whom this description is appropriated, above chapter 1. 13, 16. Where it is likewise explained] that walketh in the midst of the seven golden Candlesticks: [to provide and furnish them with their spiritual light and adornment (as the Priests were wont to do it outwardly) to take care and heed of their good order and government: not as being every where present with his body, but because he is ever with his churches by his spirit and word, thereby enlightening and governing them, according to his promise, Mat. 18. V. 20. And 28. 20. See the like Lev. 26. 12.]
\p
\v 2 . I know thy works, [i.e. all thy practice, good and evil, as the sequel showeth. And Christ speaketh here, not of a mere bare knowing, but of such an one as is joined with an operative care purpose, to reward or punish the same, as appeareth plainly in this and all the Epistles following] and thy labour, [viz. thy constant teaching and exhorting. See 1 Thes. 5. 12. 1 Tim. 5. 17.] and thy patience: [in bearing of persecutions, as is further declared, v. 3.] and that thou canst not bear the evil ones : [i.e. such as are scandalous in life and doctrine. Thus their zeal is condemned here in the exercise of Ecclesiastical discipline] and (that) thou hast tried [Gr. Tempted, or, search, proved, sifted out, and discovered the falsehood of] those that gave out themselves to be Apostles, [i.e. such as pretended they were sent by Christ, there being many false Teachers and false Apostles risen up already in the churches, Acts 20. 29, etc. 2 Cor. 11. 13, etc.] and they are not: and hast found them liars.
\p
\v 3 . And thou hast born, and hast patience: and thou hast labored for my name’s sake, and didst not grow weary.
\p
\v 4 . But I have against thee, that thou hast forsaken thy first love [i.e. thy first zeal, in practicing thy duty and the works of love, as is showed further verse 5.]
\p
\v 5 . Remember then from whence thou art fallen, [i.e. from how great a zeal into how great a remissness]] and convert thyself, [viz. unto thy former zeal. For that he was not wholly fallen away from the Love and from the Faith, appears plainly by the commendation given him by Christ himself in the second and third verses before, and in the sixth following] and do the first works: And if not, I shall come (upon) thee suddenly, [viz. with my punishments and chastisements] and shall remove thy Candlestick he means the church here spoken of, as above chapter 1. 20. Whence it appears that the church also itself was fallen into that remissness, whom Christ by this communication, labours to rose up again to their former zeal. For, albeit that Christ’s church never perisheth, Mat. 16. 18. Yet it comes to pass, that she is removed now and then one place to another, as Christ threateneth the Jews, Mat. 21. 43.]
\p
\v 6 . But this thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaites, whom I also hate. [This sect of the Nicolaites, as some ancient writers witness, taught, that whoredome was no sin, and that it was lawful to eat that which was sacrificed to idols; against which the Apostles had determined, Acts 15. 29. Some think, that Nicolaus, one of the first Deacons, Acts 6. 5. Was the first Author thereof, as being fallen away from the purity of the doctrine of Christ, like another Judas; though others clear this man of it, ascribing it to another Nicolaus, that brought it in, abusing the name of the former Nicolaus in that behalf. See Euseb. Hist. l. 3. C. 26. And Irene. L. 1. c. 7.]
\p
\v 7 . He that hath ears [Gr. An ear. See Matth. 13. 43. Mark 4. 9.] let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches, To him that overcometh, I will give to eat of the tree of life, that is in the midst of the Paradise of God. [Gr. Word of life. This hath respect to the tree of life, that stood in the midst of the earthly paradise, Gen. 2. 9. Which paradise is taken as a type and shadowing forth of heaven, or the habitation of the Elect in heaven, as also Luk. 23. 43. And 2 Cor. 12. 24. The tree of life is a shadow of Christ the Author of life, of whom such as persevere in faith shall participate for ever; as likewise hereafter that tree of life is to stand planted in the new Jerusalem, below, chapter 22. 2. Whose leaves serve for the healing of the Gentiles, the virtue whereof proceedeth only from Christ, John 11. 25. Acts 4. 12.]
\p
\v 8 . And write to the Angel of the Church [See the annotate. on ver. 1.] of these at Smyrna, [this was what near to the North and Ephesus, whereof this was a Colony in a manner] this saith the First and the Last, [see the annotate chapter 1. On ver. 8.] he that was dead, [viz. after this human nature, 1 Pet. 3. 18.] and is become alive (again) [viz. through his resurrection from the dead, or was living, viz. according to his divine nature, whilist he was dead according to his humanity.]
\p
\v 9 . I know thy works, and affliction, and poverty [viz. by being bereft and spoiled of thy goods in thy affliction] but thou art rich [viz. after the Spirit, or in spiritual and heavenly goods, which no enemy is able to despoil thee of, Mat. 6. 19.] and the blasphemy of those that say they are Jews [i.e. boast of it, and that therefore they are Gods people, and zealous maintainers of the Law. Ro. 2. 17. & c. these made no scruple of blaspheming Christ, as a seducer, and his Church as so many enemies of the Law, apostates from Moseh, and seditious persons; as find it upon record in the Gospel and Acts of the Apostles, and they persecuted the Christians under that pretence all along. See Acts 13. 50. And 14. 2. And elsewhere] and are not [i.e. they are no true Jews, nor Abrahams children, as they boast; but rather the children of the Devil, whose works they follow, Joh. 8. 39. Etc.] but are a Synagogue of Satan. [that is to say, a congregation; the Apostle makes use of the word Synagogue, because the Jews used to call their Assemblies or Churches thus.]
\p
\v 10 . Fear none of these things which thou art to suffer: [viz. so as, that it should make thee to shrink back, or to grow faint hearted] behold, the Devil shall cast some of you into prison [viz. by his instruments, the Tyrants and others whom he shall raise and instigate against you, for to do you all the ignominy and mischief they can devise] that ye may be tried: [or, proved, viz. whether ye be steadfast in the truth] and ye shall have an affliction for ten days. [some take these days to signify so many years, as Numb. 14. 34. And we read that soon after this time here spoken of there was a persecution raised against the Christians, under the Emperor Trajan, for ten years together. Others take it for a short or small time, as Hos. 6. 2. In regard that this is brought in here, by way of comfort] Be faithful unto death, [i.e. so as not to be terrified with death itself, or unto the end, to the last and utmost] and I will give thee the crown of life. [i.e. everlasting life, as a crown, or gracious recompense for your labour, 1 Pet. 5 4. A comparison taken from those that combat or run a race for a prize, so 2 Tim. 4. 7, 8.]
\p
\v 11 . He that hath ears to hear, let him hear, what the spirit saith unto the Churches: He that overcometh shall not be hurt by the second death. [i.e. by everlasting death: for even as the first death is a separation and seclusion of man of God, joined with everlasting pains and torments in Hell, as John declareth it, bel. chapter 20. 14. And 21. 8.]
\p
\v 12 . And write to the Angel of the church that is in Pergamos; [This was a principal city of a part of Asia the less, where the Attalian kings kept Court formerly, and where at this time the Roman Gorvenours resided; which City was full of pride, violence, whoredom and idolatry, there being a Temple in it then, where the Devil used to give answers by the name of Esculapius, as the heathen-writers testify; where also the Christian Church was most persecuted and oppressed, and disturbed with great heresies] this saith he, that hath the two edged sword. [See the annotate above chapter 1. On ver. 16.]
\p
\v 13 . I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, (namely) where the throne of Satan is: [Christ calleth this city here the throne of Satan, because that Satan bare sway there in a special manner by Idolatry and Tyrany; according as hereafter the throne of the Dragon is given to the beast with seven heads and ten horns, chapter 13. 2.] and thou keepest my name, and hast not denied my faith, [i.e. thou art not afraid to profess my Name, notwithstanding all the difficulties thou encounterest with in that behalf] even in these days wherein Antipas was my faithful witness, who was put to death with you, where Satan dwelleth. [of this Antipas there is but little mention made in the Old Ecclesiastical Histories; but it seems by this place that he was a principal Overseer or Pastor of that Church, who having suffered as a Martyr or witness of the truth of Christ, and sealed the same with his death, is brought in here and set before the eyes of that Church, as an example for their imitation.]
\p
\v 14 . But I have (some) few things against thee, that thou hast there [i.e. sufferest to converse and teach among you, as is further declared below, ver. 20. Without removing them by Ecclesiastical censure from among you: the contrary practice whereof is commended in the Angel of the Church of Ephesus, above ver. 2.] those that keep the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast an offence before the children of Israel, that they might eat idols-sacrifices, and commit fornication [of this story, see Numb. 22, 23, and 24. Chapters for when God would not suffer Balaam to curse the Israelites, he for the love of filthy lucre, notwithstanding gave counsel to Balak, to entice and seduce them to their idolatrous feasts and entertainments, and to whoredom by certain daughters and women whom he sent into the camp of the Israelites, as appears by Numb. 25. 1, & c. compared with chapter 31. 16. That so thereby they might incur Gods displeasure, as it also came to pass. Which indeed was a most diabolical counsel: against which sort of men, Peter in his second Epistle, and Jude also in his, have written professedly.]
\p
\v 15 . So thou hast likewise those that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaites, [i.e. even as the Israelites were seduced by the counsel of Balaam unto idolatry and whoredom, so there be those among you, who follow the doctrine of the Nicolaites, teaching that to be lawful which Balaam counseled Balak. Of these Nicolaites, see before, the annotate on verse 6.] the which I hate.
\p
\v 16 . Repent, and if not, I will suddainly come (upon) you, and will wage war against you with the sword of my mouth. [i.e. by my threatening and spiritual power. See above, chapter 1. 16. And 2 Cor. 10. 5, 6.]
\p
\v 17 . He that hath ears, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches. He that over, to him will I give to eat of the Manna that is hidden, [the Apostle hath respect here to the pot with Manna, which was set by and kept in the holy of Holies, as we read, Exod. 16. 33, 34. And Heb. 9. 4. Whereby Christ the bread of life, that was to come, was typified, or shadowed forth with all his merits and benefits, as is declared more at large, Joh. 6. 31, & c. Here then is promised the near union and communion with Christ, and the enjoyment of all spiritual benefits, and of the glory which he hath purchased for us, as before ver. 7. Is promised to us, by the tree of life: it having pleased the Father that in him all fullness should dwell, and we should be made perfect in him, Col. 1. 19. And 2. 9, 10.] and I will give him a white electing stone, [hereby is mearnt the Holy Spirit, which transfers this electing voice the farther into our consciences, and beareth witness that we are justified in God’s judgement for Christ his sake, by faith, from all his sins and guilt thereof, 2 Cor. 1. 22. A similitude taken from the voicing or voting among the Greeks and Romans in the condemning or absolving of Malefactors: the black electing-stones betokened condemnation, the white one absolution or acquitment. See somewhat like it, Act. 26. 10. ] and upon the electing-stone a new name written, [this name is, that He, who was formerly a child of wrath and destruction, should now become a child of God, and heir of life everlasting, as Paul speaketh, Rom. 8. 15.] which none knoweth, but he that receiveth it. [for the natural man doth not understand the things that belong to the spirit of God, but we have received the Spirit of Christ, to the end that we may know what it is that God hath given unto us.]
\p
\v 18 . And write to the Angel of the Church at Thyatira, [This was the last City in Mysia, lying opposite to Macedonia, southward of Pergames, whereof see Acts 16. 14.] this saith the Son of God, that hath his eyes as a flame of fire, and his feet are like to shining copper. [Or, fine copper. Here Christ calls himself by His Name, according to his divine Nature, as above chapter 1. 13. In the Vision, he called himself the Son of man, according to his human Nature; he being God and man in one person, chapter 1. 14, 15.]
\p
\v 19 . I know thy works, and love, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works, and [some leave out this particle and here] (that) the last (are) more than the first.
\p
\v 20 . But I have (some) few things against thee, [Few in number, though great of weight, as also verse 14. And this Christ saith, the better and more easily to induce and encourage them to amendment] that thou sufferest the woman Jezebel, that saith of her self, she is a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants, that they commit whoredom, and eat the offering of idols. [By this description some do understand the sect of the Nicolaites, as by the whore of Babel, hereafter chapter 17. There is understood the whole Idolatrous Vogue, and sway of Antichrist. Yet, seeing Christ nameth this sect the second time here, it is more probable, that here is meant a certain woman of note and repute among them, belonging to that sect, making a great show of godliness, and boasting of a prophetical spirit of her own, who in the same manner (as the true Jezabel of old) enticed and seduced the people of Israel to the Idolatry of Baal, and consequently also to bodily whoredom , commonly attending such idolatry, likewise sought to draw and bring the Christians by her shows and persuasions to the like exorbitances in both regards, as to matters of indifference, and to that end kept open house.]
\p
\v 21 . And I have given her time, that she might turn from her whoredom, [Spiritual and Corporal, both of them being expressed before] and she hath not turned her self.
\p
\v 22 . Behold I cast her into a bed, [viz. into a grievous and tormenting sickness, so that the bed, which formerly served her for pleasure, may serve now to afflict and punish her, and that she may have some time yet there, together with their children to repent, as followeth] and those that commit adultery with her, [i.e. idolatry and whoredom both together, as before: for idolatry is also spiritual adultery, it turning away the soul of man from God, the true husband of his Church] into great affliction, [viz. either by punishment from the Magistrate, or by grievous bodily diseases, or also by the checks and torments of their own guilty consciences] if they repent not of their works.
\p
\v 23 . And her children I will destroy by death, [Some understand here her disciples; yet these being already spoken of before, others think that this passage hath regard to the true and proper children of this woman, and their progeny. And here doubtless the issue of Achab. And Jezebel, is likewise glanced at, who were all of them destroyed by the sword of Jehu, as we read 2 King 9. 22. And 10. 6. Etc.] and all the Churches shall know, that I am he that searcheth reins and hearts, [this Christ adds here, because of the pretences and coverings which the leaders of this sect made use of to palliate their abominations withal, seeking to enveigle the simpler sort, from discovering their vilenesses, under colour of spiritual mysteries, and Christian liberty, as appears by the sequel, and as some libertines and sects do yet at this day; unto which Christ doth oppose his omniscience, being able thereby to judge their very reins and thoughts of their hearts] and I will give unto you, to every one, according to your works.
\p
\v 24 .Yet I say unto you, and to the rest that are at Thyatira, as many of them as have not this doctrine, and those that have not known [i.e. as yet not understood, nor approved] the depths of Satan, [i.e. those dark mysteries of their satanical doctrine] as they say: [i.e. which they pretend to proceed from the holy Ghost, and seduce others withal] I will lay no other burden upon you: [i.e. no extraordinary punishment or visitation as the Prophets generally call them a burden of Ceremonies, or the observing of certain grievous commands, as Acts 15. 10, 28. Such commands are expressly called a yoak and a burden.
\p
\v 25 . But that which ye have, hold the same until I come.
\p
\v 26 . And he that overcometh, and that keeps my works [i.e. my precepts and instructions, as faith also itself is called a work of God, John 6. 29.] unto the end, to him will I give power over the heathen. [i.e. over the enemies of this Church, as the heathen always were Enemies to the people of God. The place here is taken out of Psalm 2. Ver. 8 where this promise is made by God the Father, to his Son Jesus Christ, into the communion and participation whereof Christ doth promise here to receive the true believers, persevering to the end, after the same manner, as chapter 3. 21. He promiseth to give them to sit with him in his throne, as he himself did sit in the throne of the Father. See also Rom. 8. 17. Ephes. 2. 6. 2 Tim. 1. 2.]
\p
\v 27 . And he shall guard them with an iron staff; they shall be bruised as potters-vessells: as I also received power of my Father. [Hereby is understood the spiritual power against, and overcoming of all the enemies of the Church of Christ, who set themselves against the salvation of the children of God, whereof they enjoy the beginnings here through the blood of the Lamb, and the word of their Testimony, which is the scepter of that kingdom, Rev. 12. 11. And at the last day hereafter, they shall likewise as Kings judge the unbelieving world, together with Christ, Matth. 19. 28. 1 Cor. 6. 2, 3.]
\p
\v 28 . And I will give him the mourning star. [Hereby may fitly be understood, a greater light of the knowledge of Christ, which, as the morning star precedes the day, shall here likewise shine in our hearts continually, until the star of the perfect knowledge of God shall shine in us, when God be all in all, 1 Cor. 15. 28. And Rev. 22. 16. Where Christ and his knowledge is likened unto the morning star.]
\p
\v 29 . He that hath ears, let him hear, what the spirit saith unto the Churches.
\c 3
\s Christ commands the fifth letter to be written, to the Angel of the Church at Sardis, ver. 1. Whom he exhorts to more watchfulness and carefulness, 2. Or otherwise he threatens to come upon him, as a thief in the night, 3. He promiseth to those which keep their garments unspotted, that they shall walk with him, and that he will not blot their Names out of the Book of life, 4. After that he enjoins the Apostle to write the sixth letter, unto the Angel of Philadelphia, 7. Whom he commends for his steadfastness, 8. And promiseth that Jews shall come to worship before his feet, and that he would keep him in the temptation, 9. Also he promiseth to make the overcomer a pillar in the Temple of God, and an inhabitant of the new Jerusalem, 12. As last he giveth charge for the seventh letter, to be written to the Angel of Church of Laodicea, ver. 14. Whose luke-warmness he reprehendeth, 15. And their vain boasting or opinion of the riches; he wisheth them to buy gold tried in the fire, and garments, and eyosalve, 18. Testifies, that he stands knocking at the door , and promiseth the overcomer that he will give him to sit at his Table, and upon his Throne, 20.
\p
\v 1 And write to the Angel [See ab. Ch. 2. 1.] of the Church that is at Sardis; [this was a very great and famous City in Lydia, where in the former time king Craesus had his Court and Residence] this saith he, that hath the seven spirits God, and the seven stars, [this Title being nor extant in the description of Christ’s apparition set down in the first chapter. Some conceive it to be taken out of the preface of this Book, chapter 1. V. 4. Where the Holy Ghost is called thus for the reasons there given. For the Holy Ghost is not only the Spirit of the father, but also of the son, whom he bestows upon his true believers, to be their guide and comforter, John 15. 26. Gal. 4. 6. Others think, that these seven spirits here are the seven Angels, often mentioned in this Revelation, which are in Christ’s hand as his Ministries, to use and employ them where he pleaseth; as the seven stars also do signify the seven Angels or Overseers of the Churches, as is declared chapt. 1. 20. Yet seeing the word Spirits is no where used in this Relevation of Angels, therefore the former opinion seems the fittest] I know thy works, that thou hast the name that thou livest, and thou art dead. [i.e. thou carriest a fair show of a diligent and faithful Overseer of the Church, and yet thou art nothing left, as the sequel declareth.]
\p
\v 2 . Be watchful [Or awake, viz. out of thy drowsiness and pretences, as Eph. 5. 14. See also Ezek. 34. 16.] and strengthen the remnant that is ready to dy: [i.e. which grows daily more and more remiss and careless, and thereby is ready to perish quite, if it be not roused up and quickened by good exhortations and examples] for I have not found thy works full [Gr. Not fulfilled, i.e. not upright, serious and zealous enough; For otherwise the most holy persons have their failings, Jam. 3. 2.] before God. [others read, before my God, i.e. although thou mayest satisfy men with these shows of thine, God is not satisfied therewith, but requires an upright mind, and earnest endeavours.]
\p
\v 3 . Remember then how thou didst receive and hear it, [i.e. what charge was given thee, and what doctrine thou hast heard from the Apostles, when thou was called to this Ministery] and keep it, and repent. If then thou hath watch not, I will come upon thee as a Thief, [i.e. suddenly, as unawares, as Mat. 24. 43. Which may be understood either of some sudden death, or of other grievous punishments surprising him] and thou shalt not know at what hour I shall come upon thee.
\p
\v 4 . Yet thou hast(some) few names also [i.e. persons, as Acts 1. 15.] at Sardis, who have not defiled their garments, [i.e. have not polluted themselves with impure doctrine and with uncleanness of life, as the Nicolaites. See 1 Thes. 4 4. This similitude Jude also makes use of, v. 23. Of his Epistle] and they shall walk with me in white (rayments): [as having conquered the world and sin. For white rayments were anciently a token of triumph and excellency, as appears by the next verse. See also hereafter, ch. 7. 9. And 19. 14. And an example Mat. 17. 2.] they being worth of it. [this worthiness in them comes not from any powers or deserts of their own, but from Christ, and for Christ’s merit sake, Christ through his own merits, graciously accounting and making them worthy of such recompense. See 2 Cor. 3 4, 5. 2 Thes. 1. 5, 11. Heb. 13. 21.]
\p
\v 5 . He that overcometh shall be clothed with white garments: And I will in no wise blot out his name out of the book of life, [This is said for the comfort of the Faithful, which might begin to doubt of their Election. Not as if any truly written in the Book of Life, may ever be blotted thence; the contrary appearing, by Rev. 13. 8. And 21. 17. But that some in regard of their calling and profession, seem to be written therein, who show afterwards by their actions, that they are not, as is made plain by Psa. 69. 29.] that they are blotted out of the book of life, and that they are not written with the righteous, [where the latter clause explains the former] and I will acknowledge his name before my Father and before his Angels. [i.e. I will own him as my Fathers true servant and disciple, Matth. 10. 32.]
\p
\v 6 . He that hath ears, let him hear, what the Spirit saith unto the Churches.
\p
\v 7 . And write unto the Angel of the Church that is in Philadelphia; [This was a city in Mysia, not far from Lydia, so called by one Attalus Philadelphius, who first caused that city to be built, though it prospered not very much, as being subject to frequent Earthquakes; however there was a very goodly and godly church there, as appears by the letter it self here, in the sequel] this saith the Holy (one) the True (one) [these two Titles are generally ascribed to God in the Old Testament, as may be seen Isa. 6. 3. Psal. 145. 17. Which Christ, as the true Son of God, attributes here unto himself also, he not only being holy in himself, but making us also holy; and being true likewise in all his promises and threatening] he that hath the key of David and his family was a Type. And here regard is had to the place, Isa. 22. 22. Where the like promise is made to Eliakim; and thereby is understood the supreme power of admitting into, and putting out of the same such as he pleaseth, and consequently also into and out of Heaven; according as Christ also promised a spiritual power to his church, though subordinate to his own, Mat. 16. 19. And 18. 11.] he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and he shutteth and no man openeth:
\p
\v 8 . I know thy works: Behold, I have given for thee an opened door, and none can shut the same: [i.e. a sure and unmolested occasion of spreading the Gospel with good success, as 1 Cor. 16. 9. 2 Cor. 2. 12.] for thou hast a little power, and thou hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name. [this little power he had not of or from himself, to accomplish such great things by it; but (as he implyeth) seeing thou art faithful in keeping of my word, therefore I will open thee a door by my spirit, and none, whoever or however he strive against it, shall be able to hinder the same. For the power of God is perfected in our weakness, 2 Cor. 12. 9. Others read, Thou hast a little power (yet), i.e. there is yet some good left in thee, through my grace, which I shall bless further.]
\p
\v 9 . Behold, I give (you some) out of the Synagogue of Satan, [See above chapter 2. 9.] of them that say they are Jews, and are not, but lie: Behold I will cause them to come, [i.e. of those very Jews, which now are sworn Enemies to my church, will I convert some unto me: In like manner as happened as Paul, and some other remaining vessels of Grace, before that time, and according to Christ’s promise here, no doubt was verified on many in the church] and worship before thy feet, [i.e. submit themselves to thee and to my church, and be converted from their former opposition. The similitude in the phrase is taken from the usual custom among the Eastern Nations, and the marching of those that acknowledged themselves to be subdued. See Psal. 72. 9.] and acknowledge that I love thee.
\p
\v 10 . Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, [Thus the Gospel is called, because it sets before our eyes the suffering and patience of Christ, and exhorts us every where to the like] therefore I will keep thee also out of the hour of Temptation, which shall come upon the whole world, for to tempt those that dwell upon Earth. [i.e. I will hinder thy being tempted, or atleast wise, that thy being tempted, shall not hurt thy soul. By temptation he understands persecution, as hath been often showed. And it should seem, that Christ here speaksof the ten years persecution, which Trajan raised against the Christians shortly after this prophecy all the world over.]
\p
\v 11 . Behold I come suddenly, hold that which thou hast, [viz. Faith and a good conscience, as Paul hath it, 1 Tim. 1. 19.] that none take away thy crown [some understand this of the crown of the Ministry, wherein this Pastor had hitherto so well acquitted himself: but it may also well be understood of the crown of eternal life, as above, chapter 10. Which is here threatened to be taken away from him that shall grow flack and negligent in his Ministry, or careless of his life and conversation. And such warnings are the means whereby to keep the faithful constant in the good way. For Christ promiseth in the former verse, that he would keep him out of the hour of temptation, and in the following 12. V. that he shall be a pillar in the temple of God, out of which he shall go no more.]
\p
\v 12 . Him that overcometh I will make a pillar in the house of my God, [i.e. In the Church of God’s Elect, which is building here below, and to be perfected hereafter in heaven. The Apostle hath an eye here to the two pillars in the Temple of Salomon, whereof we read 1 Kin. 7. 15. Which were excellent both for ornament and strength: the one being called Jacin by Salomon, i.e. he shall establish: and the other Bohaz, i.e. in him is strength. See also, Gal. 2. 9.] and he shall no more go out there: [viz. as those typical ones in the Temple of the Old Testament, which were carried away out of it by the Chaldeans, as may be seen, Jer. 52. 17. For he that is a pillar in the Church of the true Elect, he cannot be seduced, Matth. 24. 24. And is never cast out, Joh. 6. 37.] and I will write upon him [as it was the manner also to inscribe such Pillars with honourable Titles, and as the two before mentioned in Salomons Temple had these two names written upon them, spoken of in the former note] the Name of my God, [in token that he belongs to God in a more peculiar manner, as we use to sign or inscribe our own things with our own name: and as in former times the souldiers were wont to be marked with the name of their commanders, and the bondmen with the name of their Masters. See hereafter, chapter 7. 3. For although we know here that we are God’s children, yet it is not actually declared yet what we shall be, 1 Joh. 3. 2.] and the name of the City of my God (namely) of the new Jerusalem [i.e. of the true Church of Christ opposed here to the power whereby it is gathered upon earth, and of the glory wherewith it is to be invested at the last day. See Rev. 21. 2, etc.] and also my new Name. [in token that he is my servant and Minister, and shall be made partaker of my glory, of which new Name, which Christ purchased after his exaltation, see Phil.2. 9, 10. Prov. 19. 12, 16.]
\p
\v 13 . He that hath ears, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches.
\p
\v 14 . And write unto the Angel of the Church of the Laodicea was a rich and famous City in Phrygia by the river Lycus not far from Coloss, wherefore mention also is made of it in the Epistle to the Colossians, chapter 2. 1. And 4. 16.] this saith the Amen, [this word Amen is put here for a name or Title of Christ, as chapter 1. 8. He that is to come, and as Exod. 3. 14. The word Eheje, i.e. I shall be, is put for the Name or Title of God, whereby is understood the faithfulness and steadfastness of Christ in the executing of all the promises of God, 1 Cor. 1. 19, 20.] the faithful and true witness, [even as the word or name Amen doth signify the steadfastness of Christ in executing of his promises; so these words do set forth his faithfulness and truth in propounding the doctrine of salvation, which he brought forth unto us out of the Fathers bosom] the beginning of the creation of God. [i.e. the author and foundation of the creation of all things, as Joh. 1. 3. Col. 1. 15. Others render it Prince (or Chief) of God’s Creatures, as he it also called the Heir of all things, Heb. 1. 2.]
\p
\v 15 . I know thy works, that thou are neither cold nor hot, [i.e. neither zealous in the truth received, nor a stranger to it, as having indeed embraced the truth, but seeking to frame and accommodate thy life, or outward worship of God to the world, for to eschew the ungratefulness and persecutions thereof, which sort of people are worse and with more difficulty to be reclaimed, than those that are altogether strangers to the truth, as Christ witnesseth of the Pharisees, Joh. 9. 41. Elias of the Israelites, 1 Kin. 18. 21.] oh that thou wert cold or hot!
\p
\v 16 . So then, because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth. [Not, as if such luke-warm professors were in the mouth of Christ, or in Christ really, but because by their outward profession and boast, they seem to be in to the eyes of the world.]
\p
\v 17 . Or thou sayst, I am rich, and grown rich, and want nothing: [i.e. thou dost make boast of it, thou persuades thy self that thou aboundest with all manner of spiritual gifts, because thou prosperest outwardly in the world, just as the Pharisee was conceited of himself, Luke 18. But the contrary is true, as Christ shows it them in the sequel punctually] and thou knowest not that thou art miserable, and wretched, and poor, and blind, [viz. in the knowledge of thy self and thy own misery] and naked. [i.e. destitute of the true righteousness and holiness, which availeth before God, appears by the sequel.]
\p
\v 18 . I counsel thee to buy of me [i.e. to desire and seek to get, not by thy own desert (for Christ saith plainly thou art poor and naked) but of grace, and for nothing, by prayer, as is declared, Isa. 55. 1. See also Mat. 11. 28.] gold coming tried out of the fire, [or, which comes forth glowing (or red-hot) out of the fire, and is past the trial, whereby is understood the true faith, which is tried by the fire of temptations, 1 Pet. 1. 7. And which applies to itself all the riches of Christ’s suffering, and is enstated therewith] that thou may become rich: and white rayments that thou mayest be arrayed, and the shame of thy nakedness not be made manifest: [i.e. the whole rayments are the righteousness and holiness of Christ, wherewith our spiritual wretchedness and nakedness comes to be covered before God, as is declared below, cha. 7.13, 14. And 19. 8.] and anoint thine eyes with eye-salve, [or eye-water, i.e. with the right understanding of his word, and the power of the Spirit, whereby we are brought to the knowledge of our selves, and of the grace of God toward us, Psal. 19. 9. And 119. 105.] that thou mayst see.
\p
\v 19 . Whomsoever I love, him I do reprove and chastise, [i.e. convince him by words in his mind, and punish him actually by one or other visitation. See the like, Heb. 12. 5,6. This qualification Christ adds here thereby to moderate the sharpness of the former admonition, seeing it proceeds from love] be zealous therefore and repent.
\p
\v 20 . Behold I stand at the door, and I knock: [This place seems to be taken out of the song of Solomon, chapter 5. 2. Where the like knocking of the Bridgegroom is described at the door of his sleeping spouse: and thereby is understood Christ’s spiritual admonishing of us at the door of our consciences by his word and Spirit, for to rouse us up out of our sins and dullness, that we may give heed to his warnings and exhortations] if any one shall hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in unto him, [this is not left in the free will of man; but this exhortation is a means whereby Christ openeth the door of our hearts, he addressing his speech here unto members of his Church, many whereof were already made partakers of the Spirit of Christ: which gift is stirred up more and more by such exhortations, as Paul speaks to Timothy, 2 Tim. 1. 6, 7. For none comes to Christ, but he that hath heard and learned it of the Father, whom the Father draweth, and to whom it is given by the Father, Joh. 5. 44, 65. So that none doth open his heart to Christ’s admonitions, but he whose heart God openeth first, to make him give heed to his word, as David prayeth, Psal. 119. 18. And is recorded of Lydia, Act. 16. 14. And of all believers, Phil. 2. 13.] and I will sup with him by my spirit, and make him more and more sensible of my grace and favour, for his comfort and strengthening, Joh. 14. 21, 22. And partaker hereafter of everlasting joys; which is also likened to a sitting at a rich table, Matth. 8. 11. And Luke 14. 15.]
\p
\v 21 . To him that overcometh I will give to sit with me in my throne, as I have overcome, and em sat down with my Father in his throne. [i.e. I shall make him hereafter to participate of my power and glory in the last judgement, as Christ explains it, Matth. 19. 28. And Joh. 17. 5, etc. and Paul Rom. 8. 17. 1 Cor. 6. 2, 3.]
\p
\v 22 . He that hath ears, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches.
\c 4
\s From hence to the end of the seventh chapter there is described the second Vision, containg the first prophecy of the things that were afterwards to come to pass. 1. Where in the first place there is showed to the Apostle a Royal Throne in the opened heaven, 2. And the glory of God sitting upon the throne, 3. And afterwards 24. Elders sitting round about the Throne, together with thundering, lightnings, and burning lamps, 4. And a sea of glass, and four beasts and the 24. Elders sang unto God, 9.
\p
\v 1 After this [Viz. the first Vision being finished] I looked, and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I had heard, [viz. chapter 1. Ver. 10. Which was the voice of Christ, whose glory is described there, and whose words here do agree with those explained, ch. 3. 1] speaking with me as a trumpet, said, come up here, and I will show thee what must come to pass [in regards of God’s providence, as in the world in general, so especially in the Church of God, for a punishment to the bad, and the trial and comfort of the good, as chapter 1. 1. And 22. 6.] hereafter. [i.e. from henceforth unto the end of the world, as is made plain afterwards by the Revelation it self.]
\p
\v 2 . And forthwith I became in the Spirit: [i.e. fell into a new trance or rapture of my sences through the Spirit, as above, chapter 1. 10.] and behold there was a Throne set in heaven, [many compare this Vision with that which Isaia saw, chapter 6. 1. And Ezekiel, chap, 1. 4. Representing the Majesty of God in heaven: and there are doubtless divers things in this Vision, which are common to those others. Yet this is observable, that this Vision as well as those, borrowed many things from the Tabernacle or Temple of the Old Testament, which Moseh was charged to make according to the pattern showed him in the mount, as is to be seen, Exod. 25. 8, 9, 40. Heb. 8. 5. And 9. 24. By which observation, many parts and properties of this and the following Visions are so much the better understood, as will appear further by the sequel] and there sat one [viz. God the Father, who gave this revelation to Christ, as is expressed, chapter 1. 1. And which appears also from comparing the 6. And 7. Verses of the next chapter Where Christ takes the book out of his hand that sat upon the throne] upon the throne. [viz. as a Judge of all, but especially as King and Protector of his Church; and it is to be noted, that this throne from whence the thundering issued forth, is said to be in the Temple of Heaven, chapter 6. 17, 18. As also that the Altar is said to stand before this throne of God, chapter 8. 3. And 9. 13. In which Temple the Ark of the Testimony is seen, chapter 11. 19. And thence the Angels are sent forth as Cherubims from the presence of God, chapter 14, 15, 17, 18. All which and other the like things have respect to the type of the Temple and Tabernacle though here they are seen in heaven.]
\p
\v 3 . And he that sat thereon was in regard like unto the stone of Jasper and Sardias: and there was a rain-bow round about the throne, [Hereby is fitly represented God’s covenant of grace with his Church, that namely, notwithstanding all the storms and tempests of persecution and other troubles they must encounter with in this unsteady world, yet he will never suffer them to perish, as God spake once of the waters of the deluge, Gen. 9. 12. & c.] in regard like unto the Emarald stone. [by the three precious stones mentioned in this verse, whereof the first is of various colours, the record of a bright carnation, and the third of a lively green, there is aptly represented here the manifold glory, and yet withal the unchangeableness of God’s being, illustrating all things with his glory, and supporting them with his strength. And it is remarkable, that here is no similitude or shape of God’s countenance described, that men might not take occasion hence to make his Image; as Moses expressly showeth, why God appeared on mount Horeb in fire, Deut. 9. 15. And therefore in the apparitions, Isa. 6. Ezek. 1. And 10. & Dan. 7. There is no peculiar shape of the face expressed. The Israelites also in the Old Testament, never durst, under the pretence of any such apparition exhibited unto the Prophets, make any image or portrait of God, as likewise the Apostles and the primitive church in the Apostles times, never attempted to practice, it being so directly against God’s express commands, Deut. 4. 15, 23. Isa. 40. 18. Act. 17. 29. Rom. 1. 23.]
\p
\v 4 . And round about the throne were four and twenty thrones: and upon the thrones I saw the four and twenty Elders sitting [These 24. Elders some do take to betoken the twelve Patriarchs and the twelve Apostles, as leaders of the whole Church of the old and new Testament. But John as one of the Apostles being himself alive yet, and this Vision being represented in heaven, others do here understand all the leaders of the Old Testament: and the comparison to be taken from the Priests and Levites which ministered in the Temple, and were divided into 24. Orders, and had therefore 24. Leaders, which went before all the Israelitish Church, as we read, 1 Chr. 24.] clothed in white raiment, [which betokeneth their holy and Priestly function, and their having overcome] and they had golden crowns upon their heads. [whereby is signified the Royal dignity which they received in and from Christ, as overcomers and conquerors of Satan and the world, chapter 6. 1.]
\p
\v 5 . And from the throne there issued forth lightnings, and thunderclaps, and voices, [Hereby is set forth the powerful working of God and his word, said to come forth out of the Temple of Heaven, chapter 16. 17.] and seven fiery lamps were burning before the throne, [viz. even as there were seven lamps on the candlestick in the Tabernacle, which were always to be supplied with oil and kept burning, whereof see the signification above chapter 1. 4.] which are the seven spirits of God. [i.e. the holy Ghost with the variety of his gifts, and the Church of Christ. See chapter 1. 4.]
\p
\v 6 . And before the throne there was a sea of glass, like Crystal, [This Comparison is likewise taken from the Temple, or Tabernacle, where there was a great Copper Vessel kept full of water, called the Copper, or molten Sea, 1 kings 7. 23. Which is said here to be of Crystal, because it was altogether visible and transparent before the throne of God: and it signifies the multitude of Nations in the World, who are often stirred this way and that way, but continue still in the presence, and under the power of God, and may easily be broken or calmed. Thus the word waters, whereof the sea is a gathering, is explained hereafter by the Angel, chapter 17. 15.] and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, four beasts, being full of eyes, from before and from behind. [Some do hereby understand, the four beasts which Ezekiel treats of, chapter 1. And 10. In the like Vision, whereby the Angels of God are there signified; yet it appears plainly by the sequel, chapter 5. 9. That here by these beasts, men are to be understood, such as were redeemed by the blood of Christ, out of people, tongues and nations; as also the twenty four Elders before mentioned, both which are plainly differenced from the Angels, chapter 7. 11. Therefore others interpret this of the their great knowledge in Christ’s life and actions: and had six wings, having diligently searched and dived into the life, death and glory of Christ, on all sides, and imparted the same unto us, that we might obtain everlasting life by it through Christ, on all sides, and imparted the same unto us, that we might obtain everlasting life by it through Christ: of whom Matthew is said to have a face as a man, he having most evidently testified of Christ’s incarnation. Mark that of a Lion, as beginning his Gospel with the call and cry of John the Baptist in the wilderness. Luke that of Calf, or Bullock, because of the Relation he makes of Zacharia, that offered in the Temple: and John is likened to an Eagle, as beginning his Gospel with the high and transcendent birth of the Son of God, out of the Father. And this opinion is very ancient in the Christian Church: nevertheless John living on earth yet, and they also singing, chapter 5. 8. That they are redeemed with the blood of Christ, out of all Tongues and Nations, whereas the four Evangilists were only of the Jews; therefore others take it as sittingly, for the Pastors and leaders of the New Testament in general, which are said to be four, because the Gospel was spread by them towards the four corners, or quarters of the world, and that the Apostle Paul expresseth four several orders of them, Ephe. 4. 11. Viz. Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists and Pastors, or Teachers, who in their office, in Christ’s matters, ought to be endued with the courage of a Lion, the patience and perseverance of an ox, the prudence and discretion of man, and the searching and soaring of an Eagle; wherefore also many eyes and wings are here ascribed unto them.]
\p
\v 7 . And the first beast was like unto a Lion, and the second beast like unto a Calf, and the third beast had the face of a Man, and the fourth beast was like to a flying Eagle:
\p
\v 8 . And the four beasts had each of them for himself, six wings round about, and within they were full of eyes, and they take no rest. [i.e. they never cease thanking and praising God before his throne] day and night, [evermore, perpetually, for in the Heavenly Jerusalem there is no night at all, but an everlasting day, enlightened by God and the Lamb, chapter 21. 23, 25.] saying; Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, that was, and that is, and that is to come.
\p
\v 9 . And when the beasts gave glory, and honour, and thanksgiving, to him that sat upon the throne, [i.e. acknowledged his glory and honour with a thankful heart, as Jos. 7. 19.] that liveth in all eternity. [Gr. In the eternities of eternities, as also in the next verse.]
\p
\v 10 . Then the four and twenty Elders fell down before him, that sat upon the throne, and worshipped him that liveth in all eternity; and cast down their crowns, before the throne. [Not to deprive themselves of them, but to show their acknowledgment, that overcoming came not from themselves, but from him that sat upon the throne, which they testified by this their falling down, and casting off their crowns] saying;
\p
\v 11 . Thou Lord art worthy to receive the glory, and the honour, and the power; [i.e. that all the world should acknowledge thy Glory to exceed all other, and worship thee as God above all, and stand in awe of thy power, as almighty] for thou hast created all things thy will, they are, and were created. [They are existent, subsisting still so as they were created, Rom. 11. 30.]
\c 5
\s After the description of him that sat upon the throne, the Apostle rehearseth the conditions of the sealed Book, that was in his hand, 1. Which seeing no Creature in heaven and earth was able to open it, 3. The Lion of the Tribe of Juda only is declared to be worthy of it , 5. Who receives the book out of his hand, 7. Whereupon the four beasts with the twenty four Elders do praise his worthiness, 8. Which the multitude of Angels also do acknowledge by their Hymns, 11. And all the creatures in heaven and earth, bear a part in it.
\p
\v 1 And I saw in [The Greek particle epi is otherwise also rendered at; but by ver. 7. It appears, that here it is better rendered in] the right (hand) of him that sat upon the throne, a book written within and without, [or within and on the backside. Hence it appears that this book was made up of a roll, written on both sides, such as were much in use among the ancients. See examples Psalm 40. 8. And Zach. 5. 1.] sealed with seven seales. [Some do understand this of the Book of the Old and New Testament; yet seeing here a Revelation is spoken of concerning things to come, which God gave unto Jesus Christ, to make it known afterwards unto John, as is showed forth in this chapter, therefore we do more fitly understand it of the Book of God’s gorvening his Church, and of his Judgements against the enemies thereof; which is also further manifest by the successive opening of the several seals, one after another, and the ensuing Revelation of the same.]
\p
\v 2 . And I saw a strong Angel proclaiming wit a great voice; [That by his strong cry he might be heard the better by every one, all the world over. And this attribute of strong, is given to all the Angels of God, Psal. 103. 20.] who is worthy to open the book, and to break open his seals? [i.e. who hath most authority and right, most might and abilities to do the same.]
\p
\v 3 . And none in heaven nor on earth, nor under the earth, was able to open the book, nor to look (in) it. [viz. for to impart the contents thereof unto John, and by him to the whole Church of their Comfort and warning, according to their former promise, chapter 1. 1.]
\p
\v 4 . And I wept much, that none was found worthy to open and read that book, nor to look (in) the same [viz. because he feared, the promise formerly made to him, would by reason hereof not be perfomed this good while yet, which nevertheless he longed so much after.]
\p
\v 5 . And one of the Elders said to me, [He namely, to whom he then stood nearest] weep not, behold the Lion that is of the Tribe of Juda, [so Christ is called by Jacob’s blessing upon Juda, Gen. 49. 9. And that by reason of his Royal and conquering power over the Devil, World, Sin and Death] the root of David. [As he is stiled likewise below chapter 22. 16. And thus Christ is termed as sprung forth out of the seed of David, and promised also by this Name, Isa. 53. 2.] hath overcome, for to open the book, and to break open the seals thereof.
\p
\v 6 . And I saw, and behold , in the midst of the throne, and in the midst of the four beasts, and in the midst of the Elders a Lamb [Thus Christ is represented here, because the Paschal-Lamb and others, which were daily offered for sin, Exod. 29. 38. Were shadows of Christ, as he is also expressly called, Isa. 53. 7. See likewise, John 1. 29. Standing as slain, [or having been slain. The particle as, some do take to imply the truth of the matter, as it is taken John 1. 14. And elsewhere. Others take it only for a similitude, so that Christ in this Vision, glorified on the Throne of his Father, should yet have born those marks of his wounds and sufferings, which he had born formerly for us here on earth, according as he did likewise, Luke 24. 40. And John 20. 27.] having seven horns, and seven eyes; [hereby is figured out the holy Ghost, whom Christ received without measure, John 3. 34. By whom also he executes his providence in the Government of his Church] which are the seven spirits of God, [ i.e. the fullness of the holy Ghost. See the reason of this manner of speaking, chapter 1. 4.] which are sent forth into all lands, [Gr. Sent forth into all, (or every) land, or earth. These words are taken out of Zach. 3. 9. Where seven eyes are engraven into the stone, whereon God built his Temple under Joshua, which (chap. 4. 10. Of the same prophecy) are declared, to be the eyes of God, going throughout the land, or earth, that is to say, this providence and spirit, whereby he governs the world, and more specially his Church.]
\p
\v 7 . And it came [viz. as a Mediator betwixt God and man] and took the book out of the right (hand) of him that sat upon the Throne.
\p
\v 8 . And when it had taken that book, [viz. for to open the seals thereof, and to reveal the contents thereof, as chapter 6. 1. And onward to the end of the whole Revelation] than the four beasts, and the four and twenty Elders fell (down) before the Lamb, [in like manner as they had done formerly, chapter 4. 10. Before him that sat upon the throne; whereby they manifested, that they acknowledge him also for the only true God, of the same Essence and glory with the Father; as the Angels likewise and the rest of the creatures, do yield him the same honour, which they give to God the Father] having each Harps and golden vials, being full of incense, [viz. such as the Priests and Levites were wont to use in the Temple. Of the Harps, as Instruments of Music, wherewith they lifted up their hearts and praised God, we read frequently in the Psalms of David: of vials, potts, or vessels for incense, see 2 Chron. 4. 22. Zach. 14. 20. By which incense are signified the prayers, which ascended up to God, and were acceptable to him in Christ, as is to be seen, Psalm 141. 2.] where are the prayers of the Saints. [i.e. which do signify the prayers of the Saints. And here regard is had to the practice in the Old Testament: for as the Priest daily, and the High Priest once a year, offered up incense before God, Jointly with the blood of the sacrifices, Lev. 16. 13. Heb. 9. 4. Etc to show thereby, that they as Leaders of the Church, and together with the Church of the old Testament, did address their prayers and thanksgiving unto God. So here is represented unto us, that the Leaders of both the Old and New Testament, together in the Triumphant Church in Heaven, do likewise jointly present their prayers and thanksgiving before God in Christ: as together with these four beasts and twenty four Elders, there are likewise comprehended all the rest of the saints in heaven according to the contents of the Hymn, set down and recorded in the next verse, and more fully explained, ch. 6. 10. And 7. 9, 10, 15 and 8. 3.]
\p
\v 9 . And they sung a new song, [Made altogether after a new manner, and containing a new matter also, as Psalm 33. 3. Isa. 42. 10.] saying thou art worthy to take that book, and to open the seals thereof; for thou as slain and hast bought us unto God with thy blood, [Gr. In thy blood, i.e. by, or with the same] out of every family, and tongue, and people, and nation.
\p
\v 10 . And thou hast made us unto God, Kings and Priests: [See above chapter 1. 6.] and we shall reign as Kings upon earth. [Some do understand this of the Reign of the saints here on earth, during the thousand years spoken of below, chapter 20. See there what may serve against this opinion. Others would understand it of a certain sway and government, which the saints in heaven should be exercising there now over the people upon earth: but this is repugnant to other places of scripture, 2 Kin. 22. 10. See Joh. 14. 23. Isa. 63. 16. And here express mention is made, not of any present, but of a future Dominion, which should come to pass then, when the said saints shall come, to sit upon thrones with Christ at his last coming, for to judge the world then and the Angels themselves, Mat. 19. 28. Luke 22. 30. 1 Cor. 6. 3. And when the new heavens and the new earth shall be, wherein righteousness shall inhabit, 2 Pet. 3. 13. See also Mat. 5. 5.]
\p
\v 11 . And I saw, and I heard a voice of many Angels round about the Throne, and the beasts, and the Elders; and their number was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousand times thousands. [This is taken out of Daniel chapter 7. 10. Whereby the glory and power of God and Christ is held forth, they being attended with innumerable Ministers.]
\p
\v 12 . Saying with a great voice, the Lamb that is slain, is worthy to receive the power, [Not, as if he had it not already; for he was exalted above every Name in Heaven and on earth, Phil. 2. 9. But this must be understood, of the acknowledgement of all these Attributes, which all the Creatures should testify at last, as is further expressed hereafter] and richness, and wisdom, [for in him are hidden all the Treasures of wisdom and knowledge, Col. 2. 3.] and strength, and honour, and glory, and thankgiving. [Gr. Blessing, as also in the next verse.]
\p
\v 13 . And every Creature, that is in heaven, and upon the earth, and under the earth, and those that are in the sea, and all that is in the same, [Meaning and comprehending all creatures whatsoever, animate and inanimate; all and every one of them, containing and affording matter and cause of praising and glorifying Christ, Psalm 148. 1. Etc. Others do understand by those which are under the earth, the dead ones in their graves, who in due time shall rise again out of them] heard I say; unto him that sitteth upon the Throne, and to the Lamb, be the thanksgiving, and the honour, and the glory, and the power into all eternity. [Gr. Into the eternities of eternities.]
\p
\v 14 . And the four beasts said, Amen. [See chapter 1. 7.] and the four and twenty Elders fell down, and worshipped him that liveth into all Eternity.
\c 6
\s The first Seal is opened, and there cometh forth a White horse, and one upon it that overcometh, 1. After that there cometh forth a Red horse, and one upon it that takes away peace from the earth, 3. Then the third Seal being opened, a black horse is seen after that, and thereupon one with a baliance in his hand, 5. At the opening of the fourth seal a pale horse issueth, and death upon it, 7. After that the fist seal is opened, whereupon the souls under the altar do cry unto God, and are comforted, 9. At last the sixth seal is opened, whereupon there follow great signs in heaven and earth, 12. At which signs all sorts of men are terrified, and sue unto the rocks to cover them before the wrath of the Lamb.
\p
\v 1 And I saw, when [Gr. Hot, i.e. when, for which others read hot, i.e. that, both in a good sense] the Lamb had opened one of the seals [i.e. the first seal, as presently after one of the beasts, i.e. the first, as appears by ver. 3, 5, 7. It being an Hebraism. See Gen. 1. 5. Mat. 28. 1.] and I heard one of the four beasts say, like a voice of a thunderclap, come and see. [even as one of the 24. Elders, (above, chapter 5. V. 5.) had comforted the Apostle when he wept, that there was none found, that was able to open this book with its seven seals, so there comes another now, one of the four beasts, and exhorts the Apostle to diligent attention of the things that were to ensue the opening of the seals, as likewise the three others did each in their turn, in the sequel of the story, to the end that all things in these apparations here exhibited in the heavens, might pass the more orderly and usefully]
\p
\v 2 . And I saw [Some by the Visions that followed upon the opening of the first four seals, do understand the four Monarches whereof Daniel prophesied: but this opinion cannot stand, in regard the ab. chapter 1. Ver. 1. And chapter 4. Ver. 1. It is said, in this book things are showed, that were to come to pass after this, therefore not such as were past long before already. Now among those that interpret it of things to come, there are like-wise two opinions, some by the apparations exhibited upon the opening of these seals, do understand the changes and troubles which befell the Roman Empire, from this time until that of Constantine, who was the first Christian Emperor: namely, thus that the white horse, with its conquering rider, should betoken Christ, who as he had begun already by his Apostles, so he would likewise successively, by other faithful Teachers and Ministers, subdue the Heathenish Idolatry and other vain superstitious worships, and quite new-model the Roman Empire in this behalf: the red horse should signify the effusions of blood and civil divisions, which would arise in this Empire, among the various Emperours of it. The black horse, that famine and those deaths which God in his judgements sent among them at sundry times; the pale horse, the grievous pestilences and other burning diseases and mortalities, which should rage in that Empire; and all that, because of those persecutions, which they raised against the Christians ten several times one after another. Whereupon after the opening of the fifth seal, the souls of the slain Christians should cry to God for vengeance, as after the opening of the sixth seal they were heard before God: after which Constantine was raised, who powerfully subdued the rest of those tyrannous Emperours and Persecutors of the Church, Maxentius, Maximianus, Licinius and others, whereby he took away all the repute of their Idols, and brought their worshippers into utter ruin and confusion. This opinion on this chapter doth ill agree with the properties of these Visions, and with the Histories of those times. Yet in regard that properly Christ is here spoken of, and brought in as a Lamb slain, that with his blood hath purchased his Church; and only the four beasts, and the 24. Elders are mentioned as leaders of the Church of Christ, as was showed in the former chapter. It seems more probable, that in this and all the ensuing Visions, an eye is had to the several changes and troubles, as also comforts and deliverances, which should happen to the Church of Christ in all ages all the world over, as shall be noted in the sequel] and behold, a white horse, and ha that sat thereon had a bow: and to him a Crown is given, and he went forth conquering and to conquer. [hereby the pure preaching of the Gospel is understood, which Christ the King of Kings, that rules this horse, (as is declared hereafter chapter 19. 11, & c.) hath made to spread abroad all the world over, being armed with the power of his Spirit, and with a bow, subduing all oppositions by his Ministers, so that notwithstanding the persecutions of the Heathenish and other Barbarous or Heretical Kings in the East and West, he prevailed, and kept the upper hand therein.]
\p
\v 3 . And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, come and see.
\p
\v 4 . And another horse went forth that was red: [or was given to take peace from the earth, that they should kill [Gr. Slaughter ] one another, [hereby Satan and his instruments may fitly be understood; namely, the Heathen and Arrian Kings and Emperours, who filled the Church of Christ with persecutions and bloodshed: during which time many thousand Martyrs did seal the doctrine of Christ with their blood, whereof mention is made, ver. 9.] and to him was given a great sword. [viz. therewith to slay or behead the true professors of Christ.]
\p
\v 5 . And when it had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, come and see: and I saw, and behold, a black horse, [Hereby are not unfitly understood, the false doctrines and heresies, which Satan and his instruments from this very time sought to introduce against the pure doctrine of the holy Gospel, such as were the Corinthians, the Ebionites, the Marcionites, the Manichees, Samosatenians, Arrians, Palegians and the like, who nevertheless were all of them subdued and confounded at last by the faithful teachers, and sound Synods] and he that sat thereon, had a balance in his hand. [hereby many do understand the holy Scriptures, which these Hereticks used indeed to hold forth, but perveted the same to their own destruction, and sought still to bend and ply the same according to their human sense and imagination, 2 Pet. 3. 16.]
\p
\v 6 . And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts, which said, a measure [The Greek word Choenix signifies such a measure as might suffice a man to live upon for one day, and thereby the meat was measured forth which was allowed to the bond-slaves] of wheat for a peny, and three measures of barley for a peny, [this was the ordinary wages for a day-labourer, as is to be seen, Matth. 20. 2, 9, 10. So that here it is foretold there should come such a death of grains, that a man should be constrained to spend all his daily getting for to maintain his life. Now the speech being properly of spiritual sustenance here, it may fitly be applied to the death of God’s pure word, which should happen in one of these times, through the falsehood and tyranny of some of these Heresies, and through the reminess and timorousness of many teachers. See the like figurative expressions, Amos 8. 11.] and the oil and wine is fitly understood the fundamental doctrine of salvation, that revives and comforteth the hearts, and hereby it is intimated that God would nevertheless always stir up some faithful teachers ever amidst this death and scarcity of his word, who should maintain the fundamental doctrine of salvation, and thereby encourage and cheer up the hearts of the Elect, according as the Ecclesiastical Histories also bear record to have happened in these sad times through-cut.]
\p
\v 7 . And when it had opened the fourth seal, I heard a voice of the fourth beast, which said, come and see.
\p
\v 8 . And I saw, and behold, a pale horse [Or, wan, pale green, such as is the colour or fading or withered leaves; whereby may fitly be understood the human institutions and superstitions, disfiguring the faces of men, Mat. 6. 16. & by degrees bereaving the Church of Christ of sound doctrine, and misleading men from the the merits of Christ to their own deserts, and to other midiatours and means of salvation, that is to say, to their own destruction. See mat. 15. 8, 9. And 23. 14. Gal. 5. 4. Col. 2. 8, etc. Which superstitions and human institutions broke into the Church of Christ after these heresies, and made way thus by little and little to Antichristianism] and he that sat upon it, his name was death, and hell [oth. The grave] followed him, and power was given unto them to kill the fourth part of the earth, which the sword, and with famine, and with death, and by the wild beasts of the earth. [these four plagues are the same which God threateneth to the Israelites, Eze. 14. 21. See also Lev. 26. 22, etc. whereby may be understood here the spiritual plagues which Satan put upon the souls and consciences of men.]
\p
\v 9 . And when it had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar [viz. that which stood in the holy place of the Temple in heaven before the throne of God, as is expressed below, chapter 8. 3. And 16. 17. Which Altar is Christ, Heb. 13. 10. So called, because that our prayers are not acceptable to God, unless they be presented in his name, Joh. 16. 2, 3. And offered up to God through him, Heb. 13. 15. Therefore the souls of the Saints (whose bodies were martyr’d by the unbelieving Jews, Gentiles, and false Christians) present themselves in the presence of Christ, and under his shadow as it were, as David speaks of the Tabernacle, Ps. 27. 5. & John below, chapter 7. 16, 17. And that these holy souls have all their habitation and comfort in Christ, appeareth plainly by 2 Cor. 5. 8. Phil. 1. 23. And below by chapter 7. 15, 16, etc.] the souls of those that were put to death, [or, slaughtered, slain] for the word of God, and for the Testimony which they had. [ See below, chapter 19. 10.]
\p
\v 10 . And they cried with a great voice, saying, how long O holy and true Lord, doth thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell upon the earth? [Gr. Until when, etc. This prayer doth not proceed out of any revengefulness, but out of an holy zeal, which thoe holy spirits had for the advancement of God’s honour, and a desire that God would make his justice known among men, together with the good cause they professed, as David also spake to Saul, 1 Sa. 24. 13. And Paul touching an enemy of the Church of Christ, 2 Tim. 4. 14. and we, all of us, praying, deliver us from the evil one.]
\p
\v 11 . And unto every one were given long white garments, [Gr. Stolai, whereof see Mark. 12. The note on v. 38. Such namely as were washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb, as is testified, chapter 7. 14. Whereby is understood the perfect sanctification and overcoming of these souls through the blood of Christ, as also the glory intimated, which already they do enjoy in heaven. See 2 Cor. 5. 2, 3.] and it was told them, they should rest for a small time yet, until their fellow servants also, and their brethren should be fulfilled, who were to be put to death as they were. [viz. by antichrist and his Ministers, who should arise in the Church of Christ, soon after this, and by their spiritual tyranny oppress the Church, and persecute and kill his faithful witness, in like manner as the Gentiles, the Jews and other false Christians had done formerly.]
\p
\v 12 And I saw, when it had opened the sixth seal, and behold there was a great earth-quake: and the sun became black as an hairy sack, and the Moon became as blood;
\p
\v 13 . And the stars of heaven fell upon the earth as a figtree casts his unripe figs, being shaken by a great wind.
\p
\v 14 . and the heavens departed as a book that is rolled up: and all mountains and islands were moved out of their places. [upon the opening of the sixth seal, there followed the rising, not only of the Mahumetans in the East, but especially of the Roman Antichrist in the West, who by a spiritual tyranny exalts himself above all that is called God, and vaunts himself out in the Temple of God as God; under whom did happen these great and terrible concussions in the Church of it is turned out of its place as it were: that Christ the Sun of righteousness is eclipsed or obscured by their sack of human traditions; and the Church of Christ, which like the Moon receiveth all her light from him alone, is filled with bloody persecutions, and become red altogether: that the stars, that is, the Pastors and Teachers, (as is declared, chapter 1. Ver. 20.) are fallen down from heaven, that is, from the care of heavenly and spiritual matters, to that of earthly and worldly things. That the heaven is ready to be rolled up, that is, that the holy scriptures & the heavenly doctrine of Christ is become as a book shut up, the members of Christ being forbidden to have and peruse it; That lastly all mountains and islands, that is, all Princes and Nations should be terrified by his dominion. Which application agrees well enough with the experience of things past: and that the like changes and revolutions in the Church and in the world, are frequently shadowed forth by such figurative resemblances in the Scriptures, appears by comparing sundry passages in the Old Testament, whence this here in the Text seems to be borrowed. See Isa. 13. 10. And 34. 4. Jer. 4. 23. Ezek. 32. 7. Joel. 2. 10. Others nevertheless keeping closer to the letter, join these three verses to three following, which treat of the grievous punishments that shall light upon the persecutors and oppressors at the last day, and is opposed to the comfortable condition which the holy Martyrs do enjoy already, of which punishments these tokens in heaven and earth, are likewise continued forerunners as it were of Christ’s coming to judgement, Mat. 24. 29. Mar. 13. 24. Luke 21. 25, etc.]
\p
\v 15 . And the Kings of the earth, and the great ones, and the rich, and the Captains over thousands, and the mighty ones, and all bondmen, and all free ones, did hide themselves in the Caves, and in the rocks of the mountains:
\p
\v 16 . And I said unto the mountains, and unto the rocks, fall upon us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth upon the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb;
\p
\v 17 . For the great day of his wrath [i.e. of the heavy punishment, which God in his righteous judgement shall bring upon them] is come, and who can subsist? [Gr. Stand, as Psal. 1. 5. In these three last verses are described and comprehended all those that persecuted and oppressed the faithful. None of them all, whatever he be, great or small, bond or free, shall be able to escape these punishments; for as in the former 11. V. the Maryrs were comforted and promised, that their recompense should be completed, as soon as the number of their fellow-brethren should be fulfilled (ofwhich general comfort, more will be said in the next chapter, ) so here on the contrary their oppressors are likewise generally forewarned of the grievous and heavy punishments which they must expect, unless they repent.
\c 7
\s 1. John seeth four Angels, to whom power was given to hurt the Earth by the ceasing of the Winds, 2. And another Angel, having the Seal of God, who hindereth them from doing it, till all the servants of God are mocked, 4. Whose number is an hundred and four and fourty thousand of all the tribes of Israel. 9. After that he seeth an innumerable multitude of all Nations standing before the throne and before the Lamb, 24. Whom all the Angels and the four Beasts and the four and twenty Elders do follow with a like song of praise, 17. John is informed by one of the four and twenty Elders, who those are that were arrayed in white robes, 15. And wherein their blessedness doth consist.
\p
\v 1 And after this I saw [Namely, when this former vision was past, I saw as it were a part of that which was yet to come to pass after the opening of the sixth seal. For that which followeth in this chapter, pertaineth also to the opening of the sixth seal, as appeareth by the beginning of the next chapter, where the seventh seal beginneth to be opened. From whence also may be fitly concluded, that the matters contained in this chapter have some dependence and connection with those of the former chapter, and do expound one another] four Angels stand on the four corners of the Earth, holding the four winds of the earth, [some take these four Angels spoken of to be good Angels, who are also sometimes made use of for the executing of Gods judgements in the world; and they understand by those four Angels, which had power to hurt the earth and the sea with stormy winds and tempests, or to make them cease, such instruments, as God in his just judgement hath made use to of in all parts of the world to stir up the Arabians, Hagarenes, Ethopians, Sarasins, and other fierce and cruel Nations in the East and in the South, and the Gothes, Vandals, Longobards, Hunnes, and others like unto them in the West and in the North, to over-run and destroy the whole Roman Empire: as such troubles are oftentimes understood under the comparison of winds and tempests. See Jerem. 49. 36. And 51. 1 Dan. 7. 2. Which destruction of the Roman Empire came to pass before the rising of Antichrist, as is testified by Paul that it should be so, 2 Thes. 2. 7. Whereupon followed, that God, to keep and serve his Christian church in being in the midst of this desolation, caused this marking of the sealed ones of all Nations (as followeth) to be made by this other Angel, as the like marking was made by Angel at the time of desolation of the land of Israel by the Babylonians & Assyrians by Gods command, Ezek. 9. 4. Whereunto this prophecy doth apparently relate. Others understand by these four Angels so many evil spirits, which as instruments of Satan in the setting up of Antichristianism, have especially labored in all parts of the world for that end and purpose, that the working of Gods Spirit, which is also resembled to the wind, John 3. 8. Acts 2. 2. Might be resisted and hindered, and the Faithful and Orthodox Teachers, might every where be put down and silenced, to the decaying and destruction of the true Orthodox Religion, there being a power of error sent among them by lying signs, as Paul witnesseth, 2 Thes. 2. 9, etc. whereupon God notwithstanding would thus mark out his elect out of all families (as followeth) , that he might still at all times preserve his church even in the midst of all this, as he did in Israel, when he preserved those seven thousand, which had not bowed their knees unto Baal: of whom see 1 Kings 19. 18. Rom. 11. 4, 5.] that no wind should blow on the earth, neither on the sea, neither against any tree. [these three sorts are mentioned here, because the winds are commonly either prejudicial or beneficial to these three things; the earth, that is, men on earth; the sea, that is, men in Islands and in ships; and the trees, which with their boughs spread themselves forth in the air. And thereby are understood such men as are some what eminent above others, as appeareth chapt. 9. 4. Where the locusts are commanded not to hurt any tree, but onely such men as have not the mark of God upon their foreheads.]
\p
\v 2 . And I saw another Angel come up from the rising of the Sun, having the seal of the Living God: [Hereby is meant Christ, who is the rising from on high, and who alone hath the seal of the living God, to seal those that belong unto him therewith, and who hath the supreme command over all the Angels] and he cried with great voice to the four Angels, to whom (power) was given to hurt the earth and the sea,
\p
\v 3 . Saying; hurt [Gr. Wrong] not the earth, neither the sea, neither the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God, [that is, those that are true believers and God’s elect, to the end that they might not be seduced together with others, see Mat. 24. 24. That is, till we have marked them with a seal, as with a mark or token, that they being thereby distinguished from others, might not be hurt with them. This marking is the working and strengthening of the Holy Ghost, whereby they being made the children of God, are secured and preserved against all seducement. See Rom. 8. 15, etc. 2 Cor. 1. V. 21, 22. Eph. 4. 30. 2 Tim. 2. 19.] on their foreheads. [here respect is especially had to that which is related, Ezek. 9. 4. And this is like likewise spoken by way of similitude, because slaves and bond-men afore-time were marked in their foreheads with the names of their masters, and souldiers in their hands with the names of their Captain General: And this marking is made on the forehead, because though it be especially internal, yet it doth manifest and discover itself in the sight of every one by the profession and fruits thereof. See hereafter chapter 14. 1.]
\p
\v 4 . And I heard the number of them which were sealed: (there) were sealed an hundred and four and forty thousand out of all the tribes of the children of Israel: [Some take this properly for the elect among the Jews, in whose naming or mentioning there is now no order kept, as there was formerly in the Old Testament, because God in the New Testament hath put all those that love him in one degree, and in Christ neither Jew nor Greek, neither bond nor free is regarded one more than other, Gal. 3. 28. Others take it for the Israel of God of Jews and Gentiles joined together, who are gathered by the Lord during the dominion of Antichrist. A number which is great, and yet numerable before men. But the number which shall hereafter be seen in Heaven, consisting of all the elect of all times, is also indeed known before God, but it is innumerable before men. See Gen. 15. 5. Isa. 49. 20. And 60. 4, 5, etc]
\p
\v 5 . Of the Tribe of Judea were sealed twelve thousand: Of the Tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand: Of the Tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand:
\p
\v 6 . Of the Tribe of Asur were sealed twelve thousand: Of the Tribe of Nephthali were sealed twelve thousand: Of the Tribe Manassah were twelve thousand:
\p
\v 7 . Of Tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand : Of the Tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand: [Here the Tribe of Levi is numbered among the Tribes of Israel, who notwithstanding had no certain inheritance in the land of Canaan, and the Tribe of Dan is left out. The reason is, because we are now all Priests and Levites before God. But as concerning the Danites, their Tribe is here passed by, because they were the first that gave themselves up to commit idolatry, Judg. chapter 18. And entertained the Calves of Jerobeam at Dan, 1 Kings chapter 12. Wherefore they were also among the first, that were carried away by the Heathen, 2 Kings chapter 16. And remained ever since scattered among them. Wherefore also the Tribe of Dan in the return of the Israelites, after the captivity of Babel, is no more numbered among the Tribes of Israel in the first book of the Chronicles] Of the Tribe of Isachar were sealed twelve thousand:
\p
\v 8 . Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand of the tribes of Joseph [that is of the tribe of Ephraim whose name is also concealed because the idolatry of Dan and Bethel had also in the original from them fro Jerobeam was an Ephraimites 1 Kings 11.26 therefore Joseph the father of Ephraim is here put in his stead others conceive that the tribes of Ephraim are therefore called the tribes of Joseph because the tribe of Ephraim is exalted above the tribe of Manasses in Jacobs blessings Genesis 48.14,19 Psalms 78.67]were sealed twelve thousand of the tribes of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.
\p
\v 9 . After this I beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number of all nations and kindred and number and people and languages [Gr tounges] standing before the throne and before the lamb being clothed with the long white garments [as the former marking of the hundred and four and forty thousand was done on earth in the time of the antichrist when the churches of Christ lay yet hid an was persecuted under him so this innumerable number of all nations and people was seen in heaven before the throne of God were they were gathered from all parts of the world and from all times some others take this innumerable number to be those which after the beginning of the antichrist are gathered in the public congregation throughout all countries and are still daily gathered for this marking is wont to be made in the oppressed and hidden churches not in the public and free assemblies in that place Ezekiel 9.4 also importeth see likewise hereafter chapter 14.1] and palm branches were in the hands [namely in token of victory .]
\p
\v 10 . And they cried with a great voice saying salvation be to our great God, which sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb[namely salvation be alone ascribed unto him that is we have obtained it not by our own strength, works, and worthiness but the mere grace of God and merits of our Jesus Christ our savior see Ephesians 2 verse 8, 9, 10 Revelations 19.1.]
\p
\v 11 . And all the angels stood around about the throne and all the elders and four beasts fell down before the throne on their face, [ that is with submissive hearts and the reverence before the majesty for the angels and the spirits have neither faces neither flesh nor bones as Christ speaketh Luke 24 verse 39] and worshipped God.
\p
\v 12 . Saying Amen praise [Gr. Blessing] and glory, and wisdom, and honor, and power , and thanksgiving and strength be to our God [that is the praise concerning these attributes to spread abroad by all and ascribed unto God ] in all eternity[Gr in eternity of eternities] Amen.
\p
\v 13 . And one of the elders answered saying unto me these which are clothed with long white robe who are they and whence come they ? [here the elders seemeth to point at a whole multitude which had some peculiar fashion of apparel.]
\p
\v 14 . And I said unto him Lord [thus John called this elder by way of reverence ] thou knowest it and he said unto me these are they which come out of great tribulation [namely under antichrist for of the other martyrs is spoken in the former chapter] and they have washed their long robes and have made their long robes white in the blood of the lamb [that is have purified them etc. for the blood o Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all our sins 1John 1.7.]
\p
\v 15 . Therefore are they before the throne of God [that is in the presence of the face of God]and serve him day and night [by rendering praise and thanks unto him] in his temple [namely in the innermost part of heaven for the heavenly Jerusalem hath no other temple but God and the lamb below chapter 21.22] and he that sitteth on the throne will overshadow them [ or dwell among them Gr. Be or make a tent or Tabernacle over them.
\p
\v 16 . They shall hunger no more neither shall they thirst no more neither shall the sun light upon them neither any heat[that is no harm want shall befall them anymore see the like Isaiah 49.10.]
\p
\v 17 . For the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them nor shall be their leader to the living and fountains of waters [that is the fullness of the gifts of the holy ghost see john 4.14 and 7.38 and hereafter chapter 22.1 ] and God shall away all tears from their eyes [a comparison taken from a nurse nor mother which comforteth her child that weepeth and here such a weeping is meant as that no other tears shall follow after it see Isaiah 25.8 and hereafter revelations 21.4.]
\c 8
\s The seventh seal is open whereupon there followeth silence in heaven 2 after which silence seven heaven angels are seen with seven trumpets 3 but thee appeareth first another angel which layeth incense upon the golden altars together with the prayers of the saints 5 then fileth his censer with fire from the altar and casteth it upon the earth 7 that being done the first angel bloweth the trumpet and also the second whence the terrible things follow 10 then the third angel bloweth the trumpet and the star called wormwood falleth from heaven into the waters 12 finally the fourth angel bloweth the trumpet and the third part of the sun, moon and the stars is smitten with darkness 13 after which another angel crieth woe because of the plagues of the three following trumpets.
\p
\v 1 And when it had opened the seven seal [namely the last of the book with seven seals which the lamb took out of the hand of him that sat upon the throne chapter 5.7]there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour[that is there was a calm or a cessation from speaking and from the sound of other voices that were heard before by which calm or silence some understand a cessation from presenting the church on earth which continued for a short time after the subduing of the Tyrants by Constantine others take this calm and quietness to be an earnest expectation of all the spirits in heaven upon that which should follow after the opening of the seventh seal and is also taken by some of the manner and practice that was wont to be used in the temple at the hour of prayer when the incense went into the holy pace to offer incense as the angel will do here immediately and all the congregation that was quiet and still without waited for the priest coming forth as appeareth Luke 1.10.]
\p
\v 2 . And I saw the seventh angel which stood before God and to them were given seven trumpets[by the seven angel some understand the whole multitude of the holy angel that stand continually round about the throne of God because the number of the seven is a perfect number but this my also be here understood of the special seven angels which were chosen out of the whole multitude to receive this special charge from God and the angels are said to stand before God here and Luke 1.19 and always to behold the face of the father in heaven Matthew 18.10because they always have access unto the throne of God and are always ready to receive and execute the commands of God Hebrews 1.14.]
\p
\v 3 . And there came another angel [namely of another nature which here stept in between both before the other seven did sound their trumpets: and by this angel is here necessarily to be understood Christ our Mediator, the Angel of the covenant and of God’s face, Mal. 3. 1. And Isa. 63. Ver. 9. Who alone is the Priest of heaven, and (as followeth) offereth and presenteth our prayers with the incense of his merits upon the golden altar, that is, upon himself, unto God for a sweet smelling savour, as is testified, Rom. 8. 34. Ephes. 5. 2. Heb. 4. Ver. 14. And 9. 14. And 13. Ver. 10. 15. 1 Joh. 2. 1.] and stood at the altar, having a golden censer: and much incense was given unto him, [namely, of God his Father, forasmuch s he ordained him to be a Mediator] that he should lay it (with) the prayers of all saints, [Gr. Should give it to the prayers, etc. Some understand this of the prayers of all believers on earth, who continually cry and sigh unto God, that his kingdom might come, and that he would deliver them from the evil one. Others understand this of the prayers of the Martyrs in particular, whereof is spoken before, ch. 6. 10. But may be indeed understood of all the prayers of God’s children in general] upon the golden altar which is before the throne.
\p
\v 4 . And the smoke incense (with) the prayers of the saints, [Or laid by the prayers, & c] went up before God [namely, to be heard of the Father: after which the following jugements of God, as a fruit of that hearing, should follow. See acts 10. Ver. 4. ] out of the Angel’s hand.
\p
\v 5 . And the Angel took the censer, [The Greek word signifieth properly incense, but it appeareth plainly by that which followeth, that it must here be taken for the censer, as also v. 3.] and filled it with the fire of the altar, [hereby is fitly understood Christ’s servent desire whereby he desireth that our prayers joined with his merits, should be accepted of God, and heard of him, Joh. 17. 24.] and cast it upon earth: [namely, the fire of the altar, whereby as he always desireth that which maketh for the good and salvation of believers, so doth he likewise desire that the justice of God his Father should be executed against the impenitent oppressors of his Church. See Psal. 2. 12. As this also would appear by the fruits of the sounding of the seven Angels] and there were voices, and thundering, and lightnings and earthquake. [namely, s it is always heard. See Joh. 11. Ver. 41, 42. And 12. 28, 29.]
\p
\v 6 . And the seven Angels which had the seven trumpets, prepared themselves to sound. [As it is noted on the second verse of the foregoing sixth chapter, that some Expositors interpret the Visions of the six first seals of the political changes and troubles that have befallen the world, and especially the Roman Empire, in regard of the oppressions of the Church of Christ, unto the times of Constantine: so there be also some that understand these Trumpets of the following changes and troubles, which the Roman Empire by reason of divers barbarous nations from all parts of the world, at sundry times of Constantine: so there be also some that understand these Trumpets of the following changes and barbarous nations from all parts of the world, at sundry times hath endured: whereby the same Empire in the West hath been quite subdued, and hath been divided into many Kingdoms and Principalities, which afterward by the spiritual dominion of the Bishop of Rome, were in some sort after another manner knitted and fastened to the other. Which opinion with the phrases that are here used, and with comparing of such like phrases seemeth to be also confirmed from the Old Testament: whereof see Isa. 28. 2. And 30. 30. Jerem. 15. 9. Ezek. 32. 7. But seeing it was said before, that Christ is here every where brought in, not as a Ruler of worldly Kingdoms, but as a spiritual Governour of his Church, and that by the mediation and intercession of Christ here, and by his marking out in the former chapter: and in the next chapter in the fourth verse, true believers are kept free from these following judgements and troubles, as Christ also prayeth for Peter, Luke 22. 32. And assureth all believers, that they shall not be seduced by the false Prophets, Matth. 24. 25. Whereas they are not free from corporal troubles, therefore it’s more meet that this be understood of the Spiritual estate of the Church, and of the temporal estate only so far forth as it concerneth the Spiritual.]
\p
\v 7 . And the first Angel sounded, and there was hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third (part) of the trees was burnt, and all the green grass was burnt. [Hereby is fitly understood the arch-heresy, which after a little rest of the Church in Constantine’s time, corrupted the sound and wholesome doctrine, namely, the heresy of the Arrians, who denied the eternal God-head of the Holy Ghost, and which corrupted a great part of the Church. As sound doctrine is compared unto rain, Isa. 55. Ver. 10, 11. So this destructive doctrine is fitly compared to hail and fire, which causeth the earth to wither. And here blood is also adjoined, because it was followed with great persecution under the Emperour Constantius and others, throughout a great part of the world, whereby a third part of it, that is, of Teachers, and other eminent members of the Church were seduced, and the green grass was burnt, that is, the vulgar sort or common members, who indeed seemed to flourish in the church, but having no true root, withered, as Christ speaketh of such as fall away, Matth. 13. Verse 20, 21.]
\p
\v 8 . And the second Angel sounded, and there was (something) as a great mountain burning with fire cast into the Sea: and the third part of the Sea became blood.
\p
\v 9 . And the third (part) of the creatures in the Sea, that had life died, and the third (part) of the ships perished. [by the great mountain burning with fire, etc. is understood the second arch-heresy, namely, that of the Pelagians, which rose up about the year four hundred, and assaulted the church of Christ for some considerable time: which is therefore compared to a mountain of fire, because it exalted the free will of man against the grace of Christ, and caused man so to be puffed up by his own seeming holiness and self conceitedness of his perfection and natural strength in heavenly and spiritual matters, as the Scripture also elsewhere compareth such kind of pride unto mountains, Isa. 2. Ver. 14, 15. Zach. 4. 7. This mountain is said to be cast into the Sea, because this Heresy, besides other places, did afterwards possess many islands, as Rhodes, Sicily, Britannie and others more as Histories testify. Otherwise Nations are also sometimes in this Book called waters, as is showed below, chapter 17. 15. And by the ships that are therein, were corrupted by this doctrine: yet so as that Christ still preserveth two parts thereof (by the diligence of faithful Teachers) in the sound and Orthodox doctrine.]
\p
\v 10 . And the third Angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven burning like a torch, and (it) fell upon the third (part) of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters. [Hereby is fitly understood the third Arch-heresy, which began about the year four hundred twenty and five, and was broached by one Nestorius Bishop of Constantinople, an eloquent and eminent Bishop, who divided the two natures in Christ, and mad of Christ two persons, namely one that was man, and one that was God: for which respect he is called a great star burning like a torch. And though his doctrine seemed to gainsay the Arrians, yet he was bitter like worm wood as followeth whereunto also seducing doctrine is compared Hebrews 12.15 and it spread itself through many nations as fountains and rivers are wont to do until it was condemned by all the churches in the Synod of Ephesus.]
\p
\v 11 . And the name of the star is called wormwood [that is like indeed was like wormwood that is bitter for it maketh doctrine bitter like the wormwood and unfit for good and wholesome nourishment though in the first it appeareth otherwise] the third part of the waters became wormwood and many men died for the waters as they were made bitter.
\p
\v 12 . And the fourth angel sounded and the third part of the sun was smitten and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars and third part of them should be darkened and that the third part of the day should not shine and that of the night likewise [ hereby is fitly understood the fourth part arch-heresy namely of Eutichians which sprung up about the year four hundred and fifty quite contrary to the Nestorian Heresy which taught that two natures in Christ were mingled and confounded and the one turned into the other whereby Christ the sun of righteousness was robbed of a great part of his honor the moon that is the church of Christ the stars that is their teachers in a great measure darkened and the light of doctrine itself deprived of its true splendor and brightness till in the Synod of the Chalcedon the same doctrine was condemned as destructive and evil after which arch-heresy did follow many and contentions about precedence did arise which at length rent the churches of the east and west and brought them into many troubles whence also in the next chapter greater troubles should arise as the angel here declareth.]
\p
\v 13 And I looked and I heard an angel flying in the midst of heaven saying with a great voice wo, wo, wo to them that dwell on earth by reason of the remaining voices of the trumpet of the tree angel which shall yet sound.
\c 9
\s The fifth angel sounded there falleth a star from heaven which hath the key of the bottomless pit 2 where issueth smoke as the smoke of a furnace 3 and out of the smoke come locusts which sting the men that have not the seal of God 7 the form men and arming of these locusts is described 11 and the name of their kings Abaddon 13 after this the sixth angel sounded whereupon the four angels by the river Euphrates are loosed and there appears a great multitude of horsemen which slay the third part of men 20 after all which men do not repent of their idolatry and sins.
\p
\v 1 And the fifth angel sounded and I saw a star fallen from heaven upon the earth[some understand by this star Mahomet and his followers whom about the year six hundred and twenty did take together his ungodly doctrine out of Judaism, gentilism and christianism and brought the same to light of the bottomless pit as followeth and afterwards by his Arabians Saracens as armed locusts did propagate the same through a great part of the world partly by deceit and partly by violence as such armies are compared to locusts or grasshoppers Judges 7.12 Isaiah 33.4 Joel 1.4 and 2.4etc from which places this description is for the most part taken but this book by stars are every where meant the overseers and teachers of the churches as is shewed chapter 1.20 therefore here far more aptly the bishop of Rome with his adherents is to be understood who set up himself as an universal bishop among the Christians about the very same time who after the ruin of Roman empire instead of minding only the spiritual care hath rather given himself to earthly and temporal care and hath set up a new dominion and is therefore saith to be fallen from heaven upon the earth ] and to it was given the key of the abyss [that is power to open the pit of the deepest part of the abyss that is of hell Luke 8.31 whence arose this thick smoke whereof in the sequel which power in God’s just judgment is unthankfulness was given to it as is also said hereafter verse 4.5 and as Paul speaketh 2 Thessalonians 1 verse 9,10,11.]
\p
\v 2 . and it opened the pit of the deep and there arose the smoke from the pit as the smoke of a great furnace[ by smoke here is meant false and idolatrous doctrine which Paul 1Timothy 4.1 calleth doctrines of devil consisting in the forbidding of marriage and the use of meats which God created to be used with thanksgiving as also of idolatry image worship their own merits and satisfactions and other superstitions as is expressed hereafter verse 20] and the sun and the air[that is Christ and his doctrine as above chapter 8.12 and elsewhere ] where darkened by the smoke of the pit.
\p
\v 3 . And there came out the smoke of the locusts upon the earth and unto them was given power as the scorpion of the have power[ that is out of the idolatrous and superstitious doctrine these locust had their original for the forbidding of the marriage of certain meats by the inventing of purgatory by doctrine of their own merits and satisfaction and the like the multitude of monks and the others called religious orders were so exceedingly increased through Christendom as is well known.]
\p
\v 4 . And to them it was said that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree[that is true believers which grow and flourish in the Lord‘s field Psalms 1.3 and 92.13 this is said to shew here is not said of the grasshoppers properly so called by the hypocritical and fruitful men as their following description also sheweth]but only the man which have not seal on their foreheads [see of this seal on the forehead of God above chapter7.3,4.]
\p
\v 5 . And power was given unto them and not that they should kill them but that they should be tormented by them [namely in their consciences through the uncertainty of their of their through the uncertainty of the sufficiency of their merits through fear of purgatory and the like whereas those that are marked with seal of Gods spirit are free these as God testifieth Romans 5 verse 1,2 8.1 ] five months [that is the time that the locusts are wont to be in the field in their vigor and strength from the beginning of the spring till after harvest or the whole time of the summer whereby is signified that these locusts shall be not in straight way removed or hindered from vexing men as the grasshoppers from the plagues of Egypt were Exodus 10.9 but that they shall retain all property all the time that they are in their strength and vigor and the whole time that God hath appointed ] and their torment was like the torment of the scorpion when it hath stung a man [namely whose stinging the longer it lasted the worse it growth if it be not cured in the beginning.]
\p
\v 6 . And those days shall man seek doth [namely through anguish of heart] and shall not find it and shall desire to die and death shall free from them.
\p
\v 7 . And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses which are prepared unto war and upon their heads were as it were crown like gold and the faces were as the faces of men [this description sheweth that here is only spoken of hurtful men that they are always ready for to persecute those that are true Christians and to make spiritual war against them like horses that stand ready prepared to make battle with their shaven crowns like the crowns of their heads do witness and declare on their dominion which they have under superior with his triple crown which with a fair countenance like men posses the heart of many by their long hair do indeed feign in mildness or meekness but they have teeth like lion teeth to hurt Christians by their inquisitions and other sharp and cruel proceedings which oppose their privileges and immunities granted them by their king of whom verse 11 like iron beast plates and by the noise of their wings do exalt themselves above others and make all the world afraid lastly which within their tails that is their superstitious doctrine do exceedingly vex and torment those men that have not the seal of God as was shewed verse 5.]
\p
\v 8 . And they had hair as the hair of women and teeth as the teeth of lions.
\p
\v 9 . And they had breast-plates as lion breast-plates and the noise of their wings was as the noise of their carets when many horses run to the battle.
\p
\v 10 . And they had tails like scorpion and their stings in their tails and their power was to hurt men five months .
\p
\v 11 . And they had over them the angel of the bottomless pit his name was in the Hebrew Abaddon and in the Greek language he had the name Apollony [Abaddon in the Hebrew and Apollon in the Greek signifieth perdition and destroyer and agreeth with the name which the apostle Paul giveth unto anti-Christ 2Thessalonians 2 verse 3,4,9 when he calleth him the man of sin and the son of perdition and adversary and he that exalieth himself above all that is called God whose cunning is after the working of Satan whereof see the exposition there.]
\p
\v 12 . One wo is past [ namely in respect of the vision which was shewed to the apostle for the thing itself came to pas a long while after and shall not be utterly abolished until the coming of Jesus Christ as Paul testifieth 2Thessalonians 2.8] behold they were yet two woes after this .
\p
\v 13 . And the sixth angel sounded and I heard a voice out of the four horns of the altar which was before God [this hath respect to the altar of the incense which hath four horns and stood in the holy place before the holy of holies on which altar the priest did daily offer incense but on these four horns the high priest offered only once a year Exodus 30.10 by which horns Christ over is understood who here in this chapter pronounceth sentence for the punishment of those that yet persecuted his church see above chapter 6.9.]
\p
\v 14 . Saying to the sixth angel which hath the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound by the great river Euphrates [by these four angel is for the most part by all expositors understood that sort of the Mahumetanes which chiefly consisted of four nations which subdued all others under them namely the Arabians, Saracines, Tartars and Turks whereof the Arabians and the Saracines from the year six hundred and twenty used much violence against the Christians and especially against the Roman emperor in the east and west but were afterwards by the Christians driven again beyond the Euphrates till about the year thirteen hundred when the antichrist was at the highest and the orthodox Christians were most oppressed the Tartars and Turks were broken out of both through Armenia lying against the Euphrates and overrun and subdued all Asia and Africa and abolished the Grecian and eastern emperor whereof Constantinople was the metropolis in which wars much blood was shed and it seemeth that by these wars those kings that had given their power unto the beast were so full of employment that the orthodox teachers in divers countries in the mean while erected churches so that they could not be rooted out by all the persecution of antichrist as came to pass in France, England, Bohemia Switzerland and other parts of the world by Waldus, Wiclef, John, Hus,Jerome of Prague and others besides whereof more at large will be prophesied in the chapters following who re bound and see namely by God providence till the measure of sins of Christendom was filled up and testified verse 20 and that in Gods just judgment the reign shall be given to those nation to execute their ambition and greedy desire after their prey as Isaiah 10.5 Jeremiah 25.9.]
\p
\v 15 . And the four angels wee loosed which wee prepared against the against the hour and day and month and year to slay the third part of men [for by these armies many hundred thousand Christians where slain and many others brought to apostate and thereby to spiritual death as the histories of those times and experience testify.]
\p
\v 16 . And the number of the armies of the horsemen[this is expressed because their armies did most consist in horses which were exceeding great and much far surpass the armies of the Christians whereby also got their greatest victories as is expressed in the following verse ] was twice ten thousand of ten thousand [that is an exceeding great multitude by this phrase is also elsewhere understood see Psalms 68.18 Daniel 7.10 and that these Turks and Tartars with some hundred thousand are wont to march into the field is sufficiently known by the histories ] and I heard the number of them [ to wit named in this vision.]
\p
\v 17 . And thus I saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them having fiery and sky color and brimstone-color breast-plate [forasmuch as these nations used to wear very few iron weapons therefore some do understand hereby their divers liveries which they used to were of such like colours others understand thereby their cruel hearts which they bear towards their Christians and their horrid blasphemies which they are wont to belch out against them ] and he heads of the horses were as the heads of the lions [that is which are strong swift and cruel and are wont to rage not only by smiting but also by biting and renting in pieces ] and out of their mouth went forth fire and smoke and brimstone [some apply this to the great gun which they carried in the discharge whereof there seemeth to issue fire smoke and brimstone out of the mouths others understand hereby all manner of cruelty which they should commit by their weapons.]
\p
\v 18 . By these three was the third part of men killed namely by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which came forth out of their mouths.
\p
\v 19 . For their power is in their mouths and their tails [some apply this thereunto that they knew how to shoot and hurt not afterwards in pursuing but also backward in fleeing in former times with their bows but now with their guns ] for their tails are like unto serpents [whose poison lieth in their heads and in their tails which also use to hurt most with these two as there are also such serpents found that have heads and their tails that is are called Amphisbaenae] and have heads and with them do hurt.
\p
\v 20 . and the rest of the men which were not killed of these plagues [namely which God had sent among them for their idolatry and other sins committed by them as these words do plainly shew whence it appeareth tat idolatry which the Christians had set up in Grecia and in all the east-countries and had confirmed by their second Synod of nice and other Synods more was the cause why God in his just judgment sent this plagues and punishment upon them by whose example withstanding the western churches took no warning but still continued in the same idolatry as the words following do shew ] repented not of the works of their hands [that is image worship for not devils but images are the works of men’s hands ] that they should not worship devils [here no mention is made of the idolatry of the heathen which long before were most destroyed by the heathen for the Mahumetanes properly did not make war against the heathen which long before wee most destroyed by the Christians emperor in the east and west of the wars of Mehumetanes among themselves for they neither hath no worship images but they make war against the Christians images also those that were not killed by them but wee left alive were not heathen but Christians of profession so that here by the worshiping of devils respect is not had that they did indeed and in the truth because of those that depart from the true worship of God and set up a false worship forbidden by God do not serve God by it but the devil what boasting so ever they make as appeareth 2 Chronicles 11.15 Amos 5 verse 25,26 1Corinthians 10 verse 20 and as the apostle 1Timothy 4.1 calleth them doctrines of devils which they indeed esteem to be divine doctrines but because they oppose God’s institution and to be held to be no better than doctrines and service of devil ]and golden and silver and copper and stone and wooden idols [or images ]which neither can see nor hear nor walk that is taken out of the115 Psalms which the apostle applieth to the antichristian images which hath no more power when the images of the gentiles and the Jews have in this case.]
\p
\v 21 . And they repented not also of their murderers [hereof besides the others of the martyrs they have slain of so many thousand in many ages by fire the sword and the halter and otherwise are sufficient witnesses ] nor of their poisonings [or sorceries as this word signifieth both as both are too, too rife in kingdom of antichrist ] nor of their fornication [whereof the public stews which in great multitudes are tolerated by them and whereof they gather tribute and concubinate of priest among the rest are a sufficient proof ] nor of heir thefts [among which may justly be counted withholding of inheritances from right heirs and bringing the same to their own cloisters and the diverting of good dedicated to the worship of God toward the maintain of the idle bellies and towards worldly pride among many.]
\c 10
\s After the relation of the plagues which under the sixth trumpet should come Christendom from the east and west there is related in the chapter that which should follow for the churches comfort under the same trumpet and first an angel is seen descending from heaven in great glory with a little book open in his hand 3 which crieth with a loud voice whereupon seven thunder claps follow 5 and he sweareth by him that liveth forever that time should be no more after that the seventh trumpet should have founded 8 after that he delivereth the book that was open to the apostle to eat it up 10 which was sweet in the mouth but bitter in the belly 11 after that he telleth the apostle that he must prophesy again.
\p
\v 1 And I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven [some conceive that this was angel Gabriel because this name signifieth the might of God but most other expositors understand by this angel the Lord Christ himself who appeareth here in a vision as descending from heaven for the comfort of his church not in his own human nature whom the heaven must continue until the restitution of all things Acts 3.21 but in respect of his working which are fitly expressed in this vision as is partly shewed chapter 1.13,15 and as h speaketh of his continual presence in his church Matthew 18.20 and 28.20 for before he appeared unto the apostle in the shape o a lamb and of a priest of heaven because he is considered in the former division as an advocate and intercessor with the father but henceforth he is sometimes manifested in his glory as an angel or ambassador f his father sometimes as king of kings and a conqueror of all sometimes as the bridegroom of his church because I the sequel he is brought in as an executioner of God decrees upon his church or upon the entries thereof ] which was clothed with a cloud [namely as a token o his majesty as he went before the hosts of the Israelite in the cloudy pillars Exodus 13.21 etc. and appeared in the temple 2 Chronicles 5.13 and 7.1 and will also come at the last day with clouds as the judge of all as is testified before in this book chapter 1.7] and a rain bow was upon his head [of this and of the following properties see above chapter 1.15,16 and 4.3 ] and the face was as the sun and the feet as pillars of fire.
\p
\v 2 . And he had on his hand a little book which was opened [some understand hereby God book of providence which was before sealed with seals which is now open in hand of Christ because none in heaven and earth was able to open it but the lamb which was lain as is testified chapter 5.3 which is therefore called a little book because there remained now yet but a part to be revealed before and because there remained now yet but a part to be revealed others take it to be meant of the book of the gospel which in those times when antichrist was at the highest was a closed book unto the church but from this very time that the Turks did break in against Christendom as was noted in the former chapter it was again more and more revealed and more nakedly propounded unto the church by some special men of God] and he set his right foot upon the sea and the left on the earth [namely to signify that from henceforth he took public possession of the earth and the sea of the continent and isles to propagate again his truth and the doctrine in both.]
\p
\v 3 . And he [namely whom none was able to hinder from being heard] cried with a great voice as a lion roareth and when he had cried the seven thunder claps uttered their voices [namely certain mysteries or prophecies of things to come for these thunderclaps gave not only a sound but were also joined with a speaking voice as appeareth by the following verse see the like chapter 1.10,11.]
\p
\v 4 . And when the seven thunder claps hath uttered their voices I should have written them and I heard a voice from heaven which said unto me the seven thunderclaps uttered [the like prohibition may be read Daniel 8.26 and 12.4 whereby the eight and concernment of the things which the thunderclaps hath uttered is set forth which ought rather to be known by the event thereof then the prediction in the church ] and write it not [some books have and thou shalt write it afterwards therefore some are of opinion that which is sealed here , was first set down in writing in the fourteenth chapter and rather because chapter 1.1 it is said that the revelation was given to Jesus Christ to make the same known to his minister not to conceal it see also hereafter chapter 22.10.]
\p
\v 5 . And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven [namely according to the common course used by the ancient in swearing see Genesis 14.22 Daniel 12.7 yea God himself speaketh thus of himself Exodus 6.7.]
\p
\v 6 . And he swear by him that liveth forevermore which created the heaven and that which therein is and the earth and that which therein is and the sea that which therein is that there shall be time no more [namely after the sounding of the seventh angel as the next verse sheweth which some understand by the time which by the course of heaven is measured out in days months and years which time will end with he and of the world others understand it of time of repentance which this time shall no more be given unto men which is therefore confirmed by the angel with such an oath that men might presently heed it persecution and oppression of the church of God by antichrist and the world and that the angel therefore so confirmeth it with an oath namely to assure the church thereof and to comfort here thereby as Christ also doth Luke 21.28.]
\p
\v 7 . But in the days of the seventh angel when he shall sound [this according to the opinion of many shall be the voice of the arc-angel at the last day after which shall follow at the resurrection of the dead and the last judgment with the full deliverance and the glorification of Christ 1Corinthians 15.52 1Thessalonians 4.16] the mystery of God shall be fulfilled as he had declared to his servants the prophets [ many understand this as shewed before of all that should befall the church of Christ in the world and of all that was foretold by the prophets which shall end with this trumpet others are of opinion that being it is foretold by the prophet that the house of Jacob shall be converted to the Lord that the whole church of Christ consisting of Jews and gentiles shall yet triumph over all her enemies even in this world and understand these words so that the same shall be in the beginning of the trumpet and that Christ shall not appear till after that to pronounce judgment upon all flesh continually in scripture concerning the church of Christ in this world because there is no where any settled rest promise unto the church of Christ in this world but a continual warfare against her enemies ye even then when the Jews shall be converted unto Christ which conversion some do place under the sixth trumpet but here shall be spoken more at large chapter 20.]
\p
\v 8 . And the voice which I had heard from heaven spake with me again and said thy way and take thy little book [namely whereof was spoken verse 2 of this chapter whereof see also there the exposition] which is opened and is in the hand of he angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.
\p
\v 9 . And I went my way unto the angel and said unto him give me that little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up [these words are taken out of Ezekiel 3 verse 1 where the like command is given to the prophet and thereby is meant that he was diligently to peruse ponder understand and ruminate upon that book] and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.
\p
\v 10 . And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand and I ate it up and it was in my mouth and it was as sweet as honey and when I had eaten it belly was bitter [hereby is signified that the knowledge of the mysteries of God indeed pleasant and delightful but that afterwards the operation that followeth thereupon are oftentimes bitter and grievous unto the children of God as for example the denying of ourselves and the affliction and persecution that thence befall them likewise the punishments which are threatened to the persecutors are also bitter and grievous to hear of unto the children of God as Ezekiel chapter 3.15 is troubled in his mind when he complaineth of the Jews obstinacy against his sermons and Paul of the obstinacy of Jews of his time Romans 9.2.]
\p
\v 11 . And he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many people and nations and languages and kings [some understand this of John who should again be released from his banishments that he might everywhere preach the gospel freely and without control but sith here is spoken of prophesying under the sixth trumpet should again appear and come to light out of the persecution and thick darkness of anti-Christianism as shall be shewed in the next chapter whereunto this chapter is kind of introduction.]
\c 11
\s A reed is given to the angel to measure the temple 2 but not the court 3 Christ giveth unto his two witnesses power to prophesy and inflict plagues upon their enemies 7 the beasts cometh out of the bottomless pit and killeth the witnesses 9 whereat the nations rejoice 11 but after three days and a half they revive 12 and are taken up in heaven13 after which followeth an earth quake and hurt upon the great city 15 seventh angel sounded and the kingdoms become God’s and Christ’s16 whereupon the twenty and four elders praise God 18 and he wrath of God cometh upon the nations but the prepared reward is given to the saints 19 the temple of God in heaven is opened.
\p
\v 1 And there was given a reed like unto a measuring reed and the angel stood and said arise and measure the temple of God [that is limit the truth church wherein God is worshipped aright and separate it from others that is the greatest multitude and which though they bear the title of it yet are not so in did and in truth in this vision represented in this chapter is by the reparation of the temple set forth the restoration of the decayed worship of God in the church of Christ through the straighter limits after that the same was subverted by the tyranny of the antichrist in part foretold already in the foregoing ninth chapter and this vision is taken out of Ezekiel 40.3 etc. whereby the like measuring and that greater breadth and that the temple was formerly is signified the restoration of the church which before was fallen to decay and which by Christ should be restored again in a large compass throughout the world ] and the altar and them that worship therein [this altar was two fold in the temple namely the altar of burning offering which stood before the temple in the priest court were the offering of the atonement and thankfulness where perfomed with the worshippers are also measured here to be set up again because there were two fundamental points of Christian faith were under the kingdom of antichrist and most darkened and subverted to wit first cause of reconciliation of our sins before God,, which the scripture also placeth only in Christ and his sacrifice whereas the same under the antichrist is sought in private merit ,pardon , purgatory, going on pilgrimages to saints and such like superstition secondly the true invocation of the only God by the only mediator Christ whereas the same invocation is antichrist kingdom is divided among many patrons and patronesses as is well known these are then here alone the true worshippers before God which keep alone close to God and Christ in their sanctuary. And these are likewise alone the true priest of the new testament though they are fewer in number and somewhat more removed from the sight of the of the world and not those that are in open courts exercise their superstitious service worships in greater assemblies.]
\p
\v 2 And the court which is without the temple [some copies have it which is within the temple namely in respect of the outermost wall of the temple ] leave out [Gr cast out without ] and measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles [so are all those called that are used heathenish practice by committing idolatry in their worships performed unto God although the Greek signifieth also nations in general ] and the holy city shall they tread under foot [that is the visible church which was typified by Jerusalem which is now taken and trodden under foot by idolaters because they should come with the title of that temple and of these holy church and persecute the true church . So that the outer court are meant those which have most devotion and respect under the men of the antichrist and their clergy as they speak and holy city is meant the whole multitude that belong thereunto and also boast of this title no otherwise and those of Jerusalem used formerly to do even when they persecuted Christ and his true members ] two forty months [this time is meant by the whole time of the antichrist dominion but the account of the beginning and the end this time is diversely taken as shall be noted on the next verse but the safest is that we do expect the accomplishment thereof with patience.]
\p
\v 3 And I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days clothed with sacks [ some are opinion that by these two witnesses are meant Enoch and Elias which for this space of two and forty months and of the thousand and two hundred and three scores day that is about for three days that is about three and a half years before the end of the world should prophesy against antichrist and after that be killed by him and to whom according to the letter should happen all that is here related in the text in the verse following and this opinion is urged by many in these days to darken antichrist and kingdom which now for a long time hath been known in the world but besides that is absurd that the holy ghost of the revelation should come to pass by those things that consequently should come to pass hereafter wherein the church of Christ suffered so many changes and straight way come to the four last years of the world it is impossible that the antichrist kingdom within the compass of three years and a half should be set up and perfume all things through our the whole world that in word of God are afore told of him and his kingdom it is also repugnant of the word of God that the saints should descend from heaven with their heavenly bodies to be killed here or that they should come and preach again in this world as Abraham testifieth Luke 16.29 or also that they should in the space of three years and half prophesy among all nations or that their bodies within the space of three days properly so called and an half should thus seen by the nations kindred and languages and that they that dwell upon the earth should rejoice thereat and send presents to one another as here is said in next text therefore both thing itself and time must necessarily be here prophetically and figuratively understood namely of such days as signify whole years as Ezekiel 4.5 and Daniel 9.24 which years by some begun from six hundred and six when the bishop of Rome did assume the title of bishop of the universal Christian church (which belongeth only to Christ) and idolatry did most begin to brake in among Christians . though others begin these years somewhat earlier name from the destruct of old Rome and from his dominion under the goathes about the year of the hundred and twelve but this opinion being left once as was said on the second verse the raising of the two witnesses is fitly understood of some eminent teachers whom God within that space of time out of the kingdom of the antichrist did here and there and divers time raise up in his church to discover that oppose this dominion and idolatry who are therefore it was said to disclothed with sacks because in mean garment and in a sad and mournful countenance they opposed the pride of the arrogance of the antichrist of the kingdom and therefore are called two because they should be but yet enough to testify the truth unto men sith all truth consisteth in two or three witnesses Deuteronomy 9.15 and because God commonly was wont to use two such excellent witnesses for the restoration of the decayed doctrine as here in the words following the first respect is had to Joshua and Serubabel who set up the worship of God after the activity of Babel in the 4 verse and to Moses and Aaron which did the same in the wilderness and to Elias and Eliseus which did the same in the Achab and other worshippers of Baal whereunto respect is had here in verse 5 and six two may also be there called two because they only produce the doctrine o the old and new testament for confutation of the popery as the witnesses of the truth and whereby effectually convinced others such were Weldus and Peter Bruis in France Wicklif and Pourneus in England John Hus and Jerome of Prague in Boheima in Germany who also were put to death for it I the council of the Constance and with joy of all the company gathered out of divers nations and tongues burnt till it pleased God afterwards to raise the Luther and the Malancthon in Germany Zwinglius and Oecolumpadius in Switzerland Farelleus and Calvin in France and more others in their stead with more efficacy have prepared the testimony and have preferred a great testimony and have caused a great part of great Babel to fall of whose total ruin and destruction shall be prophesied hereafter.]
\p
\v 4 These are the two olive tree and two candle sticks which stand before the God of the earth [this example is taken of Zachariah’s vision chapter 4.2,3,4 where Joshua the high priest and Serubabel the prince are thus typified because they were instruments where by the oil of eh holy ghost and the light of his word were effectual for the restoration of the ruined temple and worship of God in Israel after the captivity of Babel.]
\p
\v 5 And if any man will hurt them a fire shall proceed out of their mouth and shall devour their enemies [this hath respect to the example of Moses in Rebellion of Corab with the compliances Numbers 16.35and to the example of Elias against the soldiers that came to apprehend him 2Kings 1.10 whereby all manner of plagues are understood which God sent upon the enemies of the prophets it may also be understood of the fire of Gods threatening against obstinate sinners as appeareth Jeremiah 5.14] and if any man will hurt them and thus must be killed.
\p
\v 6 These have power to shut heaven that no rain might rain in the days of their prophesying [this likewise hath respect of Elias 1 Kings chapter 17 whereby either the outward plagues of draughts and famines may be understood or also with the holding of the working of Gods spirit for the ingratitude of men as Paul testifieth 2Thessalonians 2.11 that God shall send them a power of error that they should believe a lie because they received not the love of truth they may be saved ] they have power over the waters to turn them into blood [that is hath also respect to the example of Moses and Aaron which punished the Egyptians that oppose them and their expectations with this and other plagues as God also sent with divers mischief for such causes upon the obstinate Christian ] and to smite the earth with all manner of plagues as often as they will.
\p
\v 7 And when they shall have finished their testimony [namely everyone his in his appointed time while the dominion of the antichrist lasted] the beast that cometh up out of the bottomless pit[ that is antichrist with his spiritual dominion who chapter 9.11 is called Abaddon or destroyer of whom a further description will follow in chapter 13] shall make war against them and shall overcome them shall kill them.
\p
\v 8 And their dead bodies shall lie in the streets [or in the wild open place this is also property of this Romish Hierachy or spiritual dominion that such as they account Hereticks they hand them upon gallowses and break them upon wheels ad throughout their whole dominion deny them burial especially in their consecrated places and offer all manner of infamy and reproach unto their names after their decease] of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt where also our Lord were crucified [hereby is meant the city of Rome with her dominion as the angel himself sufficiently declareth below chapter 17 verse9,18 which is spiritually Sodom because of the uncleanness that reigneth there and Egypt by reason of the oppression of Gods people and where also our lord is said to have been spiritually crucified because as Christ himself was crucified by the Roman deputy so is here crucified yet daily in his members of the Roman tyranny.]
\p
\v 9 . And the ma of the people and the kindred and language and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and a half and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be laid in graves.
\p
\v 10 . And they that dwell upon the earth [that is earthly man that apply themselves to earth] they shall rejoice over them and shall make merry and they shall send gifts one to another [namely in token of joy as Ester 9 verse 19.22] because these two prophets had tormented them that dwell upon the earth [that is hath touched and vexed their consciences with their sermons writings and exhortations that they could not go on so quietly in their superstitions and sins of which they seemed to be freed by death .]
\p
\v 11 . And after these three days and a half a spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood upon their feet [that is after a short time that these witnesses were killed by the violence and public judgment of the antichrist and his compliers seemed to have lost their respect amongst men God again raised up other in their stead which were moved by the same spirit as the power o Elias Luke 1 verse17] and great fear fell upon which saw them.
\p
\v 12 . And they heard a great voice from heaven which said unto them come up hither and they ascend up to heaven in the cloud and their enemies beheld them [ some understand this of the salvation of the prophet or witnesses of Christ who as Christ their head ascended into heaven in a cloud & as Lazarus his soul was carried by the angels into Abraham bosom so they likewise from much infamy and affliction by earth and went up to heaven to be there comforted and glorified till at the last day in the view of their prosecutors they shall be taken up both in body and soul in clouds to heaven to meet Christ 1Thesallonians 4.17 others understand it of greater power and glorification of those witnesses by those that succeed in their place as such kind of phrase is taken Isaiah 14 on verse 3,19 and elsewhere also which hath also been done and performed and is still performed by others that followed them and who have likewise been strengthened by the civil powers in Germany, France, England, Scotland, Switzerland, the low countries and the other parts of the low countries and the other parts of the world not with standing all the powers of the antichrist.]
\p
\v 13 . And in that same power was there a great earth quake [that is great troubles and commotion of men in the world as well of antichrist and of opposed the witnesses as of others that received and maintained their testimonies and experience their testified in former ages and yet testifieth in this age] and the tenth part o the city fell [that is a great part of the Romish and the antichristian hierarchy fell off from antichrist] and in the earthquake there slain seven thousand names of men[ some understand this to be meant of men of name and respect such as the king princes and prelates teachers and the like which perish in sundry wars which they waged by the antichrist ] and the residue were aforesaid and gave glory to the God of heaven [ that is great part of the dominion fell off from him were daily more converted to the purity of the gospel by their example till the final ruin of this great city with seven mountains and their false prophets shall follow whereof shall be prophesied in the following chapters.]
\p
\v 14 . The second war is past behold the third war cometh quickly.
\p
\v 15 . And the seventh angel founded [ that which followed upon the trumpet is most fitly understood of setting up o the kingdom of God and his Christ in heaven after the end of the world which doth there and agree with the last word of the 15 verse and with the 18 and 19 verses and with the order that is kept in visions meeteth with the end of the world with the prediction as was also testified before chapter 10.7] and there were great voices in heaven [namely of joy which was among the holy spirit in heaven as followeth] saying the kingdom of the world are become our Lords and his Christ ] that is are now under his governments after that they were all subdued and brought under foot that opposed them see 1Corinthians 15.24] and be shall reign as king of evermore.
\p
\v 16 . And the four and twenty elders which sit before God in their throne fell down on their faces and worshipped God.
\p
\v 17 . Saying we thank thee Lord almighty which is and which was and which shall come for that thou hast received thy great power and hast reigned as king.
\p
\v 18 . And the nations wee angry and the wrath were come [ the nations wee angry namely hereto fore against Christ and his kingdom but now the time has come and thou shalt execute thy punishment in thy just wrath such ] and the time of the dead to be judged and to give reward unto their servants the prophets [ among whom also the apostle and the evangelists of the new testament are also comprehended ] and to the saints [among whom also true teachers and martyrs are comprehended ] and them that fear thy name [herby are all believers ] to the small and to the great and to destroy them which destroyed the earth [namely by the force of persecution by false doctrines and evil examples see chapter 19.2]
\p
\v 19 . And the temple of God was open in heaven and the ark of the covenant was seen in his temple and they were lightning and voices and thunderclaps and earth-quakes and great hail [by the opening of the temple in heaven is most conveniently understood the glorification of the church itself in heaven and by the ark of his covenant and the glorious beholding of Christ our mediator in it whereof the ark was a type and by the thunder and lightning c the tokens of his wrath against unbelievers.]
\c 12
\s Unto the apostle is shewed the vision of a woman that is in travel 3 And of a red dragon tat stood before her to devour her child 5 but the child is taken up before throne of God and the woman fleeth into the wilderness where a place is prepared for her 1260 days 7 war ariseth in heaven between Michael and the dragon 9 but the dragon is overcome an cat upon the earth 10 whereupon there followeth a song of praise in heaven 13 the dragon persecuteth the woman who receiveth eagles wings to fly into the wilderness 15 after whom the dragon casteth forth the floods of waters which the earth drinketh in 17 And the dragon maketh war against the remnant of her seed. 18 And John standeth on the sea shore.
\p
\v 1 And there was seen a great token in heaven [ that is a vision which signified great things which is therefore said to have been seen in heaven because it was shewen in heaven that was opened though the things themselves where for the most part done upon the earth] namely a woman clothed with the sun and the moon was under her feet [here beginneth the forth vision and many are of opinions that were likewise beginneth the second part of this revelations wherein the estate of Christ church from the apostle time unto the end of the world and rising and reign of the antichrist with the final ruin is somewhat more fully or more largely described because it was briefly done in the former vision by this woman some understand the virgin Mary that bare Christ and fled with Christ into Egypt which Christ Satan persecuted unto death as seemeth to be implied in the words following who was afterwards taken up into heaven and seeteth there at the right hand of God and his father and ruleth the nations with an iron rod but for as much as this was already come before this revelation was come before this revelation was made into John and here properly is prophesied of things that were yet to come s is testified chapter1.1 and 4.1 and is related hereafter chapter 22.6 and many things here cannot well be applied to the virgin Mary therefore the greater part of the interpreters understand by this woman the church of Christ to whom according to the example Christ her head and the bridegroom these things wee befallen that are here understood as the similitude as will appear in the sequel by the sun here is signified the faith in Christ the sun of righteousness wherewith the child of Christ is clothed adorned and enlightened see Galatians 3.27 Ephesians 3.17 and 5.14 by the moon some understand the ceremonies of the old testament which wee very often ordered and framed according to the changes of the moon and which the coming of Christ were grown weak and were abolished Colossians 2 verse 14 but hereby are fitly understood all mutable and worldly things which often change like the moon and which the true church of Christ hath under her feet and counteth them vile and base in respect of the eternal immutable and heavenly things 1Corinthians 7 verse 30,31 and 2 Corinthians 4.18] and upon her head was a crown of twelve stars [that is the doctrine of the twelve apostles and whereof she alone glorieth and which she holdeth to her crown and ornament to hereafter chapter 21 the foundation of the heavenly Jerusalem are compared to twelve precious stones upon which were graven the names of the twelve apostles.]
\p
\v 2 . And she was with child and cried travelling in birth [namely to bear Christ y the gospel and to give him a form of heart a Gods elect throughout the whole world as the apostle speaketh Galatians 4.19which though it be always true of the universal church yet it was effectually fulfilled in the times of the old and for some hundred year after the time of the apostles wherein the apostolically primitive church not withstanding the opposition of Satan and his instrument hath propagated the doctrine of Christ throughout the world and hath brought many particular churches as her own children as the apostle speaketh thereof Galatians 4 on verse 26,27 out of Isaiah 54.1 ] and the being in vain to be delivered [that is here added because of great care sorrows and anguish which the church of Christ the faithful ministries oftentimes have to beger children unto God and to gather them out of the world whereof see an example in Paul 1Corinthians 4.11&c.]
\p
\v 3 . And was seen another token in heaven and behold there was a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven royal hats [Gr diadomata of which see chapter 13.1] upon his heads [that is the dragon is the devil and the Satan is shewed hereafter verse 9 and he is said to be great and red by reason of his blood thirstiness and cruelty of whom here seven heads are ascribed by reason of his great subtilty and ten horns and ten crowns by reason of his great power and dominion in the world as the scripture speaketh of him Job 8.44 2 Corinthians 11 verse 13 ,14 Ephesians 6.12 though some also understand by the seven heads seven mountains and seven kings of the great city where Satan had then chiefly his dominion and by ten horns and ten crowns and ten chiefest kingdom that were under their dominion whereof shall be spoken hereafter chapter 17.9,10.]
\p
\v 4 . And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth [as it was chapter 20 the seven stars are seven angels of the churches so may may be so fitly understood the third part of the teachers or leaders of the church which by the church which by the tail that is by the power and poisonous dragon in the times of persecution of heresies whereof was prophesied before chapter6.3 should fall away from the true doctrine of the spiritual care of the church of the worldly care as was shewed before chapter 9.1 and as Ecclesiastical histories testify that in such time this hath come to pass ] and the dragon stood before the woman which should bear that he might devour her child hen she should have brought it forth.
\p
\v 5 . And she brought forth a man child [Gr she brought forth a son or a man child [ Gr she brought forth a son a man or male ]which should preserve [Greek seed] all the heathens [or nations ] with an iron rod and the child was taken up unto God and his throne [some understand by this male as also by he following battle of Michael against the dragon Constantine the first Christian emperor which appeared in the Christian church after the persecution or after many wars or victories of the worshippers of idols and the dragon did at last subdue the roman empire and brought it under the power and dominion of the Christian and advanced the Christians church above all others and lifted it up unto the heaven which exposition is very ancient the sith Constantine himself did therefore hear this vision in his arms after that he had conquered Maxinus and Maxentius Licinius and other enemies and persecutors with the Christians and the armies and had removed idolatry out of the Roman empire but since many things are here said of this male child and hereafter of Michael and the dragon which can very hardly be applied unto Constantine and his adherents therefore it very meet that this likewise should be taken of Christ himself and of his spiritual nativity through the whole world in the hearts and in the possession of believers by the ministry of the church as was before verse2 against which Christ and his spiritual nativity Satan hath set himself with all his might and subtitle as well by the persecution of the Gentiles and Jews as by divers blasphemous heresies heresies which he hath raised against the person and satisfaction of Christ though Christ now sitting at the right hand of God as the head of the elect hath always prevailed and hath always continue.]
\p
\v 6 . And the woman fled into the wilderness [some understand this flight of Christ church of the duty of all believers when they have already received in their hearts and do sit with him in heaven as Paul speaketh of them Ephesians 2.6 Namely that must they must flee from the world and seek the things that are above and not the things that are beneath Colossians 3.1,2 but forasmuch as this duty of Christ church continueth always and here mention is made of a certain time therefore its fitly taken by others for a preparation both Constantine time by the Arrian and other heresies and the pride and by the pride and ambition of many bishop and other worldly wise men from the time they begun among them in the church which by little and little bred antichrist till at last about the year six hundred and six it was brought to light and was as is else where hinted and they conceive that this only hinted here to relate in the interim the occasion of the flight and to speak further o the hereafter which is also proved by the agreement of the time in this verse with the next to wit the verse14] where she had a place prepared of her by God [namely of God by the measuring of the temple and excluding of courts whereof she was spoken of before chapter 11.1 as the agreement of the 1260days here and for the 42 months there verse3 likewise imported ] that they should feed her there a thousand and two hundred and three score days [others that she should be fed there c namely by the two witnesses which were sent by God out by God for that very purposes to maintain the church of God all this while in the wilderness which hath also relation to that which was prophesied in the former chapter for that some would have this to be meant of flight of Christians out of Jerusalem and out of the land of Judah to Pella beyond the Jordan at the time of the siege of Jerusalem and the destruction of the holy land which lasted about three years and a half suteth not with this revelation because that desolation hath already come to pass in the time of revelation and that here is spoken of a longer time as was shewed before and shall be shewed hereafter .]
\p
\v 7 . And there was war in heaven [that here as some are of opinion is not spoken of the first fall of Satan and of his rebellion against the son of God whereof Christ speaketh 1 John 8.44 and Jude verse 6 appeareth by the saying often related that here things to come are treated of as neither of the conflict which Christ the true Michael that is being equal unto God Philippians 2.6 had against Satan when he took upon him the form of a servant and entered into the strong mans house to bind him and to spoil him of the vessels Matthew 12.29 and when he destroyed him by his death and triumphed upon him over the cross Colossians 2.15 Hebrews 2.14 for though this be an everlasting foundation of all victory over Satan and his instruments as the inhabitants of heaven sing hereafter verse 10 and 11 yet this foundation was strongly laid already before the revelation came to John therefore this war and victory here must be understood of a particular application of this victory of Christ which yet should follow over Satan in the members of Christ whereof Christ speaketh Matthew 16.18 and Paul Romans 16.20 namely in the times of persecution and seductions under heathen and Arrian empires and other heretical kings when Christ was exceedingly opposed in his members and also especially when the antichrist prevailed in the west and the Mehumetans in the east and the church of Christ was afflicted and persecuted throughout the whole world which is clearly proved by the time of a thousand two hundred and three score days which after this battle is ascribed to women flight in the wilderness and by the triumphant song of the inhabitants of heaven verse 10 and 11 which here apparently speaketh of such victory and consequently also of such a combat ] Michael and his angels warred against the dragon and the dragon also fought and his angels [as by this Michael that is who is like unto God Christ himself by most and the interpreters is understood so some understand by his angels the faithful which by Christ and with Christ have overcome the dragon and the angels as is testified hereafter verse 11 yet notwithstanding this name angel may be also understood by the properly so called because they are also often sent by Christ for the comfort and help of the believers in this warfare as apperaeth Hebrews 1.14 and the example of Elius and Elisus of Daniel and his companions of Peter and Paul in their imprisonment prove in the scripture as the Ecclesiastical scripture testify that the holy martyrs under the heathen empires and under antichrist were either by angels delivered out of the hands or eased by the angels or comforteth and strengthened in their torments their persecutors were often by them punished and taken off by divers plagues as Herod was smitten by the angel of the Lord or the ease and comfort of the church Acts 12.23.]
\p
\v 8 . And they prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven [the like phrase Christ used it in his victory over Satan Luke 10.18 and here plainly respect is had to some visions of the old testament where it is seen the like conflict and accusation of Satan before the throne of God against the faithful with a final victory over Satan Job 1.11 and 2.5 and especially Zach. 3.1 which hath many things common with this vision both in respect of the persons and in respect of the issue of event now whether this was actually and really done figuratively spoken in matters not much this is sufficient and certain that after Christ had finished the propitiation of our sin and now sitteth at the right hand of his father and there appeareth as our advocate all manner of accusations against believers before the throne of God is quiet taken away from Satan and his angels as Paul truly glorieth Romans 8.33 c and the heavenly hosts hereafter sing viz verse 10 and 11 and he will from thence subdue from Satan with all our and his enemies under his feet Paul testifieth 1Corinthians 15.25.]
\p
\v 9 . And the great dragon was cast out namely the old serpent [Satan is so called because he by the serpent seduced our first parents in paradise see 2 Corinthians 11.3] which is called the devil and Satan who seduceth the whole world [that is the children ‘s disobedience in the whole world Ephesians 2.2 ] I say was cast upon the earth and his angels wee cat with him.
\p
\v 10 . And I heard a great voice saying in heaven now is the salvation and the power the kingdom become our Gods and the power his Christ for the accuse of our brethren which accused them before our God day and night is cast down [see before the annotations on verse 8.]
\p
\v 11 . And they overcame him by the blood of the lamb [so hereof the annotate on verse 7] and by the word of their testimony [that is the gospel received from them by faith and steadfastly possessed for this is the spiritual sword and instrument whereby Satan is also overcome see Ephesians 6.17 ] and they loved not their lives unto death [that is did here set little by their lives in respect of Christ and hi truth see Luke 14.26 Acts 20.24.]
\p
\v 12 . Therefore rejoice ye heaven and ye that dwell in them wo unto them that inhabit the earth and the sea [that is wo unto earthly and worldly men whether they those that inhabit the continent or such that inhabit the isles in the sea above chapter 3.10 and elsewhere besides] for the devil hath come down unto ye and hath great wrath [that is he is very wroth because he can not prevail against the children of God before the throne of God as is said verse 8 ] knowing that he hath a little time [namely as he time between Christ first and last coming is called the last hour 1John 2.18 so is also of the residues of Satan dominion called a little time because in the end world he shall be cast into the lake with fire and he seeth now daily by the tokens which Christ and the apostle have foretold that the same time draweth still nearer and nearer see hereafter chapter 20.10 and Matthew 25.41.]
\p
\v 13 . And when the dragon saw that he was cast upon the earth he then persecuted the woman which had brought forth the man child [that when Satan saw that he could no more hurt Christ in his members nor he salvation of his members by the accusation in heaven ten he set himself again against the same church of Christ to hurt them at least in this world by spoiling them of their goods by the imprisonment by reproaching their persons by banishment persecutions and such like troubles.]
\p
\v 14 . And the woman were given two wings of a great eagle [namely of God which two eagle wings some conceive to be faith whereby she in all these continueth firmly grounded upon Christ her head 1John 5.4 and hope of salvation whereby she ovecometh all afflictions and persecutions knowing that the suffering of his present time are not to be compared with the glory revealed unto us though also all manner of effectual preservation is understood b eagles wings as appeareth by Deuteronomy 32. 11] that she might flee into wilderness into her place [namely was treated verse 6] where she is nourished [oth. That she might be nourished there namely as well by God alone and his spirit and word as is said of the seven thousand whom God in Elias his time has reserved to himself 1 Kings 19.18 Romans 11.4 and afterwards also the two witnesses whom God a long while raised up unto her in the wilderness of hers as was noted on c 11.3 ] for a time and half a time two yea and half time half year as this phrase seemeth to be taken of Daniel c 7.25 and 12.7 and are of opinion that the time of the antichrist reign shall not last longer then three years and a half before the end of the world as the tyranny of the Antiochus who was a type of antichrist among the Jews in the time of the Machabees lasted no longer but this opinion is repugnant to Daniel 11.3 and is besides effectually confuted because if that were true the day of judgment in antichrist time would be already known contrary to the testimony of Christ Matthew 13.32as it is also impossible that antichrist info short a time should arise out of time of Daniel as they pretend which hath no power or command in the world and should make all the Jews throughout the whole world to adhere unto him take the city of Jerusalem with all the land of Judah built up the temple and after that should cause himself to be worshipped throughout the whole world subdue Christian dome under the dominion destroy the city of Rome and the like whereas the scripture testifieth that his mystery of iniquity began to work even in Paul’s time 2Thesalonians 2.7and the Jews themselves shall be converted before the end of the world and be gathered to the true church of Christ Romans 11.25 2 Corinthians 3.14 c therefore this time, time and a half a time must be meant of a time that is well known unto God and shall not be known unto us before the event or for three years and a half which make together two and forty weeks or a four thousand two hundred and three scores days everyday taken for a year whereof before chapter 11.3 and verse 6 of this chapter and of which more shall also be spoken hereafter chapter 13.5 for even that very time church shall come nourished in the wilderness wherein the court of the temple shall be left unmeasured and the holy city shall trodden down by the Gentiles and the two witnesses shall prophesy and the beasts shall make war with the saints whereof will be prophesied in the sequel ] without the face [Gr from the face ]of the serpent .
\p
\v 15 . And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a river after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away by the river.
\p
\v 16 . And the earth helped the woman and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed p the river which the dragon had cast out of the mouth [though some do also understand by these waters false doctrines yet its well known that in the word of God by waters or rivers are meant persecutions or afflictions as appeareth Psalms 42.8 and 124.5 Matthew 7.25 that here also is spoken of new persecution and troubles which Satan should cause and procure unto the church after she was fled into the wilderness appeareth here from the text but to what persecution respects is had here thereof are sundry opinion some conceive that they are the persecutions which the antichrist raised against the Greek church because they would not embrace the worshipping of the images nor the invocation of the saints nor the honoring of their reliqeus nor his dominion which things were a long time opposed by some of the Greek empires others of opinion are hereby is meant the persecution that were raised against the Huffites in Bohemia and places which the Lord for a long time stopped by one Ziska in the wonderful deliverance as if they were risen out of the earth as also the combinations of the empires and kings with antichrist at such time when the church after Luthers time began to lift up the head whereof some do yet still continue lastly others understand this of the last violence which the antichrist with all his adherents yet should perform before his fall but followed thereupon for the comfort of the church that God will yet at length wonderfully deliver his church as Moses and Aaron were delivered from violence and conspiracy of the core ,Dathan and Abiram when the earth opened her mouth and devoured their enemies Numbers 16 verse 31,32 the like wonderful and unexpected deliverance we also in our time in all parts of Christendom have frequently seen.]
\p
\v 17 . And the dragon was wroth with the woman [namely because she had now hid her self from his sight in some places and times as is said verse 14 and because she had also afterwards gotten help of king and princes which protected her against violence and assaults of antichrist and his adherents] and went his way to wage war against the remnants of his seed which keep the commandment of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ [namely which were yet scattered and hid in such places where no public were and where antichrist and the king which lent their power him yet had their dominion of which scattered Christians here two marks or tokens are set down namely that they served God according to his commandments and not according to the humane tradition and that they kept testimony of Jesus that is sought their salvation only in the merits of the only and perfect savior Jesus and not in their own merits of any creatures according to the doctrine and testimony of the holy gospel wherein consisteth the true difference between the worshipper of the antichrist and the evangelical or reformed Christian.]
\p
\v 18 . And I stood upon the sand of the sea [namely in a vision and also indeed a truth in the isle of the Patmos as the like of Daniel chapter 10.4 namely to see what should further come to pass or what vision should be shewed unto me out of the sea as the next chapter sheweth whereunto this verse seemeth to be appertain which is therefore also joined by some unto the next chapter.]
\c 13
\s Unto the apostle is shewed in vision a beast with seven heads and ten horns 3 whereof one head being wounded to death is healed 4 all earth worshipped the beast and the dragon for the space of two and forty months 6 the beast blasphemeth God and his saints and maketh war against them 8 and over cometh all them whose names are not written in the book of the lamb 10 the reward of like punishment is threatened to the prosecutors 11 after that another beast cometh up out of the earth having two horns like the lamb but doing the works of the first beasts 13 this doth great wonders and seduceth the inhabitants of the earth so that they maketh an image which all are made to worship 16 and it causeth everyone to bear a mark either the name of the beast or his number which is six hundred threescore and six.
\p
\v 1 And I saw a beast rise up out of the sea [this vision represented in this and some following verses doth in many things agree with the vision which Daniel saw chapter 7 verse2 c where four monarchs or sovereignties in the world under the like form are shewed unto the prophet the reason why are compared unto beasts and that rising up out if the sea is because they are set up with the sea is because they are set up with a great noise by the confluence of many nations resembled unto waters Revelations 17.15 and are often wont to be joined and accompanied with much cruelty and violence] having seven heads [these seven heads are chapter 17 verse 9 expounded by the angel himself to be the seven mountains of which the great city whereon the woman sitteth that have dominion over the king of the earth or forms of government which she was subject unto whereof a further exposition will follow in the same chapter] and ten horns [these are hereafter chapter 17.12 expounded to be the kings which hath not yet received the kingdom but should in no one hour receive the kingdom but should be in one receive their power with the beast to whom they should for a time deliver up their power till they should take it again to themselves whereof see also there a further exposition ] and upon his horns were ten royal hats [Gr Diademata where were sort of crowned hats belonging also unto king which hath cloud conveniently take off from their heads for to put them off before the throne of the dragon and of the beast do cast down their crown before the throne of God and the lamb chapter 4 verse 10] and upon his head was a name [oth. Names] of blasphemy [namely such as God on earth Christ vice-gerents the head and bridegroom of the church and the like more besides the idolatry which is also understood under the name of blasphemy as appeareth Isaiah 65.7 Ezekiel 20.27 see hereof also 2Thesalonians 2.4 what dominion is to be understood by this beast that the seven heads and the ten horns c about it are sundry opinion some expositors understand thereby the Romany Monarchy under the heathen empire when John received this revelation and shortly after time under Trajan the empire in its great vigor and splendor and as they worship idols and consequently also the dragon so were they also stirred up by him to oppose the Christian religion to the utmost and though after the time of about two hundred and twenty years Constantine the two Theodosius’s Gratian and some few good and great empires did for a while protect the church yet in the interim there have been some heathen and heretical kings that lent their power unto the dragon and have persecuted the churches of Christ and the orthodox teachers till at last under the empire in the west about the year four hundred and five after the nativity of Christ this beast receive a deadly wound when because the northern nations the Longobards Goths Hunnes and Vandals the city of Rome was five times taken at the last destroyed out of whose ruin at last destroyed out of whose ruin antichrist at last brought forth his kingdom when the empire Justinian about the year five hundred and fifty expelled and subdued these Barbarous nations and exalted the bishop of Rome a new and the civil empire Phorus about the year six hundred and six proclaimed him universal bishop whereby the wound of hi head of the beasts was healed again and worshipped amongst all nations and tongues whereof in the sequel of the chapter by the coming up of the second beast more shall be spoken this opinion is the opinion of many eminent teachers and suteth very well with almost all the parts off the description of the properties of the first beast but these difficulties do here occur first that this Roman empire hath been long before in its vigor and strength whereas this beast in vision is shewed as it were yet coming up secondly that its difficult thing that should be also comprehended under this the time after Constantine coming up to the empire and the godly empires or that the ascension of the second beast that is of the antichrist must be placed among these godly empires and most of all that the two and forty months or one thousand two hundred and sixty days whereof is spoken chapter 11.2,3 and with one thousand two hundred and sixty days whereof mention is made chapter 12.6 which is the time when the holy city was trodden down by the gentile and wherein the two witnesses that fed the church in the wilderness were raised and against whom the beast made war as it shewed there therefore this is mostly applied to the new Roman dominion which was set up in the same city about the time of the treading down of the holy city and of the flight of the church of Christ into the wilderness and did extended itself overall Christendom especially in the west which dominion since it is twofold namely a secular dominion which antichrist exerciseth either directly or indirectly above all kings princes and common wealth’s and a spiritual dominion which assumeth over all bishops Abbots, Prelates and priest in the church both these usurped powers are most plainly set forth in the vision under the appearance of these two beasts as hereafter by the royally adorned whore which sitteth upon the beast and by the false prophets that accompanieth her for this is a usual thing with the apostle in this scripture to represent divers properties and the operations of one person or succession of the person by the divers or sundry vision as before chapter 11 the church of Christ is set forth by the temple and the courts thereof and chapter 12 by a woman clothed with the sun yea as Christ himself in this revelation is brought in sometimes like an angel and the priest of heaven sometimes like a conqueror sitting upon a white horse now that the exposition of all these properties which follow here in this chapter do suit well with both dominion will appear in the sequel .]
\p
\v 2 . And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were like the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion [the three first Monarchies Daniel 7.4 &c are compared of these three wild devouring beasts which three together are here attributed unto this beast alone because out of these three together do suit with the beast of which properties see also the exposition Daniel 7] and the dragon gave him his power and great might [which power and throne of authority of the dragon is to be the prince of the world Job 12.31 the God of this world 2 Corinthians 4.4 and the supreme power which worketh effectually in the children of disobedience Ephesians 2 verse 2 who himself also boasteth that he can give these kingdom to whom he will Luke 4.6 and Paul testifieth the coming of the antichrist shall be after the working of Satan with all power 2Thessalonians 2..]
\p
\v 3 . And I saw one of his head as it were wounded [Gr killed ] to death and his deadly wound [Gr blow or wound of his death ] was healed [see of this wound and this annotate on verse 1for it appeareth of the text & by the phrase which John useth that this beast received this wound in his first ascension which in manner was held by Justinian the Empire and some following empire but was fully and perfectly healed by Pipine and Charles the great who about the years seven and eight hundred placed the bishop of Rome in his full possession when the ten kings that came up with him joined their power with him whereunto followed the admiration and subjection of all nations in Christendom as text in words followeth sheweth ] and all the earth wondered after the beast [that is followed after the beast with admiration .]
\p
\v 4 . And they worshipped the dragon [namely not in his form as the heathen Rominish Empire in her idols had done but the new image worship and other idolatrous practice whereunto they fell in this empire as was said before chapter 9 verse 20 and experience super abundantly shews but too plainly ] which had given power into the beasts and they worshipped the beast saying who is like unto the beasts ? who is able to wage war against it?
\p
\v 5 . And unto him a mouth to speak great things and blasphemies [see the like Daniel 7.8 which is said of a little horn which grew up between the other horns which according to the letter is understood of king Antiochus of whose tyranny and idolatry among the Jews much may be read 1 Mich. 1 and 2 chapter and whom many expositors among Christian hold to have been a type of antichrist who should exercise and use such tyranny and idolatry among the Christian see the exposition of these great things before in the last annotate on the first verse of this chapter & on chapter 12 on verse 6 ]and power was given unto him to do it two and forty months [others to make war two and forty months that is a thousand an d two hundred three score days whereof see the exposition on the first verse of the chapter and on chapter 12verse 6.]
\p
\v 6 . And it opened its mouth unto blasphemy against God[ namely forasmuch as he ascribed unto him self the power and the names of God for he sitteth unto the temple of God and exalteth himself above all that is called God 2Thessalonians 2.4] to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle [some understand hereby the true church of God whom he declareth before all the world to be heretical and accursed others understand hereby the body of Christ which is called the tabernacle of his God head Job 1.14 Hebrews 9.11 ,12 of which the blasphemously abused by the mass both opinion are true ] and them that dwell in heaven [that is the angels and blessed souls whom he as much as him lieth changeth into idols and to whom he hath commiteth spiritual fornication wherewith he maketh the kings and the nations drunk as shall be shewed therewith after chapter 17 which is greatest contempt and blasphemy that he is able to offer unto them as Paul and Barnabas when men would have given him divine honor they rent their clothes Acts 14.14 which was wont to be done at the hearing of the blasphemy as appeareth 2kings 18.37 and Matthew 26.65.]
\p
\v 7 . and power was given unto it to make war with the saints [that is the true believrs and professor of the name of Christ as was also said before of those two witnesses chapter 11.7 ] and to overcome them [namely by corporal victories as well as particular believers by slaying them as against their congregation by troubling and wasting them whereof the books of the martyrs are full of examples how be it believers have always overcome the dragon and the beast according to the spirit as faithful songs glory and sing praises here at chapter 12.11 as is testifieth of them in the same chapter verse 8] and some was given to it over every kindred and language and nation [namely by the just judgment of God who sent a power of errors among those nations that should believe lies and should all be condemned that believe not the truth 2Thessalonians 2 verse 10,11.]
\p
\v 8 . And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship it whose name are not written in the book of life [that is which are not chosen of God in Christ as Paul speaketh Ephesians 1 verse 4 see the like phrase Luke chapter 10 on verse 20 and hereafter chapter 20.12] of the lamb which was slain from the foundation of the world [some join these last words from the foundation of the world to former words which is whose names are not written in the book of life as Paul speaketh of our election in Christ Ephesians 1.4 others join them to the last words which is slain for though Christ was not actually slain but when he suffered for us upon the cross yet his death and sacrifice was effectual from the beginning of the world for the redemption of believers and he was slain from the beginning in Gods decree in Gods promises and in the faith of the elect as is said of Abraham Job 8 on verse 56 and Moses Hebrew 11.26.]
\p
\v 9 . If any man have ears let him hear.
\p
\v 10 . If any man lead into captivity [Gr if any man lead captivity together that is a multitude of captives ] he himself goeth into captivity if any man shall kill with the sword he himself must he killed with the sword[ this is added here for a conclusion or for a comfort of believers namely that the unrighteous man shall receive like recompense either in this world as oftentimes happeneth or at least in the world to come when they with the beasts and the false prophets shall be cast into the lake of fire and by the spirit of sword of Christ which proceeded out of the mouth and killed with eternal as is said hereafter chapter 19,20.] here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
\p
\v 11 . And I saw another beast coming out of the earth [ that is the ascending of this other beasts out of the earth signifieth antichrist is without controversy among all interpreters who in the shape of the first beast setteth himself as a prince of the world and as god upon earth as was shewed hitherto but no cometh forth as a false prophet which seduceth the whole world as the idolatry and false doctrine as shall appear by the sequel ] and it had two horns like the horns of the lamb [that is he carrieth himself outwards shew and possession as if he were the vicar of Christ the lamb of God and a servant of all the servants of Christ ]and it spake like the dragon that is bringeth in the doctrines which the scripture calleth doctrines devils 2Timothy 4.1 se also Matthew 7.15 2 Corinthians 11.14but some understand hereby the power which he taketh up on himself of shutting and opening heaven.]
\p
\v 12 . And it came to it exerciseth all the power of the first beast in his presence [that is he persecuteth and afflicteth the church of Christ by the power of the clergy by the instruments of the spiritual hierarchy by his inquisitions decree excommunications from the society of his church and the like as he also doth by the secular instruments by bloody decrees and punishments with halter sword and fire] and it casueth the earth [that is worldly and earthly men whereunto are before in this chapter opposed those that are written in heaven and in book of the lamb ] and then that dwell therein to worship the first beasts whose deadly wounds were healed.
\p
\v 13 . And it doth great token [namely which the apostle calleth the token of lies 2Thessalonians 2.9 because they are partly feigned and are partly done by Satan for the confirmation of lies ] so that it maketh fire to come down from heaven on earth before men [hereby is fitly understood the lightning of the excommunication and bannings whereby he affrighted not only the common people but also the kings and princes and the whole kingdom and the common wealth as is known by the histories though some such kinds of miracles have been highly boasted by some of Roman bishops.]
\p
\v 14 . And seduceth them that dwell upon the earth by the tokens which wee given unto it to do the presence of the beasts saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast that had the wound of the sword and lived again [ this is understood by some of the worship of images in general which all those that are under antichrist must receive as the as the subject of the king of Babel Daniel 3. Were constrained to worship the king of Babel image upon pain of being burnt by fire but its not unfitly understood by others of spiritual dominion which he by his clergy hath in all spiritual courts as they call them and which all nations every where were constrained to worship as the image of their sovereign and submit themselves thereunto wherewith the ensuing properties of the beast do best suit.]
\p
\v 15 . And power was given unto it to give a spirit unto the image of the beast that the image of the beasts should also speak and cause that the image of the beast should also speak and cause that all that could not worship the beast should be killed [they that understand this of the worship of images apply to the images which Satan as he did unto Eve by the serpent sometimes spake by which their clergy feigned that the saints that are represented by them are spoken as in their legend sundry examples thereof are to be found to bring thereby more credit and life to the idolatrous worship others apply to the priviledges of the foremaned spiritual courts and their inquisitions where by they are dreadful and small unto small and great and whereby they persecuted very many to death that will not acknowledge their power and follow their idolatry and cause them to die by hands of the magistrate.]
\p
\v 16 . And it causeth that unto all great and small both rich and poor and free and bend and mark given unto them in their right hands or in their foreheads [ this is fitly understood of their charisma or unction wherein everyone in their sacrament of confirmation which they prefer above the baptism of Christ must be marked in the forehead as also their clergy in taking orders are anointed and marked in their head and hands and fingers in the llike manner which make them call the indelible characters and without which they may distribute their spiritual merchandise neither tread and converse among other men in peace as followeth.]
\p
\v 17 . And that no man must buy or sell save he that had that mark or the name of the beast [that is the profession that they are Roman Catholics or good Popelings well affected to the pope holding him to be the head of the church and infallible in his doctrines and traditions ] or the number of his name [that is addicted to the Roman church which perfometh her chiefest worship in Latin and forceth also upon her followers to make their prayers in Latin although they understand not that they say which name Roman or Latin iporteth this number of his name as followeth.]
\p
\v 18 . Here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is a number of a man and his number is six hundred and threescore and six [that is a number which is counted of a letter named of a man or an order of a man after the Hebrew or Greek manner which use the letter of their alphabet to express a number and though many expositions of Irenaus who lived a little after the time of the apostle about two hundred years who applieth this to the word of Lateinos wherein number 666 is found which agreeth very well with the thing since the pope pretended to be the head of the Latin church will have the service of God to be performed in the Latin tongue and will have the old Latin translation in the bible to be held authentic.]
\c 14
\s The apostle seeth a vision the man standing on the mount Zion with his 144000marked ones 2 a new song is sung in heaven which none could learn but they these are the virgins and follow the lambs which are whithersoever he goeth 6 whereupon an angel flyeth through the midst of heaven and preacheth the everlasting gospel 8 whom another angel followeth who foretelleth the fall of the great Babylon 9 and a third who threateneth eternal punishment to them that worship the beast or bear his mark 12 the saints are exhorteth unto patience and they that die in the Lord are assured of salvation 14 after that they appeareth one upon a white cloud with a crown upon his head and with a sickle on his hand which is charged to put the sickle into the harvest that is ripe at lasts there cometh an angel out of the temple of heaven with another sickle who is charged to cut of the grapes of the earth 19 which he casteth into the wine press fat of gods wrath which is trodden and floweth even unto the bridles of the horses a thousand six hundred furlongs.
\p
\v 1 And I looked and lo the lamb [why Christ is called the lamb was shewed in chapter 5.6] stood upon mount Zion [Christ is here sought in as it were here standing upon mount Zion whereby the church is represented as Isaiah 2.23 1Peter 2.6 and elsewhere and because in the midst of the antichrist persecutions he hath always a watchful eye over his church and always gathereth and persecuteth the same for which cause he is also said Acts 6.56 to stand at the right hand of God and above chapter 2.1 to walk among the candlestick as being always ready and prepared to assist them and to furnish them with all things necessary ] and with them an hundred and forty four thousand [these are those that there marked of all the tribes of all the Israel of chapter 7.37c during the time of the antichrist reign and of the flight of the woman into the wilderness and which is general apostasy always cleave close unto Christ their head and are here opposed to the great multitude of those that received the mark of the beasts whereof was spoken before and shall be spoken hereafter ] having his fathers name written on their foreheads [of which writing of these name on their foreheads see below on chapter 7 verse 3 and 9.4.]
\p
\v 2 . And I heard a voice from heaven [some understand by this voice the voice of the marked ones themselves which the apostle heard at first afar off and afterwards nigh at hand approaching and coming nearer by degree but sith it is said in the third verse that none was able to learn this song besides these marked ones therefore this is fitly understood of the voice of an innumerable multitude of those that those that stood already before in heaven about the throne of God and praised God day and night spoken of above chapter 7.9 to whom these 144000 also joined themselves after that they in the antichrist wee also brought by Christ their head from the militant church here on earth to the triumphant church in heaven as appeareth hereafter chapter 19.1 &c ] as a voice of many water and a voice of a great thunderclap [not in respect of the terribleness thereof as its sometimes taken but in respect of the greatness thereof and the zeal from whence it arose otherwise it was pleasant to hear as it shewed hereafter chapter 19.6] and I heard a voice of harpers playing of their harps [this comparison is taken from the practice that was used in Solomon’s temple where together with the singing they wee also used by priest and Levites instruments of music see also before chapter 5 verse 8.]
\p
\v 3 . And they sung as it were a new song [which is likewise so called chapter 5.9 and its called new here by reason of new occasion that was given for this song of praise by the redemption of these marked ones and the new preaching of the everlasting gospel see like phrase Psalms 40.4 Isaiah 42.10] before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders and the man could learn that song but the hundred forty four thousand [namely with an upright mind and full of assurance that they had part in it for though hypocrites do sometimes also phrase God for the redemption of wrought by God yet none can do it cordially but such as by true faith and the assurance of the holy ghost have learnt it see Romans 8.15,16 1Corinthians 12.3] which were brought from the earth [namely by the blood of the lamb as is expressed chapter 5.9 see also 1Peter 1 verse 19.]
\p
\v 4 . These are they which are not defiled with women for they are virgins these are they that follow the lamb wither so ever he goeth [this can not be understood by the state of marriage for some would have it for that is honorable among all and the bed undefiled as Paul testifieth Hebrews 13.4 and Christ is followed wither so ever he goeth not only by the blessed saints that here led a single life and wee never married but also by a married person as patriarchs, apostles , martyrs and innumerable others as the scripture speaketh 2 Corinthians 5.6 c 1 Thessalonians 4.17 c but by these virgins are here namely those that by their faith and true profession steadfastly adhered unto Christ when the whore of Babylon made all the kings and nations of the earth drunk with the cup of her fornication that its with her idolatry whereof further will be spoken in the sequel them and in like manner doth apostle Paul speak of all kind of true believers see 2 Corinthians 11.2.] these are brought from among men to be first fruits unto God and the lamb [ that is that they might be holy and dedicated unto God and to the lamb as the first fruits were to be consecrated and dedicated unto God see Leviticus 23.10 Numbers 15.20c.]
\p
\v 5 . And in their mouth was found no guile [namely in those that bear the mark of the beast which indeed and with their heart they turn away from him to the worship of images and other helpers whom they will honor and worship besides God see the like Zach. 3.13 and Romans 11.25] for they are unblameable before the throne of God [namely because they are by true faith justified before God and serve him sincerely from the heart not to please men but to please God only see the like Luke 1.6 and Ephesians 5.27]
\p
\v 6 . And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven and he had everlasting gospel [namely of obtaining salvation by faith and calling upon the one and only God and the only mediator Christ which gospel is called everlasting because it was ordained from eternity and was promised from the beginning of the world Titus 1.2 how be it how others are also of opinion that is here called everlasting because it could not any more be after that time so suppress but that it will always continue publicly known expressed in the world in or other ] to pray unto them that dwell on the earth and every nations and kindred and language and people [here in this verse beginneth the second part of this chapter see chapter wherein the restoration of the doctrine of the gospel by certain steps or degrees in certain churches is foretold separated from antichristianism come to its height and the truth of the gospel was most observed how be it God hath also at all time gathered out of it those that believe unto him as he had in Achabs time reserved those seven thousand in Israel Romans 11.7 by the angel are meant the faithful witnesses of Christ and teachers of the gospel who when antichristianism was now at the highest began to warn the world publicly against it and to spread the gospel publicly against it abroad throughout Christdom as about the year 1170 there were in France the Waldeneses and the Ablingenses against whom antichrist set himself with great power so that according to the testimony of some historian above ten hundred thousand of them were slain and banished at sundry times in sundry places but he was not able so to root them out but they were yet in great numbers and scattered throughout all Europe and adhered still to their possession.]
\p
\v 7 . Saying with a great voice fear God and give glory to him [that is the first part of the gospel voice whereby the worshippers of the beast are warned and exhorted to honor fear and serve God only in Christ ] for the hour of his judgment is come [that is near as the scripture also speaketh of the last day and this is a strong argument to dissuade men from idolatry as this is used by Paul to those of Anthens Acts 17 verse 29,30,31] and worship them that made the heaven and the earth and the sea and the fountain of the waters [ which wonderful work of God scripture also elsewhere relateth after the same manner Psalms 104.10 and 114.8.]
\p
\v 8 . And there followed another angel [namely with a new zeal and earnestness should set upon the antichrist kingdom and forewarn the world against it after that it had now in a great measure suppressed the progress of the former angels preaching some are of opinion that under this angel arose John Wyclef with his adherents in England and john Hus and Jerome of Prague in Germany and Bohemia who about the year 1380 and 1400by writing and teaching made a great breach upon this new Babylon and though they were at last in great measure suppressed by the council of Constance and by the power of Sigsmund the empire yet many of their disciples and churches always still remained especially in the parts of Bohemia and Moravia Poland Hungaria and elsewhere] saying she is fallen she is fallen Babylon that great city [that is her fall is decreed by God and is already begun in the heart of many and shall from henceforth be more and more advanced till it be at last utterly destroyed shall be further shewed hereafter c. 18 these words are taken out of Isaiah 21.9 and Jeremiah 50.8 where the like threatening is denounced against old Babel of Assyria or Chaldea which had for a long time oppressed the Israelites and which had been a nourisher of all manner of pride and idolatry in the world ] because she hath made of all nations to drink all the wine of the wrath of her fornication [that is her idolatry whereby the wrath of God is provoked against them otherwise it may also be rendered the wine of the poison of her fornication as this Greek word in old Greek translation of the old testament is also taken Deuteronomy is also taken Deuteronomy 32.32 Psalms 58.5 a comparison taken from a dishonest woman which by sweet poison wine poisoned wine is wont to bereave men of their sense and to draw them to her unchaste love which signification agreeth very well with the outward manner of the worship of idolaters .]
\p
\v 9 . And a third angel followed them saying with a great voice if any man worship the beast and his image and receive the mark in his forehead and in his hand.
\p
\v 10 . The same shall also drink of the wrath of God [that is because he had suffered himself to be assured by the cup of idolatry of the whore of Babylon the Lord will cause him to drink of the wine of his wrath and his judgment and a phrase frequently used by the prophets when the heavy judgments of God are threatened against a nation see Psalms 75.9 Jeremiah 25.15] which unmingled is poured into the cup of his wrath [ or intermixed etc. for pure wine poured in or divers sort of wine mingled together do soon procure drunkenness giddiness and other distempers to a man which are here compared to God’s just judgment wherewith he doth not intermingle his mercy ] and shall be tormented with fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the lamb [this third angel comes further and warns yet with greater earnest all those that worship the beast or bear his mark to beware of eternal punishment that is unto them unless they repent under which angel is appointed the time of fuller reformation in Christendom which was begun by Luther Zuingilius and their associates in the year 1517 and hath hither to carried on by many eminent teachers yea even kings princes and common wealth wherein man there wee under antichristianism are yet more plainly instructed and are yet more earnestly warned to beware of the false doctrine and idolatry thereof .]
\p
\v 11 . And the smoke of their torment [that is the smoke of the fire whereby they are tormented Luke 16.24] ascended up forever more they had no rest day nor night which worship the beast and the image and if any man receive the mark of his name.
\p
\v 12 . Here is the patience of the saints here are they that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus [these are two marks of true reformed Christians opposed to the worshippers of his beasts and the image as the same are also set down before chapter 12.11,17 see the exposition there this verse and the next following serve for the comfort of believers who in the time of these reformation should a new persecutors and afflicted by antichrist whereunto us opposed their patience in the expectation of just vengeance of God upon the minister of antichrist and the assurance of salvation prepared from them as also the martyrs which is the primitive persecution under heathen empire died for Christ his sake chapter 6.10 say etc.]
\p
\v 13 . A I heard a voice from heaven which saith unto me write blessed are the dead which die in the Lord [that is for the Lord’s sake as Ephesians 4.1 or in the Lord that is in the faith and in the fear of the Lord as this phrase is also used 1Corinthians 15.18 1Thessalonians 4 verse 6c] from hence forth [some join these words to the former word write and expound them thus write from henceforth so as that here is testifieth by the angel that is the time of the renewing of the preaching of this everlasting gospel shewed by these three angels and the true witness of Christ should not preach nor write as is done in the darkness of the antichristianism in such a manner as that the children of God when they die should have caused to be troubled with the fear of purgatory and of hell torments which they should be fain to suffer after that they are dead unless there be a provision made against it by funeral solemnities masses for the soul indulgences etc. but that they are blessed as soon as they die that they are purged by the blood of Christ alone from their sins others join these words from henceforth to the word blessed and expound it thus that those that die in Christ are blessed from henceforth that is as soon as they die etc. notwithstanding that the antichrist with his adherents condemneth them as Heretics and damned men as Christ also setteth such comfort before his disciples Matthew 5 verse 10,11,12 and the opinion do agree well with the thing itself ] yea saith the spirit that they may rest from their labor and their works follow with them [ or after them that is the gracious reward of their hardship patience etc undergone from Christ sake doth accompany them or doth follow them a comparison taken from them that are come to the end of the race or of the combat then take rest are refreshed and crowned 2 Timothy 4 verse 7,8.]
\p
\v 14 . And I looked and behold a white cloud and the cloud was one sitting like unto the son of man having on his head a golden crown [namely as king of kings and Lord of Lord chapter 19.16] and in his hand a sharp sickle [namely by reason of his power in this judgment whereby he is able to subdue things unto himself Philippians 3.21 most expositors understand this of Christ himself to whom such titles are also elsewhere given as chapter 1.13 and whose coming to judgment is likewise described after this manner chapter 1.7 see also Daniel 7 verse 13 Matthew 26.64 these following visions in this chapter area understood by some of grievous war massacres or blood-shedding which antichrist should raise against the reformed princes and nations in the world and of the taking away of the hundred thousand men which on every side followed thereupon happen yet daily and more grievous are to be expected before great Babel shall utterly fall but the greater part understand it to the last judgment as the similitude and phrase import and as almost all visions in revelations end in the last judgment.]
\p
\v 15 . And another angel came out of the temple [namely of heaven as is exprest as in verse 17 wee the throne of God is as is testified chapter 4.2 from whence this angel as a messenger of the father cometh unto Christ according to the custom used among great kings to declare the things that follow and to shew the fulfilling of the time of the execution of God judgment as we read that this time of humiliation not only the angels but also Elias came unto him from heaven to speak of this decease at Jerusalem Matthew 17.3 Luke 9.30 for as much as he came not to do his own will but the will of the father that sent him John 4.34 and 6.38] crying with a great voice to him that sate on the cloud thrust in thy sickle and reap for the hour is come for thee to reap [that is to take away man from earth forasmuch as the number of the elect was now made up see below chapter 6.11 and 2Peter 3.9] for the harvest of the earth is become ripe [ Gr dry withered.]
\p
\v 16 . And he that sate in the cloud thrust in the earth and the earth was reaped [namely to gathered the good in the barn and to burn the tares with fire as Christ himself speaketh Matthew 13.30 which last clause is further spoken of these verses.]
\p
\v 17 . And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven himself also having a sharp sickle [some understand this also of Christ Jesus whom in divers forms and apparition is brought in as a judge both of good and evil though others understand it of some special created angels who had other angels next to him who should gather the scandals of the wicked ones from the earth to bring them from the presence of God sitting on the judgment seat and to cause them there to receive their sentence and to cast them into hell as Christ accompanied with the power of his angels shall pronounce and execute sentence unto them Matthew 13 verse 41,42 2 Thessalonians 1.7 etc.]
\p
\v 18 . And another angel came out from altar [namely where the souls of the martyrs before chapter 6.9 were seen which cried and longed after vengeance upon enemies of God and after the redemption of Christ church on earth which prayer is here heard when their number and the time there mentioned was fulfilled this angel is a publisher and declarer as the angel declared unto Daniel , Daniel 9 verse 21,23 and the Cornelius Acts 10.4] which had power over the fire [namely where with the wicked shall be tormented off which is spoken before verse 10] and he cried with a great cry to him that had the sharp sickle saying thrust in thy sharp side and cut off the clusters of the vineyard of the earth for her grapes are ripe[that is their sin are come to the highest and God long-suffering towards them is at an end as is said to the Amorites Genesis 15.16 and of those Sodom and Gomorra Genesis 18.20 ,21.]
\p
\v 19 . And the angel thrust in [Gr cast as also verse 16] his sickle on the earth [namely to execute as followeth Gods judgment upon it as under such a similitude the execution of Gods punishment upon the wicked is also understood Joel 3.13and hereafter chapter 19.15 and elsewhere] and cut off the grapes of the vine yard of the earth and cast them into great winepress of the wrath of God [that is into the deep bottomless pit that God will pour out his wrath upon the wicked.]
\p
\v 20 . And the winepress was trodden without the city [namely of Jerusalem see hereafter chapter 22.15] and there came blood out of winepress unto the bridles of the horses [a similitude taken from a great slaughter where the blood followeth very high see the like expression Isaiah 63.3] by the space of a thousand and six leagues a certain number taken from an uncertain that is very great and terrible to behold.]
\c 15
\s Seven angels appear which have the last plagues a glassy sea at which the conquerors of the beasts stand furnished with harp 3 which sing a song of praise therein they praised God and his judgments 5 after that the temple of heaven is opened 6 whence proceed the seven angels in bright raiment 7 who receive from one of the four beasts seven vials full of the wrath of God whereupon the temple is filled with the smoke of the glory of God.
\p
\v 1 And I saw another great and marvelous token [that is which signifieth great and marvelous things] in heaven[ as in the two former chapters was treated at large of the rising seducing and tyranny of the antichrist so now the holy ghost in some following chapters comes and relates from the comfort of believers the plagues and punishment that shall come upon the antichrist and his whole kingdom till he shall be utterly destroyed at last whereof vision contained in this chapter is but a preparation thereunto] namely seven angels having the seven plagues [that is power over the seven last plagues namely which God shall cause to come upon antichrist adherents in this world in this world for after the last judgment shall the wrath of God abide upon them and upon all wicked men forever as we testified before chapter 14.10,11 and is also testified hereafter chapter 19.3 and 20 see also Matthew 25. 46 Job 3.46 whether these angels that are frequently mentioned before the uncertain but this is certain that they were instrument thereby God hath already in part executed and will yet in part execute his judgment upon antichrist kingdom as shall be further declared in the next chapter ] fro in these is finished the wrath of God.
\p
\v 2 . As I saw as it were a glass sea mingled with fire and them that hath the victory of the beasts [that is the true believers which according to their spiritual condition had overcome the beast as according to the body they have been tempted and persecuted and oftentimes killed forasmuch as they always continued in faith ] and of his image [ see hereafter the sequel chapter 13.14 &c ] and of his mark and of the number of his name which stood at the glass sea [that is which had escaped all dangers and were got into a safe harbor as the Israelites being got through the sea to the shore were free from all care and trouble see Exodus 15.1 &c .] having the harps o God [ that is fair and excellent harps as this phrase is much used among the Hebrews see Genesis 23.6 Psalms 36.7 and therefore sit to play and sing upon them to praise of God.]
\p
\v 3 . And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God [that is the song where Moses praised God for the deliverance of his people which is recorded Exodus 15 .1 &c for as much as the history doth wholly look at the deliverance of the children of Israel out of Egypt as also at the punishment of Pharaoh and the Egyptians in the red sea and lastly to the song of praise which Moses with the children of Israel standing on the shore of the red sea sung for their deliverance and for the punishment of the Egyptians his glass sea shall be mingled with fire and must be compared with the red sea where in the Egyptians perish and through which the Israelites were delivered these are then the many nations that are under the superstitious reign of the antichrist as the angel himself sheweth hereafter chapter 17.1,15 which like a sea do continually rage and be drowned in their superstitious and seek the overwhelm some believers therein with themselves which is mingled with fire by reason of their cruelty and blind zeal in persecuting them and is transparent like glass in the eyes of the Lord before whom all their actions are naked and manifest who withstanding bringeth his people through all the tumult and danger over unto the shore or haven of salvation as Moses did the children of Israel under the shadow of the angel of God see also before chapter 4.6 ] and the song of the lamb [that is which is sung by believers to the honor of Jesus Christ the lamb of God and their spiritual redemption purchase by him whereof an example is related before chapter 5,10 and chapter 12 verse 10,11] saying great and wonderful are thy works Lord thou almighty God just and true are thy ways [that is thy counsel and actions thou men be not always able to comprehend it see Romans 1 verse33 ] thou king of saints.
\p
\v 4 . Thou should not fear thee and Lord not glorify thy name? for thou art alone holy for thy nations [that is the elect of all nations see above chapter 5.9,10] shall come and worship before thee for thy judgments are made manifest [namely against antichrist and his adherents of the execution of the judgment shall be further spoken in the two next chapters the words of the hymn of praise are for the most part joined together out of certain places of the old testament as Psalms 25.10 and 86 verse 8,10 Jeremiah chapter 10.7.]
\p
\v 5 . And after this I looked [namely after the song of praise of believers of the judgments of God to come and a further preparation of the execution of God judgment is declared in the following verses] and behold the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven [some are of opinion that the temple is here called because it was made according to the pattern of the tabernacle but here the Greek word naos that is the temple may be fitly more taken for the innermost part of the temple that is for the holy of holies as this is sometimes used Psalms 28.2 which agreeth with the innermost part of heaven where God hath his throne and were the four twenty elders and the four beasts with the holy angels stand round about as was shewed before and especially chapter 4 and this is as it were Gods court in his celestial, church were the judgment of God are pronounced and the angels commanded to execute the same as the sequel importeth ]was opened [namely to publish and execute the judgment or sentence of God against the antichrist or adherents a comparison taken from a royal throne and courts which are opened when sentence is to be given.]
\p
\v 6 . And the seven angel which had the seven plagues [that is the power and the charge of executing the seven plagues as before verse 1] came out of the temple clothed with pure bright linen [namely to signify the purity and justice not only of their persons but also of their Gods judgment whereof their executioners ] and girt about the brest with golden girdles [namely to express their readiness swiftness and activity in executing God judgments according to the custom of the eastern people that are girt about with broad girdles when they undertake or go about some difficult business see Luke 12.35 Ephesians 6.14.]
\p
\v 7 . And one of the four beasts [namely which before in this book stood nearest to the throne of God with for and twenty elders and which represented the whole church of Christ at whose request and at the avenging of whom the judgments mentioned in the sequel are poured out unto the kingdom o the antichrist se before chapter 4.6] gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials [these vials were sort of drinking bowls somewhat deep and contained some ordinarily as much as man was able to drink off at once ] full of the wrath of God[that is of the wine of the wrath of the cup of God whereof see before chapter 14.10] which liveth forever more.
\p
\v 8 . And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from the power [that is proceeding from the throne of God glory who was compassed about by the lightning and thunder voices and burning lamps all token of Gods glory as the same is described chapter 4.5 here the respect is happened to that which happened in the tabernacle Exodus 40.34 which was overshadowed with a cloud of Gods glory at the dedication thereof so that Moses could not enter into it as also happened at the dedication of Solomon’s temple 2Kings 8.10 others conceive that here respect is had to Isaiah 6.4 thereby the judgments of God upon the people signified] and no man was able to enter the temple till the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished [no man was able to enter the temple namely behold or search narrowly into the Judgments of God sith they are unspeakable Romans 22.33 and which can then be only fully understood when they are fulfilled others take it thus that this shutting of the tabernacle by the smoke of God glory after the denunciation of Gods judgment upon antichrist and his worshippers yet signifieth a sequel of Gods judgment upon them namely that they should not be amended by any of these punishments or brought to mediation of what will come after to consider of these judgments as they ought to their own salvation but that they should be therein more and more blinded and hardened and regard it then more sooner and then when it should be too late when the last plagues should be powered upon them and they should be cast into everlasting destruction as Paul hereof yet speaketh 2 Thessalonians 2 verse 11 ,112 see also hereafter chapter 6.9,11.]
\c 16
\s The seven former angels are commanded to pour out their vial s2 whereof the first is poured upon the earth 3 the second in the sea 4 the third in the river for which the justice of God is praised with a praise of song 8 the forth vial is poured out into the sun 10 the fifth upon the throne of the beasts after which notwithstanding the men on earth to repent not 12 the sixth upon the great rivers Euphrates 13 three unclean spirits like frogs come forth and go to the kings of the earth to gather them to the war of the great day 15 and there upon every one is exhorted to watch 17 lastly the seventh vial is pour upon the air and all things have an end ye also even great Babylon 21 after which a grievous hail falleth upon men who blaspheme God for it.
\p
\v 1 And I heard a great voice out of the temple [namely of heaven as was expressed in the former chapter verse 5 and below verse 17 whereby is meant the throne of God in heaven as was shewed there for though the vials were already given to the seven angels in the former chapter yet they proceed not to the execution of the former power before they have received a charge for it as followeth see Psalms 103 verse 20] saying go your ways and pour out the seven vials of wrath of God upon the earth [it appeareth in the sequel that only the first angel poured out his vials upon the earth but for as much as the plagues of the six other vials came also at last upon the man that dwell through at first they were poured out upon the other bodies and the elements they were truly said to be poured out upon the earth and the earthly men to whom God maketh all the elements of their enemies .]
\p
\v 2 . And the first went his way and poured out the vial upon the earth [the kingdom of the antichrist is continually considered in this revelation as a world wherein there is earth sea river air stars &c and that by reason of the condition thereof and the power which antichrist ascribeth to himself to have over heaven earth sea &c the first part then of this antichristian world is the earth whereby here as elsewhere in this book earthly men in general are fitly understood which are addicted to earthly and idolatrous worship and do obstinately maintain them upon whom this first vial according to the opinion of many is said to be poured out when the kingdom of the antichrist began to decay as by the renewing of the preaching of the everlasting gospel in divers places of Europe by Waldus, Wiclef, John Hus and Jerome of Pragus and their fellow and the men of this earthly world and the worshippers of the beasts instead that they should have repented by the judgments of God were given up to a reprobate mind and were incensed and vexed in their mind with hatred and envy as with grievous bile so that they could neither be at rest themselves or would suffer others to take rest till they had again as much as in them lay suppressed and obscured the same gospel. Though some do add thereunto, for a special punishment of these idolatrous persons and persecutors of God’s people about the year 1500,some secret sicknesses and ulcers whereof in the sequel began to reign in the countries that lay nearest in the countries lay nearest unto antichrist which from thence spread also abroad into other parts of Europe especially against those that in their forced single life committed many uncleanness the very naming whereof is to be abhorred with such like diseases God also plagued the Philistines when they detained the ark of the covenant captive among them 1Samuel 5.6 c.] and there was an evil and wicked sore upon the man which had the mark of the beast [all these following plagues do very well agree with the plagues which God by the hand of Moses and Aaron inflicted upon king Pharaoh and his people when he would deliver the Israelite out of Egypt as appeareth by comparing the 7, 8, 9, and 10 chapters of Exodus excepting the plagues contained in the third vial verse 8 which for the most part agreeth with the plague wherewith God punished Achab and his people who also flew the Prophets and persecuted his people in the time of Elias whereof see 1 Kings 17 and 18 now whether these plagues are to be understood according to the letter or to a spiritual sense there are divers opinions corning it. And it is the more obscure because a part of them was not poured out but was to be poured out afterwards as appeareth from thence that these plagues before chapter 15.1 are expressly called the seven last plagues and that is the chapter those that are punished by those plagues that bear the mark of the beast and that the throne of the beast and that great Babylon are at last destroyed by them and which destruction a further relation will follow in the two next chapters which for a great part is yet to be fulfilled the issue then will yet further discover some things hereof in the mean while that which is most probable shall be briefly noted on every vial the first went c that by these angels are meant God instruments whereby antichrist with his whole dominion in divers time and by divers degree was plagued and punished as appeareth sufficienly by the whole scope of this chapter and expressly by the second verse and by the sixth and tenth verse following but whether these were the celestial spirits themselves or others that under their conduct were for that purpose raised up by God in the world will best appear by every exposition of every vial which had the mark of the beast see the exposition hereof and which followeth on chapter 13.14] and which shipped his image .
\p
\v 3 . And the second angel poured out his vial into the sea and it became blood as blood of the dead man and every living soul died in the sea [by this sea are fitly understood those nations and kingdoms which compassed the kings of the antichrist about like a sea as the angel himself declareth hereafter chapter 17.15which here in respect of the worshippers of the beasts is said to have been turned into blood when after Luthers time and whole province kingdoms and nation that lay round about fell off from him so that the fishes or inhabitants of the earthly kingdom could not any longer live quietly in it or perform their superstitions whereby much of their blood was shed and is yet daily shed for a just recompense and revenge of the abundance of the blood which was also shed under the dominion of the worshippers of this image of the beast as the justice of God is excellent for hereafter verse 6 others understand hereby the decrees and statutes of their council and especially of the council of the Trent which lasted for certain years whereunto the spiritual and temporal worshippers of the beast flowed from all parts of Europe which are therefore said to have turned into blood because therein false and idolatrous doctrines was established which necessarily leadeth man to death if they receive it for as much as no idolater can be saved 1 Corinthians chapter 6 verse 10 and they that will be justified by the works of the law are fallen from the grace of Christ Galatians 5.4]
\p
\v 4 . And the third angel poured out his vial into the river into the fountains of the water and the waters became blood [some understand hereby the westing and falsifying of the word of God which in scripture is compared unto clear fountains of waters and rivers so hereby is signified a power of error and spiritual blindness that should be upon them by just spirit of God but sith this began a long while before and here is spoken of the last plagues whereby the kingdom of the antichrist hath been a good while weakened and will fall to ruin the last it is as fitly understood by others in their inquisitions courts societies covenants conventions colleges schools and the like which antichrist has set up all the kingdoms thereby which were also turned into blood when they were abolished and forbidden in these reformed kingdom and countries so that no man was suffered to stay any longer there or to exercise his superstitions there anymore which things as they already come to pass in some places so shall they likewise more and more come to pass hereafter when the kings shall withdraw their power from the beasts as is foretold hereafter chapter 17.16.]
\p
\v 5 . And I heard the angel of the waters [that is which had poured out the vials upon the rivers and fountains of water as before chapter 14 verse 18 here is called the angel of the fire which had received power over the fire to punish wicked men therewith] say thou art righteous Lord which is which was and which shall be [others read and the holy one] because thou hast judged this.
\p
\v 6 . Because they shed the blood of the saints and of the prophets therefore thou hast given them blood to drink [that is thou hast also suffered them to perish in their own blood whence it appeareth that these two vials must be taken for such just recompense and shedding of their blood ] for they are worthy of it.
\p
\v 7 . and I heard another from the alter say yea Lord thou almighty God thy judgments are true and righteous .
\p
\v 8 . And the forth pored out his vial upon the sun and the power was given unto him to search men with fire.
\p
\v 9 . And men were scotched with great heat and blasphemed the name of God which had power over these plagues and they repented not to give him glory [namely in acknowledging his justice and embracing his mercy and grace offered to them by the pouring out of this vial into the sun and the scorching of men thereby some understand very great heats drought and barrenness as also famine and mortalities which are wont to follow thereupon as came to pass among the Jews in Elias his time which yet in a special manner in after time shall be sent upon lands and kingdoms addicted to the beast but in regard such punishment seldom prevail in one land but another participateth thereof likewise and that these plagues are properly threatened to the worshippers of the beast therefore others understand it of the light of the gospel upon which this vial is poured out to give it more virtue for the convincing and inflaming of the heart of man whereby yet more shall be brought to repentance yea even the Jews in great number shall receive Christ Romans 11.25,26 and the other obstinate worshippers of the beasts shall be stirred up to greater despite and blasphemies because they shall see that their kingdom shall be thereby brought to ruin at last for which cause they themselves shall blaspheme the name of God when they shall accuse the scriptures of the darkness imperfection and uncertainty and shall dare to call it a ground and foundation of heresies.]
\p
\v 10 . And the first angel poured out his vial upon the throne of the beast and his kingdom waxed dark[many expositors understand hereby the city of Rome which properly is the throne of the antichrist from whence he beareth the spiritual rule over other countries which throne shall be destroyed by such instruments as God shall raise fro that purpose who shall cause for that antichrist himself with his consistory and adherents whereby his kingdom shall greatly decrease and his splendor be obscured in the world till at last utterly destroyed by the spirit of Christ mouth] and gowned their tongue for pain [namely for spite and vexation that such a thing did befall them whereas they had fancied to themselves a kingdom without end.]
\p
\v 11 . And they blasphemed the God of heaven because their pans and because of their souls and they repented not of their works[ that is superstitions idolatries and blasphemies.]
\p
\v 12 . And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates and the water therefore was dried up that the way of the kings that should come from the rising of the sun might be prepared [by the river Euphrates some understand the river Euphrates properly so called on both sides whereof the Turks and the Persian s such like nations eastwards have their jurisdiction as was noted chapter 9.14 who should yet united themselves together and take possession of the antichrist throne others understand by the river Euphrates by the way similitude all the revenues which antichrist gathereth from whole christiandom whereby his throne is enriched where he descend himself and his throne by the power and against all power whatsoever which being utterly suspended and dried up by the Christians princes as hath already begun they will make him unable to stand it out with princes are here said to come from the rising of the sun because they should be raised for that purpose by Christ who is the day spring from a high and old Babylonian being aforetime defended and enriched by river Euphrates was dried up by Cyrus and opened the way for the invading and taking of the city and destroying the kingdom thereof was foretold Jeremiah 51.31c and fulfilled Daniel 5.30.]
\p
\v 13 . And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs [namely which live in unclean water and always hold one manner of croaking ]come out of the mouth of the dragon out of the womb of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophets [hereby are meant the many Legats and Nuncio’s and other spiritual ministries of the antichrist that are sent forth throughout the world to subdue nations kings princes to the kingdom of the antichrist full of deceit and hypocrisy which the apostle 2Thessalonians 2.11 called a power of error which also boasts of miracles which the apostle there calleth miracles of lies as is known to all the word of the dragon and of the two beasts was spoken heretofore whereunto was also added before the images of the beasts in which second beast room here the false prophets is named hence it appeareth that this false prophet is also the image of the beast that is the antichrist with his whole kingdom for as much as he by himself and others his ministers defended false doctrines and shall appear in the next chapter by these then jointly taken are these unclean spirit sent forth because they unite and bring together all their craft and authority and combine together to destroy the church of God and his truth and speak herein as it were out of the mouth and are moved by one spirit.]
\p
\v 14 . For they are the spirit of the devils and do miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth [namely yet are addicted to the kingdom of the antichrist as the word earth used here and the world used in the sequel is continually taken ] and of the whole world [that is which throughout the whole world they yet seek to bring under their dominion which is done daily in all countries of the world even in the barbarous countries in the east and west] to gather them to the war of a great day of the almighty God [ namely wherein God is an extraordinary manner will execute his judgment against all his power whereof further mention shall be made hereafter chapter 19.19 and 20.1 though this be also daily done that these unclean spirits by their daily clamor seek to stir up all kings and nations against good Christian whom they with an unanimous voice call damned heretics yet in his vial respect is properly had to the last assault which the antichrist yet should make before his last ruin whereof is spoken in the next vial when he shall seek to bring together throughout the whole world not only the people that bear the name of the Christian but also barbarous and remote nations to destroy the church of Christ and to set up his own throne again.]
\p
\v 15 . Behold I come as a thief blessed is that he watched and keepeth his garment[this is added here to admonish everyone to standeth upon his guard forasmuch as all things shall have an end that day and after that time there will be no more time left for repentance as will follow hereafter see Matthew 24.42luke 12.39 Revelations 3.3] lest he walk necked and men see his shame [Gr and they see his shame that is the shamefulness of his sins namely if they not covered with his robe of Christ righteousness and with true faith joined with repentance see Galatians 5.27 and revelations 3.18.]
\p
\v 16 . And they gathered them together into the place which in the Hebrew is called Armageddon [this word is diversely interpreted some render it the causing of desolation or the deceit of cutting off because these camps of the antichrist shall be deceitful gathered together out of all nations but to their desolation and destruction but others conceive that this is a proper name of a proper name of a certain place mentioned in the scripture of the old testament where the like thing happened that is here foretold namely 2 Corinthians 35.21 and Zach. 12.11 where mention is made of the valley of Megiddon where king Josiah with the whole army of Israel was smitten by the Egyptians in the like place whereunto the army of the antichrist should be gathered together again in the like hope of obtaining the like victory against the Israel of God but tat the Lord by his unexpected coming should like turn away his reproach from the church and should fully and perfectly smite and finally destroy the enemies themselves though some are of opinion here rather respect s had to those places Judges 5.18 where Safera with the whole army of the Canaanites was miraculously smitten by Deborah and Barak about the valley of Megiddon to the comfort and deliverance of the children of Israel which they very well agreeth with this victory.]
\p
\v 17 . And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air[the seventh angel putteth the period to all and all consequently to the whole kingdom of the antichrist which is poured out upon the air because no living creature can live without air and because Satan who hath hither to ruled in the greatest part of the world hath his throne and habiteth there as Paul speaketh E[hessians 2.2 and 6.12 which shall also be abolished hereby as is more plainly testified hereafter chapter 20.10] and there came a great voice of the temple of the heaven from the throne saying it is done [ that is all things are fulfilled that wee to be done in the world according to the word of God or it hath been namely the great city and the beast whereof shall be treated more distinctly in the two next chapter.]
\p
\v 18 . And there were voices and thunders of lightning and there was great earth quake such as was not since men were upon the earth namely such an earth quake and so great [ by these voices etc. thunders are meant the token which should go the last coming of Christ to judgment as also the like token related Matthew 24 Mark 13 Luke 21 and 2Peter 3.10.]
\p
\v 19 . and the great city [which is spiritual Sodom and Egypt and comprehended the whole kingdom of the antichrist as was shewed chapter 11.18 which is called after great Babylon see chapter 14.8 and chapter 18.10 ]was rent into three parts [Gr became into three parts that is was utterly broken to shiver as things that are broken in many pieces come to nothing ] and the cities of the gentiles [ or the cities of the nations hereby are meant all other cities without Christiandom as for example the city of the Turks and Persians and other heathen ] are fallen and great Babylonian was come into remembrance before God [namely to receive her just sentence of God for God seemed before to wink at her and to have forgotten her willfulness[ to give unto her the cup of the wine of the wrath of indignation[see before chapter 14.8,10.]
\p
\v 20 . And every Island fled away and the mountains were not found [that is the place that were held fastest for to flee unto did leave them or were gone as chapter 6.14.]
\p
\v 21 . And they fell down from heaven upon men and were hail every stone was a talent in weight [ namely this hail fell out of heaven for the punishment of the wicked as John 10.11 but this punishment was so much as heavier because it brought intolerable burden of God wrath upon them for a talent weighed according to the testimony of some hundred pound weight ] and men blasphemed God because of the plagues of hail [namely though despair s the wicked will do at the last day see before chapter 6.16] for the plague thereof was exceeding great .
\c 17
\s One of the former seven angels bringeth the apostle into the wilderness and shewed the great whore of Babylon sitting upon the red beast which hath seven heads and ten horns 4 her apparel ornament title and blind thirstiness is described 7 the angel declareth unto John first the mystery of the beast 9 then he telleth him of his seven heads and of the eight king that should follow 12 and of the ten horns which are so many kings which receive their power with the beast 14 which fight with the lamb but overcome by him 15 the angel declareth what the waters are whereon this whore sitteth 16 and how the king shall again take away their power from the beast lastly he sheweth this whore is .
\p
\v 1 And one of the seven angels which had he seven vials [namely one of them spoken of in thefore going sixteenth chapter whom some conceive to have been the first because he had poured out his vial upon the throne of the beast whereof a large explication is properly made in these two following chapters ] came and walked with me said unto me hither [the seventh only to stir up the apostle there being no alteration of the place but only renewing of vision here to be understood as appeareth by the following third verse see the like phrase Ezekiel 8.3 and 40.1 etc. ] I will shew the judgments of the great whore [as the true church of Christ was compared to the honest woman clothed with the sun and adorned with a crown of twelve stars chapter 12.1 so here the back sliding church is compared with the harlot which forsaking Christ the only bridegroom keepeth company also with other man that is with idols and other patrons though she may boast of the contrary as is also said of the Israelitish church and of the city of Jerusalem Isaiah 1.21 Jeremiah 3.1 Ezekiel 16.15 Now who this whore is and that are judgments is will appear by the sequel] that sitteth upon many waters [that is which hath dominion over many people multitude tongues and nations as the angel sheweth hereafter verse 15 and 18.]
\p
\v 2 . With whom the king of the earth have committed fornication [that is have combined to defend the spiritual fornication and dominion and to bring others thereto by their power as is shewed by the angel verse 13 and 17] and they tat inhabit the earth [that is they that are earthly minded and inclined to earthy worship as man are so by nature for here from verse 8 are expressly expected all those whose names are written in the book of life ] have mm made drunk with the wine of her fornication [that is have been so taken and filled with the blind zeal and love of their trick up superstitions and idolatries as lewed man are wont to be with the wine that is filled unto them by a crafty harlot to allure them to satisfy her unchaste lust.]
\p
\v 3 . And he carried ne away in the spirit [ namely in a rapture or trance as was noted on the first verse ] into the wilderness [namely that he might be able the more freely to heed all things quietly and without trouble or tumult from men others understand by this wilderness of the kingdom of the antichrist itself which indeed is full of the earthly tumult but empty and void of al saving truth and spiritual fruitfulness] and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet colored beasts [hereby is meant a royal pride and blood thirstiness of the beast as also of this woman as appeareth on verse 4 and 6 whereof see the further exposition as also of the names of blasphemy mentioned in the sequel in the annotate on chapter 13.1 concerning the seven beasts and ten horns mentioned also in the words following the exposition whereof will be made hereafter by the angels ] which was full of the names of blasphemy and had seven heads and ten horns [that by the woman sitting upon the scarlet colored beast is meant the city of Rome which is the dominion thereof appeareth by the whole description that followeth after especially by the first verse which is called the great Babylon namely to be understood in a spiritual manner as appeareth in chapter 14.8 and 16.19 and by the following ninth verse where it is shewed by the following verse where it is shewed by the angels that the seven heads of this beast upon which the woman set are seven mountains and by the last verse where it is expressly said that this woman is the great city which hath the kingdom over the kings of the earth which is only applicable to Rome this is so plain not that as only the chiefest of the fathers and all the reformed teachers agreeth therein but even many popish expositors but these last hold to keep off antichristianism from their pope and popery, that this is to be understood by the city of the dominion of Rome only it was under the dominion of Pagan empire and did persecute the Christians namely about three hundred years after Christ nativity till the time of Constantine the empire but these are easily confuted by the sequel of the two chapters first because Rome pagan did not use the press upon other kings and nations which had brought under the dominion her own idolatry but did further themselves to follow their own customary superstitions yea they permitted the very Jews themselves to enjoy their own worship till such time that that they rebelled against them whereas this woman maketh all kings and nations drunk with the cup of fornication that is idolatry secondly to Rome Pagan cannot be applied that which is said verse 12 that the ten kings which gave their power unto the beast in honor receive their power with the beast in regard with the ancient Romans did violently by little and little from time to time to subdue unto themselves those that toy had brought under their dominion and not by mutual consent and combinement thirdly because the beast and the two men that sitteth upon it that is antichrist and the city of Rome are here continually joined together whereas Rome Pagan as long as it was Pagan was not properly the city of the antichrist and therefore its said that the beast should yet out of the bottomless pit and after that go into the perdition lastly because the sad and exemplary ruin of this city of Babylon whereof the last chapter speaketh of at large cannot be not meant of Rome Pagan because that never happened to it as a long as it was Pagan but was afterwards above a hundred years in a good condition under Christian empire as appeareth by history its true indeed that it was afterwards destroyed and taken by the Goths, Vandals and others but it was presently after brought to his former condition and continueth still whereas its plain that the ruin of the Babylon whereof is spoken in the next chapter shall be never at an end as it is testifieth chapter 18.2,21 this is so plain that some popish expositors themselves acknowledge that which is prophesied here and in the next chapter must be understood of the city of Rome that is now but to clear themselves of antichristianism they devise another intention that a little before the end of the world ten Pagan kings its not known out of what corner of the world shall come and join with the antichrist that should be a tribe of Dan and take possession of the whole world chase away the pope of Rome and set up antichrist in the place and impose upon all nations their heathenish idolatry and all this in three years and a half before the end of the world and shall burn Rome with all her riches and yet mourn over her etc. which was also confuted before and is repugnant to all human judgment reason as the following exposition will also sufficiently shew.]
\p
\v 4 . And the woman was clothed with purple and scarlet was adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls [the outwards pomp of this woman and of the backsliding church of Rome goeth though the whole kingdom not only in public government but also in public worship where all things are performed in the most sumptuous and most beautiful manner and purple scarlet is the livery of their chiefest head ] and had in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and of uncleanness fornication[hereby are fitly understood the fair and alluring title which antichrist giveth to himself and to his church before the world to bring men thereby to obedience unto them as for example, holy father Vicar of Christ head of catholic church the successor of Peter the foundation of the church etc. which not withstanding considered in themselves are abominable blasphemy, superstitions, and false doctrines others interpret this of the cup of the mass and consequently of the mass itself which is full of abominations .]
\p
\v 5 . And upon her forehead was a name written [namely as famous trumpets of the old were wont to set up their names and titles upon the fore part of their houses and upon their foreheads that they might not be more known and might be better allured others to them and draw them to their will] namely mystery [namely mysteries which name many testify it hath been heretofore put upon the pope miter with the triple crown but this no withstanding it may be fitly applied to all ceremonies vestments and consecration which the pope with his shave lings useth which they all even to very least feign to be full of mysteries and secrets] great Babylon [namely called so spiritually and figuratively as is expressed chapter 11.8 of Egypt and Sodom whereof see there the exposition see also before chapter 14.8 and 16.19] the mother of whoredom [or the mother of harlots that is of idolatries and superstitions as was noted before verse 1 for thus doth she also boasts namely that she is the mother of the holy church from whence all other churches on earth are sprung forth and depend as children do spring forth and proceed from their mother ] and of abominations of the earth [namely in deposing and murdering of kings and princes and subject from their oaths in dissolving lawful marriages in withdrawing of children from their obedience and service due to their parents under the cloat of religion in tolerating of public stew in lying and deceiving and such like abominations which the doctrines and actions of popery do import ] and with the blood of witnesses of Jesus.
\p
\v 6 . And I saw the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints [whereof the books of martyrs of all nations are full of examples ] and when I saw her I admired with great admiration .
\p
\v 7 . And the angels saith unto me wherefore marvellest thou? I will tell thee [that is I will further declare unto thee as is done in the sequel ] the misty of the woman and of the beast that carrieth her which hath the seven heads and the ten horns.
\p
\v 8 . The beast that thou hast seen was and is not [that is here prophesied of the kingdom of the antichrist is manifest therefore all these properties must agree therewith the first that it was John time may fitly be understood of the Roman empire that had been already and should still continue some hundreds of years under several governments whereupon the angel addedeth and is not because at that time it had no spiritual command over the churches in Christendom neither should have in some hundreds of years ] and it shall ascend out of the bottomless pit [because it should receive these two dominion but about five hundred years after Johns time when antichrist should subdue unto himself not only spiritual persons but also temporal princes contrary to the doctrine and example of Christ as came to pass in the time of Phorus and afterwards Revelations 13 verse 1] and go into perditions [namely after it shall have continued some considerable time it will again decrease the degrees and lose its authority among Christians as of a latter time is begun and in the next chapter shall be fulfilled ] and they that dwell upon the earth shall wonder[that is shall be moved with reverence towards it and worship it or submit themselves unto it see before chapter 13 verse 3,4,8] whose names are not written from the book of life in the foundation of the world [that is expecting those whose names are written in the book of life whereof see chapter 13.8 which is here inserted that it might not seem that Christ in time of antichrist reign hath no more reserved a church for himself on earth ] holding the beast that was and is not though it be [these word may be sufficiently understood by the former annotations on this verse.]
\p
\v 9 . Here is the understanding that hath wisdom the seven head are seven mountains [that is signify seven mountains ] whereon the mountain sitteth [now that the city of Rome was built upon the seven mountains apparent sufficient by all ancient writers which are mount Capitolinus , Polatinus,, Coelius, Aventinous , Esquilinus , Vimilanas and Quirinalisfor which cause is also called by some ancient writers the seven hilled city.]
\p
\v 10 . They are also seven kings [that is they signify seven kings or kingly governments whence is appeareth that a type or thing may have a divers signification now who these seven kings are is diversely understood some understand by these kings the seven empires that had reigned in Rome and Nero’s time unto the time of John’s banishment but there seemeth to be no reason that the empire that had reigned before Nero’s time even from the time of Julius Caesar should not be well counted as the following empires that came after Nero and its manifest that here is spoken of the kings which comprehended the whole government of the Roman empire therefore others understand it more fitly of the seven forms or manner of government where by the city of Rome hath been governed in this past time and should yet be governed in the time to come as the angel testifieth here and in verse 11 whereof the first government hath been from Romulus Tarquinius under kings properly the so called the second from Brutus under Consuls the third under Dictator the forth under Decimvir the fifth under tribune Consulates the sixth under empire from Julius Caesar which form of government continued still at that time when the revelation came unto John ] five are fallen one is the other not yet come and hen he shall come he shall continue a little while [this is the seventh sort or manner of government which begun under Constantine the first Christian empire who began another form of government on his time and after he had reigned about the space of 20 years at Rome and every where had brought in the Christian faith departed to Byzantium which hereafter his name called Constantinople and there especially established the city of the empire whereby the empyreal authority in Rome and in Italy more and more decrease and the antichristian dominion did the degree rise higher and higher which I the eighth form of government mentioned in the next verse.]
\p
\v 11 . And the beast that was and is not [this is the Papal government which in a manner began to rise up in a beginning but was not yet fully revealed till the time of Phorus the empire about fie hundred and ten years after Christ nativity Popery by little and little extended his spiritual and temporal dominion over Christendom and was fully discovered as was shewed formerly which after that it had been for some hundred years in its full strength and power it began afterwards again to decline by little and little and declineth still] the same is also the same king and is of the seven [that is hath gathered his strength together from the former seven heads and forms of government and hath set up the same by little and little for this eighth form comprehended not only an head of this beast but the whole beast also ] and goeth into perdition.
\p
\v 12 . And the ten horn horns which thou sawest are ten kings [that is kingdoms as by Daniel and kings with their successors in those kingdoms are continually understood now some these expositors take number for a strict number of ten which were the first that rose up also about the very time of the rising up of the antichrist in the west others for an uncertain number that or thereabouts as this word is also elsewhere used see an example see Genesis 31.7 Numbers 14.22 and under this number are counted the kingdom of Hungary, Naples, Spain, France , England, Scotland, Poland, Sweden, Denmark, Portugal, Bohemia and some others that are comprehended under these as Nava, Aragon, Lions, Sicilia, Sardinia, Norway etc. ] which yet has not received the kingdom but receive the power as king at one hour with the beast [that is or about one time as this phrase is also taken Job 4.52 Acts 10.3 and verse 30 Revelations 3.3 others render it one hour that is a short time as this phrase also signifieth elsewhere but the first agrees with the scope of the apostle .]
\p
\v 13 . These have one kind of meaning and shall deliver up their power and strength unto the beast [they have one mind namely in this point of maintaining and defending the authority and superstition of antichrist though in the worldly matters they oftentimes differ and are at variance amongst themselves and though sometimes some of these kings have opposed some of these Popes yet they would always seem to defend popery and the doctrine thereof.]
\p
\v 14 . These shall make war against the lamb [ that is assault and persecute Christ in the members as Christ himself speaketh unto Paul Acts 9.4 for though they did not intend to fight directly against Christ yet they that seek to destroy his members and his doctrine are counted and said in scripture to fight against Christ himself see Psalms 2.2 Acts 4. 25 &c.] and the lamb shall overcome them [namely both by a spiritual victory that they shall not be able to destroy the sure and saving doctrine of Christ whatsoever they do but that Christ by his elect and believers in spite of all such power shall spread the same abroad in the world and also by many outward victories which he will give to his people in the world over them as the example of former ages and of this present age do plainly shew and in that last great war whereof that was prophesied in the former chapter verse 1 shall it yet more plainly appear before the eyes of all the world ] for he is the Lord of Lords the king of Kings [this title is here attributed unto God 1Timothy 6.15 because he is the true God and ruler over all creatures of one essence with the father see also hereafter chapter 19.16] and they that are with him the called ones and chosen and faithful.
\p
\v 15 . And he said unto me the waters which thou sawest where the whore sitteth are people and multitude and nations and tongues [that is signify people of divers languages and nations a sacramental phrase as was also shewed before and followed after verse 18.]
\p
\v 16 . And the ten horn which thou sawest upon the head of the beast they shall bate the whore [the ten horn that is as the kings was declared verse 12shall open their eyes at last and perceive how they have been seduced by her and hate it for her idolatry and dominion whereof some have done it already and we are to beg of God that it may be also done by the rest ] and shall make her desolate and naked [that is re-assume to themselves their power and authority which they had formerly given to her in the kingdoms and shall turn the same against her ] and they shall eat her flesh [that is they shall refuse to pay and take away her revenues and riches which she gathered their lands and shall convert them to their own use and employ them against her ] and shall burn with her fire [it or her namely the place or their city with seven mountains where she had her seat or throne as was shewed chapter 16.10.]
\p
\v 17 . For God hath given them in their hearts to do his mind [for the heart of kings is the hand of the Lord as waters brook he turneth it wither so ever he will Proverbs 21.1 namely either in his just wrath or judgment for their punishment and for their trial of his people or in his mercy and favor for the redemption and deliverance of his people and for the punishment of his enemies his mind or counsel as also verse 13 and here in the sequel ] and do one mind and give their kingdom to the beast until the word of God shall be finished [that is until the prophesy and the predictions shall be fulfilled which God hath reveled unto us in his word as well of the rising dominion as of the fall of antichrist.]
\p
\v 18 . And the woman which thou sawest is the great city which hath the kingdom over the kings of the earth [see the exposition hereof on the annotate on verse3.]
\c 18
\s An angel came down from heaven 2 which again declareth the fall of Babylon because of her whoredom and voluptuousness 4 for which cause Gods people are exhorted to depart out of her 6 and commanded to reward her double 7 and though she boas that she shall be no widow yet her plagues shall come upon her at once 9 the kings of the art mourn for her fall 11 Also the merchants that hath put all manner of precious to sale in her 17 likewise the masters of the ship and the seamen 20 but the contrary the heaven with the holy apostle and prophets are exhorted to rejoice 21 a mighty angel casteth a very great stone in the sea and represented the final fall of the great Babylon 22 declareth that no instruments of joy shall be heard anymore of her 23 because she had seduced all nations and because the blood of the saints was found in her.
\p
\v 1 And after these things [that is after that the former angel had finished his work concerning the destruction of the great whore ] I saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with glory[some understand of Christ himself and of his coming f judgment when he shall utterly abolish antichrist 2Thessalonians 2.8 but since that in the 9 verse and so following is spoken at large of mourning of the kings merchants and the seamen which they should yet make after this fall of great Babylon its therefore probable that here is spoken of the fall of this Babylon and the destruction of her throne which shall yet come to pass before for an example of Gods just judgment throughout the whole world as also appeareth from thence that God in verse 4 commanded his people to depart from out of het that they may not be partakers of their sins and plagues which can not be well applied to the last day of which last vengeance upon the beast and the false prophets shall be first spoken chapter 19 verse 20,21 these two properties of great power and glory are also ascribed to created angels Psalms 103.20 Luke 2.9 Acts 12.7 the reason why these titles are here given to this angel is because the great power and glory were requisite to destroy this almighty throne of the antichrist in the world.]
\p
\v 2 . And he cried mightily with a great voice saying she is fallen she is fallen the great Babylon [these words were also uttered by the angel chapter 14.8 but there understood of the beginning of the fall of this great Babylon in the hearts of many in the world as was noted there which began to be done a great while ago and is done yet daily but they are understood here of the utter destruction of the throne of this beast of great Romish Babylon and these words are taken out of Isaiah 21.9 and Jeremiah 51.8 which words are foretold by an prophets a hundred years before the destruction of the city and kingdom of the Assyrian Babylon and were fulfilled afterward] and is become an inhabitation of devil and an hold of all unclean spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird[ an inhabitation of devils namely which for the most part in solitary and desolate places which for the most part kept solitary and desolate with he unclean birds as experience and Christ himself testifieth Matthew 12.44 whereby the providence of God are kept as in a hold till God in his just judgment let them use to tempt men a new and the like words are also used of the desolation of the Assyrians Babylon Isaiah 13 verse 21,22 Jeremiah 50.39&c.]
\p
\v 3 . Because all the nations have drunk the wine of her fornication [that is idolatry see hereof the annotate on chapter 14.8 and 17.2] and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed with rich by virtue of her pleasure[though this in a manner be applicable to merchants properly so called in all parts of the world which through the abundance of pleasure that is found in the kingdom of the antichrist or in the great city of Babylon as is further declared hereafter verse 11 and so forth yet this may be here very fitly applied to the spiritual merchandise that is practiced in their service of God and selling of spiritual benefices & offices forasmuch as all things are there to be bought for money and the rather sith also the souls of men are counted among these commodities and merchandise verse 13 and its said verse 23 that the great men of the earth were these merchants among whom may be understood of the Cardinals Patriarchs Arch-bishops Abbot and other Prelates that drive such a trade with them.]
\p
\v 4 . And I heard another word from heaven saying go out of her my people [these also words are used by God Isaiah 48.20 Jeremiah 50.8 and 51.6 and Zach 2.7 for admonition to the people to the ruin of the Assyrian Babylon that they might in time provide themselves and depart out of it which are here spoken to all true believers concerning spiritual Babylon the ground whereof follow in the text the voice seemeth not to have been the voice of a created angel but the voice of God of God or Christ proceeding from the throne of heaven forasmuch as he calleth believers his people which only belongeth to God or Christ Matthew 1.21 Acts 18 verse 9 , 10] that ye have no fellowship in her sin that ye receive not her plagues [that ye partake not her sins namely being either enticed thereto by daily converse with them and being forced thereto by them through fear and persecution whereupon followeth community of punishment thus Christ exhorteth his Matthew 24.16.]
\p
\v 5 . For her sins have followed one upon another unto heaven [a phrase when the measure of sins which God in his patience and long suffering hath fore born is filled up so that there is nothing left anymore save the punishment see the like phrase Genesis 15.16 and 18.20,21 Romans 2.5] and God hath remembered her iniquities [as God is said to forget or not remember men’s sins Jeremiah 31.34 and elsewhere he pardoneth them unto believers and penitent persons and doth not punish them in them so he is said to remember them or to be mindful of them when he decreed to punish them see chapter.19.]
\p
\v 6 . Reward according as she had rewarded you [this must not be understood of any self revenge which Christ exprestly forbiddeth his people Matthew 5.39 Romans 12.19 But either of Gods secret providence in his whole work whereby god will raise up certain instruments which shall execute even ignorantly this public vengeance according to the will of God as is said of the Medes and Persians against the Babylonians Jeremiah 50.9 and 51.11 &c or else of those princes and kings which after they had brought to knowledge of the truth shall defense and protect the people of God and being moved by a godly zeal against the injustice tyranny and idolatry of this great Babylon shall also execute Gods judgments upon her which do well agree with 16 and 17 verse of the former chapter see the like phrase Exodus 32.2] and double unto her according to her works [this is said not in respect of her iniquity and tyranny which god neither can do or hath done to any but of the trouble and anguish which she had justly procured and offered into the Godly which is God here will have her to suffer justly as the following words declare] in the cup wherein she hath filled fill to her double.
\p
\v 7 . As much as she hath glorified herself and hath had pleasure so much torment and sorrow offer to her for she saith in her heart I sit as a queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow [this is the proper boasting of him that sitteth in the temple of God as if he were God and whom in temporal is exalted himself above all kings and princes and in spirituals above all councils, bishops, and Prelate who as a mother and queen of all churches can not fail nor err whose seat can not fall to the ground and such proud titles more which themselves and their ministers do generally give them in their writings.]
\p
\v 8 . Therefore shall her plagues come in one day [that is in a short time which God hath appointed upon her ] namely death ad mourning and famine and she shall be burnt with fire for strong is the Lord who judgeth her [and therefore no worldly power shall be able to hinder his mighty arm from executing this his judgment upon her.]
\p
\v 9 . The kings of he earth which have committed fornication and have pleasure with her [namely till the time of her fall and destruction ] shall bewail her and lament her [Gr smite themselves etc. namely upon the breast for grieve ] when they shall see the smock of her burning [hence it appeareth that some princes and kings will yet always side with her to establish her state and superstitions which shall seek to stop and hinder her ruin and when the same shall have already come to pass shall seriously but vain lament and bemoan her.]
\p
\v 10 . Standing afar off [ namely without being able to help her] for fear of the torment saying two wo the great city Babylon the strong city for in one hour [as verse 8 in one day that is in short time ] is thy judgment come.
\p
\v 11 . And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her because no man buyeth their ware anymore [Gr their freight or lading because their vanity and deceit is known.]
\p
\v 12 . Ware of gold and of silver and of precious stones and of pearls and of fine linen and of purple and o silk and of scarlet [these words with some of the following verses are for the most part taken out of Ezekiel chapter 27 where the like is foretold of he merchant city Tyrus and though as was said before the antichristian Tyrus enricheth also many merchants from all parts of the world by buying and using these commodities in all their stateliness and adorning of their temples images buildings and outward worships throught all her dominions yet in many be also fitly understood of the spiritual merchandise which they and their great ones exercise among men as was noted on the third verse] and all manner of sweet wood][ Gr thyne-wood see 1 Kings chapter 10 verse 11] and all manner of ivory vessels and all manner of vessels of most precious wood and of copper and of iron and of marble stones.
\p
\v 13 . And cinnamon and incense and sweet smelling ointment and frankincense and wine and burden bearing beasts and sheep and of horses and carets of bodies and of souls of men[that is making the bodies of the living their slaves and selling the souls of the dead to be delivered out of their devised purgatory by indulgencies pardons pilgrimages sacrifices for the dead and like wherein the profit of their merchants doth greatly consist.]
\p
\v 14 . And the fruit of the lust of thy soul [Gr the autumn fruit harvest or fruit tree that is all manner of fair and pleasant fruit sweet meats and delicate dishes abundance ] is departed from thee and all that is delicate and that was glorious to depart from thee and that shalt find it no more.
\p
\v 15 . And the merchants of these things which were made rich by her[namely the spiritual merchants which depended on this Babylon and by her where made honorable and mighty see before the annotate on verse 3.]shall stand afar off for fear of her torment [namely because they are in danger and of receiving their part in it or at least of doing their profit and credit in the world ] weeping and mourning.
\p
\v 16 . And saying wo, wo the great city that was cloathed with fine linen and purple and scarlet and adorned with gold[ Gr golded or gilded as before chapter 17.4] and with precious stone s and with pearls in one hour so great riches are come to desolation.
\p
\v 17 . And in all pilots and all the people upon the ship [hereby may be in some sort be understood by steer-men or ship-master properly so called who also made profit by this Babylon by means of the bringing of this good from all parts of the world as is related of the steer-men and seamen of the Tyrus Ezekiel 27.9,25 and so forth but this is also by many figuratively understood of those that are members or have government oth spiritual courts Abbies, Cloisters, and such like spiritual good who shall also hereby lose their profit and credit which are also compared to waters and rivers chapter 16.4] and sailers [or shipmen] and all that trade at sea stood afar off.
\p
\v 18 . And cried seeing the smock of her burning and saying what city was like unto the great city?
\p
\v 19 . And they cast dust upon their heads [for a special token of great sorrow and grief of their loss as was usual among the ancient 1samuel 4.2 Job 2 verse 12 and as is also said of the steer master and the seamen of Tyrus Ezekiel 27verse 30,31 how be it this their mourning is not for their sins and superstitious worships wherein they were hardened but only for their loss and damage] and cried weeping and mourning and saying Wo, wo the great city wherein all that had ships in the sea where made rich for her costliness for in one hour she is made desolate.
\p
\v 20 . Rejoice over her thou heaven [that is ye inhabitants of heaven angels of holy martyrs who also prayed for the execution of God’s judgment, for the justifying of their cause chapter 6.10 whose number is now daily filled up which not withstanding is not so to be understood as if the heavenly creatures of the church of God ought to rejoice at anyone’s mischief but at the execution of God’s justice and at the manifestation of the justness for cause for which believers here do suffer ] and the holy apostle and the prophet [hereby are meant not only the apostle and prophets properly so called who as members of one body having one common cause should also rejoice here at but also the ministers and teachers of succeeding time to whom all the same should happen according to the example of the former] for God hath judged your judgments on her [that is avenged you on her.]
\p
\v 21 . And a mighty angel lifted up a stone like a great mil-stone and cast it into the sea saying thus with violence shall the great city Babylon be cat and shall be found no more[this is a token of casting a great mil-stone into the sea saying thus with violence shall the great city Babylon be cast and shall be found no more. [this token of casting a stone like a great mil-stone into the sea is added to the promises and threatening for confirmation sake as appeareth throughout by the prophets especially of the fall of the old Babylon Jer. 51.63.]
\p
\v 22 . And the voice of the players on harps or singers and of pipers and of trumpeters shall be heard no more [under such like phrases as is utter ruin and mischief is also prophesied to them of Tyrus Ezekiel 26.13] and no artificers of any art shall be found anymore in thee and no sound of the mill [namely to prepare food for the inhabitants requisite for the sustentation of this life] shall be heard anymore in thee.
\p
\v 23 . And the light of the candle shall shine no more in thee [this is added thereunto either such light is necessary for a great part o mans life in the evening and in the night time or because wedding whereof followeth in the next words where in the former time kept in the evening and at night time especially for which purpose the candles and torches were used see Mathew 25.1 ] and the voice of the bride groom and of the bride shall be heard no more in thee [namely which I not only a time of joy but also a means whereby th inhabitants of this Babel might be able to increase and multiply again ] for thy merchant were the great men of the earth [ see the annotate on verse 3] for by thy sorceries [that is idolatry an enticement of thy religion as often heretofore] were all nations seduced.
\p
\v 24 . And in her was found the blood of the prophets and of the saints and all of them that were slain upon the earth[ that is she is found to have been the occasion of the shedding of blood of the prophets and saints as well she herself hath slain a great multitude of them and caused them throughout her dominion by her rigorous decree and inquisition to be put to death as also because she hath by this her practice furthered and applauded the tyranny of that have done the same see like words of Christ Matthew 23 verse 34,35,36.]
\c 19
\s Hallelujah is sung in heaven for the judgment the great whore 5 another voice out of the throne exhorteth all the servants of God to rejoice because the marriage of the lamb is come and his bride has made herself with bright linen 9 they pronounced blessed that are called to his marriage 10 the apostle falleth down before the angels feet but is reproved for it and commaned to worship God 11 John seeth in new vision a white horse and one seeth thereon and whose justice, flame eyes, blood died garments, hidden name, train, sword and iron rod are described 15 this same treadeth the wine press of Gods wrath and is the king of kings 17 another angel calleth of God all the birds to come and eat the flesh of the commanders and of all others in great slaughter of God 19 who were gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse 20 but the beast with the false prophets are cast into the lake of fire 21 and all their adherents are slain with the swords.
\p
\v 1 And after these things [that is after the Romish Babylon was now at last by special judgment of God burnt and destroyed as was related in the former chapter] I heard as it were great voice of the great multitude in heaven [namely of those that triumph with Christ in heaven and compassed hi throne about chapter 7.9 as they are exhorted in the former chapter verse 20 by the angels of this song of phrase mentioned in the words following]saying Hallelujah[that is praise god an Hebrew word that occurred in many psalms which hath also been retained in the Greek and other churches because it was very similar and know and is also Amen Hosanna Abba etc.]salvation and glory and honor and power be unto the lord our God [these properties are not here wished unto God sith he had always possessed he same but are acknowledged extolled in him because he had now actually made them manifest in the sight of the every one see the like expression before chapter 5.12 and 7.12 and elsewhere.]
\p
\v 2 . for the judgments are true and righteous [that is the executed according to his truth and righteousness sith he had promised before unto his people and had had threatened the same unto the enemies f the church see Psalms 9.9] because he hath judged the great whore [see before chapter 17.1] which did corrupt the earth with her fornication and he had avenged the blood of his servant at her hand.
\p
\v 3 . They said the second time namely to shew with how great earnestness they did it ] Hallelujah and her smock ascended forever more [Gr into Eternity of eternities.]
\p
\v 4 . And four twenty elders [namely with the four beast were about the throne of God whereof see further chapter 4.4,6 above chapter 5.8] and the four beast fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne saying Amen Hallelujah.
\p
\v 5 And a voice came forth out of the throne [namely of heaven whereof frequently spoken before ] saying praise our God all ye his servants namely not only believers in heaven on earth but also angels who acknowledge themselves to be fellow servants of the faithful below verse 10 and chapter 22.9 ] and ye that fear him both small and great [this voice tendeth thereunto to exhort all the servants of God in heaven and on earth to sing a new song of praise for the mercies which God will shew unto his church at the last coming of Christ to judgment as by the exposition will plainly appear .]
\p
\v 6 . And I heard as it were a voice of great[ Greek much] multitude and as a voice of many waters and as a voice of strong thunder saying Hallelujah for the Lord of the almighty god hath reigned as king [that is the time cometh now that he having subdued all his enemies under his feet and having abolished the kingdom of the antichrist of Satan and of the world will reign alone and will make it appear before all the world 1Corinthians 15.24 for though he always reigned as king and the kingdom hath been much darkened among many by reason of the tyranny of these others and by the reason of the patience and forbearance in all these things according to the judgment of the world.]
\p
\v 7 . Let us be glad and rejoice and give glory to him for the marriage of the lamb is come [that is the nearer union and full glorification of the church of Christ in heaven with the bridegroom Christ is at land which comparison is also continually used elsewhere see mark 2 verse 19,20 John 3.29 2 Corinthians 11.2 Ephesians 5.23 etc.] and his wife hath made herself ready [namely for this nearer union and full glorification which preparation proceedeth not from her natural abilities but from free grace which was given unto her by hr bride groom as the next verse sheweth see also Ezekiel 16.3 etc. 2 Corinthians 3.5 Ephesians 5.26 Philippians 1.29.]
\p
\v 8 . And to her was granted that she should be arrayed with pure and bright fine linen are [that is signified as before chapter 1.20 and 17.15,18.]the justification [or righteousness] of saints [namely not whereby we are righteous in our own selves but where we are righteous before God which is righteous of Christ which is imputed unto us by faith 2 Corinthians 5.21and is as a pure white garment whereby our nakedness is covered before the face of God see Romans 13.14 1 Corinthians 1.30 Galatians 3.27 and above chapter 7.13 from whence the sanctification of the spirit ariseth which shall also hereafter be perfected in us.]
\p
\v 9 . And he said unto me write blessed are they which are called [ namely with a calling according to Gods purpose from them he had justified and glorified Romans 8.30 otherwise there are some called to this marriage whereof in the sequel with the outward calling which shall be afterwards cast forth see Matthew 22.11 etc.] to the marriage super of the lamb [ so called because marriages were wont to be kept by the ancient at the even tide Matthew 25.1and because it shall here begin in the end of the world or last day ] and he said unto me these are the true words of God [namely whereby this salvation is promised to us which is therefore received with sure faith and fulfilling whereof we must exprest in due time.]
\p
\v 10 . And I fell down before his feet to worship him [namely being moved thereunto through humane frailty as well by reason of the glory of the angel as by reason of the glorious which he made declaration which he made of the coming of the marriage of the lamb as the like was done by Cornelius unto Peter Acts 10.25] and he said unto me see thou do it not [though John held not this angel refused to take it both here and below chapter 22.9 as also the worshipping of the angels is forbidden by Paul Colossians 2.18 ] I am thy fellow of thine brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God [ namely who this honor and true invocation only belongeth Matthew 4.10] for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of the prophecy and of the same worth whereby he sheweth they are both servants of Jesus Christ for as much as he had received the spirit prophecy to declare this unto John Revelations 1.1 and John likewise to testify this in the name of Christ unto the church.]
\p
\v 11 . And I saw heaven open [namely to open way unto Christ as the supreme judge and ruler to come down with all his heavenly hosts for the redemption of his church and for the punishment of all his their enemies see Matthew 24.30 and 25.30 1 Thessalonians 4.16 2 Thessalonians 1.7 Jude verse 14 etc.] and behold a white horse [namely as a token of glory conquest as was shewed before chapter 6.2 but for another end whereof see the annotate there.]and he that sat upon it was called faithful and true [namely in persecuting and performing hi promises and threatening ] and he judgeth and maketh war in righteousness [namely not only for the defense of his people but also for the just punishment of his enemies Romans 2 verse 5,6 in the eleventh verse begin the last part of this chapter wherein there is shewed unto John in a new vision the coming of Christ to redeem their church fully and perfectly and utterly to destroy the antichrist with all his adherents and all other enemies of the church as appeareth by consideration of this whole relation but some are of opinion that is here is described another coming of Christ and his spirit and power which should precede hi last coming wherein the Jews should be converted and the rest of the church here being united with the Jews should triumph over all the enemies and enjoy a quiet and peaceable kingdom but this opinion can not consist with that which is said verse 20 that in the coming of the beast and the false prophets were cast alive in the lake of fire which shall not be done till the last coming of Christ as the apostle also expressly testifieth 2Thessalonians 2.8 and also because in the coming of Christ whereof is spoken in the chapter the marriage of the lamb with the bride is said to be kept or solemnized which is uniting of the church of Christ as the last day with Christ her bridegroom Matthew 5. Verse 1 ,13 whereunto may be added that the state of the church of Christ before the last coming of is continually described in the scripture that it shall quiet otherwise on earth then these men conceive as is more largely noted chapter 20.1.]
\p
\v 12 . And his eyes were as a flame of fire [ namely as chapter 1.14 whereby he vieweth all things thoroughly and nothing is hid from him] and on his head were many royal diadems [namely folded together as a token of his dominion even above the dragon and the beasts of his manifold dominion even above the dragon and the beast with seven heads and ten crowned horns for he is the king of kings and Lord of Lord verse 16] and he had a name written that no man knew but himself [namely the only son of the infinite father whose nature no man fully understandeth but himself John 1.18 for though the same be also revealed unto us and his name be also declared verse 13 yet no creature is able to comprehend it perfectly because his generation is unalterable and eternal.]
\p
\v 13 . And he was clothed with a garment died [Gr dipped in ] with blood [ namely in respect of the suffering of us and in respect of the blood of his enemies wherewith the garment was died in this slaughter see below verse 15 Isaiah 63.1 etc.] and his name is called the word of God [ see here the annotate on John chapter 1 verse 1]
\p
\v 14 . And the armies in heaven [that is the holy angel with whom that hall descend with him b again united with the bodies and to be taken also partakers of his triumph f Christ see 2 Corinthians 5 verse 8,9,10] followed him upon white horses clothed with white an pure fine linen[namely to signify their purity and glory when they shall to triumph with Christ their head whose garment alone is died with blood by reason of this slaughter and whom alone is armed with the sword and an iron rod because the honor of victory belongeth only to him see Isaiah 63 verse 1 etc. and hereafter verse 21.]
\p
\v 15 . And out of his mouth went a sharp sword [see the exposition of the sword verse 21] that with it he should smite the heathen [or nations that is all the enemies of the church that shall side with the antichrist against Christ and his kingdom see before chapter 2.26 where this place of the second Psalms is applied to the members of the Christ ] and he shall rule them with an iron rod [namely to break them in pieces like ear then vessels because they suffered not themselves to be laid then by the staff of his word] and he tread ed the wine press of the wine of the wrath and indignation of the almighty God [that is he treaded underfoot and bruiseth in pieces the enemies of God as grapes in a wine press are easily trodden underfoot and bruised in pieces by a strong man see before chapter 14.20 Isaiah 63.3 where this similitude is also used by Christ see also the like in the lamentation of Jeremy chapter 1.15.]
\p
\v 16 . And he hath upon his garment and upon his thigh [that is upon his garment hanging upon his thigh that is openly in the sight of men as the garment upon the thigh of men that ride on horsebacks is most seen and in most manifest ] this name written KING OF KINGS THE LORD OF LORDS [which title is by Paul given to the father 1Timothy 6.15 and before this book unto Christ Revelations 17.14 as he that hath not only received of God his father and a name above all names but was also from eternity equal with God see John 10 verse 29,30 Philippians 2.6.]
\p
\v 17 . And I saw an angel standing in the sun [namely that he might be heard throughout the whole air as Herald are wont to proclaim the charge of their captain general in high and their open places the better to be heard by everyone] and he cried with a greater voice saying to all the fowls that flew in the midst of heaven come hither and gather yourself to the supper of the great God [that is which God in his wrath upon the enemies hath prepared for you a figurative phrase taken out of Jeremiah 12.9 and Ezekiel 39 verse 17 whereby is signified an exceeding overthrow of Gods enemies whose dead and slain bodies were left for a prey unto wild fowls and savage beasts but they shall hereafter his great slaughter of God in valley of Armageddon chapter 16 verse 16 being given for a prey unto the devil and hell as is declared verse 20.]
\p
\v 18 . That ye may eat the flesh of the kings [namely which shall adhere unto and defend antichrist and shall side with him against antichrist as is shewed in the next verse for some of his kings shall also hate this whore and strip her naked and eat her flesh and burn her with fire chapter 17.16] and captains over thousands and the flesh of the mighty men and the flesh of the horses and of them that sit on them [that is of all sorts of soldiers of which a great army is wont consist ] and the flesh of all free men and bond men and of small and great.
\p
\v 19 . And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse and against his army [that is I saw antichrist that was the head of the army [and who had sent sent three unclean spirits to the kings of the earth to stir up this great to stir up to this great war against Christ and his church whereof see before chapter 16.113,14.]
\p
\v 20 . And the beast was taken [namely by Christ power and that alive as is expressed in the sequel ] and with it the false prophets that had wrought miracles in his presence whereby he had seduced them that had received the mark of the beast and that worshipped his image these two were cast alive into the like of fire that burneth with brimstone.
\p
\v 21 . And the rest wee slain with sword of him that sat upon the horse [of the false prophet here mention see chapter 16.13 and by these two is meant the spiritual and temporal dominion of antichrist with all his mitered and armed which shall above all others and be punished by Christ with greatest forest punishments whereas others earthly and worldly man seduced by them shall also bear their punishment but lesser which is fitly expressed by these two sorts of killing by the lake of fire and by the sword se the like passage Matthew 5.22 that burneth with brimstone are added because brimstone giveth exceeding sharp and very piercing heat whereby the greatest torment of hell is represented ] which went out of his mount [that is by sentence or judgment which shall pass upon them whereof the angels shall be executioners Matthew 13.14 which shall be also eternal as was testified before chapter 14.9,10,11 and is also testified of all cursed ones Matthew 25.41] and all the fowls were testified with their flesh.
\c 20
\s And angel cometh own from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and bindeth Satan there a thousand years 4 the holy martyrs and hat they did not worship the beasts sit upon throne and reign with Christ a thousand years 5 but others abide in death 6 they are all pronounced blessed that have part in the first ressurection7 after the end of a thousand years Satan is loosed 8 and seduceth the nations again and stirred up God and Magog to the war 9 who compass the beloved city about but devoured by fire 10 and the devil is cast into the lake of fire a white throne is seen with a one throne thereon before whom heaven and earth flee away 12 the dead both small and great appear before God and every book are opened and everyman is judged according to his works 1 death and hell are cast into the lake of fire with all those that are not written in the book of life.
\p
\v 1 And [ this chapter is somewhat difficult to be understood and is diversely expounded by interpreters some conceive that whatsoever is related must yet all come to pass and tat after the ruin of the antichrist whereof was spoken in the two former chapters and that Satan shall be bound and the Jews be but then converted to Christ and that the true church of Christ shall be in great reputation glorious peace and prosperity reign over all nations of the world and for the space of a thousand years in the beginning of which thousand years all the martyrs shall arise from the dead and join themselves unto this church or be taken unto heaven unto Christ till after thousand years Satan being again loosed the rest of the unbelieving nations which are understood by Gog and Magog should again make war against them but that Christ then coming to judgment shall fully deliver his church and cast Satan with all his ministers for ever into the lake of fire this opinion is very ancient yea among many of the ancient fathers and is again renewed by some teachers even in those days because it seemeth that the letter of this chapter doth import the same but when all things are well considered it can stand with the constant sense and meaning of the word of God and that for this reason first because it was shewed in the former chapter verse 19,20 and is also proved out of 2Thessalonians 1.8 that antichrist and his kingdom shall not be utterly abolished but at last coming of Christ to judgment secondly because the conversion of the coming of the Jews coming to pass according to Paul’s predictions Romans 11 chapter and 2 Corinthians 3.16 and no where such condition of the church is promised which should be without affliction combat the persecution throughout the whole world as was proved before chapter 19 verse 11 for it remaineth ever true that which Paul saith 2Timothy 3.12 all that will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution and especially about the end of the world concerning which Christ saith Luke 18.8 but the son of men when he cometh shall he also find faith upon the earth? And that which Paul saith 2Timothy 3.1 in the last days shall arise grievous times thirdly because it is repugnant to the article of the resurrection of the dead that so many million of martyrs as have been in the world should only arise in the beginning o these thousand years and should still live in this world as some conceive of them saith the scripture everywhere testifieth that all the dead shall arise at once and not before the last day see hereof John 5 verse 28 and 6.44 and 11.24 see also 1 Corinthians 15.52 1 Thessalonians 4.16 and hereafter in the chapter verse 12,13 for these and such like reasons must this chapter be understood after another manner as in the exposition shall be shewed ] I saw an angel come down from the heaven [ by this angels is meant the angel Michael that is Christ himself as was also noted on chapter 12.1 in the beginning of the combat against the dragon who there is cast unto the earth and now bound fast in the bottomless pit. whereof see the exposition] having the key of the bottomless pit which is also peculiarly ascribed unto Christ chapter 1 verse 18 as the sovereign of the lord of this key which key antichrist also asurpeth chapter 9.1 but by the just judgment of God who sent a spirit o error upon disobedient men 2Thessalonians 2 verse 10,11]and a great chain in his hand [hereby is meant the power of Christ death whereby all Satan strength and power is taken from him Colossians 2.15 Hebrews 2.14 as also the power of Christ spirit and word whereby Satan hands and feet are as it were bound so as that he cannot hurt the elect see Luke 11.22 Ephesians 1.21,22 yea neither other man also any further then the chain of Gods providence and judgment upon men and suffereth to do as the example of Achab 1 Kings 22 and other places testify.
\p
\v 2 . And he laid hold o the dragon [of this name and other following titles of Satan see chapter 12.3,9 and this chapter is not unfitly joined and compared by some with the same 12 chapter for in regard that there is described the battle of the dragon against Christ and his church and in the interim in some chapters the whole history of the antichrist and his ruin is related the holy ghost cometh now again n this chapter and related in brief the whole event of this battle of the dragon himself against Christ and his church even while the time of the antichrist lasted until he was cast by the antichrist into the lake of fire forever] the old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years.
\p
\v 3 . And cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him therein and sealed it upon him [namely the door of the bottomless pit for security tat he should be fain to abide there all that while see the like Daniel 6.18 Matthew 27.66 in the example of Daniel’s den and Christ’s sepulcher] that he should seduce the nation no more [namely as he had done before almost throughout the whole world when he had seduced the gentiles to worship him 1 Corinthians 10.20 otherwise Satan’s power continueth forever over the children of disobedience 2 Corinthians 4 verse 4 ] till the thousand years should be ended [some take these thousand years for the first coming of Christ unto his second coming saw this word thousand signifieth sometimes in scripture a certain number for an uncertain see Psalms 91.7 and 105.8 Daniel 7.10 but for as much as verse 7 and 8 Satan is let loose again after those thousand years the same can not well stand as neither of opinion of some and others which will end these thousand years before the coming of the antichrist seeing in 4 verse even during these thousand years mention is made of some that did not worship the beast nor his mage antichrist then must also need have been before the thousand years therefore others begin the beginning of Satan that should seduce the nations no more from time that Christ by the preaching of the gospel and the power of his spirit by his apostle brought the heathenish nations in the world everywhere to repentance which for the most part was fulfilled by the time of the desolation of Jerusalem & destruction of the Jews that is about the seventy years and end them with the time of pope Gregory the seventh who was a strong instrument of the devil to bring antichrist kingdom to the height and to cause all nations to worship him who sat in the chair about 1070 though some by reason of the persecutions which Satan yet more that two hundred and fifty years after the destruction of Jerusalem raised against the Christians begin these thousand years some what later namely from Constantine time and continue then till the year 1300 when the antichrist caused the state of Christian more and more to decline when Boniface the eight reigned over this kingdom but also the Turks and Tartars were most set on by Satan to subdue the Christians in the east and west and destroyed many kingdoms and Christian churches not only in Asia but also in Africa and Europe as the present condition thereof sheweth] and after that he must be loosed [namely not in respect of Christ power as if he were not able to keep him and were bound but in respect of God’s providence who for the punishment of the thankful world shall after that let him loose again and give him more liberty ] a little season [this may be understood either in respect of the former thousand years and time of the world or respect of the future state of the Christ church in heaven whereof shall be prophesied in the next chapter forasmuch as also the very whole time of Christ’s first coming unto his last coming is in scripture called the last day or the last hour.]
\p
\v 4 . And I saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgments was given unto them [some take this fasting upon thrones and giving upon judgments to be meant of the resurrection of Christ’s kingdom even in the time of the antichrist whereof is spoken immediately in which time also some eminent men arose which condemned the doctrine of the antichrist and opposed both the kingdoms and doctrines of whom was also prophesied chapter 11 and 14 but others take this here most fitly of those persons o whom there is spoken immediately namely which were beheaded for the testimony of Christ and which did not worship the beast which after their death are here in the thrones and receive judgment because according to their souls they triumphed with Christ in heaven not withstanding that earthly men and worshipers of the beast had condemned them as heretics and dammed them see the like promise before chapter 3.21 and Matthew 19.8] and I saw the souls of tem that were beheaded [Gr killed with the axe ] for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God and which had not worshipped the beast neither his image and which had not received his mark upon their forehead nor on their hand and they lived and reigned as kings with Christ with thousand years [namely and forever after for he that reigneth with Christ in heaven is never cast out see before chapter 3..12.]
\p
\v 5 . But the rest of the dead[that is such as were dead in their sins and superstitions as this word dead is also taken Matthew 8.22 John 5.25 1Timothy 5.6] wee not made alive again [that is did not arise from their sins or did not repent as is said in like case chapter 9.20] until the thousand years were finished [that is even not the time that Satan was bound therefore much less after when Satan was let loose this is the first resurrection [namely from the death of sin as the fall into sin is the first death and the first dying of men in the spirit see the like phrase John 5.25 Colossians 3.1 Ephesians 2.5 and 5.14.]
\p
\v 6 . Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection[that is he that is partaker of the first resurrection as this phrase is also taken John 13.8 Acts 8.21] on these the second death had no power [his second death is deathly eternal as is expressed declared hereafter verse 14 and hence also appeareth that this resurrection is not a corporal but a spiritual resurrection seeing that many shall also according to the arising unto destruction see Daniel 12.2 John5.29 ] but they shall be priest of God of Christ [see hereof as also of the following word kings the exposition of chapter 1.6 and 5.10 ] and they shall reign with him as king as thousand years.
\p
\v 7 . And when the thousand years shall be finished [see the annotate before on verse 3] Satan shall be loosed out of his prison [Gr ward]
\p
\v 8 . And he shall go out [namely out of the bottomless pit wherein he was bound before to join with antichrist to whom he had surrendered his power who had alone for a while afflicted the church of Christ] to seduce the nations [many understand this of spiritual seducing whereby whole nations are more and more brought to new idolatry and heathenish superstitions though under another title see also chapter 9.20 &c.] which are in the four corners of the earth [that is in the whole world or in all countries of the world for few or not any whole nation in the east or west hath been quiet free from the seducement in the time that Satan was let loose again ] Gog and Magog to gather them together at the war [some understand by these two nation the same nations that are named in the former clause but it seemeth not that all nations in the four corners of the world can be called here Gog and Magog but only that they are part of those nations of the earth which besides that they were seduced by the dragon in the matters of religion in their own destruction on the were also seduced and set by him to this war which is related in the text now who this Gog and Magog is thereabout are sundry opinion but their opinion agreeth best with the ting itself and with the place in Ezekiel 38 and 39 chapter that say that as God by Ezekiel foretelleth the people of Israel whom h had promised to deliver out of Babylon what troubles should afterwards befall in the whole land by the neighboring heathen of Asia ,Syria, and Egypt which by Ezekiel is called Gog and Magog before Christ should be manifested in the flesh out of which God would and did miraculously deliver them as we may read the first and second book of the Machabees so likewise after the expiration of the thousand years and the oozing of Satan before the second coming of Christ the Turk, Tartars and Sarasins that for the most part have their habitations in the most quarters of Gog and Magog with the remnant of the antichrist kingdom should set upon Christendom and afflict with grievous wars out of which God would miraculously deliver them and those nations should also by length also by the second coming of Christ by vanquished or subdued ] whose number is as the sand of the sea[see hereof further chapter 9.16 and so forth.]
\p
\v 9 . And they went upon on the breadeth of the earth and compassed the camping place of the saints about and the beloved city [so the Christendom called because God hath al time times had and will have to the end of the world his saints and the marked ones in it though much corruption hath been in the worship and manner of many as the people of Israel were continual called the people of God and the city of Jerusalem the holy city even when they wee exceeding corrupt in these things see Isaiah 1.3 ,21 Matthew 4.5 Luke 19.46] and there came fire down from heaven and devoured them [this may in a sort be understood of extraordinary helps which God afforded the Christian against the Turks and Tartars as is to be hoped is still hold unto them as the phrase still afford unto them as the like phrase is used concerning Gog and Magog Ezekiel 38.22 but it may also be understood of the last violence of these such like nations which they the antichrist shall offer to destroy Christendom utterly before the as the day as when Christ before the last coming shall upon them unaware as was prophesied before of the antichrist army chapter 19.20 and this is also confirmed by the following verses.]
\p
\v 10 . And the devil that seduceth them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone [that is into hell to remain there forever see also chapter 19.20 Matthew 25.41 1Corinthians 15.24] where the beast and the false prophet is and they shall be tormented day and night forever more.
\p
\v 11 . And I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it [ as the former vision ended with the last day so doth this vision also end in it he that is seen here is Christ the judge o quick and dead who will set up his judgment seat in the clouds as himself testifieth Matthew 25.21 see also Acts 17.31] from whose face [that s majesty and glory ] the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no pace for them [see the like phrase chapter 6.14 and 16.20 whereby the ruin and alteration of the heaven and the earth now are is signified whereof see further divers exposition in the annotate on 2Peter 3.10.]
\p
\v 12 . and I saw the dead small and great [that is of all condition and degree though some do understand this also of this age and stature that which is here imperfect shall be then made perfect 1 Corinthians 13.10] standing before God [that is standing before the throne or judgment seat of Christ 2 Corinthians 5.10 whence it appeareth that Christ is also true God ] and the books were opened [namely of God omniscience and providence wherein all men’s actions both omission and commissions are set down see the like Daniel 7.10 Matthew 3.16 and it is a similitude taken from the judgment of men and practice of princes where notice or knowledge of all things is kept and recorded see Ephesians 6.1 others understand it of the book of every man’s conscience which is also true sith the same also will either accuse or execute itself before that day see Romans 2.15,16] and another book was opened which is the book of life [that is of God’s gracious eternal election of life see of the same also chapter 3.5 and 13.8 and 17.8 ] and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the book according to their works [which they have done in this life whether good or evil as Paul addeth 2 Corinthians 5.10 whereof see there the exposition.]
\p
\v 13 . And the sea gave up the dead which in it and the death and hell [or the grave ] delivered up the dead which were in them [by the word hell is understood by many the grave and by the word death all the places where the dead bodies might be scattered as the fire the air the fowls and the cruel beasts have devoured many bodies which shall all by the power shall be brought to light where so ever there may be tat created all things out of nothing will be able easily to gather together all the bodies of men that ever where in the world with the elements of the world ] and they wee judged every man according to their works.
\p
\v 14 . And the death and hell were cast into the lake of fire [this is understood either of the devil who had power of the death Heb 2.14 or by an improper phrase whatsoever is any grievous or painful which shall be removed out of the world and shall be nowhere found after that time but in the everlasting lake of that fire ] this is the second death of sin when men do not repent of it.]
\p
\v 15 . And if any man was not found written in the book of life [see above verse 12] the same was cat into the lake o fire.
\c 21
\s John seeth a new heaven a new earth 2 with the new Jerusalem adorned as the bride of Christ 3 he heareth a voice from heaven whereby God promiseth that he will be their God wipe away all their tears from their eyes and give them the inheritance of all things 8 out threateneth that the fearful and other impenitent sinners shall have portion in the lake of fire one of the angels of those vials carrieth John up into the high mountains and sheweth him more clearly the whole form of the new Jerusalem 11 her glory 12 her wall with twelve gates according to the names of the children of Israel 14 her twelve foundation according to the names of the twelve apostle 16 her length and breadeth 18 her materials of Gold 19 twelve foundation of twelve precious stones 21 gates of twelve pearls 22 her temple God himself and the lamb 23 God glory instead of sun and moon 24 her inhabitation all blessed people yea even the blessed king 25 her gates always open 27 that no man that commiteth uncleanness entereth into it.
\p
\v 1 And I saw [namely after the last judgment was held whereof was spoken in the end of the former chapter] a new heaven and a new earth [that is renewed heaven and earth as is further noted 2Peter 3.10 some expositors understand this also a new condition of the Jews whereof more was spoken in the former chapter but this opinion is confuted and that is spoken of the triumphant church of Jesus Christ in heaven and of the condition thereof at the last judgment will sufficiently appear at the last exposition especially by the 4 verse and the 22 and the following verse which can not be applied to the estate of the church of Christ in the world as also almost orthodox interpreters expound it so]for the first heaven and the first earth was passed away [namely in respect of their present state and for as much as it serveth the use of men which lead there a natural life and in respect of the amity which is in subject to for men’s sins see Romans 8.19etc.] and there was no more sea [ some conceive here that the sea shall be consumed and dried up by the fire seeing there shall be no more use of it but that heaven and earth renewed and glorified shall always to be a common habitation of holy angels and blessed men as it also at present the angels do sometimes appear upon the earth though the heaven be their proper habitation this is an uncertain opinion.]
\p
\v 2 . And I John saw the holy city and the new Jerusalem [though the church of Christ in general b also sometime so called as appeareth Galatians 4.26 Hebrews 12.22 because Jerusalem was a type and figure thereof yet hereby the triumphant church of Christ and the place of her habitation is so called because then that shall be perfected in her which was begun in her in this world see 132.14] coming down from God out of heaven [not that the habitation of the blessed saints shall be hereafter out o heaven for the contrary is testified John 14.2 ,3 Philippians 3.20 1 Thessalonians 4.17 but this is said of a type of the vision which John saw thereof in respect of the power whereby all this was effected and wrought see Hebrews 11.10 and Revelations 13.12] prepared as a bride that is adorned of her husband [namely was said in the former 19 chapter verse 7 that she prepared herself as a bride namely against the coming of Christ so its she said here that she was always prepared that is fully adorned and glorified to remain united forever with Christ her bridegroom see Ephesians 5.27.]
\p
\v 3 . And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God [that is the habitation of God ] is with men and he will dwell with them [namely not only by his grace and spirit as is also done here on earth in hi church John 14.23 2 Corinthians 6.10 but also by his perfect glory and joy he shall be all in all 1 Corinthians 15.28 a figurative phrase taken from the pattern of the Tabernacle in the old testament see Leviticus 26.11] and they shall b his people and Go himself with them and be their God [namely who shall deliver them from all evil and because them to bound with al good both in body and soul see Corinthians 2.9 and 13.12 and 15.43 2 Corinthians 2.9 and 13.12 and 15.43 2 Corinthians 3.18 Philippians 3. Verse 21.]
\p
\v 4 . And God shall wipe off all tears from their eyes [see Isaiah 25.8 and above chapter 7.17] and death shall b no more [ namely among those that dwell in the heavenly Jerusalem otherwise death remianeth forever in the lake of fire whereunto it was cast before chapter 20.14] neither mourning nor crying neither shall there be any more trouble [or labor] for former things [namely crosses and afflictions incident to believers and all other miseries and troubles of the present ] are passed away.
\p
\v 5 . And he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me writ for these things are true and faithful .
\p
\v 6 . And he said unto me [it is come to pass or it hath been it is done that is al things are fulfilled that were foretold by the prophet in the old and by the apostle in the new see chapter 16.17] I am alpha and omega the beginning and the end [see before chapter 18] I will give unto the thirsty of the well of the waters of life [John took this place out of the words of Christ in his gospel chapter 7.37 whereof see there] for naught [that is o free grace without any merits of theirs Ephesians 2.8.]
\p
\v 7 . He that overcometh shall inherit all things [that is the fullness of eternal and spiritual riches both in soul and body see Romans 8 verse 17,29 1 John3.2] and I will be a God unto him and he shall be a son unto me.
\p
\v 8 . But the fearful [these are here opposed to them of whom is said in the former verse that they overcame namely valiantly steadfastly all troubles that befell them for the profession of the gospel see Romans 8.37these fearful ones then are those that through fear fall away in the times of persecution and affliction Matthew 13.21] and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and isolators and all liars their part is in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death [see chapter 20.14.]
\p
\v 9 . And there came unto me the seven angels [namely that had carried John into the wilderness before chapter 17.3 and shewed him the judgment of the great whore who now sheweth him Christ’s and heavenly Jerusalem as followeth as the end of all visions]which had the seven vials which had been full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come with me hither I will shew ye thee the bride the lambs wife[that is glorified church of Christ with her dwelling places see before chapter 19.7 whence it appeareth that in this vision there is not only shewed the glory o the place where the elect shall always rejoice with Christ but also especially the glory of the church of Christ itself with her properties as she shall be hereafter in heaven.]
\p
\v 10 . And he carried me away in the spirit [that is in a trance or in a vision see chapter 1.10] to a great and high mountain [namely that he might be better able to view from thence this heaven Jerusalem whereof in the sequel with all its situation as from the top of the mountain Sion the city of Jerusalem which was a type hereof could b most conveniently beheld Psalms 24.3 and Isaiah 2.2 etc.] and he shewed me the great city and the holy Jerusalem descending out of heaven from God [see before the annotations on verse 2.]
\p
\v 11 . And it had the glory of God [namely which shined upon it and glorified it as God himself is said to possess an inaccessible light 1Timothy 6.16] and her light [ or shining ] was like unto the most precious stone namely like the jasper stone shining as the crystal.
\p
\v 12 . And had a great high wall [hereby is signified the invincible strength and safety of the glorified church of God in heaven who by his omnipotence is and will ever remain as a strong wall bout it see Zach. 2.5 Matthew 15.18] and had twelve gates [ namely at each side three gates as is shewed in the sequel whereby is signified that all believers from all quarters of the world shall have access unto this city as Christ also speaketh Matthew 8.11] and at the gates twelve angels [namely to be faithful watchmen to wit the naught might go out or into this city but that which was clean and pertained to it as is shewed hereafter in the 27 verse as is also related of the entrance in paradise Genesis 3.24] and names written thereon which are the names of the twelve families [or tribes] of the children of Israel [namely of the children of God chosen and gathered together out of families of the earth see Romans 11.26 and above chapter 7.4.]
\p
\v 13 . On the east were three gates on the north three gates in the south three gates on the west three gates [this hath not respect to the outward Jerusalem which on one side had no gates seeing it lay upon on steep place but either to the Jerusalem of the new testament which Ezekiel also saw after that manner but in a lesser proportion chapter 48.31 or also the camp of the Israelites in the wilderness which lay foursquare and had a gate for every tribe see Numbers 2.2 etc.]
\p
\v 14 . And the wall of the city had twelve foundations [namely of precious stones fitly laid upon or next tone another as is shewed verse 19 and 20 whereby is signified the doctrine of the twelve apostles whose outermost cornerstone is Jesus Christ upon whom this church of Christ here is built and shall remain rebuilt forever as Paul testified Ephesians 2.20 ] and in them the names o the twelve apostles of the lamb [a similitude as it seemeth taken from the practice of the workmen in great buildings which for a memorial are wont to engrave or carve their names upon the corner stones so is here spoken of the twelve apostles because all of them built on this city and laid no other foundation but Jesus Christ but in a different measure and luster as these precious stones are a luster and as Paul also speaketh of himself and others 1Corinthians 3.10,11.]
\p
\v 15 . And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure and the gates thereof and the walls thereof[this hath respect to Ezekiel 40.3 where the like measure of the new Jerusalem and of the temple is taken to shew that all things are here done according to Gods ordering and disposing.]
\p
\v 16 . And the city lay four square [Gr. lieth four corners this is said so because this figure of all others is t strongest and most moveable ] and the length thereof was as great as the breath thereof and he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand furlongs [eight furlongs making an Italian mile and three Italian miles one league whereby is signified that the church of Christ in heaven shall exceeding great and yet so as that her proper habitation as an heavenly paradise shall be and continuous severed from other places .]
\p
\v 17 . And he measured the wall thereof [that is the height of that wall ]and hundred forty and four ells [Gr. cubits taken from geometrical foot and a half making together two hundred an sixteen geometrical feet a great height arising from twelve times twelve multiplied together a four square number according to the number of the twelve apostles and of the twelve tribes of Israel here named whereby is signified not only the fruitfulness the signification and multiplication of he members of Christ by the doctrine of the apostles but also the ability and stability and safety of this church in heaven ] according to the measure of men which was of the angel [that is which a man is wont to use in whose shape the angel here appeared unto John.]
\p
\v 18 . And the building of the wall of it was jasper and the city was pure gold being like unto pyre glass [earthly gold is not in itself transparent but only bright and pure but this gold hath moreover the property of pure glass and is joined to the jasper and other precious stones which are related one after another to intimate thereby that all the parts of the heavenly Jerusalem both within and without all the inhabitants thereof shall be very most pure most glorious most holy and most acceptable before God and among themselves according to the gift measure of Christ .]

\v 19 . And the foundation of the wall of the city [namely whereon the wall was founded whereof see before verse 14] where adorned all manner of precious stones the first foundation was jasper the second Saphir the third Chalcedony and the fourth emerald.
\p
\v 20 . The fifth Sardonix the sixth Sadius the seventh Chrysolite the eight Beryl the ninth Topas the tenth Crysophasas the eleventh Jacinth the twelveth Amethyst.
\p
\v 21 . And the twelve gates were twelve pearls [these gates are said to be twelve according to the number of the twelve tribes of Israel as was shewed verse 12 and thereby may fitly be understood the multitude of all faithful teachers and other leaders of the church which like pearls surpass the common gold thereby as God instrument according to the example of the twelve apostles the true Israelites both of the old and the new testament always came to the fellowship of the church of Christ see 1 Corinthians 3.8] every gate was each of one pearl and the street city was pure gold like transparent glass [the streets or the markets the plains whereby is ordinarily understood that place of the city where the meeting so f the citizens and the courts of justice are kept which is also said to be the pure gold and transparent like glass because all will go peaceable uprightly and without any difference among the members of the church .]
\p
\v 22 . For I saw the temple therein for the Lord almighty God is the temple is the temple thereof [ I saw no temple namely no outward temple or temple ornament as the outward Jerusalem had adorned also with gold and precious stones for this served as a good figure o the things to come or it saved also the preaching of the word of God the administration of the sacraments the sacraments and the performance o such like divine worships and service therein all which tings shall then cease when they shall be all taught of God alone Jeremiah 31.34 and when he himself shall be all in all ] and the lamb [that is Christ himself whom as the true God with the father and the holy ghost will glorify his church and be all in all.]
\p
\v 23 . and the city hath no need of the sun neither o the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the candle thereof [this city hath no need of either sun nor moon namely to measure thereby the difference of the days and times sith there shall be no night but an everlasting light as the next verse declareth neither to lighten us outwardly forasmuch as Gods glory and his inaccessible light which he inhabiteth will darken all other lights and this place hath respect to Isaiah 60.19 where the like I prophesied not only of the times of the new testament compared with the times of the old testament but especially of the fulfilling which shall be done hereafter.]
\p
\v 24 . And the nations which are saved shall walk in the light of it [that is shall also be partakers of the glory of the whole church as Christ saith Matthew 8.11 that they shall sit down with Abraham , Isaac and Jacob in he kingdom of God ] and the kings of the earth [namely that are become believers] do bring their glory and honor unto it these words are also taken out of Isaiah 60.3 not that this kingly power shall continue therefore the contrary is testifieth by Paul 1Corinthians 15.24 but that even kings tat there were here n great glory shall also have their portion in the glory of this church in such measure as God shall please to communicate unto them .]
\p
\v 25 . And the gates hereof shall not be shut by day [this phrase is also taken out of Isaiah 60.11 and signified and all the elect shall always have access thither and shall be such peace and quietness that they need not to fear their enemies nor anything that may hurt either them and theirs] for there shall be no night.
\p
\v 26 . And they shall bring glory and honor of the nations into it [see before verse 24.]
\p
\v 27 . And there shall no enter into anything that defileth [or commiteth uncleanness as Paul also declareth 1 Corinthians 6.9] or commiteth abominations or speaketh a lie but they which are written in the lambs book of life [that is they which from eternity were freely chosen thereunto and were in the efficaciously called and brought unto it see Romans 8.29,30 and Revelations 13.8.]
\c 22
\s There is further shewed unto the apostle the river of life on the bank whereof the tree o life was planted 3 some other properties of the inhabitants of the new Jerusalem are described 6 after which the conclusion is made with a testification of the truth ad certainty of these visions and prophesies 8 John falleth down again before the angel of his feet and reproved for it the second time 10 after which he received a charge that he shall not seal the words of the book though some will abuse them to their sorer punishments 13 Christ declareth that he is the alpha and omega and pronounceth them blessed that keep his commandments and them cursed that commit abominations 16 and testifieth that he sent his angels of reveal these things unto his church 17 the pride of Christ longeth for his coming 18 after which this revelation is shut up with a threatening against those that should add anything unto and take away ought from these things 20 Christ testifieth that he will come quickly and John closeth all with an apostolic salutation.
\p
\v 1 And shewed me a pure river of life clear as Chrystal [that which is related here of this river and of the tree of life in the next verse is by way of comparison taken from paradise Genesis 2.10 and from new Jerusalem Ezekiel 47.1 etc and by this river of life this water is understood everlasting bliss which by reason operation of the holy ghost and the vision of the Gods face by the elect in the life to come shall be and always in abundance fresh and pure so here also John 4.14 and 7.38 and before chapter 2.7] proceeding out of the throne of God and of the lamb ]that is out of glorious vision of the face of God and of Jesus Christ see Psalms 16.11 1 Corinthians 13.12 1Thessalonians 4.17 1John 3.2.]
\p
\v 2 . In the midst of the street [or plain market as chapter 21.21] of it and on the one and other side of the river was the tree [Gr. the wood ] of life [ not that were many trees seen for Christ alone is this tree of life but that her roots downwards and her branches upwards spread themselves all along that whole river as appeareth before chapter 2.7 whereof see also there the further explanation ] bringing forth twelve fruits yielding her fruits from month to month [that is the quickening virtue of Christ spirits which is vigorous and efficacious throughout the whole year that is forever and ever to preserve always the spiritual life and this blessed threshing of the twelve tribes of the Israel of God without any weakening or enfeebling] and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the gentiles [namely that were saved as was said before chapter 21.24,26 this last clause is also taken out of Ezekiel 47.12 not that there shall be any infirmities anymore in this life everlasting but that the healing of all infirmities which was wrought here by the merits and the spirits of Christ shall be there by the same power forever kept and preserve inviolate not only for Israelites but also for all believing nations.]
\p
\v 3 . And there shall be no more curse [or banning ] against any man [that is nothing worthy of a curse chapter 21.17 no unclean things or that worketh uncleanness and this seemeth also to be taken out of Zach chapter 14.11 where this is also foretold of the times of the new testament which notwithstanding should be fully accomplished until Christ should have purged his threshing floor and cast all his chaff into the fire Matthew 3.12 an 13.40 etc.] and the throne of God and of the lamb shall be in it [that is the glory of God and of Jesus Christ as true God and men shall fill it see chapter 3 verse 21,23] and his servants [namely both angels and blessed men see chapter 7.15] shall serve him [that is stand around about his throne ready to praise and magnify him and to obey his commandments.]
\p
\v 4 . And shall see his face [that is his majesty and glory to be partakers thereof as is said of angels Matthew 18.10 and all the blessed ones in heaven Matthew 5.8 1John 3.2 ] and his name shall be on their foreheads [namely as belonging and appertaining unto him and making open possession thereof as the high priest also in the old testament did wear a plate of gold on his forehead whereupon was written the holiness of the Lord see hereof further exposition chapter 3.12 and 14.1.]
\p
\v 5 . And there shall be no night there and they shall need no candle neither light of the sun for the Lord God lighten them [see chapter 21.23,25] and they shall reign as kings [for though all believers are also kings and priests here Revelations 1.6 yet they shall reign only as kings then when all their enemies and death itself are put under their feet and when God shall be all in them see Romans 16.20 and 1Corinthians 15.28] forever and ever [Heb. in eternities of eternities.]
\p
\v 6 . And he said unto me those words [namely the words of the whole revelation as is declared hereafter verse 18.19 ] are faithful and true [whereby the divinity of them is testified see also before chapter 19.9 in this verse beginneth the conclusion or last part of this revelation ] and the Lord the God of holy prophets sent his angels [ that is me who am his angel ] to shew unto his servants things that must quickly be done[ see hereof the annotate on chapter 1.1 the God of the holy prophets that is that revealed prophecies unto the prophets and that sent them unto his people 2Peter 1.20 etc. by which God of the prophets is here meant the person of Christ to shew things which must shortly be done which is expressly ascribed unto Christ chapter 1.1 and below verse 16.]
\p
\v 7 . Behold I come quickly [namely to reward every man according to his works as is expressed verse 12 and these words are the words of Christ which confirm that which was said in the former verse see also 1Thessalonians 5.2] blessed is he that keepeth the words of the prophecy in this book [that is that given diligently heed thereunto and abstaineth from things that are forbidden therein namely from having fellowship with the dragon and the beasts and his adherents and followeth after the things are therein commanded see also chapter 1.3.]
\p
\v 8 . And I John am he that saw and heard these things [thus doth John also confirm his gospel in the close of it John 19.35 and 21.24 and this is also next unto others a fit proof that the evangelist John is the author of the prophesy [and when I had heard and seen them I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed these things [see hereof that which was noted chapter 19.10.]
\p
\v 9 . An he said unto me see thou do it not for I am the fellow servant and of thy brethren the prophet and of them that keep the word of the book worship God.
\p
\v 10 And he said unto me seal not the prophecies of this book for the time is at hand [that is shut them not up keep them not secret but reveal them before all otherwise then is commanded before chapter 10.4 as also Daniel 8.26 and 12.4 the reason is because the things that were revealed there might be kept secret for a while without prejudice to the church of God till the accomplishment should tell us the exposition thereof but not so here because the accomplishment of some thing should begin forthwith as that which was taught chapter 2 and 3 and because the church of Christ ought to be straightway informed and warned of all those troubles that should come upon them that they might be better in time arm themselves against them and that the members thereof might take heed of having fellowship and communion with anti-Christ when they should perceive his rising the mystery whereof began to work already at that very time 2 Thessalonians 2.7.]
\p
\v 11 . he that doth wrong let him do wrong still [hereby an objection is prevented which might be made upon the former verse namely that some would abuse his Revelations if it were made known to everyone to carnal security or to provocation against the church of Christ whereupon this answer followeth as Ezekiel 2.3 and Daniel 12.10 by which phrase no permission of being evil is signified but a sorer judgment of God against such is threatened as Christ also said unto Judas John 13.27 that thou dost quickly see 2 Corinthians 2.15] and he that is righteous let him be justified still [that is he that is righteous let him be more and more shew his righteousness by the fruits of it as is declared James 2.18 and 24 for the word justified is here opposed in doing wrong as the word being holy to the word being filthy.]
\p
\v 12 . And behold I come quickly [from this place and so onto the middle of this 20 verse Christ himself beginneth to speak unto the words of the apostle as all circumstance and the 16 verse plainly imports and he doth clearly before by the angel ] and my reward is with me to recompense unto every man as his works shall be [namely whether it be good or evil as before was often promised and threatened see 2 Corinthians 5.10 whereby is signified not any merit but gracious rewarding of good works and just punishments and recompense of evil works see Romans 6.23Ephesians 2.8 etc. compare Psalms 62.13 Jeremiah 17.10 and 32.19 Matthew 16.27 Romans 2.6 and 14.12 1Corinthians 3.8 2 Corinthians 5.10 Galatians 6.5 Revelations 2.23.]
\p
\v 13 . I am the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end the first and the last [thus Christ speaketh of himself as the only and eternal God with the holy ghost to signify his stability and omnipotence in the executing of his promises and threatening see hereof chapter 1.8 and 21.6 also Isaiah 41.4 and 44.6 and 48.12.]
\p
\v 14 Blessed are they that do his commandments that their power may be in the trees of life [that is right lot portion that they may enjoy the fruits of the tree o life whereof see verse 2] and that they may enter in though through the gates in the city [namely of the new and heavenly Jerusalem which was described before.]
\p
\v 15 . But without [ namely without the heavenly Jerusalem in the lake of fire into which by Gods just judgments they are cast forever see chapter 19.15 and 21.8] shall be dogs [ that is raging enemies and barkers against Christ and the gospel of Christ as calleth upon them Matthew 7.6 or those that having once made profession of the truth turn again to their own vomit as Peter also called such king of persons dogs 2Peter 2.22] and sorcerers [or prisoners for the Greek word signifieth both ] and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters and everyone that loveth and maketh a lie [ namely whether it be against the third or against the ninth commandment whereby are meant all perjured persons unfaithful ones double dealing men and deceivers of their neighbor.]
\p
\v 16 . I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches [namely unto the angels or shepherds and overseers of seven churches and by you unto your churches and consequently to all others pastors and churches in the world see chapter 1.11 and 2.1 &c.] I am the root and the generation of David [see before chapter 5.5 Isaiah 11.10 Romans 15.10 an Christ is so called in respect of his human nature which descended from David Matthew 1.1 Romans 1.3 ] the bright morning star [namely which exceedeth all other stars in light of the world and by his knowledge enlighteneth all men to salvation see John 1.9 and 8.12 yea also in respect of the heavenly Jerusalem where there shall be neither sun nor moon but the night of the age being past Christ with the father and the holy ghost will be the perfect light of all the elect as the morning star is in the morning see above chapter 2.28 and chapter 21.23 2Peter 1.19.]
\p
\v 17 . And the spirit and the bride say come [that is the spirit stirreth hearts of all believers such motions and prayers with groans and unutterable as Paul speaketh Romans 8.23,26 and the bride that is the whole church of Christ yea even they that in soul triumph in heaven wish and long for this last coming to be united and glorified with Christ both in soul and body see 21.28 Revelations 6.10,11] and let him that heareth it [namely with a believing heart ] say come and let him that is athirst [that is that earnestly and with a sense and feeling of his own infirmity longeth after this [come and let him that will namely by the grace of the holy ghost who worketh in us both to will and to do Philippians 2.13 that is everyone that hath a desire to it ]take the water of life [that is be partakers of the heavenly grace comfort according to grace laid down before chapter 21.6] for naught [that is freely only by virtue of Christ merit and intercession see Isaiah 55.1 Romans 3.24,25 Ephesians 2.8.]
\p
\v 18 . For I testify to every man that heareth the words of the prophesy of this book if any man ad unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written unto this book .
\p
\v 19 . And if any man take away from the book of this prophesy God shall take away his part out of the book of life [namely which he may imagine to have for that none of those that are truly written in the book of life are blotted out appeareth before chapter 13.8 and 21.27] and out of the holy city [namely of he heavenly Jerusalem as before verse 14 ]and from the things which are written in this book[ this is the last feeling of the divinity of this book joined with a threatening of Christ against those that shall add anything unto or take anything away from this book this is not only a sealing of this book but also a close of the whole scripture forasmuch as John was and wrote the last of the apostles as also the like close is seen in this gospel John 20 verse 30,31 &21.24 and Moses before him had laid down in his book such like prohibition of not adding or taking away ought namely by any human authority Deuteronomy 4.2 and 12.32.]
\p
\v 20 . He which testifieth these things saith ye I come quickly [namely Jesus Christ saith so as appeareth out of verse 16 and from the words themselves which belong not to the angel but to Christ ] Amen yea come Lord Jesus [these are words of John who being now come to the words of extreme age doth also testify to his longing for the coming of Christ and for the redemption and glorification of all believers.]
\p
\v 21 . And the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with ye all [this conclusion agreeth with the conclusion of almost all the epistle of the apostle because this prophesy was in manner and form of epistle directed to the churches to signify the sureness and certainty of al that was written and treated before according as in the former verse and the word Amen is made use of to the same end.
