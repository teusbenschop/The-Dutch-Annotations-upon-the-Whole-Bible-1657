\mt2 THE PROVERBS OF
\mt SOLOMON
\s The Argument of this BOOK
\p This Book containeth most excellent, holy, instructive Proverbs or Sentences, which King Salomon, by the instinct and inspiration of the Holy Ghost, (by whom he was indued with singular wisdom and knowledge both in Divine and Human matters,) uttered; and God of his good grace would have the same to be written and preserved for the common use and benefit of his church. The Argument or Contents, is, concerning the true wisdom and fear of the Lord, with all manner of effectual exhortations and persuasions to the performance of our duty, not onely toward God, but also toward our selves, and our neighbour, in what state or condition soever any one on earth may be in, with the promise of this present life, and that which is to come: Together with most faithful dehortations and warnings to abstain from all sins, vices and frailties, opposite to the first and second Table of Gods Law: especially, from whoredom and adultery. So that this Book is rightly held to be an overflowing Fountain of wholesome Doctrine, in all things requisite to a wise holy and well-pleasing frame of life and conversation, in all callings, both general and particular, private and public, and consequently, ought highly to be recommended unto all Christians, far above all that which hath been written by heathen Philosophers, or worldly-wise men, of wisdom and of the chiefest good, and of the vertues and vices. Concerning the connexion or coherence of these Proverbs; it seemeth that Salomon himself hath collected and joined together Sentences which are recorded after his instructive Preface or Introduction of the nine first Chapters, (which are full of the praise of heavenly wisdom in general, and of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, the eternal Wisdom, and Word of the Father, in particular) from the tenth Chapter to the five and twentieth: and that the following Proverbs, from the five and twentieth to the thirtieth Chapter, were by the command of that religious king Hizkia (when he reformed the decayed Kingdom, written out, and gathered out Solomons own, or other holy mens Records. In the Thirtieth Chapter, are contained the words of Agur. In the last, the doctrine of Salomons Mother, which he embraced, set down in writing, and left behind for the common instruction and edification of the Church God.

\s Of the profit and utility of these Proverbs, ver.1, etc. The duty of children to their Parents 8. An admonition to beware of the company of the wicked 11. The eternal wisdom it self is brought in, complaining that she is despised, exhorting to repentance, and threatening everlasting destruction to all disobedient ones, and promising assured happiness to the obedient, 20.
\p
\v 1 . The Proverbs, [See the Hebrew word, 1 King.4.on verse 32.] of Salomon the son of David King of Israel:
\p
\v 2 . To know wisdom, [Meaning a sure and grounded knowledge of Divine and Humane things how to order ones self aright, both in matter of faith and life. Compare 1 King 3.on verse 14.] and discipline; [meaning the instruction which is given, to attain unto wisdom] to understand the saying of understanding; [or, the words, or sayings, that are understandingly propounded. This understanding here spoken of is held to be the wisdom and prudence of the spirit, whereby wisdom is well managed, and employed to the right use or end. Compare 1 Kings 3.on verse 12.]
\p
\v 3 . To receive the instruction of good understanding; [To wit, whereby a man be come judicious, wise, intelligent, and prudent in all that may befall him, concerning below, Chapter 3.4. and 13.15. and chapter 21.16.] Justice, [understand hereby, the whole duty which we owe unto God, and our neighbour according to the direction of the first and second Table] and Right, [to wit, whereby we do and perform unto our neighbour, that which we are bound to do and perform unto him, according to the prescript and direction of the second Table properly] and Equities. [which must be upheld and kept in all dealings and differences with men according to the nature of love, and according as the thing it self requireth.]
\p
\v 4 . To give subtilty [This word here is taken in a good sence, for a quick, nimble, subtile, and sharp wit, or apprehension, as below, chap.8.verse 5.12. item, 19.25. Elsewhere it is taken in a bed sence, for craftiness, mischievousness, as Exod.21.14. Jos.9.4. Job 5.12. and 15.5.] to the simple, [this word is sometimes taken in a bad sence, for those who by reason of their dullness, stupidity and blockishness do easily believe, and suffer themselves easily to be turned aside, and to be missed out of the way that is good. See Job 5.on verse 2. So also v. Sometimes the Hebrew word is taken in a good sense, for those that are teachable, harmless, sincere, and down right, and would easily be deceived and hurt by the wicked, unless God, (in whom they trust) as a gracious Father, did keep and preserve them, Psalm 19.8. and 11.6.6. below chapter 19.25. Matth.10.16.] to the young man [both in years and in understanding] knowledge of the things that ought to be known: but also of the grounds and reasons thereof] and discretion. [that is, a wise and serious, or judicious consideration. [that is, a wise and serious, or judicious consideration, accompanied with a singular prudence. So below, Chapter 2.11. and 3.21. See Job 21. The Annotat.on v.27.]
\p
\v 5 . He that is wise will hear, and increase in learning; [See of the Hebrew word translated learning, Job chap.11.on verse 4. Or, will augment learning, or increase in apprehension. Compare below, chapter 9.9. Hebr. Properly add learning] and he that is of understanding, shall attain unto wise counsel: [Hebr. Wise counsels, in the plural number. See of this word, Job 37.on v.12.]
\p
\v 6 . To understand a Proverb, [See above on verse 1.] and the interpretation] to wit, of the same Proverb. Others, skilful sayings; that is apt or fit eloquence, to utter a mans words well] the words of the wise, and their riddles. [that is, their sayings, which have a hidden and deep sense or meaning. See Judg.14.on v.1.2. and 1 Kings 10.on vers.1.]
\p
\v 7 . The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: [that is, the ground and foundation of true wisdom, to wit, to obtain it fully; even as in the building of an house, the foundation is the beginning of the rest of the building, to finish and perfect it. See Psalm 11.on v.10. item, Job 28.28. Prov.9.10. Zech.12.15.] (but) fools [understand by those for the most part, men, that having drunk in false opinions, do not follow the right way of wisdom, and the fear of God. See Job 5.on v.2.] despise knowledge and instruction.
\p
\v 8 . My son, [So Salomon calleth all those that hear, or read his Doctrine, to shew that he doth not onely propound it with a fatherly mind and affection, but that they also ought to receive and entertain it with a child like and most obedient heart and inclination. So below, verse 10.15. and chap.2.1. and 3.1. etc. Compare Judg.17.on v.10. 1 Kings 2.on v.12. Psalm 34.on v.12.] hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the Dotrine [or Law, or Instruction. See below, Chapter 3.1. and 4.2. and 6.20.23. and 7.2.] of thy Mother.
\p
\v 9 . For they shall be an acceptable ornament, a gracious addition unto thine head, [Hebr. An addition of acceptableness, etc. That is, which shall make thee acceptable of thy mother: and respected. So below, chap.4.9.] and chains on thy neck: Hebr. Throat.]
\p
\v 10 . My son, if the sinners [Meaning gross and impotent sinners. See 1 Sam.25.on verse 18.] entice thee, [or, would seduce thee; that is, shall seek to persuade and inveigle thee with fair words. See of the Hebrew word rendered here enticed, Judge 14.on verse 14. Consent thou not. [Compare Prov.4.24.]
\p
\v 11 . If they say, Go with us, let us lurk for blood, [To wit, to shed it, by killing and murdering. Blood is used for killing, or murdering. See Gen.37. on verse 26.] (let us) hide our selves [that is, lie in wait, or, lay wait. So Psal.56. and below verse 18.] against the innocent, without cause: [that is, without his deserving. So Psalm 35.7.]
\p
\v 12 . Let us swallowed them up alive, [That is, without pity or compassion. Compare Psalm 124.3.] as the grave, [that is, as the grave swalloweth up the dead bodies. Compare below chap.27.20. and 30.16.] yea whole and all, as these that go down into the pit: [Heb.the goers down of the pit. So Gen.23.10. the enterers in of his City gate; that is, those that entered in at the gate of his City. So Psalm 78.9. shooters of the bow; that is, those that shoot with the bow.]
\p
\v 13 . We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:
\p
\v 14 . Thou shalt cast in thy lot in the midst among us, [That is, help to share the prey with us, which is commonly done by casting or drawing of lots, when every one desireth to draw out his share] we will all (of us) have it in common, and divide it amongst our selves.]
\p
\v 15 . My son, walk not in the way them, [that is, keep no their company, nor converse with them. Compare the phrase, 1 Sam.25.15. Psalm 1.1.] refrain thy foot from their path: [that is, go not with them in their wicked ways. Hereby may be also understood, the affections, inclinations, and motions of the mind or soul: For as the feet carry the body hither and thither; so is the spirit of a man led on and carried by the affections, to sundry devices and practises. Compare below verse 16. And 5.5. and 6.18, &c.]
\p
\v 16 . For their feet run to evil; [That is, to do evil, or to hurt others] and they make haste to shed blood.
\p
\v 17 . Surely the net is spread in vain before the eyes of all manner of fowl. [Hebr. Of all Lord of the wing. That is, of all manner if fowl, or, all that hath wings. See Gen.14.on verse 13. The net spread in vain, etc. Meaning, in respect of the silly bird, because it taketh no warning by the spreading abroad of the net, to shun and avoid danger; but is onely carried by a greedy appetite and desire to the bait. Some apply this thus: that the birds when see the net spread, are thereby warned, and fly away, but the wicked are so dull and senseless, that they even spread their own nets wherein they shall be taken. But the sense of the proverb seemeth to be this: As a bird doth in vain see the net spread abroad, not heeding it, but having her eyes fixed onely upon the bait, and so by falling on its taken: so wicked men and evil doers regard not the danger, where into they put themselves, when for some temporal gain or profit, they hurt their neighbour, but fall into the hands of the Magistrate, who punisheth them according to their deservings, or else are punished some other way by God himself.]
\p
\v 18 . And these [To wit, they, of whom is spoken above, verse 15,16.] lurk for their (own) blood, and hide themselves [see above on verse 11.] against their (own) souls. [the meaning is, that they bring their own lives to ruine and destruction, by seeking after the lives of others. Compare below chap.8.verse 36. And the Annot.]
\p
\v 19 . So are the paths [that is, the intentions, purpose, deeds, and practises. Compare Gen.6.on ver.12. also below chap.2.15. and 22.25.] of every one, that practiseth covetousness: [Hebr. That covets covetousness, or, coveteth with covetousness. So below chap.15.27. Jer.6.13. Ezek.22.27. Hab.2.9. The Hebrew word is for the most part taken in a bad sense, for filthy, covetous, and dishonest lucre or gain. See Gen.37.26. Exod.18.21. 1 Sam.8.3. Psalm 119.36. below chap.28.16. Isa.56.11.] it [to wit, covetousness] will catch [that is, bring to destruction, as a bird is caught, and cometh to its death by the bait, after which it flyeth] the soul of the masters thereof. [that is, of those that study or practise covetousness. See of the word Baal, Gen.14.on verse 13.]
\p
\v 20 . The Sepreme Wisdom [Hebr. Wisdom in the plural number, that is, the highest, most excellent, or supreme wisdom. So below chap.9.1. and Psalm 49.4. so Job 40.verse 10. A great beast is called Behemot; that is, beasts in the plural number. This is done to aggravate, or to multiply things. Oth. Every wisdom, or, manifold wisdom, or, (wisdom) of wisdoms. By this wisdom may be understood, either the essential wisdom of the Father, which is the Son of God, whereof see below chap.8. or the wisdom contained in the holy Scripture, which far exceedeth all the wisdom of men. Some understand the wisdom, which is revealed by the Word of God, and by the works of Divine Providence] cryeth aloud without; [to wit, by the Preachers of the word of God, or also by the works of Creation, and upholding, and governing of all things] she lifteth up her voice [Hebr. Giveth, &c. That is, she lifteth up her voice, and causeth it to be heard. So Gen.45.2. below chap.2.3. and 8.1.] in the streets.
\p
\v 21 . She cryeth in the front of the stirs, [Hebr. In the head of the stirs. Understand the places where great concourse or assembling of people was, and wherein also was much stir anmd noise] at the doors of the gates [where judgement was kept, and consequently where were great meetings and gathereds of people together. See Gen.22. on verse 17.] she uttereth her sayings in the city. [Meaning every city in the land of Israel.]
\p
\v 22 . Ye simple ones, [These are the words of wisdom, which Salomon bringeth in speaking after this manner. Of the word simple, see above on verse 4.] how long will ye love simplicity? And the scorners? And fools [understand not idiots, or naturals fools, senseless persons, that have not the common use of reason and understanding, as other men have; but such as are deprived of true wisdom, leading to everlasting life, neither are enclined or bent to seek and endeavour after it, but onely cumber and trouble themselves about the things pertaining to this temporal life] hate knowledge?
\p
\v 23 . Turn you unto my reproof: [To wit, to hear and obey it, or to follow after it. Oth. Turn you at my reproof: that is, repent and amend your lives by virtue of my reproof. Understand such a reproof as is done by words of instruction and exhortation. So below ver.25.30.] I will abundantly pour out. [a phrase borrowed or taken from fountains, out of which water issueth, or gusheth forth in great abundance. See of the Hebrew word, Psal.19.on verse 3. It is used sometimes in a good sense, as here, and so in the forementioned place: and sometimes in a bad sense, as below, chap.15.2,28.] my spirit unto you; [that is, the knowledge of my mind and will. See the word spirit often taken in the like sense, that is, for the gift of understanding, Psalm 76.verse 13. Below chap.29.11. Joel 2.28.] I will make known my words unto you.
\p
\v 24 . Seeing I have called, and ye have refused; (I) have stretched out mine hand, [To wit, to invite you to repentance. See the like phrase Isa.65.2.] and there was no man that regarded: [Compare Isa.65.12. and 66.4. Jer.13.10.]
\p
\v 25 . And ye have rejected [The Hebrew word is taken in the like sense, below chap.4.15. and 8.33. and 13.18. and 15.32.] all my counsel; [Oth. Have withdrawn your selves from, or, bereaved (your selves of) my counsel: Oth. Have caused my counsel to cease] and would not reproof:
\p
\v 26 . Therefore I will also laugh at your destruction: I will mock when your fear [That is, the evil, and mischief, whereat ye shall be sore afraid and astonished: or, which ye exceedingly fear. So in the following verse. See Job 39.on verse 25.] cometh.
\p
\v 27 . When your fear cometh as a destruction, [Which spreadeth it self far and near with a great sound or noise, and doth exceeding much harm. See of this similitude also, Psalm 35.8. and the annotations below, cha.3.25. Isa.10.3. and 47.11.] and thy destruction cometh as a whirlwind; [that is, very swiftly, terribly, and violently. See of such a kind of similitude also, Job 9.on verse 17.] when distress and anguish cometh upon you; [compare Job 27.9. and 35.12. Isa.1.15. Jer.11. verse 11. And 14.13. Ezek.8.18. Mich.3.4.]
\p
\v 28 . Then shall they cry unto me, but I will not answer: they shall seek me early, [That is, seek me with great care and diligence. See Job 8.on verse 5.] but (they) shall not find me:
\p
\v 29 . Because they hated knowledge, [Of knowledge, [Of knowledge, see above on verse 4.] and did not choose the fear of the LORD.
\p
\v 30 . They consented not to my counsel: they despised all my reproof.
\p
\v 31 . So [Or, therefore] shall they eat of the fruit of their (own) way, [that is, receive, and get the punishment, or recompence of their wicked works. See Job 21.on verse 25. The word fruit, here used, is taken for all manner of, either evil, or good, that issueth or proceedeth from any thing. It’s taken for evil, as here; so Isa.10 12. Jerem.6.19. Micha 7.verse 13. Lu.6.43. For good, below chap.8.19. and 31.31. Amos 6.12. Psalm 5.22. Philip.1.11.] and satisfy the selves with their (own) counsels. [that is, bring a sad inundation of plagues upon themselves, occasioned by their obstinate and contumacious minds. See of this phrase Job 7.4. and the annot.]
\p
\v 32 . For the turning away of the simple [To wit, whereby they turn away themselves from the teachings and instructions of wisdom] shall slay them, [or wit, the simple: which is done by means of the Magistrate, or other means yea by God himself] and the prosperity of fools [meaning which they, or other wicked men oftentimes have to devise: whereby they are hardened in their backsliding and course of sinning] shall destroy them.
\p
\v 33 . But whoso hearkeneth unto me, shall dwell safely: [Hebr. In, or, with safety: that is, not only without ill entertainment, but also without fear of it. The same phrase is also found, Lev.25.18. Deut.33.12. Isaiah 47.8. Jerem.23.6. Ezek.39.26, etc.] and he shall be quiet from fear of evil.
\c 2
\s Sundry promises of great use, for those that earnestly seek after, and obtain true wisdom: especially that they shall be directed and kept in the way of life, and be preserved from evil company, which walk in the way of destruction.
\p
\v 1 . My son, if thou receives my sayings; [From the twenty second verse of the former Chapter unto this verse, Salomon related the words of Wisdom: Now he speaketh again in his own person, as may be gathered by comparing the tenth and fifteenth verses of the former chapter] and layest up my commandments with thee: [to wit as a treasure, and necessary commodity. See Job 23.on verse 12. Also below verse 7.]
\p
\v 2 . To cause thine ears to attend unto wisdom, (if) thou inclinest thine heart unto understanding. [What understanding is, see above chap.1.on verse 2.]
\p
\v 3 . Yea [The Hebrew particle is so taken, 2 Kings 18.34.] if thou cryest unto prudence, [That is, if thou sleekest with all diligence to get it. It is a similitude borrowed from him that having great need of another man, sleeketh by earnest and stedfast crying unto him, to get him near himself] and liftest up [Hebr. Givest, so ab.cha.1.20.] thy voice unto understanding.
\p
\v 4 . If thou sleekest her as silver, and searchest after (her) as after hid treasure: [Compare Mat.13.44,45,46.]
\p
\v 5 . Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and shalt find the knowledge of God,. [To wit, by Gods gracious enlightening, James 1.5. who letteth them find the thing that is good, who in the use of right and lawful means seek and endeavour after it, Mat.7.7. For this word finding, hath respect or relation to the word seeking, mentioned in the last foregoing verse. Compare below chap.3.13. and the annot.]
\p
\v 6 . For the LORD giveth wisdom; [Compare James 1.5. 1 Kings 3.9.12.] out of his mouth, [that is, out of his holy Word: for the mouth of God in Scripture signifieth sometimes his good will and pleasure, Deut.8.3. sometimes the revelation thereof, Numb.9.18. Psalm 119.72.] (cometh) knowledge and understanding.
\p
\v 7 . He layeth up for the righteous a durable being: [Or, a sure estate. The Hebrew word signifieth properly that which is essential, sure, and durable, or, permanent. Understand here, either the true wisdom, and sure or sound doctrine of truth, which is opposed to the vain and empty knowledge of this world, or the eternal, celestial good, which is opposed to the momentany and transitory things of this earth. See of the Hebrew word further, Job 5.on verse 12. And compare Psalm 37.on verse 3.] He [to wit, the LORD] is a buckler [see Gen.15.on verse 1. Others understand by this shield or buckler, the true and sound wisdom, and doctrine of salvation. Compare Psalm 91.4.] to them that walk unrightly: [that is, to them that live a true, unfeigned, godly life. See also 1 Kings 9.4. Psalm 26.11. below chap.10.9. and 20. 7. And 28.6, &c. Also Gen.20.on verse 5.]
\p
\v 8 . That they may keep the paths of judgement: [That is, constantly follow the rule of Gods Word, which teacheth them what they are to believe, and how they ought to live. Compare Gen.18.on verse 19. These paths are also called, the paths of uprightness, below verse 13. The paths of life, below verse 19. The way of good men, and the paths of the righteous, below verse 20. The way of wisdom, and the footsteps of uprightness, below chap.4.11, &c. See further, 1 Kings 8.on verse 36.] and he shall preserve the way of his favourites: [Compare Psalm 1.on verse 6. See of the signification of the Hebrew word rendered here favourites, 2 Chron.6.on verse 41. And Psalm 4.4.]
\p
\v 9 .Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgement, and equities: [See of these three words above chap.1.on verse 3.] (and) all (or every) good path. [Hebr. All (or every) footstep of good: that is, every way that leadeth unto that which is good. The Hebrew word signifieth properly the print, or, furrow of a cart-wheel, or, the track of a cart-wheel made in the ground: but is by way of similitude used, to signify the way of men; that is, of their dealing and converse, their doing and omitting. See Psalm 23.3. below verse 15. And ch.4.11. and 5.21. and Isa.26.7.]
\p
\v 10 When wisdom shall have entered into thine heart, and knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul;
\p
\v 11 . Then shall discretion keep watch over thee, [That is, keep thee with singular diligence & carefulness; as the Hebrew phrase here importeth, and is also found, 1 Sam.26.16. and below chap.6.26.] understanding shall preserve thee.
\p
\v 12 . To deliver thee from the evil way; [Understand all kind of false faith, and wicked works, opposite and repugnant to the rule Gods word, and leading to destruction: which is likewise so called, Psalm 119.101. and below chap.8.15. and 28.10. likewise the way of falsehood, Psalm 119.29. the way of sinners, Psalm 1.1. the way, that is not good, below ch.16.29. and here straightway verse 13. The way of darkness: also the wicked way, Ezek.3.18.] from the man that speaketh pervesevenesses: [that is, things that are contrary to truth of doctrine, and righteousness of life. So Deut.32.20. below verse 14. And chap.6.14. and 8.13. and 10.31,32, &c.]
\p
\v 13 . (From those) that leave the paths of uprighteousness; [See above on verse 8. Compare 2 Chronicles chap.12.on verse 1.] to go in the ways of darkness. [that is, to live in unbelief, error, wilful sin, disquietness of mind, and misery. Thus the word darkness is taken for all kind of evil that is in the understanding, in the will, in the affections, in words and deeds, and in the whole course of mans life. Compare Eccle.2.14. Isaiah 9.1. Romans 2.19. Ezek.5.8.11.]
\p
\v 14 . Who rejoice to do evil, delight themselves in the perversenesses of the wicked: [To wit, either person, or work.]
\p
\v 15 . Whose paths [To wit, the paths of those that leave and forsake uprightness, &c. Of whom was spoken in the two foregoing verses] are perverse; [that is, crooked, and going awry, erring and going astray from the right and straight rule of faith and life] and declining in their steps: [to wit, from the right and good way: so chap.1.32. and 14.2.]
\p
\v 16 . To deliver thee from the strange woman [That is, which is not thine own, but another mans wife: and besides by her infidelity, wicked life, and adulterous carriage, pertaineth not to the true people of God. Wherefore she is also called an outlandish, or unknown woman. So below chap.5.3. and 6.24. and 7.5. this verse dependeth on the foregoing eleventh verse] from the unknown (woman) (which) flattereth with her speechs: [or, (which) maketh her speechs trim and neat, or, uttereth, smooth, or intreating words, whereby she enticeth men in a woman and unchaste manner. Compare below chapter 5.3. and 6.24. 7.5.]
\p
\v 17 . Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, [That is, her lawful husband, whom she married in her youth, and who is her head and governor] and forgetteth the covenant of her God. [that is, the promised conjugal fidelity; which is called the covenant of God, not onely because marriage was instituted and ordained by God; but also because God therein joineth man and wife together, and is a witness and beholder of that so near union and conjunction, as being made and done before him. See Mat.19.4,5,6, &c.]
\p
\v 18 . For her house inclineth unto death [The meaning is, that the punishment of adultery is mans utter ruine and destruction, both in soul and body. ‘Tis a similitude borrowed from an inclining or bending wall, which is nigh to its ruine or fall] and her paths unto the dead: [The Hebrew word, which sometimes signifieth Giants, is taken here for men that are dead, deceased, or, departed out of this life. See Job chapter 26.on verse 5. This eighteeneth verse dependeth on the foregoing sixteenth verse. As if he had said, I have not shewed in vain, that wisdom will deliver thee from the strange woman: for this is an exceeding great benefit, because the strange woman leadeth men unto death.]
\p
\v 19 . Whosoever go in unto her, [See Genesis 6.on verse 4.] shall not return; [to wit, from the way of death, which by the sin of adultery they have entered into] neither shall they hit the paths of life. [that is, which lead unto life. So below chap.5.6. and 6.23. and 15.24.]
\p
\v 20 . That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, [This verse dependeth upon the foregoing eleventh verse, then shall discretion keep, &c. Or, on the sixteenth verse, to deliver thee from the, etc.] and keep the paths of the righteous. [that is, the example of godly ones, that knew and feared God aright. These are commended unto us in the Scripture for our imitation, and not those, who give up themselves unto uncleanness, and to other sins. These (to wit, the righteous) are every where in this Book opposed to wicked and ungodly men, that know not God, nor obey him.]
\p
\v 21 . For the godly shall inhabit the earth, [Compare Psalm 37.9,11,22,29,34. And the Annotations on verse 29.] and the upright shall remain in it. [to wit, not onely in general, because there shall always remain a Church and people of God, but also in particular, because God will never leave any of those that are his, into what strait soever they come, but will continually follow them with his blessing even unto death.]
\p
\v 22 . But the wicked shall be destroyed from the earth, [Their death is an apparent destruction, because they living in great prosperity and pleasure, are suddenly taken away thence, and reserved for everlasting destruction. Compare Psalm 37.2,9, &c. See also Job 18.17. Psalm 104.35.] and the faithless wilful injustice transgress and violate the duty, which they owe unto God, or their neighbour. Compare 1 Samuel 15.18. and Psalm 1.1. and the Annot.] shall be plucked out of it.
\c 3
\s An exhortation to the keeping of the Commandments of wisdom, verse 1, &c. Also to affiance in God, and his counsel, with caution to beware of self-wisdom, 5. An exhortation to the fear of the LORD, 7. To liberality to the Ministers of God, and to the poor, 9,27. To patience in suffering, 11.of the blessingness that wisdom bringeth with it, the preciousness, high esteem, and great utility of it, 13. Evil practises, 29. Contentiousness, 30. Impatience, 31. The cursed prosperity of the wicked, scorners, and fools, 33.
\p
\v 1 . My son, forget not my law: [Or, doctrine: to wit, which I teach thee, and instruct thee in, namely, how to order thy life and conversation aright. See above chap.1.on verse 8.] but let thine heart keep my commandments.
\p
\v 2 . For they shall increase [So below chapter 9.11. Hebrew properly add, which is here as much as multiply] unto thee length of days, and years of life, [that is, a great age, and a long life, or a life of many years. So Deuteronomy 30.20. Job 12.12. Psalm.21.5. and 91.16. below verse 16. And 4.10. and 9.11.] and peace. [that is, prosperity both in soul and body: See Genesis 37.on ver.14.]
\p
\v 3 . Let not mercy and faithfulness forsake thee; [This may be understood of the mercy and truth of God; so that it is a command exhorting a man to cleave close thereunto, with a promise that he shall keep and preserve them. See below on verse 25. Others understand it of the bounty and faithfulness, which every one ought to shew unto his neighbour] bind them [to wit, the commandments of God, whereof is spoken in the first verse: or, mercy and faithfulness, that is, the promises of God concerning them] about thy neck, [to wit, as an ornament, or chain, as above chap.1.9. and to have them always before thine eyes, and in thy sight. See below ver.21. and 6.21. and compare Exod.13.9. Deut.6.8.] write them upon the table of thine heart. [that is, imprint them deep in the innermost part of thine understanding, that they may never slip out of thy memory. So below chap.7.3. Jer.17.1. 2 Cor.chap.3.3.]
\p
\v 4 . And find favour, [Or, grace; that is, acceptation or acceptableness, whereby a man is acceptable and pleasing unto others; so Gen.39.21. Psalm 46.3. above chap.1.9. below chap.11.16. and 22.verse 11 Eccl.10.12. Luke 2.52.] and good understanding [of understanding, see above chap.1.on verse 3.] in the eyes of God, and men. [‘Tis again a command, containing in it also a strong and earnest promise, as in the beginning of the former verse. The command is, labour to find grace, &c. The promise is, Thou shalt be acceptable both to God and good men, and have sound knowledge to live well.]
\p
\v 5 . Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; [Compare Deut.6.5. and 1 Kings 2.4. and the annot.] and lean not unto thine (own) understanding.
\p
\v 6 . Acknowledge him in all thy ways: [That is, in all that thou intendeth, understakest, speakest, doest, and omittest. See Gen.6.on verse 12. In the same sense is the word paths presently taken in this verse] and he shall make thy paths strait. [That is, direct them according to his law, and lead thee right according unto it, that thou maist at length attain unto the desired end of thy life. Compare below chap.11.5. and 15.21.]
\p
\v 7 . Be not wise in thine (own) eyes: [That is, in thine own conceit, and judgement. See Lev.13.on ver.3. and Job 18.on ver.3. Rom.12.16.] fear the LORD, and depart from evil:
\p
\v 8 . It shall be physic for thy navel, [it’s a phrase, by way of similitude, borrowed from young children, whose navels must be handled and dealt with, with singular care and prudence: and also from grown persons, that are weak and feeble in that are weak and feeble in that part of the body, and oftentimes have need of physic to be applied thereunto. The meaning is, that those that have the fear of God, shall, in respect of the spiritual life of the soul, be in very good health, and enjoy perfect strength] and moistening for thy bones. [Its another similitude borrowed from the bones in a mans body, which must be filled with good marrow to preserve the strength and vigour in man: So hath the soul likewise its strength and vigour from the knowledge and fear of the Lord. Compare Job 21.24.]
\p
\v 9 . Honour the LORD with thy substance [Honour him, to wit, in his Ministers, the Priests, and Levites: also in the widows, the fatherless, and the poor, by communicating unto them of thy means, Exod.23.19. and 34.36. Deut.26.2. &c. Mal.3.10. Luke 14.13.] and with the first-fruits of all thine increase. [See of these, Exodus. Chapter 22.verse 29.30. Levit.2.12. and 23.17.]
\p
\v 10 . So shall thy barns be filled with plenty; [Hebr. Satiety; that is, with plenty of fruits, whereby men may be satisfied and filled. See Gen.41.29. and the annotate. Also, Eccl.5.11. Compare Deut.28.8.] and thy press-fats run over [Hebr. Break asunder with new wine.]
\p
\v 11 . My son, reject not discipline [This word signifieth indeed the teaching or instruction, which is done in, or by words, but is here also taken for actual chastening or punishing. See below chap.7.on verse 22. So likewise the Hebrew Verb translated , rebuking, below chap.9.7. see the annotate.] of the LORD: neither be weary of his chastising: [this word is also not onely taken for Verbal punishment or reproof, such as is done by words, as below chap.15.31,32. And 28.23. but also for actual punishment, by blows, or plagues, or scourges, as here, and Psalm 73.14. and 149.7. Hos.5.9. So the Verb. Reprove, Psalm 6.2.]
\p
\v 12 . For the LORD chasteneth the man whom he loveth, [Compare Rev.3.19.] yea as a father the son in whom he hath a delight. [See of the signification of the Hebrew word, 2 Sam.24.on verse 23.]
\p
\v 13 . Happy is the man, (that) findeth wisdom: [Heb. (that) hath found, &c. That is, that findeth continually: therefore also the following Verb in the Original is put in the Future Tense. The word finding seemeth to relate to the seeking and searching after wisdom, whereof mention is made above chap.2.4. see the annot.] and the man, (that) bringeth for the [or, fetcheth out, to wit, as out of an hidden place, and consequently obtaineth it with great labour and pains] understanding.
\p
\v 14 . For the merchandise of it [That is, the ware, or the commodity that is to be found with wisdom; so is 23.18. Oth. Managing, or, handling; that is, searching after it, whereby it is sought, found, and obtained] is better then the merchandise of silver, [compare Job28. 15. Psalm 19.10. Prov.8.11,19. And 16.16. Oth. Ordering, or, managing of silver is gotten and obtained] and the increase thereof then gold digged out. [meaning very fine gold, perhaps so called, because it’s digg’d out of the ground. The same name is used, Psalm 68.14. below chap.8.10,19. And 16.16. Zach.9,3.]
\p
\v 15 . She is more precious then rubies; [See Job 28.on verse 18.] and whatsoever thou canst delight in, is not be compared unto her: that is, whatsoever thou canst wish or desire, is not of such worth and value, as that it should be able to be compared with wisdom. So below chap.8.11.]
\p
\v 16 . Length of days [See above on verse 2.] is in her right hand; in her left hand, riches and honour. [Wisdom is here compared to a woman, that in great plenty divideth all manner of goods to those that follow, and obey her. Under temporal goods are comprehended also those that are eternal.]
\p
\v 17 . Her ways [That is, whatsoever she prescribeth to believe, and to do. Understand also in like manner the following word paths] are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths peace. [that is, prosperity and happiness, both in soul and body; as above verse 2. The meaning is, that this is obtained by wisdom.]
\p
\v 18 . She [To wit, wisdom; see above verse 13.] is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her; [that is, as a tree life, giving life, and full contentment or satisfaction to them that eat of her fruits, that is, that receive her instruction. Compare Gen.2.9. and 3.22. also below chap.11.30. and 13.12. and 15.4.] and every one that holdeth her fast, is happy.
\p
\v 19 . The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth, by understanding hath prepared [that is, beautifully adorned, gloriously sitted, and orderly composed and joined together. So is the Hebrew word taketh, Job 31.15.] the Heavens.
\p
\v 20 . By his knowledge the depths are cloven, [Meaning the seas, and consequently the fountains, springs, rivers, and all sorts of streams, that issue and spread out of the depth and bottom of the earth, as it were by the renting thereof in twain. Compare Gen.1.9,10.] and the clouds drop (down) dew.
\p
\v 21 . My son, let not them [To wit, wisdom, understanding, and knowledge, whereof is spoken in the two former verses. Oth. The Law, and the commandments, of which see verse 1. Of this chapter] depart from thine eyes: keep the durable wisdom [see of the Hebr. Word Job 5.on verse 12. And abo.chap.2.on verse 7.] and discretion. [See above chap.1.on verse 4.]
\p
\v 22 . For they shall be life for thy soul; [That is, bring life to thy neck. [that is, an ornament, which will make thee gracious and acceptable both in the fight of God, and of all good men. Compare above chap.1.9. and the annot.]
\p
\v 23 . Then shalt thou walk (in) thy way safety: [That is, go sure in thy intention, doing, and omitting. So below chap.10.9. and compare Psalm 37.24. and 91.11,12. Below chap.28.18. Isa.chap.40.31.] and thou shalt not dash thy foot. [that is, thou shalt not come into danger, so as to hurt thy self. Oth. And thy foot shall not dash it self, or, stumble. Compare Psalm 91.12. Foot is taken for the man himself. So Psalm 31.9. below chap.7.11. Isa.52.7.]
\p
\v 24 . If thou liest down, [To wit, to sleep, or, rest] thou shalt not be afraid; but thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. [Compare Lev.26.6. Job 11.19. Psalm 3.6. and 4.9.]
\p
\v 25 . Be not afraid of sudden terror, [‘Tis a Commandment, containing in it a promise, as above verse 3,4. Also below chap.4.4. and 7.2. and 9.6. see Psal.37.on verse 3. Therefore some render these words thus: Thou shalt not be afraid of sudden terror, &c. But with the translation, that is in the text, doth the Hebrew particle all, or, any, better agree. The meaning is, that the lovers of wisdom shall not need to fear, or be afraid of, &c. Hebr. Of terror suddenly; that is, which is sudden, or cometh unwares, and unexpected. So below ch.15.24. from hell, or the grave below, or beneath; that is, which is below, or beneath] neither of the desolation [see Psalm 35.on verse 8. And above chap.1.on verse 27.] of the wicked seek to raise or effect among the godly: or rather, which shall come upon the wicked by the just judgement of God] when it cometh.
\p
\v 26 . For the LORD shall be with thine hope: [That is, he will be found of thee, when thou hopest in him, that thy hope, whereby thou waitest on his help, may not be in vain. Oth. Shall be thine hope. Of the word hope, see the Hebrew word so taken, Job 4.6. and the annot.] and he shall keep thy foot from being taken. [Hebr. From taking: To wit, whereby thou mightiest come into the hand and power of the wicked, and be oppressed by them.]
\p
\v 27 . Withhold not good [Meaning, either corporal, or spiritual good] from the masters (or owners) thereof, [understand by these, those to whom we owed any thing that is good, either according to the Civil Law, or according to the Divine and Natural Law. The Civil Law is, that we should give to others, that which belongeth to them, by virtue of commerce or trading one with another. The Divine, and Natural, or Moral Law is, that we should give unto others, by virtue of our duty of love and compassion, which we owe unto them in general. Consequently by the word masters, or owners, the poor are here also to be understood, because the rich are given unto them by God as Stewards, and Dispensers, to communicate unto them, and to make them sharers of their means. In which respect alms or almsdeeds are called righteousness, Dan.4.27.] when it is in the power of thine hand to do (it). [that is, when God hath given the means and ability, either in Civils, to content and satisfy thy neighbour, or in Divine and Naturals, to do good unto poor, and to relieve them in their wants and necessities. The meaning is, that both those duties in such a case may not be delayed. Oth. Although it were in the power of thine hand to do it; to wit, to withhold from any man that which is his due, or belongeth unto him. That which is delivered in this, and the following verse, is a general proverb, forbidding the neglect, or hindering of doing good unto others.]
\p
\v 28 . Say not unto thy neighbour; Go thy ways, and come again, and tomorrow I will give; [Namely, that which thou in a manner owest him, and which he asketh and craveth of thee, and hath greatly need of: compare Lev.19.13. Deut.24.14. also Gal.6.10. James 2.15,16.] seeing it is with thee.
\p
\v 29 . Forge not evil against neighbour, [The Hebrew word rendered here forge, signifieth to devise, intend and promise a thing closely and secretly; which may be said to be done either in a bad, or a in good sense. Here its taken in a bad sense, as also below chap.6.14,18. Elsewhere it is also taken in a good sense, as below chap.14.verse 22.] seeing he dwelleth with confidence [That is, securely, without having any mistrust, or evil suspicion of thee. Oth.in truth, or, fidelity] by thee.
\p
\v 30 . Strive not with a man without cause; [To wit, neither in judgement, nor elsewhere beside] if he have done thee no harm. [for if he have done so, it is then lawful for a man to vindicate his own right; either by the means of the Magistrate, or to bring him to an acknowledgement of his fault by the Ecclesiastical power, or other private admonition, and that without desire of revenge, and scandal, Exod.22.verse 8. Mat.18.15,16,17. 1 Cor.6.4. Eph.4.26.
\p
\v 31 . Be not envious [See Psalm 37.on verse 1.] against a man of violence: [That is, that useth violence, and practiseth oppression, and thereby becometh great, rich, and mighty. See of this phrase, 2 Sam.22.49. Job 11.on verse 11. And Psalm 5.on verse 7. Compare Psalm 37,1. And 73.3. above chap.23.17.] and choose none of his ways. [Hebr. Not all his ways; that is, none of them. See 1 Kings 11.on verse 34.]
\p
\v 32 . For the revolter [That is, he that revolteth or departeth from the right way] is an abomination unto the LORD: [Hebr. Is the Lords abomination; that is, whom God esteemeth as an abomination. So below ch.11.1.20. and 12.22. and 15.9. and 16.5, &c. See Deut.17.on verse 1. Elsewhere a thing is said to be an abomination unto the LORD, Isa.1.verse 13. The sense or meaning is one and the same: so is an abomination to man, below chap.24.9.] but his secret [that is, his deepest mercy, and good will in the Messiah. See .Ps.25.on verse 14.] is with the upright. [Compare 25.14.]
\p
\v 33 . The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: [Compare Lev.26.14. etc. Deuter.28.15.etc. Mal.2.2.] but he will bless the habitation of the righteous.
\p
\v 34 . Surely he will scorn the scorners: but he will give grace unto the meek. [Oth. If he scorneth the scorners, he will also give grace unto the meek. Compare Jam.4.6. 1 Pet.5.5. Of the word meek, see Psalm 22.on verse 27.]
\p
\v 35 . The wise shall inherit honour; but every one of the fools taketh shame upon himself, [that is, taketh shame with him for his portion: or, shame taketh fools away; that is, frustrateth them and all their expectation; or, shame exalteth fools.]
\c 4
\s Salomon (propounding his own example; how he was taught and instructed by his parents) exhorteth again with many reasons and arguments to study the doctrine of wisdom, verse 1, etc. Also to shew and decline the paths of the wicked, 14. To keep the words of wisdom, 20. To practise holiness of soul and body, in ordering of the heart, mouth, eyes, and feet, 23.
\p
\v 1 . Hear ye children [So Salomon calleth all those, that as children desired to heat his doctrine, as being the instruction and admonition of a loving father to his children. See above chap.1.on verse 8.] the discipline [see above chap.1.on verse 2.] of a father; and attend to know understanding.
\p
\v 2 . Seeing I give you good doctrine; [See Job 11.on verse 4.] forsake not [so above chap.1.8. and below ver.6.] my law. [or, intention. So above chap.1.8.]
\p
\v 3 . For I was my fathers son, [That is, a singular son, whom he exceedingly loved, and of whom he had special care. Of such a one we also use to say, he is the fathers child, or, the fathers son: the father loves him] tender, [that is, tenderly brought up, and carefully look to. Compare 1 Chron.29.1.] and an onely (one) [that is, well-beloved, and very loving, as an onely son. Compare 1 Chron.3.5.] before the face of my mother.
\p
\v 4 . Now he taught me, [See 1 Chron.28.9.] and said unto me; Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live. [it is a commandment, with a promise, as if it were said, and thou shall live. Compare above chap.3.on verse 25. And below verse 13.]
\p
\v 5 . Get wisdom, get understanding: forget not, [To wit, the words, or sayings of my mouth, whereof is spoken in the following words of this verse] neither decline from the sayings of my mouth. [That is, which proceed out of my mouth: or, of my command; that is, which I command or enjoin. Thus the word mouth is taken for command, Gen.41.verse 40.]
\p
\v 6 . Forsake her not, [To wit, wisdom, whereof is spoken in the former verse] and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.
\p
\v 7 . Wisdom is the chiefest (thing) [To wit, that we ought to endeavour after, and which can do us good. The Hebrew word Reschith is taken for the best, and choicest, or most excellent, and transcendent thing that is, Psalm 119.160. Amos 6.1. as also the word rosch, Ezek.27.22.] get (thou) wisdom: [Oth. The beginning of wisdom is, get wisdom. Oth. Get wisdom, the first of wisdom: which is the fear of the LORD. See above ch.1.7. and the annot.] and get understanding with all thy possession. [that is, with all thy goods and means. Compare Matth.13.44. also Prov.23.23.]
\p
\v 8 . Exalt her, [To wit, by highly esteeming her in thine heart, commending her with thy mouth, and obeying her with thy life] and she shall promote thee: she shall honour thee, [that is, make thee acceptable and great in the sight of God, and men, see Dan.1.17. Luke 2.52.] when thou shalt embrace her.
\p
\v 9 . She shall give to thine head an acceptable addition: [Hebr. An addition of acceptableness. See above cha.1.on verse 9.] a beautiful crown [Hebr. A crown of beauty, or, glory; that is, wherewith the head is adorned, and honoured. So below cha.16.3. Jer.13.18. Ezek.16.12. and 23.42.] shall she deliver to thee.
\p
\v 10 . Hear, my son, and receive my sayings: and the years of life shall be multiplied unto thee: [Compare above chap.3.2. and the annot.]
\p
\v 11 . I do teach thee in the way of wisdom: I do cause thee to tread in right steps. [Hebr. In the steps of rightness, or, uprightness: that is, in right ways. See above chap.2.on verse 8. Of the word step, see in the same place on verse 9.]
\p
\v 12 . In thy going thy step [See Job 14.on verse 16.] shall not be straitened: [as it happeneth in narrow, uneven, troublesome, and slippery ways. The meaning is, that they way of wisdom is a convenient, easy, and pleasant way, Mat.11.30. Psalm 91.11,12.] and if thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble. [Comp. Ps.91.11.]
\p
\v 13 . Take fast hold of discipline, [That is, of the instruction leading unto wisdom. See above chap.1.on verse 2.] cease not: [to wit, from following this exhortation. Oth. Let her) not go: to wit, wisdom. See the following annot.] keep her; [to wit, wisdom, whereof is spoken in the former verses, and which is gotten by discipline or instruction] for she is thy life. [meaning the well-being, or well-living, not only of thy body, but also of thy soul. So verse 22. Compare above verse 4. And the annot. Oth. Keep it, for it is thy life.]
\p
\v 14 . Enter not into the path of the wicked; neither tread in the way of evil (men). [Compare Psalm 1.1. Prov.1.10,15.]
\p
\v 15 . Reject it; [To wit, the way of evil men. Of the word here rendered reject, see above chap.1.on verse 25.] pass not through by it: turn from it, and pass away.
\p
\v 16 . For they sleep not, [Hebr. They will not sleep. The Future Tense signifieth the continuance of the action; as if he had said: They are not wont to sleep] if they have not done evil; and their sleep is taken away, if they cause not (some body) to stumble. [to wit, by hurting him in his soul, when they seduce it, and cause it to sin; or in his body, when they wound and kill it, or in his estate, when they steal and rob it.]
\p
\v 17 . For they eat the bread [By bread and wine in this verse is meant all things necessary for the sustentation of this temporal life. So is the word bread also taken, when it is put alone, without the addition of another word to it; below chap.20.17. and 30.8,22. And 31.14. Mat.6.11.] of wickedness, [that is, goods unjustly gotten; or wealth gotten by injustice. So in the following words, wine of violence, which is gotten by violence. So below chap.20.17. bread of falsehood, which is gotten by false means, and chapter 31.27. bread of idleness, which is gotten without labour. Or, the meaning is, that to commit injustice and violence, is as delightful and acceptable unto them, as eating and drinking: which king of phrase our Saviour Christ useth, John 4.34. Compare Job 15.16. and the annot.] and drink the wine of meer violence. [Hebr. Of violences, or robberies.]
\p
\v 18 . But the path of the righteous is as a shining light; going on, and lightening until the full day. [Hebr. Unto the set, or appointed (time) of the day: that is, until noon, or mid-day, when the sun is in its greatest strength and brightness, and the day in its perfection and compleatness. The just and the righteous are here compared unto the shining light; to wit, not only because they prosper by the blessing of God upon them, and enjoy peace and quietness of mind, but also because they are enlightened with the knowledge of God, and do therein daily increase more and more, going on from strength to strength, and from virtue, until they hereafter attain unto the perfection of the children of God. Compare Job 18.on verse 5.]
\p
\v 19 . The way of the wicked is as darkness: [That is, full of ignorance, error, disquietness, danger and misery. See Gen.15.on verse 12.] they know not at what time they shall stumble. [that is, what is, that shall bring them to ruine, and plunge them into destruction. Understand this of the means, whereby God will execute his just judgement upon them. The reason, why they know no at what they shall stumble, is, because they are perpetually in apparent danger of falling into mischief and destruction: which surpriseth and overtaketh them suddenly and unwares, above chap.1.verse 27.]
\p
\v 20 . My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear into my sayings.
\p
\v 21 . Let them not depart from thine eyes, [So above chap.3.21.] keep them in the midst of thine heart.
\p
\v 22 . For they [To wit, my words, and sayings, whereof mention is made, above verse 20] are life [that is, those that give life. Compare above verse 13. And see the Annot.] to those that find them, and physic [that is, not onely giving life, but also preserving it in a good estate and condition, and keeping off and removing all manner of sickness and disease therefrom. Compare ab.Chap.3.8. and below chap.12.18. and 13.17.] to all their flesh. [that is, to the whole man, consisting of body and soul. Spiritual blessings are typified and shadowed out by temporal blessings. Thus flesh is taken for man, Gen.6.12. Oth. To the whole flesh of every one of them.]
\p
\v 23 . Keep thine heart [The heart signifieth often all the powers and faculties of the soul, namely, the understanding, the will, and affections. So Gen.8.21. Isaiah 29.13. Jerem.17.9. Joel 2.13.] above all that is to be kept; [Hebr. Above all keeping, keep thine heart] for out of it are the issues of life. [the life of man is, either natural, or spiritual. The first he hath by his first birth; the second, by his second birth. Both kinds of life give their several operations and workings, which do flow and proceed from the heart. The natural actings and workings do proceed from the heart, that is unregenerate: the spiritual workings, and actings, or actions, do proceed and issue from the heart that is regenerate: Compare Matth.15.8.]
\p
\v 24 . Put away from thee the forwardness of the mouth, [Understand all abuse of the tongue against the first, and second Table, or against God and man. See above chap.2.on verse 12. And below chap.6.12.] and the perverseness of the lips put far from thee.
\p
\v 25 . Let thine eyes look right on, and (let) thine eyelids keep themselves straight before thee. [That is, direct thy sight straight forward. The meaning is, that, to the end that we may go on faithfully and constantly in the way of the LORD, we should not turn away our spiritual eyes from the commandments of the Lord, either to the right hand, or to the left, but go straight forward, without suffering our selves in any case to be led aside out of the way.]
\p
\v 26 . Ponder the going [Hebr. Step] of thy foot, and let all thy ways be well established, [Or, ordered, or, directed, or, well fitted. Oth. That all thy ways may be well fitted, or, ordered; or, and all thy ways shall be established.]
\p
\v 27 . Depart not to the right hand, nor to the left; [See Deu.5.on verse 32. And 28.14.] turn away thy foot from evil.
\c 5
\s An exhortation to the study of wisdom, verse 1. An earnest admonition to beware of unchaste women, 3. An exhortation to a chaste and merry life in the state of wedlock, 15. God seeth all things, he taketh and destroyeth the wicked in their own sins, 21.
\p
\v 1 My son, attend unto my wisdom: encline thine ear to my understanding: [Of the difference of these two words, wisdom, and understanding, see above chap.1.on verse 2.]
\p
\v 2 . That thou mayest preserve all discretion; [Hebr. Discretions. See above chap.1.on verse 4.] and (that) thy lips may keep knowledge. [to wit, the lips, whereby thou mayest impart and communicate that knowledge unto others, which thou gettest by my teaching and instruction, compare Mal.2.7.]
\p
\v 3 . For [Here a reason is given, why the former exhortation should take place with men] the lips [that is, the words. See Job 2.on verse 20. The same signification hath the word palate, or, roof of the mouth, that followeth. So Job 31.30.] of a strange (woman) [see above chap.2.on verse 16.] drop an honey-comb: [that is, bring forth sweet, and pleasant words without ceasing, whereby young men are allured to the love her. See of this phrase Deut.32.2. and the Annot.] and her palate is smoother then oil. [that is, her words slip into the heart, by reason of her sweet and pleasant flattery, as oil slippeth into the stomach by reason of the smoothness and slipperiness thereof. Compare below chap.26. verse 28. See above chap.2.16. and below chap.6.24.]
\p
\v 4 . But her last [Or, her end, or issue. The meaning is, that the event, or issue of all the pleasantness and sweetness of the strange woman, and of those that cleave unto her, is no otherwise, then as followeth in the Text. Thus the original word is taken for an unhappy end, Deut.32.20. below chap.14.13. and 23.32. Amos 8,10.] is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword: [Hebr. A sword of mouths: that is, that hath two mouths. Meaning a two-edged sword, or a sword that cutteth on both sides. So Psalm 149.6. Heb.4.12.]
\p
\v 5 . Her feet go down to death: her steps take hold on hell. [That is, tend thither, so that they shall not in any wise escape it. See of the signification of the word hell, Gen.37.on verse 35. By death, and hell is in this place meant not onely temporal death, and the visible grave, but also eternal death, and hell it self, even the place of the damned.]
\p
\v 6 . Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, [That is, the path which leadeth unto true life. See above cha.2.on verse 19.] her goings [Hebr. Footsteps; that is, her words and works] are unstable [or, move to and fro, hither et thither, are wavering; that is, straying, uncertain, driven with all winds, now cleaving to this, anon to that man, and that for to deceive and seduce him] (that) thou perceives it not. [the Hebrew word rendered here perceivest, is often so taken. See Job 5.on verse 24. Or, (that) thou art not aware of it, or, discernest it not: to wit, that her goings stray from the path of life, and lead a man unto death. The meaning of the whole verse is this, Lest thou come to consider with thyself, whether a man can keep her company, and yet notwithstanding keep the way of life, know of a certain, that her goings and the manner of her actings, are so unstable, mutable, and straying, in using all manner of craft and subtility to deceive and seduce thee, that thou shalt not be able to perceive it, and consequently shalt be caught by her in the net of destruction.]
\p
\v 7 . Now then, ye children, hearken unto me; and depart not from the sayings of my mouth.
\p
\v 8 . Make thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house. [That is, have no fellowship with her, and beware of coming nigh her.]
\p
\v 9 . Lest thou give [To wit, as a prey, and booty, to be deprived of it] thine honour [that is, thy youth, strength, means, good name, and souls prosperity. Understand hereunder also the children which the whoremonger getteth by the whore: for they for the most part abide in the house of the adulteress, or of her that breaketh wedlock] unto others; [to wit, unto the adulteress, and her husband] and years [to wit, thy youthful years, and the best time of thy life] unto the cruel. [meaning the whores company, and the whores husband, who shall cruelly persecute thee, and deliver thee over unto the Magistrate. Compare below chap.6.34, 35.]
\p
\v 10 . Lest strangers [Meaning not onely the adulteress, and her husband, but also all ruffians, panders and panderesses, and all the adulterous crew, that reap any profit or gain by such unclean and filthy acts] satisfy themselves with thy wealth; [that is, with thy temporal means, or estate. So Hos.7.9.] and all thy painful labour [that is, all that thou hast gotten or gained by thy labour, joined with pain, and trouble. Compare below chap.14.23. and Isa.58.3.] (come) into the house of one unknown: [Or, of an alien, foreigner, outlandish person: so below verse 20.]
\p
\v 11 . And thou roar [Or, cry, bawl. The Hebrew word signifieth properly the noise, and roaring, that beasts, and especially lions make, when they are in any danger or distress, although they are not sensible, from whence it cometh. Compare Psalm 32.3. Isa.5.29,30. Ezek.24.2.] at the last, when thy flesh, and thy body is consumed.
\p
\v 12 . And say, how have I hated discipline? And mine heart despised reproof?
\p
\v 13 . And have not hearkened to the voice of my instructors; nor inclined mine ear unto my teachers?
\p
\v 14 . I was almost in all evil, [Heb. I was almost, or, within a little in all evil: to wit, the evil of punishment, see Gen.19.on vers.19. Or, understand withal, the evil of sin, of which see Job 20.12.] in the midst of the Congregation, and of the assembly. [that is, publicly before the Church of God, and all the world.]
\p
\v 15 . Drink water out of thine (own) cistern, and floods [Or, streams] out of the midst of thine (own) well. [this is a figurative description, from the beginning prosperity, and quietness of mind of those, who live purely and chastely in the holy state of wedlock, according to the ordinance of God. The meaning is, that every one ought to delight onely in his own lawful yoak-fellow in all honesty and sobriety, as followeth, verse 18,19. Others have understood this of the lawful possession and use of temporal goods or riches, and of the liberality and mercifulness, that we ought to shew therewith unto the poor and needy.]
\p
\v 16 . Let thy fountains [Meaning thy children, that issue from thee as from a fountain. Compare Isa.51.1.] spread themselves, abroad, (and) the water-brooks [See Psalm 1.on verse 3.] in the streets. [the meaning is, that every one ought to bring up his children honestly, that they may not onely be a grace and a credit to their family, but also in their places according to their abilities, be useful and serviceable unto others.]
\p
\v 17 . Let them be onely thine (own) and not a strangers with thee. [To wit, they taking and acknowledging thee onely to be their father, and thou them to be thy children: which cannot be done among those children that are born of an adulteress.]
\p
\v 18 . Let thy fountain [That is, thy lawful wife, from whom thy children do proceed and issue, as from a springing Fountain] be blessed, and rejoice because of the wife of thy youth;
\p
\v 19 . A very loving hind [Hebr. Hind of loves. Of this mention is made here, because she is most dearly and intimately beloved of the hart, as some do write] and a pleasant wild goat: [Hebr. Roe of pleasantness] let her breasts at all times make thee drunk; [or, moisten, drench, refresh thee; that is, fill thee with joy and pleasure. Compare below chap.7.18.] err continually in her love. [that is, recreate thy self with her, as a man useth to recreate and delight himself in the thing that is lawful, and so to forget himself in it, that he not once regardeth the thing that is unlawful.]
\p
\v 20 . And why shouldest thou, my son, erre in a strange (woman), [That is, in the love of a strange (woman)] and embrace the bosom of the unknown (woman?) [Or, foreign, outlandish (woman)]
\p
\v 21 . For the wars of every one [Or, of a man] are before the eyes of the LORD: and he pondereth all his goings. [Hebr. Weigheth, or, pondereth all his steps; that is, he trieth as with a plummet every ones ways, whether they be right or crooked, knowing fully all the commissions and omissions of men. Compare 2 Chron.16.9. Job 31.5. and 34.21. Prov.15.3. Jerem.16.17. and 32.19.]
\p
\v 22 . His (own) iniquities shall take the wicked (himself); and he shall be held fast with the words of his (own) sin.
\p
\v 23 . He shall die, because he was without discipline; [That is, because he would not hear instruction or discipline, or when he heard it, would not receive it] and in the greatness of his felly [or, multitude: that is, great or manifold folly] be shall go astray. [to wit, from the way of life, and so run to damnation.]
\c 6
\s An admonition to beware of suretiship, verse 1, &c. Of idleness, with a disgracing of the sluggard, by the example of the pismires, 6. To beware of the nature and gestures of a wicked man, 12. Six, yea seven things that God hateth, 16. The duty of children in respect of the good instruction of their parents, with fair promises, 20. Especially that they shall be preserved from whorish adulterous women, who are described by their hurtful and mischievous fruits, to wit, their own unhappy end, and the unhappy end of those that cleave or adhere unto them, 24. The comparing of these with adultery, 30.
\p
\v 1 . My son, [See above chap.1.on verse 8.] if thou be surety for thy neighbour, (if thou) hast stricken thy hand [to wit, in token that thou wilt keep thy word, whereby thou hast promised to pay, if the debtor fail, and be not able to pay. See Job 17.on verse 3. The right and prudent use or custom of being surety for another is not here condemned, but the imprudence, rashness, and indiscretion, that is often used in suretiship] for a stranger; [that is, for one that is unknown to thee; or for another; that is, for any one, be he who he will, either known, or not known unto thee. Compare below chap.11.15.]
\p
\v 2 . Thou art snared with the sayings of thy mouth, [Oth. Art thou snared, &c.] thou art taken with the sayings of thy mouth.
\p
\v 3 . Do this now, my son, and deliver thy self, [That is, free thy self from suretiship, either by the creditor, that he may discharge thee, or by the debtor, that he may discharge thee out of fear and care] seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbour: [that is, into the power of thy creditor, forasmuch as he hath power to require the debt of thee. Compare Gen.6.16. and the annot.] go, submit thy self, [the Hebrew word signifieth such an humiliation, as if a man would suffer himself to be trod upon with the foot. So Psalm 68.31. see the annot. There] and strengthen thy neighbour. [That is, put courage into the creditor, that he may be contented with the payment, and not requite it strictly of thee, but expect it patiently of or from the debtor. Or, strengthen, and urge the party for whom thou art become surety, that he do his endeavour to pay.]
\p
\v 4 . Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eye-lids: [That is, delay not to quiet and pacify thy self, and the creditor.]
\p
\v 5 . Deliver thy self [to wit, from the power of the creditor, unto whom hast bound thy self for the payment of the money] as a roe from the hand (of the hunter); and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
\p
\v 6 . Go to the Ant, thou sluggard: behold her ways, [That is, manner, or course of life; to wit, in vigilant, careful, and diligent gathering and providing food for her self. So is the word way taken below, chap.13.15. and 14.12. and 16.2. and 21.2. and 30.19,20.] and be wise:
\p
\v 7 . Which having no guide, Governor, nor Ruler, [As among other beasts Bees have their King, that quickens on and stirs up his own unto diligence, and stings the idle drones to death, and casts them forth out of the hive: but the pismire having no need of such a King, puts her self on to labour.]
\p
\v 8 . Prepareth her bread in the summer, (and) gathereth her food in the harvest. [By bread, or food, which the pismire prepareth and gathereth in summer, and in harvest, is meant here grains of corn, which she gnaweth, and with her biting cutteth asunder, that they might not shoot forth and grow, to the end she might have her store and provision thereof against winter; for which cause she is called by the Hebrews nemalah, from namal, which signifieth cutting, cutting asunder.]
\p
\v 9 . How long wilt thou lie down, (O) sluggard? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
\p
\v 10 . (Yet) a little sleep, a slumber, a little folding of the hands lying down.
\p
\v 11 . So shall thy poverty come (upon thee) as a traveller; [The meaning is, while thou givest thy self to mind nothing but sleep and laziness, poverty will be sure to overtake thee: yea it will come upon thee as a traveller: that is, suddenly, and unawares, unlook for; as a traveller maketh haste, and commonly cometh upon a man, when he least looks for him. Some conceive that the sluggard is here brought in speaking to himself, or answering to the former reproof, and wishing that he might have a little more sleep, &c. The truth is, that Salomon seemeth to have respect to the manner of doing and speaking of those that accustom themselves to laziness and sluggishiness] and they want as an armed man. [Hebr. A man of the shield; that is, that beareth a shield. Meaning a strong armed man, that is wont to come in without asking, and cannot easily be driven out again.]
\p
\v 12 . A man of Belial, [So below chap.16.27. see Deut.13.on verse 13.] a vicious man [Hebr. A man of viciousness, or, vanity, or, iniquity. See Job 11.on verse 11. And Psalm 5.on verse 7.] walketh about with forwardness of mouth; [see above chap.2.on verse 12. And chap.4.on verse 24. Oth. A man of Belial is a vicious, or, unjust man, walking about with forwardness of mouth.]
\p
\v 13 . (He) winketh with his eyes, [Intimating thereby some evil which he either intendeth to do himself, or desireth to be done by others] (he) speaketh with his feet, [to wit, pushing, stamping, touching, or treading therewith] (he) teacheth with his fingers; [to wit, therewith pointing, numbering, threatening, &c. The meaning is, that he not onely abuseth his mouth, but also employed all his members, to put his wickedness in practice.]
\p
\v 14 . Frowardnesses are in his heart, [That is, inventions, plots and devices are in his heart to act some wicked and perverse thing, either in words or deeds] he forget evil [see above chap.3.on verse 29. So below verse 18.] always; he casteth in strifes. [Hebr. Sendeth; that is, occasioneth much discord, affording matter thereunto, and stirring up mens minds to dissention and disagreement. So below verse 19. And chap.16.28.]
\p
\v 15 . Therefore shall his destruction come speedily, suddenly shall he be broken, (so) that there shall be no healing of (him). [That is, no means for to escape destruction. So below chap.29.1.]
\p
\v 16 . These six (things) [ A certain number for an uncertain] doth the LORD hate: yea seven [Oth. The seventh. See of this phrase, Job 5.on verse 19.] are an abomination unto his soul: [Hebr. His souls abomination, or, the abomination of his soul; that is, which his soul holdeth to be abomination. See Deut.17.on verse 1. And above chap.3.on verse 32.]
\p
\v 17 . Lofty eyes, [That is, pride, whereof the eyes that are lifted up, and soar aloft, are a plain token. Compare Psalm 101.5. Prov. Chap.30.13. Isa.5.15. unto these are opposed those that be of lowly or humble eyes, Job 22.29.] a false tongue; [Hebr. A tongue of falsehood; that is, which speaketh lies; so Psalm 109.2. and bel. Chap.12.19. and 21.6.] and hands that shed innocent blood:
\p
\v 18 . An heart that forget vicious thoughts, [Hebrew, thoughts of viciousness, or, iniquity. Meaning an heart that pierceth and plotteth wicked and unjust practises. See ab.ch.3.on v.29. and the 14. Verse of this Chapter] feet that make haste to run to evil: [that is, men, who by their evil inclinations and affections, are exceedingly put on to wrong and mischieve their neighbors.]
\p
\v 19 . A false witness, [Hebr. A witness of falsehood] (that) lies; [that is, that inventeth and uttereth lies in great abundance, and with boldness. So below ch.14.25. and ch.18. verse 5.9.] and (him) that casteth in contentions [Hebr. Sendeth, &c. See above on verse 14.] between brethren.
\p
\v 20 . My son, keep the commandment of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother. [Compare ab.ch.1.8.]
\p
\v 21 . Bind them continually unto thine heart: fasten them unto thy neck. [Compare above ch.3.3. and the Annot.]
\p
\v 22 . When thou walkest, it [To wit, the commandment of thy father, whereof mention is made, verse 20. Although the particle (it) may also relate or have respect to the law of the mother] shall conduct thee, when thou liest down, it shall keep watch over thee; when thou awakes, it s hall talk (with) thee. [that is, put thee in mind what thou oughtest to do or omit in thy dealing and converse, and wherewith thou oughtest to comfort thy selk in thy sufferings.]
\p
\v 23 . For the Commandment [To wit, which is taken out of the Word and Law of God] is a Lamp, [compare Psalm 119.105.] and the law is a light: and the reproofs of discipline [To wit, which is done by discipline, or by instruction, which must preceed, or go before, if a man would attain unto wisdom. See of this word ab.ch.1.on verse 2.] are the way of life: [That is, which leadeth unto life: so the way of death, which leadeth unto death: see Jer.21.8. comp.ab.ch.2.on v.8.]
\p
\v 24 . To keep thee from the evil woman: [Hebr. Woman of evil; that is, that makes it her business to do evil; or, that getteth her living by doing evil] from the flatteries [that is, soothing, cogging, fair speaking. Comp.ab.ch.2.on ver.16.] of the strange tongue. [see above chap.2.on ver.16. and ch.5.3. and 7.5.]
\p
\v 25 . Lust not after her beauty in thine heart: neither let her take thee with her eyes-lids. [That is, with her fair looks, and with her lovely countenance.]
\p
\v 26 . For by a woman, (that) is an harlot, [Hebr. A woman, an harlot; that is, which is an harlot. So 1 Ki.3.16. also a woman, a Prophetess: that is, which was a Prophetess, Judg.4.4. a man, a Prophet; that is, which was a Prophet, Judg.6.8.] (a man cometh) to a piece of bread; [that is, to poverty, yea even to beggary] and a mans wife [that is, a woman that hath an husband, and yet desires to keep company with other men. Oth. A wife sick of a man. Some understand by a mans wife, one that is every mans wife] hunteth (for) the precious soul. [that is, she bringeth not onely the body of him, that enticeth her to uncleanness, into temporal destruction, but also his soul, which is his most precious and most worthy part, into everlasting suffering. Compare Ezek.13.18.]
\p
\v 27 . Shall any man take fire in his bosom, (so) that his cloaths be not burnt? [This question, as also the next to it, do deny strongly. See Genesis 18.on ver.17.]
\p
\v 28 . Shall any man go upon coals, [To wit, fiery, or red hot coals. See of this word, Job 41.on ver.12.] (so) that his feet be not burnt?
\p
\v 29 . So he that goeth ;in to his neighbours wife: [See Genesis 6. The Annotations on verse 4.] who so ever toucheth her, [that is, hath any dealings with her by carnal copulation: see the like phrase, Genesis 20.6. 1 Corinthians 7.1.] shall not be held guiltless. [that is, shall not go unpunished. See 1 Kings 2.on verse 9. And Job 9.on verse 28. As the two former similitudes laid down in the two former verses, are sure and certain, so is also this that is applied thereunto; to wit, that the adulterer hurteth and damnisieth himself in his estate, body, honour, and soul.]
\p
\v 30 . Men do not offer disgrace to a thief, when he stealeth to fill his soul. [That is, to satisfy himself; or, understand by soul, desire. See Gen.34.on verse 3. And Psalm 27.on verse 12.] seeing he is hungry; [intimating, that theft, or felony is not so great a sin as adultery is; and that felony which is chiefly committed through hunger and want, is not so heinously and severely punished, as adultery is: and this may be gathered from the particular dealing between the thief, and the party whom he hath robbed, as followeth in the next verse.]
\p
\v 31 . And being found he restoreth it sevenfold: [That is, manifold. Seven is often in scripture a certain number for an uncertain, as Genesis 4.15. Leviticus 26.18. Psalm 119.164. below chapter 24.16. and 26.25. signifying multitude. Those that had commited simple or bare theft, were to make onely two fold, or fourfold, or fivefold restitution, Exodus 22.1, etc. And 4. But some conceive that the punishment increased in Salomons time. Or it may be thus understood, that the thief agreeth to give the man so much, that he may nor bring him to shame and disgrace] he giveth all the goods of his house. [to wit, if he be so poor, that he cannot make manifold restitution.]
\p
\v 32 . (But) whose committeth adultery with a woman, is void of understanding; [Hebr. Is heartless, or, hath no heart, or, lacketh an heart; that is, hath no knowledge, understanding, nor, capacity, to apprehend what is pleasing unto God, honourable kin the sight of men, and profitable unto himself. See the same epithet, or appellation, below chap.7.7. and 9.4,16. And 10.13. and 11.12. and 15.21. and 17.18, &c. The word heart is often taken for the understanding. See Job 9.on verse 4.] he that doth it, [that is, he that committeth adultery] destroyeth his (own) soul:
\p
\v 33 . A blow, and dishonour shall he find, and his reproach shall not be blotted out: [Or, be put out, wiped away.]
\p
\v 34 . For jealousy is the rage of a man: and he will not spare [To wit, the adulterer] in the day of vengeance. [that is, when occasion shall serve, or offer it self, to take vengeance, or for a man to avenge himself. So the time when God would be avenged on the enemies of his Church, is called a day of vengeance, Isa.34.8. Compare Job 20.28. and 24.1. and below chap.11.4.]
\p
\v 35 . He will not accept any reconciliation: [Compare Numb.35.on verse 31. Hebrew, be will not accept the face of all reconciliation: that is, accept no ransom. See 1 Kings 11.on verse 34. Of the phrase, to accept the face, see Gen.32.on verse 20.] neither will he consent, though thou enlarge the gift. [Or, multiply gifts.]
\c 7
\s Salomon exhorteth to familiar, intimate, and strong society with wisdom, verse 1, &c. To be preserved from dangers of unchaste women, 5. Whereof he propoundeth a notably example, representing most lively the cunning practises of an adulterous woman, and the stupid and senseless seducing of a young man, with an earnest dehortation, to beware of such kind of lewdness, 6.&c.
\p
\v 1 . My son, keep my sayings; and lay up my Commandments with thee. [See Job 23.on verse 12.]
\p
\v 2 . Keep my commandments, and live; [That is, thou shalt surely live. That which is uttered in a commanding way, comprehendeth often in it a strong promise. See above chap.3. on verse 25. And chap.4.on verse 4. Also Lev.18.5.] and my law, [or, doctrine, see above chap.1.on verse 8.] as the apple of thine eyes. [to wit, which for its tenderness, must be very narrowly kept. See Deut.32.on verse 10.]
\p
\v 3 . Bind them to thy fingers, [That is, have them continually before thine eyes, for to remember them; and at hand, for to put them in practice. Compare Deut.6.on verse 8. And 11.18.] write them upon the table of thine heart. [see above chap.3.on verse 3.]
\p
\v 4 . Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinsman. [That is, love wisdom, and honour her, as if she were thy sister, or thy near kin, &c. The Hebrew word rendered here kinsman, is so taken, Ruth 2.1. Compare also Ruth. 3.2. and the annot.]
\p
\v 5 . That they may keep thee from the strange woman; [See above chapter 2.on verse 16.] from the unknown (woman) (which) flattereth with her sayings. [see above chap.2.on verse 16. Before mentioned.]
\p
\v 6 . For through the window of mine house, I looked through my lattice,
\p
\v 7 . And I saw among the simple ones, [See above chapter 1.on verse 4.] I perceived [see of the Hebrew word thus taken, Job 18.2. and the annotations] among the youths [Hebrew sons: that is, young men, or batchelors, as among us the word daughter is often taken for a maid or damsel] a young man void of understanding. [Hebr. Heartiless. See above chap.6.on verse 32.]
\p
\v 8 . Passing by in the street, near her corner, [To wit, the adulteresses corner. Meaning near the corner of her house, where she dwelt] and she went on the way of her house. [That is, on the way that led to her house. Although it may be that Salomon saw this with his own eyes; yet it seemeth that he propoundeth it by way of example, as a thing often happeneth, and that for instruction and admonition unto youth: as our Saviour likewise in the Gospel often alledgeth and produceth such examples and parables as this is.]
\p
\v 9 . In the glimmering, [To wit, of the evening. See of the Heb. Word, 2 Kin.7.on verse 5.] in the evening of the day, in the black night, and he darkness: [Hebrew blackness of the night; that is, when the night grew black by reason of darkness. So below chap.20.20. in the blackness of darkness; that is, when it is black, by reason of great darkness. And understand this verse both of the beginning and of the consequence of this dealing or course of life.]
\p
\v 10 . And behold, (there) met him a woman in the attire. [The Hebrew word signifieth properly an habit, apparel, dressing, or ornament, that is well fitted to the body, and fitted neat and handsome on it. Compare Psalm 73.6.] of an harlot, and with the heart on her guard: [Hebrew, kept, or, guarded in heart; or, furnished with wit, or senses: that is, double, cunning, crafty, and exceedingly furnished and provided with all manner of subtil wiliness to deceive, and not to be deceived.]
\p
\v 11 . This (women) was stirring [That is, unquiet in mind, loose or dissolute into tongue, light in behaviour or gesture, very busy in vain and idle actions: or, prattling. So bel.chap.9.13.] and stubborn: [or, declining, to wit, from all good manners, and from obedience to her husband] her feet abode not [Hebr. Dwelt not; so is the Hebrew word taken, Exod.40.35. Judges 5.16.] in her house.
\p
\v 12 . Now being without, anon in the streets, [Hebrew by turn, by turn; that is, at one time without, at another time in the streets. Understand by without, the place, and room, or space, which is before door; by the streets, the common passages, and lanes, that run through the City, and without it] and lurking at all corners.
\p
\v 13 . And she caught him, and kissed him; strengthened [Or, stiffened] her face, [that is, she laid aside all shame and grace, was bold and impudent, and (as we use to say) put on a braze face. Compare Deut.28. the annot.on verse 50. Oth. Gathered together] and said unto him:
\p
\v 14 . Thank-offerings [See of these, Lev.3.on verse 1.whereof those, that brought them unto the Lord, had their share; wherewith they then made merry with their friends] are with me; [or, thank-offerings are upon me; that is, the vow or promise to offer thank-offerings] this day have I paid my vows. [that is, performed that which I promised: see Psalm 50.14. and 61.9. and 65.2. Nahum.1.15. Of vows, see Lev.7.on verse 16.]
\p
\v 15 . Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, [The Hebrew word signifieth properly to seek a thing betimes in the morning: but it is generally taken for all kind of diligent seeking: see Job 7.on ver.21. for here it is not spoken of the morning, but of the evening-tide] and I have found thee.
\p
\v 16 . I have fitted my bed-stead with tapestry-ornament, [The Hebrew word, which is onely found here, and below chap.31.19. seemeth to signify any kind of bed-ornament, as costly tapestries, and curiously wrought blankets, or coverleds, wherewith the beds were not onely covered, but in a singular manner adorned and set out] with carved works, [meaning engravings, and cuttings in, which for ornaments sake were curiously carved and hollowed out in the bed-stead, whereon the bed lay] with fine linen [Hebr. Tape, or thread, whereby some understand very fine white, and costly linen, that was made of such kind of threads, and belonged to the bed. Compare Gen. Chap.41,42. 1 Kings chap.10.28. and below chap.31.22. some conceive that those threads or wines, which were very fine and costly, ran between the tapestries, or hangings, to mark a difference between the pictures that might be wrought or woven upon them. Others conceive that the bed-stead was for ornaments sake twisted about with these costly threds or ribbons] of Egypt.
\p
\v 17 . I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cynamom.
\p
\v 18 . Come, let us be drunk with loves [Compare above cha.5.19. and the annot. Thereon] until morning; let us solace our selves with great love. [Hebr. Loves, in the plural number.]
\p
\v 19 . For the man [She speaketh this in contempt of her husband, as if he were her husband no more: as she also for that cause straightway faith, in this house, for at home] is not in his house; he is gone a far way. [Hebr. Away from far; that is, a far way: so Jeremiah 31.10. Iles from, or, afar off; that is, that lie afar off.]
\p
\v 20 . He hath taken a bundle of money in his hand; [That is, with him: see 2 Samuel 8.on verse 10. And 2 Kings 15.on verse 5. She speaketh this, to signify that he would tarry a long while away] he will come to his house at the time appointed. [that is, at the time that hath set me, and which will be long yet ere it be expired. See of the Hebrew word, Psalm 81.4. and the Annot.]
\p
\v 21 . She moved him [Hebr. Caused him to revolt, or, inclined him] by the multitude of her instruction: [the Hebrew word signifieth for the most part a good instruction, or doctrine, whereby a man is taught and instructed for the obtaining of wisdom and virtue, above chapter 1.5. but here being taken in a bad sense, it is as much as a deceitful and alluring persuasion by fair and smooth words, whereby a man is seduced to his own hurt and damage] she forced him by the flattering of her lips. [Otherwise also called lips of flattery, Psalm 12.3,4. Hebrew smoothness, or, slipperiness of her lips.]
\p
\v 22 . He went after her straightway, as an oxe goeth to the slaughter, and as a fool to the correction of the stocks: [in the Hebrew the words are inverted, thus: as the stocks to the correction of the fool; that is, as the fool, to wit, goeth to the correction or chastisement of the stocks, that is, to be punished and chastised with the stocks, or with irons. Oth. As the fool with the stocks, or, irons of correction. The Hebrew word rendered here correction, signifieth not onely the instruction, which is done by words, as above chap.1,2. And below chapter 16.22, &c. But also the chastisement, which is done by actual punishment, as below chap.22.15. and 23.13. Jer.30.ver.14. Ezek.5.15.]
\p
\v 23 . Until the dart [That is, a cruel, sharp, and very deep entering, and piercing through plague, or punishment. See Deuteronomy 32. On verse 23. And Job 6.on verse 4.] cut him through his liver, [that is, inflamed his lust with unhappy delight, spoiled his bossy with unsoundness, and rottenness, and disquieted his spirit with the sense and apprehension of Gods wrath] as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is against his life. [to wit, hung up, laid, or spread abroad, to take away his life, (Hebr. Soul.)]
\p
\v 24 . Now then, children, [See above chap.1.on verse 8.] hearken unto me: and attend to the sayings of my mouth.
\p
\v 25 . Let not thine heart decline to her ways: [That is, course of life, doing and omitting, dealing and conversation: see Gen.6.on verse 12. Take in the same sense the following word paths] go not astray in her paths.
\p
\v 26 . For she hath cast down many wounded, and all her slain [That is, those whom he hath killed and slain] are mighty many. [Oth. Strong; that is, courageous, valiant; according to the body in power, or according to the spirit in wisdom, or according to both, as Samson, David, Salomon, &c. The Hebrew word is taken for many in number, Psalm 139.17. Jer.5.6. and 15.8. for mighty, or strong, Genesis 18.18. Exodus 1.7,9. Deuteronomy 7.1.]
\p
\v 27 . Her house are the ways of the grave, [That is, which lead to the grave. Oth. To hell: for the Hebrew word signifieth both. See Genesis 37.on verse 35. Both significations may here take place] going down to the inner chambers of death. [not onely of corporal, but also of spiritual, and eternal death.]
\c 8
\s The eternal, essential wisdom of the Father (the son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ) is here brought in, preaching to all sorts of people openly and plainly, verse 1. Of her doctrine, 6. Excellency, 10. Nature, 12. Soveraign power and dominion, 15. With a relation of the blessedness of those that do embrace her, 17. Also of her eternal Godhead, incomprehensible generation of the Father, and union with him, 22. Of her saving office, and familiar revelation to the children of men, 31. Exhorting to obedience, with a promise of salvation; and dehorting from disobedience, upon pain of everlasting destruction, 32.
\p
\v 1 . Doth not wisdom cry? [As if he should say, assuredly she doth. It is a kind of asking, or questioning, which implieth a strong affirmation, or asseveration. See Gen.13.on verse 9.] doth (not) understanding lift up [Hebr. Give. See above chap.1.on verse 20.] her voice?
\p
\v 2 . She standeth on the top of the high places. [Hebr. In the head of the high places. Hereby may be understood the places that were on high, or exalted, from whence Teachers might propound and communicate their good doctrine and instruction to the Church and people of God. Compare 2 Chron.24. verse 20. Nehem.chap.8. verse 5. Mat.10.verse 27. Acts 22.3.] at the way [understand the high way, or road, by which much people did pass] in the place where paths are: [ Hebr. (in, or, upon) the house of paths, or, ways; that is, in the place of the paths, or ways. Understand the cross ways, where many paths or ways meet together as in a house or place. House for place, see Exodus 25.on verse 27.]
\p
\v 3 . She [To wit, wisdom] cryeth [Oth. They cry; to wit, wisdom, and understanding. See therefore above verse 1. The first is better as appeareth by the following sixth verse, where the singular number is used also, see below verse 12.] aloud at the side of the gate, [Hebr. At the hand of the gates. Hand for side, see 2 Sam.chap.18.on verse 4. Oth. At the place of the gates] before the city, [Hebr. At the mouth of the city; that is, at the entry thereof, as the following words declare. So the mouth of the pit, or, well, Gen.29.2. the mouth of the cave, Jos.10.18.] (at) the entry of the doors.
\p
\v 4 . unto you; O men, I call, and my voice is to the children of men. [Some conceive, that by men, here must be understood those that are eminent among men for nobility, wealth, and power, and are otherwise called the sons or children of (great) men, and that by the sons, or, children of men, here are meant the common sort of people. See Psalm 49.on verse 3.]
\p
\v 5 . Ye simple ones, [See above chap.1.on verse 4.] understand subtility: [see on the same place] and ye fools, [see above chap.1.on verse 22.] understand (with the) heart.
\p
\v 6 . Hear; for I will speak of Princely things; [Heb. Of princes: to wit, of the things, but of glorious, excellent, and transcendent things, which become Princes, and great Lords, not onely because they likewise concern them, but also because they ought to be heard and received by them, yea even to be propounded by them. Compare Prov.22.20.] and the opening of my lips [that is, that which I will utter by the opening of my lips] shall be meer equity.
\p
\v 7 . For my palace [Or, the roof of my mouth. Understand under one member whereby speech is here said to be heard, all the rest, that likewise help and conduce thereunto, as lips, teeth, tongue, and throat. See Job 33. On verse 2.] shall utter truth discreetly: and wickedness is an abomination to my lips. [Hebr. An abomination of my lips, that is, which my lips do loath and abominate, to wit, to speak it. See above chap.3.on verse 32.]
\p
\v 8 . All the sayings of my mouth are in righteousness: (there) is nothing forward or perverse in them. [Comp. Job 5.on verse 13.]
\p
\v 9 . They are all right [Or, ready at hand. The Hebrew word signifieth, either that which is right and straight, or that which is ready at hand, present, and obvious to the sight, and very ready, open, plain, and easy to be understood. So 2 Sam.15.3. and 24.26.] for him that is of understanding, and upright to them that find [that is, get, obtain. See Genes.26.12. and the annot.] knowledge.
\p
\v 10 . Receive my instruction, and not silver: [That is, more then silver, as the following words of this verse do shew. That which is spoken in general, is oftentimes but in some respect, and by way of comparison to be understood. Compare Isa.43.18. Jer.7.22. and 16.14. Hos 6.6. Mat.23.3. 1 Cor.1.17.] and knowledge more then choice gold digged out. [see above chap.3.on verse 14. Also below verse 19.]
\p
\v 11 . For wisdom is better then rubies; [See Job 28.on verse 18. Compare Job 28.15. Psalm 19.11. Pro.1.14,15. And 16.16.] and whatsoever may be desired, is not to be compared to it. [Heb. All delights, or, desires will not be compared to it. See above chap.3.on verse 15.]
\p
\v 12 . I wisdom dwell (with) subtility; [That is, I possess, enjoy, and use subtility, as which onely belongeth to me, and waiteth upon me. Of the word rendered here subtility, see above chap.1.on verse 4.] and find (out) the knowledge of all discretion. [of the word rendered here discretion, see on the same verse.]
\p
\v 13 . The fear of the LORD, is to hate evil; [That is, the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning, and the chiefest part of wisdom, above chap.1.7. causeth and moveth a man to hate evil] pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, [see above chap.2.on verse 12.] also the mouth of frowardnesses [see on the same verse] do I hate.
\p
\v 14 . Counsel, and essence [Or, durable essence, or, durable wisdom. See above chap.2.on verse 7.] are mine: I am understanding, strength is mine.
\p
\v 15 . By me Kings reign, and Princes decree [From this word cometh another, which signifieth Law-givers, or Law-makers, Gen.49.10. Deut.33.21. Judg.5.14.] justice. [that is, good and just laws, according to which subjects ought to be governed.]
\p
\v 16 . By me Rulers rule, and Princes, [See Job.12.on verse 21.] all the judges of the earth.
\p
\v 17 . I love them that love me, and those that seek me early. [See of the Hebrew word, Job.7.on verse 21. And above chap.7.on verse 15.] stall find me. [see 2 Chron.15.on verse 2.]
\p
\v 18 . Riches and honour is with me; [Compare above chap.3.16.] durable wealth, and righteousness.
\p
\v 19 . My fruit [See above chap.1.on verse 31.] is better then gold digged out, [see above chap.3.on verse 14.] and then thick gold: [see 1 Kings 10.on verse 18. Oth. Gold of uphaz, who conceive that Paz is here put for uphaz, the name of a place, from whence much precious fine gold cometh, Jer.10.9. to wit, a place in Barbary, (according to the opinion of some) now called Fez] and my revenue, then choice silver.
\p
\v 20 . I cause to walk in the way of righteousness: [That is, in the manner and course of life, which men ought to follow, that they may according to the law, perform the duty, which they owe first unto God, and then in the next place unto their neighbour. See above chap.2. on verse 8.] in the midst of the paths of judgement:
\p
\v 21 . That I may cause my lovers to inherit that which is durable: [Meaning such wealth or substance, as is such really, and indeed, and bringeth to man the greatest happiness and prosperity, that is, which abideth for ever; not seeming to be such, but being such really, indeed, and in truth] and I will fill their treasures.
\p
\v 22 . The LORD [Meaning the everlasting Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that is, the first Person of the everlasting Godhead] possessed me [that is, had me in, and with him, being begotten of him in an unconceivable and incomprehensible manner, John 1.15. Heb.1,3,15. (me) to wit, the essential wisdom, the substantial Word of the Father, or the second Person of the Divine Essence, the everlasting, and onely begotten Son and true God: of whom see also above chap.1.20. and here verse 12. John 1.1. Col.1.15.] (in the) beginning of his may, [that is, of his working, as of the Creation, yea also of his eternal counsel, and purpose to create the world, as the following words do shew] before his works, [that is, from all eternity, when as yet there was nothing made] from thence forth. [when there was nothing but God, and nothing but Eternity. Compare Psalm 93.2.]
\p
\v 23 . I was anoint [That is, ordained and appointed as a Princess, to create, sustain, and govern the world] from everlasting, from the beginning, [compare John 1.1.] from the antiquities of the earth. [that is, before the earth, ere the earth was created. Compare below verse 25,26.]
\p
\v 24 . When as yet (there) were no depths, I was brought forth: [So is the Hebrew word taken, Psalm 51.7. and so in the verse following] when as yet (there) were no fountains, heavy with water: [Hebr. Heavinesses of waters, that is, great plenty or abundance of water: or, burdened with water: that is, full of water, and abounding with water.]
\p
\v 25 . Before the mountains were fastened in: [That is, were crushed in, founded, and set forth. The Hebrew word seemeth to imply, that the mountains have their foundation below in the waters] before the hills was brought forth.
\p
\v 26 . He [Namely, the Lord, above verse 22.] had not as yet made the earth, [the Hebrew particle ad, or gnad, is elsewhere also taken. See Job 1.18. and the annot. Or, Hebr. Until he had not made the earth: that is, before he had made the earth] nor the fields, [the Hebrew word signifieth the places, that are without the houses and the cities, as streets, and the fields. It’s here taken for the fields, as also Psalm 144.13. Ezek.7.15.] nor the beginning [Hebr. Head, that is, the beginning. So Numb.10.10. Eccl.3.11. Ezek.40.1.] of the dusts of the world. [the meaning is, that the least or smallest dust was not as yet made.]
\p
\v 27 . When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he drew a circle upon the plain of the depth. [That is, upon the deep waters. Or, drew, ordered, set a circle. This is said, in regard of the fashion of the earth, which was made round by God, so that it compasseth about the deep waters, and is compassed about by them. The meaning is, that God made the earth round as with a pair of compasses. Comp. Job 26.10.]
\p
\v 28 . When he fastened the upper clouds above: [To wit, that keeping their place, they might not fall down upon the earth] when he made sure the fountains of the deep. [that is, gave them a sure, and continual course. Comp. Gen.7.11.]
\p
\v 29 . When he set the Seather Park, [Hebr. Statute, ordinance, decree; that is, park, or bounds, within which she was to keep her self. See Gen.1.10. Job 38.10,11. Psalm 104.9.] that the waters should not transgress his command: [Hebr. Mouth. See Gen.41.on ver.40.] when be appointed [or, instituted, or, described] the foundations of the earth.
\p
\v 30 . Then was I a nurse-child with him, [To wit, as a nurse-child, that is continually with his nurse. So was the eternal Son of God, the substantial wisdom of the Father, from everlasting distinctly with him, as it is written, John 1.1. The word was with God; also chap.17.5. Glorify me with the glory which I had with thee before the world was. But the word may also be taken for him, that of himself feedeth, and nourisheth; the Translation being thus made, and I am nourishing with him; that is, upholding and governing all things, and especially bringing up, and nourishing his Church with his Word and Spirit] and I was daily [Heb. Day, day; that is, daily, always. See Gen.39.on verse 10. And below verse 34.] (his) delights: [hereby is intimated by a figurative kind of speech, the great acceptableness of the Son of God with his Father: see Mat.3.17. John 5.10. and 8.29. Oth. And I a daily delight; to wit, to the creatures, by my general and special blessings, John 5.17.] rejoicing always before his face.
\p
\v 31 . Sporting in the world of his earth; [To wit, in that she sheweth her self exceeding wonderful and various in the upholding and governing of all creatures] and my delights are with the children of men. [to wit, in respect of this present life, and the life that is to come.]
\p
\v 32 . Now then, (O ye) children, hearken unto me: for blessed are they (that) keep my ways. [That is, the ways which I prescribe unto them. Compare Psalm 119.1,2. And 128.1. Luke 11.28.]
\p
\v 33 . Hear instruction, and be wise, and reject (it) not. [Compare above chap.1.25. where the same Hebrew word is used.]
\p
\v 34 . Blessed is the man that hearkeneth unto me, watching daily at my gates, observing postes of my doors. [A similitude taken from diligent Students or Scholars, that are always about the schools, or teaching place of their teachers; or from solicitors, that diligently heed and mind the coming forth of the Lawyers and Counsellors; or from the porters and door-keepers of the Temple, that were stedfastly to mind their business, and the work they were about.]
\p
\v 35 . For whoso findeth me, findeth life, and draweth [Or, getteth] well-liking from the LORD. [that is, obtaineth favour, and grace with the Lord. See the same phrase below chap.12.2. and 18.12.]
\p
\v 36 . But he that sinneth (against) me, offereth violence [Or, wrong, or, oppression] to his (own) soul [Hebr. Is an oppressor, or, wronger, or, abuser of his (own) soul. See the following clause of this verse, also below chap.20.2.] all they that hate me, [they are said to hate God, and his wisdom, that do wittingly, and willingly that which God, and his wisdom, that do wittingly, and willingly that which God, and his wisdom hate. See of such kind of people, Psalm 21.9. and 83.3. Rom.1.30.] love death. [that is, they do that, whereby they bring death and destruction upon themselves. So, to love the curse, Psalm 109.verse 17. To lie in wait for his own blood, above chap.1.18. to despise his (own) soul, below, chap.15.32.]
\c 9
\s Here the work of grace wrought by our Lord Jesus, who calleth and bringeth his people by his Word and Spirit unto blessed communion and fellowship with him (the Supreme wisdom,) is propounded under the parable and similitude of making a Feast, and inviting of guests, verse 1, &c. With an opposition of the nature and condition of the scorners, and of the wise, 7. And on the contrary the deceitful and destructive work of Satan, under the parable of a foolish woman, (enemy to Supreme Wisdom) who also biddeth and inviteth her guests, but to their everlasting destruction, 13, etc.
\p
\v 1 . The Supreme Wisdom [Hebr. Wisdoms. See above chap.1.20.] hath builded her house: [Understand by this house, the Congregation of true believers, whose building is begun here by the Preaching of the Gospel, and the working of the holy Ghost, but shall be finished hereafter by the perfecting and consummating of the children of God. Others understand by this house, their or highest heaven, wherein the elect shall be abundantly filled and satisfied with all manner of good things] she hath hewen out her seven [that is, many. A certain number for an uncertain, see above chap.6.verse 31.] pillars. [by these are understood by many, the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Evangelists, Pastors, and Teachers. Others understand by these pillars, the stability, and the everlasting duration and continuance of the heavenly house of the Father, into which Christ is gone before us, to prepare a place for us, John 14.2.]
\p
\v 2 . She hath killed [To wit, to dress, and then to set before the guests: so Gen.43.16. 1 Sam.25.11.] her slay-cattle, [meaning the Word of God, the true food of the soul, together with all spiritual and soul-saving mercies, which are promised therein, and presented or offered unto us in the sacraments, upon which will follow the perfect joy of the life to come] she hath mingled her wine; [this looks at the custom then in use in hot countries, where they mingled their wine with water, to mitigate and allay the strength thereof, or mingled kit with divers spices, below verse 5. And 23.30. Isa.5.22. and 65.11.] she hath also furnished her table. [to wit, by setting the several messes or dishes upon it in due order. Compare the phrase with Psalm 23.6. and 78.19. Isa.21.5.]
\p
\v 3 . She hath sent forth her hand-maids: [Understand by these, the Ministers of the Word of God, who by Christ are sent forth to call and invite men to the communion and fellowship of the Church, and of all spiritual good things, that are therein distributed, 2 Cor.5.19,20.] she inviteth upon the pinnacles, [Hebr. Wings: that is, low walls, or leanings made above upon the flat roofs of high buildings, that those that went upon the roof, might be out of danger of falling down: see Deut.22 on verse 8. And compare above chap.8.2.] of the high places of the City.
\p
\v 4 . Who is simple? Let him turn (in) hither: [That is, whosoever is simple, let him turn in to me. They are the words of wisdom: see of the word simple, above ch.1.on verse 4.] to him that is void of understanding, [see above chap.6.on verse 32.] she saith:
\p
\v 5 . Come, [To wit, whosoever thou art of those that want understanding] eat of my bread, and drink of the wine, which I have mingled. [spiritual and eternal good things are often compared to corporal and transitory good things, and therefore also represented and signifieth by them: Psalm 23.2,5. Wisdom is here resembled to a King, that keepeth open Court, compare Mat.22.2,3, &c.]
\p
\v 6 . Forsake simplicities, [So is the Hebrew word taken above, chap.1.22. Oth. Let the simple ones go: or, forsake the simple ones, or, foolish] and live; [a command, containing in it a promise, that they shall live, see above chap.3.on verse 25.] and tread in the way of understanding. [that is, in the way, whereby men attain to right understanding, and true wisdom, and which men of understanding do walk in. See 1 Kings 8.on ver.36.]
\p
\v 7 . Whoso reproveth [The word signifieth here properly to instruct, admonish, and reprove with words, and with sayings onely. So Deut.4.26. Job 4.3. 1 Chron.15.22. elsewhere it signifieth also to chastify and correct with blows, and punishing, as 1 Kings 12.11. Ps.6.2.] the scorner, [see Psalm 1.verse 1.] getteth to himself shame; [to wit, because he doth labour in vain, and is reviled by him, whom he reproveth. Comp. Mat.7.6.] and he that rebuketh the wicked, (getteth) his (own) blemish. [the original word signifieth commonly a blemish of the body, as Lev.28.17. and 22.20. 2 Sam.14.25. but it is also taken for a blemish of the soul, touching faith and manners, or a good name, in respect of the event of a thing, or action, as here, and Deu.32.5. Job 11.15.]
\p
\v 8 . Reprove not the scorner, left he hate thee: [Compare Mat.7.6.] reprove the wise [that is, he that loveth wisdom, is godly and honest. So in the next verse] and he will love thee.
\p
\v 9 . Teach [Hebr. Give: to wit, wholesome instruction] the wise, so he will be yet wiser: instruct the righteous, so he will increase in learning [so above chap.1.5. see the annot.]
\p
\v 10 . The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: [Compare Job 28.28. Psalm 111.10. above ch.1.7.] and the knowledge of the holy (ones, or Saints) [that is, the knowledge werewith the saints are endowed, and which they shew forth and represent unto others. Understand by holy ones or saints true believers; so they are called, Psalm 16.3. and 34.10. and 89.6,8. Below chap.30.3. Hos.12.verse 1.1. Cor.1.2. see the reason, 1 Cor.6.11. Oth. Understand here by holy (ones, or Saints) kin the plural number, because he is threefold in persons] is understanding.
\p
\v 11 . For by me shall thy days be multiplied: [See ab.chap.3.2. and the annotations, and below chap.10.27. and understand by me, the supreme wisdom, who here produceth a reason of her former exhortations] and years of life shall be added unto thee. [ Hebr. Shall they add unto thee; that is, shall be added; to wit, by him, that addeth, or multiplieth them, which is God; see of this phrase, Job 4.on verse 19.]
\p
\v 12 . If thou art wise, thou art wise for thy self: [That is, for thine own benefits, and advantage. God hath no benefit or profit by it, Psalm 16.2.] and (if) thou art a scorner, thou alone shalt bear it. [that is, thy self alone shall have the shame and blame of it; not God, nor his eternal wisdom.]
\p
\v 13 . A foolish woman [Heb. Woman of folly, or, foolishness. This woman is propounded, and set forth in this chapter, as the chiefest adversary and enemy to true wisdom, inviting all men unto her, as wisdom before did. Understand by the foolish woman, whatsoever crosseth truth or soundness of doctrine, and integrity of life. Others conceive that here properly an adulteress is described, and that then by her the forementioned foolish woman is represented] is clamorous, [see above chap.7.on verse 11.] simplicity (it self); [that is, which is very simple, full of folly, and bad senses] and knoweth nothing at all. [to wit, to instruct a man, what he should believe, and how he ought to live.]
\p
\v 14 . And she [To wit, the forementioned foolish woman: that is, folly, who is here described by her boldness, pride, and manifold practises to seduce and deceive men] sitteth at the door of her house on a seat, (on) the high places of the City.
\p
\v 15 . To call those, that pass by (on) the way, that make their paths right, [That is, that go right on their way, without looking back after the foolish woman. Comp.ab.ch.3.6.] (saying;)
\p
\v 16 . Who is simple? Let him turn (in) hither: [Compare these words with the words of wisdom, above verse 4. Which folly here desires to counterfeit and imitate, that by open reviling and contemning of wisdoms instruction, she might draw men off unto her self] to him that wanteth understanding, she saith;
\p
\v 17 . Stolen waters are sweet, and hidden bread is pleasant. [Understand hereby, false doctrine, vain and empty riches, and transitory pleasures, which folly imparteth unto her ministers and servants. They are called stolen waters, and hidden, or secret bread, because they are compared to the secret carnal copulation of those, that live in adultery. For as this is practised with much craft and secrecy, and also is far more pleasing and delightful unto corrupt flesh, then the pure and undefiled coming together of man and wife in the state of wedlock. So in false doctrine, there is nothing but crafty deceit, and in fading and transitory riches, which folly promiseth, a greater delight for the flesh in this world. Compare below chap.20.17. and 30.20. and the Annotations. By hidden, or, secret bread, in this place, is meant riches that are ill gotten, and as ill spent; to wit, gotten by secret, false, and crafty underminings, and spent wasted by useless, shameful, and immoderate actions, which are ashamed of the light. Bread is put for all manner of temporal goods: see above chap.4.on verse 17.]
\p
\v 18 . But he [To wit, the passenger, whom the foolish woman inviteth home to her house] knoweth not, [the former words were spoken and uttered by folly, but these the dead [see above chap.2.on verse 18.] are there, [to wit, in the house of the foolish woman] (and that) her guests are in the depths of bell. [to wit, of death temporal, and eternal.]
\c 10
\s Of wise and foolish children, verse 1. Of unjust and just riches, and poverty, 2,3,15,22. Of idleness and diligence, 4,5,26. Of the blessing and prosperity of the righteous, and of the misery and calamity of the wicked, 6,7,16,24,25,27,28,29,30. Of wisdom and folly in speaking, 8,9,10,11,13,14,19,20,21,31,32. Of uprightness and perverseness in conversation, 9. Of the winking of the eyes, 10. Of hatred and love, 12. Of discipline, 17. Of backbiting, 18. Of the contrary delight of the foolish, and the wise, 23.
\p
\v 1 . The Proverbs of Salomon. [The nine foregoing Chapters are as preface, to stir men up to give diligent attention unto the ensuing Proverbs, which for the most part are divers and different, & depend not one upon another. They are as so many rules concerning the faith, good manners, & faults, or defects of men] A wise son maketh the father glad: [understand under the name of Father, the mother also, and under the following name of Mother, the father likewise. Compare below chap.15.20.] but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.
\p
\v 2 . Treasures of wickedness [That is, which are wrongfully gotten, and likewise wickedly abused] profit nothing; but righteousness [by righteousness in the general, is meant love and fidelity, which a man oweth to his neighbour, according to the second Table, and principally according to the eighth Commandment. Some understand the word righteousness in particular of almisdeeds, and works of mercy and charity unto the poor, as Daniel 4.24.] delivereth from death. [to wit, not because she is able to do it of her self, or hath deserved it by her own worthiness, but because God hath so graciously promised to reward her. So below chapter 11.4.]
\p
\v 3 . The LORD suffereth not the soul of the righteous to famish; but he thrusteth away the substance [Oth. Perverseness; that is, riches perversely gotten, or, gotten by perverseness] of the wicked.
\p
\v 4 . He that worketh with a deceitful hand, [Hebrew with an hand-palm of deceit; that is, with an unfaithful, slack, and slow hand, and so by fraud and deceit draweth or haleth his neighbours goods to himself. Deceit is used for slothfulness, below chap.19.25. Jer.48.10. as therefore also deceit is opposed unto diligence, as here, and below, chap.12.24,27. For those that are idle, and lazy, and are loath to work, are wont to use deceit, whereby they endeavour to get their living, but poverty is their reward at last, as followeth in the Text] becometh poor: [Oth. A deceitful balance maketh poor] but the hand of the diligent maketh rich. [so below chap.12.24.]
\p
\v 5 . He that gathereth in Summer, [To wit, his fruits, or that which he hath growing in the field. Compare abo.chap.6.8.] is a wise son: (but) he that sleepeth securely in the harvest, is a son that maketh ashamed. [to wit, he shames himself, and also his parents; namely, by his faults and misdemeanors. So below chap.12.4. and 14.35. and 17.2. and 19.26. and 26.7. This proverb may fitly by way of comparison be understood of a man, who while he is yet young and lusty, taketh pains, that he may have somewhat to keep him when he is old. See above chap.6.8.]
\p
\v 6 . Blessings [To wit, both temporal, and eternal] are upon the head of the righteousness: [this seemeth to look at the old custom of pronouncing any blessing; because this was done by laying the hand upon the head of him that was blessed. See Gen.48.on verse 14. Or it may be also thus understood, that the righteous being blessed themselves, do likewise impart and communicate the blessing unto others, but that the mouth of the wicked is full of meer violence, as followeth in the words of the Text] but violence [understand malice, cruelty, injustice, extortion, and oppression, which they have used] covereth the mouth of the wicked. [that is, bringeth them to death. See Job 40.on verse 8. Or covereth them with shame, as with a garment. Compare Psalm 44.16. and 69.8. or filleth them with plagues and punishments until their very mouth be full.]
\p
\v 7 . The memory of the just shall be a blessing: [That is, shall tend to his praise, and honourable report, when they shall make mention of him, either being absent, or also being dead] but the name of the wicked shall rot. [or, purify, and grow stinking, and consequently perish.]
\p
\v 8 . He that is wise in heart, receiveth the Commandments: [To wit, which teach a man how to order his life and conversation aright, so as that the he may please God, and edify his neighbour, and so get Gods blessing upon himself] but he that is foolish in lips, [that is, he that speaketh forward and perverse things, whereby with an obstinate mind he casteth away all good instruction, and admonition, boasting that he will abide by his had opinion, and evil intent and purpose, having together with the folly of the lips, also the folly of the heart: for out of the abundance of this do the lips speak, Mat.12.34. compare above chap.2.12. and 4.24. and 6.12.] shall be overthrown. [see of the Hebrew word, Hos.4.on verse 14. So below verse 10.]
\p
\v 9 . He that walketh in uprightness, [See above chap.2.on verse 7.] walketh surely: [or, quietly, because he knoweth that his works are good, and that God will suffer no evil event to follow upon it to his destruction] but he that perverteth his ways, [compare Gen.6.on verse 12.] shall be known. [to wit, by public punishments, which God shall send upon him in the sight of all men, and that by the hand or means of the Magistrate, or otherwise.]
\p
\v 10 . He that winketh with the eye [That is, secretly plotteth and contriveth sin, and seeketh to carry it on neatly and smoothly. Compare above chap.6.13.] procureth sorrow; and one foolish in lips [see above on verse 8.] shall be overthrown. [see above, the same verse.]
\p
\v 11 . The mouth of the righteous is a well-spring of life [To wit, from whence words do issue and proceed, which do not onely instruct, admonish and strengthen others unto life eternal, but also are serviceable unto the righteous that doth so for that very end purpose, namely, to bring him unto life eternal. Compare bel.chap.13.14. and 14.27. and 16.22.] but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. [See above on ver.6.]
\p
\v 12 . Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love [Namely, the love of him, that hath suffered wrong at his neighbours hands, or seeth him to be fallen into any infirmity] covereth all transgressions. [to wit, by bearing, or in a friendly way reproving them, and not by divulging or spreading them abroad. Understand this of particular and private sins, and such as may be concealed with a good conscience. Again it must be understood not of our own transgressions committed against God, but of other mens sins and transgressions committed against us. So 1 Cor.13.4. 1 Pet.4.8.]
\p
\v 13 . In the lips of him that hath understanding, wisdom is found: [And therefore he getteth also honour and reward; as on the contrary, the foolish one getteth stripes, because folly is found in his lips, as followeth in the Text] but the rod [that is, the punishment which happeneth by strips and blows. So below ch.23.13. and 26.3. and 29.15.] (is) upon the back of him that lacketh understanding. [Hebr. That wanteth a heart. See above chapter 6.on verse 32. The word heart is here taken for the mind, and understanding of man. See Job 9.on verse 4. Compare below chapter 20.30.]
\p
\v 14 . Wise men lay up knowledge. [Heb. Hide, &c. That is, as men do use to lay up their treasure, and to lock up their provision, as meat and drink, &c. To bring them forth at times convenient: so wise men do gather and lay up a stock of knowledge, to produce and utter the same when it shall be seasonable and profitable unto others, or else to make use of it their own selves] but the mouth of the foolish is near unto disturbance. [or, astonishment, terror: that is, mischief, trouble, grievance, at which a man is wont to be affrighted and astonished, occasioned by foolish, impudent, unadvised, and unseasonable words and speechs.]
\p
\v 15 . The rich mans wealth is a city of his strength: the poverty of the mean ones [Hebr. Of the thin ones; that is, of those that have very little] is their disturbance. [the meaning is, he that is money-less, is also heartless, and is afraid that he shall perish; and that he that is wealth, is for the most part also bare of courage: as on the contrary, those that have great riches and store of wealth, do commonly rely upon them, and think that they are very safe and secure against all harm and danger.]
\p
\v 16 . The labour of the righteous [To wit, whereby he doth any thing that is good and honest, for to get his living by it. Or, understand whatsoever he intendeth, speaketh, or doth] is unto life: [that is, tendeth to his prosperity, and to his good, Rom.8.28.] the revenue of the wicked [meaning his means, or all that proceedeth from him, and from his actions] is unto sin. [that is, tendeth to sin, or leadeth him to the doing of evil, and consequently to his eternal destruction; for the wages of sin is death. Rom.6.23.]
\p
\v 17 . The path unto life [To wit, the path leading unto life] is his that keepeth discipline: [or thus: he that keepeth discipline, is a path of life; or is (in) the path of life] but he that forsaketh reproof, causeth to erre, [to wit, himself, and others, that thus get both together into destruction.]
\p
\v 18 . He that hideth hatred, is (a man) of false lips, and he that uttereth an ill report, the same is a fool. [The meaning is, that both of them do ill, as well those that privily hate their neighbour, though they speak not evil of him, as those that openly backbite, and slander him, and wrong him in his own good name. Oth. He that hideth hatred (with) false lips, and he that uttereth an evil report, the same is a fool. Oth. False lips cover hatred, etc.]
\p
\v 19 . In the multitude of words [To wit, which are spoken idlely, indiscreetly, proceeding from a vain heart, and from evil and corrupt affections] (there) wanteth not transgression: but he that refraineth his lips is wise (or prudent.)
\p
\v 20 . The tongue of the righteous is choice silver: [That is, is like unto choice silver, to wit, in acceptableness value, and profit] the heart of the wicked is little (worth). [or, surely mean; and therefore his tongue also, which uttereth all that the heart hath in it. Hebr. Is as little. The letter Caph. Signifying as is by the Hebrews sometimes taken for certainly, truly, surely so. See Genesis 27.on verse 12. And Nehem.7.on verse 2.]
\p
\v 21 . The lips of the righteous feed many: [To wit, according to the soul, by wholesome instruction, exhortation, reproof, comfort, whereby also the righteous man benefitteth himself unto life everlasting] but fool, die [that is, perish both in soul and body] for want of understanding. [Hebr. For want of heart: that is, for want of understanding; to wit, whereby they are not onely disable from feeding others with good and wholesome doctrine, but also disable from sitting and composing themselves, to know God, to fear and serve him. Of the word heart, taken for understanding, see Job 9.on verse 4.]
\p
\v 22 . The blessing [That is, mercy, kindness, bounty. See Gen.12.on verse 2.] of the LORD, it maketh rich: and he [to wit, the Lord] addeth no sorrow [to wit, as there is in the heart and house of covetous miserys, that are never contented, and with their plenty and store do neither good to themselves, nor to others] with it. [to wit, with the blessing. Compare herewith Psal.127.2. Oth. Thus: and add not sorrow (that is, sorrowful labour0 with it.]
\p
\v 23 . It is as sport for a fool, to do mischief: [Compare chap.14.9.] but for a man of understanding, (to practise) wisdom. [to wit, whereby he fearing God, taketh heed of commiting villainy, and endeaveoureth to speak or promise something that savoureth of wisdom to the honour of God, which is his pleasure and delight.]
\p
\v 24 . The fear of the wicked, [That is, the evil, or harm that he feareth. See above chapter 1.on verse 26.] it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous [That is, that which righteous men wish and desire of God. Desire is taken for the good that is desired, Psalm 21.3. and 78.29. below chapter 12.19.] shall (God) grant.
\p
\v 25 . As a whirlwind passeth away, so is the wicked no (more:) [Or, as soon as the whirlwind is passed away, so is the wicked no more. The meaning is, that the wicked perish very suddenly, and fearfully, as if they were violently snatch away from the world by a most swift and mighty whirlwind. See of the comparison of a tempest, Job 9.on verse 17. And above chapter 1. Verse 27.] but the righteous is an everlasting foundation. [that is, abideth immoveable, to wit, in his faith, love hope, and consequently in a good estate unto the end. Compare Psalm 125.1. Mat.7.24,25.]
\p
\v 26 . As vinegar is to the teeth, and as smoak (is) to the eyes: so is the sluggard to them that send him. [The meaning is, that the sluggard is a great grief to them that set him on work, and especially to those that send him forth upon a speedy errand, and would have him return quickly back again.]
\p
\v 27 . The fear of the LORD encreaseth days: [To wit, the days of life, namely, of those that do sincerely fear the Lord. Understand this in respect of those that being of a weak and tender body, and feeble by reason sickness, sickness, and cast down by reason of adversity; yet by the comfort and consolation of God live longer, then the strength of their nature would be able to afford , if God had not intended to preserve and keep them longer alive. Compare above chapter 9.11. Some understand this in particular, in respect of the outward mercies, which God promised to the Israelites, as long as they should dwell in the land of Canaan] but the years of the wicked are shortened. [for according to the strength and quality of their nature they might have lived longer, but they are by Gods just judgement violently taken away from hence. Understand this proverb in the general of all wicked men, but in particular of some, with whom it pleaseth God to deal thus according to his incomprehensible wisdom.]
\p
\v 28 . The hope of the righteous is gladness: [That is, bringeth joy and gladness to the righteous, because it is sure and well grounded, resting and relying upon the promises of God, Rom.5.5.] but the expectation of the wicked shall perish. [That is, not be fulfilled, because it regardeth nothing but idle fancies; and therefore they shall even at last come to sorrow. Compare Job 8.13,14. And 11.20. Psalm 112.10.]
\p
\v 29 . The way of the LORD [See Genesis 18.on ver 19.] is strength for the upright; [to wit, against all that world. Satan; and their own flesh. Compare below ch.13.6.] but disturbance (shall be) for the workers of iniquity. [to wit, because they know, that there are many things in it, that gain-say their present life, and threaten them with future death.]
\p
\v 30 . The righteous shall never be removed, but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth. [To wit, with peace and quietness of mine, and not continually.]
\p
\v 31 . The mouth of the righteous bringeth forth wisdom abundantly: [See above verse 11. And the Annotations] but the tongue of frowardnesses [see above chap.8.on verse 13.] shall be destroyed.
\p
\v 32 . The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: [The Hebrew word is not onely taken the will, and good pleasure it self, as Psalm 38.8. and 51.20. but also for that which a man willeth well, and that which is acceptable and well-pleasing, Psalm 40.9. and 145.19. below chapter 11.1.] but the mouth of the wicked (speaketh) meer forwardness. [Hebr. Frowardnesses.]
\c 11
\s Of a false balance, verse 1. Of pride and humility, 2. Of uprightness, and perverseness in conversation, 3.20. Of the riches of the wicked, 4.28. Of hypocrisy, 9. Of the righteous and the wicked, 9,10,11,18,21,23,28,30,31. Of despising ones neighbour, 12. Of backbiting, 13. Of counsellors, 14. Of suretiship, 15. Of a good and bad woman, 16,22. Of mercifulness and cruelty, 17. Of liberality and covetousfulness, 24,25,26. Of good and evil, 27. Of unruly housekeeping, 29.
\p
\v 1 . A Deceitful balance [Hebr. Balance of deceit, so Hos.12.7. Amos 8.5. also balances of iniquity, Mich.6.1. The contrary are the balances of righteousness, Lev.19.36. Job 31.6.] is an abomination to the LORD, [Hebr. The Lords abomination; that is, which God esteemeth and accounteth an abomination; see Deut.17.on verse 1. And above chapter 3. On verse 32.] but a perfect weigh-stone [that is, weight; see Lev.19.on ver.36.] is his delight. [that is, is acceptable and well-pleasing unto him. See above chapter 10.on verse 32.Compare Leviticus 19.36. Deut.25.13. Prov.16.11. and 20.10,23.]
\p
\v 2 . When pride cometh, (then) will also shame come: [To wit, by the just providence God, who useth commonly to punish sins with judgements, that are parallel or like unto the sins. For because proud persons despise other men, and especially humble men, and such as are brought low and pressed down by afflictions and crosses, therefore they are oftentimes brought to a fall, and to a low ebbe, and so justly rewarded with shame and disgrace. Compare below chapter 15.33. and 16.18. and 18.12.] but with the humble [or, mannerly, courteous, lowly] is wisdom. [to wit, so as not to come to shame or disgrace by reason of pride, whereby they continue in honour and repute with all wise and understanding men, and such as judge rightly. Compare below chapter 15. 33. And 18.12.]
\p
\v 3 . The integrity of the upright them: [To wit, it leadeth and guideth them in the right way, in which they sincerely walk toward the good end of their journey where they would be. Compare below chapter 13.6.] but the perverseness of the faithless [to wit, whereby they seek to cousin and wrong their neighbour] disturbeth them. [that is, destroyeth them utterly. Oth. Layeth them waste, or spoileth them.]
\p
\v 4 . Wealth profiteth not [To wit, the wicked] in the day of wrath: [to wit, in the day of Gods wrath and indignation. See 2 Chron.chapter 28. On verse 13. That is, at such a time, when God doth manifest his wrath, by sending out his judgements upon men. So Job 20.on verse 28. Compare above chapter 10.2. Ezek.7.9. Zephan.1.18.] but righteousness delivereth from death. [see above chap.10.on verse 2.]
\p
\v 5 . The righteousness of the upright maketh his way straight: [That is, causeth him to walk aright in the good way, so that he at last cometh where he would be, to wit, to everlasting bliss. Compare above chapter 3.8. and the annot.] but the wicked falleth [to wit, in his evil way, so that he perisheth in it, without coming to an happy and blessed end] by his (own) wickedness.
\p
\v 6 . The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: [To wit, according to the gracious promise, that God hath made unto them. Comp. This with the end of the foregoing fourth verse] but the faithless are caught in (their own) perverseness. [that is, overtaken, and ensnared in the evil and mischief, which they intended to do unto others, so that it tendeth to their own destruction. Compare Psalm 7.16. below chapter 26. Verse 27. Eccles.10.8. The Hebrew word rendered here perverseness, is so taken below chap.17.4.]
\p
\v 7 . When the wicked man dieth, his expectation perisheth: [To wit, the expectation that he had, to live here yet a while at ease and in prosperity by reason of his wealth and means; or do here yet some mischief, whereby he might in a manner be able to benefit himself, those that belong to him, and others that rely and depend upon him] even the strongest hope [Hebr. The hope of strengths; or, firmnesses, or powers; that is, very strong, firm, or mighty hope, to wit, which the wicked had. Or, hope of strengths; that is, of all things, wherein he set his hope] is perished. [Oth. And the hope of unjust men perisheth.]
\p
\v 8 . The righteous is delivered out of distress: [Compare Psalm 34.20.] and the wicked cometh in his stead. [That is, in trouble, or distress, as if he were given for a ransom, to release the godly man. Compare below chap.21.18. Isa.43.3.]
\p
\v 9 . The hypocrite [What an hypocrite is, see Job 8.on verse 13.] destroyeth his neighbour with (his) mouth: [to wit, by his collaging and dissembling speech, enticing him to sin, and demeaning himself as if he were his fast friend, whereas he is indeed his greatest enemy] but the righteous are delivered [to wit, from the deceit of the hypocrite] by knowledge. [to wit, whereby the righteous understand, that sins ought to be avoided, because they are forbidden by God, and punished by him, and that the hypocrite ought not to be believed.]
\p
\v 10 . A City [That is, the inhabitants of a City that is in good plight, being furnished with good government, and good Citizens. City put for the inhabitants of it, as Gen.35.5. 1 Sam.4.13. 1 Kings 1.41. Isa.14.31. Mat.ch.21. verse 10. &c.] leapeth for joy, at the prosperity of the righteous: [Hebr. In the good, &c. Which may here be understood of the outward prosperity of the godly. See the word good so taken, Job 21.13. and compare the annotations] and when the wicked perish, there is shouting.
\p
\v 11 . By the blessing of the upright, [That is, by the blessing which they receive of God, and consequently which they speak, the prayers which they make, the counsel which they give, and the mercies which they shew] a City is exalted: but by the mouth of the wicked [to wit, who teach and maintain false doctrine, make bad laws, and give out hurtful speeches against the Commonwealth] it is broken.
\p
\v 12 . He that is void of understanding, despiseth his neighbour: [To wit, having not onely a bad opinion of him in his heart, but also speaking ill of him with his mouth] but a man of great understanding [Heb. Of understandings] holdeth his peace. [that is, hath a good opinion of him, and speaketh not ill of him, yea nothing at all, when it may consist with the love of God, and of his neighbour.]
\p
\v 13 . He that walketh (as) a back-biter, [See the proper signification of the original phrase, Lev.19.on verse 16.] revealeth the thing that is secret: but he that is faithful in spirit, [that is, in will, intention, and affection, so as not to be like the tale-bearers, back-biters, or slanderers, see of the word spirit taken in this signification, 2 Kin.19.on verse 7.] covereth the matter.
\p
\v 14 . When there are no wise counsels, [See of the word rendered here wise counsels Job 37.v.12.] the people fall: [See 1 Kin.12.1, &c.] but in the multitude of Counsellors [to wit, of those that fear God, understand matters aright, and love the welfare of the people] (there) is preservation.
\p
\v 15 . When (any one) [This word must often be inserted to supply and fill up the sense, as Exod.22.9. bel.ch.20.v.16.& 27.13,&c.] is become surety (for) [this word is here inserted from ch.6.v.1.] a stranger, [see ab.ch.6.on v.1.] he shall surely be broken: [Heb. Breaking, be broken; to wit, either through care and trouble, which he shall have, or through the loss and damage that he shall suffer, or through both] but whoso hateth them that strike (hands), [that is, those that strike hands, to signify that they promise payment. See ab.ch.6.ver.1. and the annot.] is safe. [or, secure, or, quiet.]
\p
\v 16 . A gracious wife [Heb. A woman of grace; that is, which is gracious and acceptable, to wit, by reason of her vertues] holdeth honour fast; [to wit, the honour of understanding, chastity, modesty, friendliness, prudent and wise house-keeping] as [so is the letter vau sometimes taken. See Job 5.on verse 7.] mighty men hold riches fast. [to wit, so that they will not suffer them to be taken from them.]
\p
\v 17 . A merciful man [Hebr. A man of mercifulness, or, bounty, or, liberality. So a man of knowledge; that is, a knowing, and understanding man, below chapter 24 25. A man of truth, or faithfulness; that is, a true or faithful man, Nehemiah chapter 7. Verse 2. A man of peace; that is, one that is peaceable, Psalm 41.10. men of holiness; that is, holy men, saints, Exodus 22.31, &c. Compare Job 11.on ver.11.] doth good [the Hebrew word signifieth sometimes so do good to a man, as here, and Psalm 13.6. Isa.63.7. sometimes to doe hurt, as Isaiah 3.9. Properly it signifieth to reward, or recompence, whether good, or evil. See 2 Chronicles 20.on verse 11.] to his (own) soul. [that is, to himself. See 1 Kin.chapter 19.on verse 4.] but he that is cruel, troubleth his (own) flesh. [to wit, not onely by taking unnecessary care, or more care then is needful, but also by refusing of necessary food, apparel, and habitation.]
\p
\v 18 . The wicked doth a false work: [Hebr. A work of falsehood: that is, work that is not good, which bringeth in no profit, nor benefit, nor reward, but is altogether vain and fruitless] but (for) him that soweth righteousness, [that is, that doth good works: which indeed is done with labour and pains, but also with expectation of a gracious harvest. Compare Hosea chapter 10.verse 12. Galat.6.verse 8.Of sowing iniquity, see Job 4.on verse 8.] (there) is a faithful reward. [Hebr. A reward of faithfulness, or, truth.]
\p
\v 19 . So is righteousness unto life; as he that hunteth after evil, (hunteth) after his (own) death.
\p
\v 20 . The forward in heart [Meaning those that in matter of faith and love, are not sincere and upright. See of the forwardness or perverseness of the heart, Psalm 101.4. above chapter 6.14. below chapter 12.8. and 17.20. Jeremiah 17.9.] are an abomination unto the LORD: but the upright in way, [so Psalm 119.1. The meaning is, those that in point of doctrine and life, are down-right, sincere, unfeigned, pure in mind and heart] are his delight. [that is, are well-pleasing and acceptable unto him. So above verse 1. And below chapter 12 22. And 15.8.]
\p
\v 21 . Hand to hand, [That is, from hand to hand] the wicked shall not be guiltless; [That is, not go unpunished. See 1 Kings 2.on verse 9. Not onely in his own person, but also in his posterity, that walk in his wicked ways. Compare Exodus 20.5. and Deut.5.9. Oth. (though) hand (were) in hand, the wicked, &c. That is, though the wicked at such time when he is in danger, should have the help of all men, to rid and deliver him out of it, yet shall he in no wise escape the punishing hand of God. Hand is here taken for help, as 2 Sam.3.12. and 14.19. Nehem.2.18. Psalm 119.173. below chapter 16.5.] but the seed [That is, children and posterity.

\p
\v 24 . There is one that scattereth abroad, [To scatter abroad here, is liberally to impart and communicate of a mans goods where need requireth. So Psalm 112.9.

\v 4 . A prudent wife [that is, a wise, virtuous woman, and one that knoweth how to keep her house in order. Hebr. A woman of prudence, or, virtue. See of the Hebrew word, Gen.47.on verse 6.] is a crown [that is, ornament and glory: see of the word crown taken in this sense, Job 19.on verse 9.] of her Lord; [that is, husband. So Exod.21.3. Joel 1.8.] but she that maketh ashamed, is as rottenness in his bones. [that is, a grief and vexation to his soul, and a consumption to his body, because he beholdeth his shame always before his eyes. See the same comparison, below ch.14.30. Habakkuk 3.16. and the like, Psalm 42.11. also contrary, Ps.51.20.]
\p
\v 5 . The thoughts of the righteous are right: [That is, are well conceived, or imagined, according as equity and justice requireth. Compare Numb.27.11. and the annot.] the counsels [this word is here taken in a bad sense, for crafty intentions, and cunning devices or plottings to do mischief. Elsewhere it’s taken in a good sense; see of it, Job 37.on verse 12.] of the wicked are deceit.

\p
\v 8 . Every one shall be commended [To wit, of wise men, and such as judge rightly] according as his understanding is: [that is, according as he can make it appear by words and works, that he hath wisdom and understanding tending to true piety] but he that is perverse in heart, [see above chapter 11.on verse 20.] shall be contempt.

Oth. That is a servant to himself; that is, that serveth himself, or is his own fervent] then he that honoureth himself: [to wit, bragging that he is a great rich man, and hath a great estate] and lacketh bread.

Compare above verse 3.] shall give forth. [that is, shoot out, spring forth, and bear fruit. The meaning is, that they, dealing truly and faithfully in the fear of the Lord, shall have enough.

\p
\v 13 . In the transgression of the lips [To wit, which a wicked man in speaking committeth against God, and against his neighbour] is the snare of the wicked: [that is, the snare, wherein the wicked man himself is caught.

\p
\v 16 . The fools wrath is known [To wit, by his words, gestures, and actions] the same day: [that is, at the same time and season, that he is grown angry at the hurt done to him] but he that is prudent, covereth [so below on verse 23. See of the word prudent, above chapter 1.on verse 4.] shame. [to wit, which proceedeth from sudden anger.]
\p
\v 17 . He that uttereth [Hebr. Bloweth] truth, maketh righteousness known; [that is, discovereth that which doth rightly agree with that which is done or spoken, that no man may be wronged] but a witness of falsities, deceit.

\p
\v 18 . There is one, that uttereth (words) indiscreetly, like the piercings of a sword: [that is, that with rash and ill advised speeches. Hurt and wound their neighbour in his mind, honour, life, and well-being, as a man is hurt and wounded in his body with a sword. See 1 Sam.22.9,10. Psalm 57.5. and 59.8. below chap.16.27.] but the tongue of the wise is physic.

\p
\v 19 . A true lip [Hebr. Lip of truth: that is, which speaketh truth: So lip of flattery, which speaketh flattery, Psalm 12.3. lips of falsehood, which speak falsehood, Psalm 31.19. lips of knowledge, which utter knowledge, below chapter 14.7. So immediately in this verse, tongue of falsehood, or of lies, is put for a tongue, which speaketh falsehood, or lies, also below verse 22. Also lips of righteousness, that is, lips that speak or utter righteous words, below chapter 16.13.] shall be established for ever: [truth (and consequently he that speaketh truth) abideth constant, and is always fixed and immoveable in it self, although it be sometimes gainsaid, or spoken against] but a false tongue is (but) for a moment.
\p
\v 20 . Deceit is in the heart of them that forge evil: [To wit, the evil of dissention, and strife] but those that counsel (for) peace, have joy. [to wit, in their heart in the sight of God, and in their life in the sight of men.]
\p
\v 21 . (There) shall no harm [Or, trouble, or, affliction] happen to the righteous: [to wit, which should be so offered to him by the wicked, as that he should faint and lie down under it. No, but all things shall work for good unto him, Rom.8.28. Oth.no iniquity shall befall him: to wit, into which the righteous should come to fall: so, as that he should not be raised up again out of it by the spirit of God. Of the Hebrew word rendered here harm, see Job 5.on verse 6.] but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.
\p
\v 22 . False lips [Se above chap on verse 19.] are an abomination unto the LORD: but they that deal faithfully [Hebr. Perform faithfulness or, truth; that is, those that both in words and deeds, both towards God, and towards their neighbour, keep truth and faithfulnesssincerely and uprightly. So Ezek.18.9. 1 John 1.6.] are his delight. [that is, well-pleasing and acceptable unto him. So above chap.11.20.]
\p
\v 23 . A prudent man concealeth knowledge: [That is, he poureth it not out by foolish and vaunting discourse, that he may thereby make a shew of himself. Compare ab.chapter 13.16. and 15.2.] but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness. [that is, all manner of ignorance, and error, concerning faith, and the life and practice of men. Compare above chap.13.16. and 15.2.]
\p
\v 24 . The hand of the diligently shall bear rule; [Comp.above chap.10.4.] but the deceivers shall be under tribute. [that is, under them that bear rule, and have dominion, impose taxes and tributes. See the same phrase, Judg.1.30,35. Lamen.1.1. Hebr. The deceit shall be, etc. See Job 25.on verse 13. Understand by these deceivers, the idle, lazy, slothful vagabonds, who because they will not work, seek to live by cheating and thievery. See above chap.10.4. and the annot. Also below verse 27.]
\p
\v 25 . Carefulness in the heart of a man maketh it stoop; but a good word maketh it glad.
\p
\v 26 . The righteous is more excellent [To wit, in the sight of God, and of good men, who look not on the outward pomp and prosperity of this life, but on the good that is begun in the godly here, and shall be compleated and perfected hereafter] then his neighbour; [namely, then his neighbour, that is wicked] but the way [that is, life, practice, and course of dealing] of the wicked, causeth them to erre. [to wit, themselves, and others, namely, by the outward shew, which the wicked make of ease, delight, pleasure, riches, honour, greatness, high estate, &c.]
\p
\v 27 . A deceiver [Hebr. The deceit. See on the foregoing twenty fourth verse] shall not roast [that is, not use, or enjoy] that which he took in hunting: [understand hereby all manner of wealth gotten by cunning and deceitful practices] but the precious wealth of man, [so is wealth, or riches, well and honestly gotten by fraud and deceit] is the diligently ones. [to wit, that getteth his living by his honest labour, and lawful calling. Oth. The wealth of a diligent man is precious. Oth. The precious wealth of a man is diligence. Oth. The wealth shall be the precious (that is, the godly mans) (and) diligent mans. Some take it thus: the wealth of the precious (that is, of the godly) man shall be cut off. (that is, be used, and enjoyed.)]
\p
\v 28 . In the path of righteousness is life; [Compare above ch.10.16.] and (in) the way of the foot-path (thereof, there is) no death.

\p
\v 3 . He that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his soul; that is, himself; see 1 Kin.19.on verse 4.

\p
\v 4 .

[that is, shall have plenty or abundance. Compare above chap.11.the annot. On verse 25.]
\p
\v 5 . The righteous hateth lying language: [Hebr. The word of lying, or, of falsehood] but the wicked maketh himself stinking, [namely, in the nostrils of them that hear him, by his lies. See of this phrase, Gen.34.on verse 30.] and procureth shame to himself.
\p
\v 6 . Righteousness keepeth the upright in way: [Compare above cha.10.29. and 11.3,5,6. See of the phrase upright in way, above ch.11.on verse 20.] but wickedness shall overthrow the sinner. [Heb. The sin. See Job 35.on verse 13.
\p
\v 7 . There is one that maketh himself rich, and (hath) nothing at all; (and) one that maketh himself poor, and (hath) much wealth. [that is, there be those men found, that pretend they are rich, and make a shew before men, as if they had a great estate, whereas indeed they are exceeding poor and bare: there be others again, that are exceeding rich, and yet feign themselves to be very poor. Compare above ch.12.9.]
\p
\v 8 . The ransom of every ones soul [That is, of the temporal and corporal life] is his riches: [to wit, when a rich man is fallen into the hands of his enemies.

Comp. Jam.3.16,17,18.]
\p
\v 11 . Wealth (gotten) by vanity [That is, gotten by evil and unjust means, called before a deceitful hand, ab.ch.10.4. and 12.24.] shall be diminished; but he that gathereth with the hand, [that is, by the honest labour of the body, or of the mind: which is called the hand of diligent, above ch.10.4. and 12.24.] shall increase it.

See above ch.10.on 24.] that cometh, is a tree of life. [that is, is a thing that is very delightful, and acceptable to man, and doth exceedingly cherish and revive his heart, and doth him much good.

\p
\v 19 . The desire, [To wit, of the godly: as may be gathered from the opposition] which is performed, [that is, which is accomplished] is sweet to the soul: but it is an abomination to the fools [Hebr. An abomination of fools] to depart from evil. [the meaning is, that when a godly man getteth the thing that he desireth, it doth his soul good, and is exceeding delightful to his soul. Now his desire is to shun and avoid evil, and to cleave and adhere unto that which is good: which the wicked loatheth and abhorreth, much less delighteth therein.]
\p
\v 20 . He that converseth with wise men, shall be wise: but he that is a companion of fools, [Or, he that is a nourisher, or, sustainer of fools: Hebr. Feeder of fools.

[that is, be quite undone, and destroyed, or come to nothing; to wit, because by the company of fools he shall grow more foolish, and shall be plagued of God for his foolishness.]
\p
\v 21 . Evil shall pursue sinners: [By evil is here meant the evil of punishment, whereof see Gen.19.on ver.19. and compare above chap.5.22,23.

See 1 Sam.15.on verse 18. And Psalm 1.on verse 1.] is laid up for the just. [it happeneth of ten that notorious sinners themselves do not enjoy the wealth, or riches, that they have gotten, much less do their children, or childrens children enjoy them: and that their estates do fall to the share of godly men by the Providence of almighty God. Compare Job 27.16,17.]

There is much food in the plowed land of the poor. Compare above chapter 12. Verse 11.] but there is one, [that is, a sort of men] that is consumed, [or, that consumeth, destroyeth, or, ruineth himself, wanting food] for want of judgement. [Hebrew in, or, for not judgment, or, justice: that is, because he hath no skill in tillage, or keepeth no good rule in it, or is careless and negligent in it, or doth ill improve his profit and increase; or because he useth deceit and coarsening, and unjust dealing.]
\p
\v 24 . He that withholdeth his rod, hateth his son: [That is, he doth that, whereby the bringeth him to ruine and destruction. To destroy a man is to hate him to ruine and destruction. To destruction. To destroy a man is to hate him. See above chapter 8.on verse 36. Compare below chapter 23.13.] but he that loveth him, seeketh him (with) chastening betime. [that is, from his youth, while he is yet sit to be ruled.]
\p
\v 25 . The righteous [That is, he that in the fear of God seeketh by honest labour and upright dealing to live in the world] careth to the satisfying of his soul: [that is, of his life. The meaning is, he hath by the blessing of God, as much as he needeth. Compare Psalm 34.11. and 37.3.] but the belly of the wicked shall want.

Confession of sin, 9. Sorrow and joy of heart, 10,13,30. Condition of the wicked and the godly, 11,32. Self-conceit, 12. Prudence and sudden anger, 16,17,29.

The glory of Kings, 28. Oppression, and love of the poor, 31. Wisdom, 33. The honour and shame of a people, 34. Kings servants, 35.
\p
\v 1 . Every wise woman [Hebr. The wife of women, that is, whosoever is wise among women. Compare Gen. Chap.47.on verse 3. And Job 12. On verse 7. And bel.verse 9.] buildeth her house: [to wit, by bringing up her children godlily, by ruling her servants wisely, and by keeping the whole family in good order. So is the word building, or to build taken, below chap.24.3.] but she that is very foolish [Hebr. Folly, or, foolishness; that is, very foolish; as if he had said, she that is folly it self. See Job 35.on verse 13.] breaketh it down with her hands. [that is, with her doing and omitting. Thus that which is rendered to a man for that which he doth and omitteth, is called the recompence, or, reward of his hands. Isa.3.11.]
\p
\v 2 . He that walketh in his uprightness [Comp. Abo.chap.2. the annotations on verse 7. Upon the words walking uprightly] feareth the LORD: but he that declineth [to wit, from the way. So above chapter 2.15. see the annot.] in his ways, [that is, in his own intention, doing and omitting. See Gen.6.on verse 12.] despiseth him. [to wit, the Lord.]
\p
\v 3 . In the mouth of the foolish, is a rod of pride: [That is, proud and lofty rod or staff, wherewith he partly beateth others, when he boldly slandereth and backbiteth them; partly himself, when being found and taken in his lies, he gets as it were a back blow thereby] but the lips of the wise preserve them. [to wit, by their courteous, wise, and prudent sayings, from falling into the evil and mischief of fools.]
\p
\v 4 . When there are no oxen, [So is the Hebrew word taken, Deut.7.13. and 28. Verse 4,18,51. Psa.8.8. Understand this of the oxen, wherewith they were wont to plow and to do all manner of husbandry, Deut.22.10. and 25.4.] then the crib is clean: [that is, empty of fodder and provision for beasts, and consequently of fruits of the ground needful for the sustentation of man. Thus want of bread or victual is called cleanness (that is emptiness) of teeth, Amos 4.verse 6. Compare ab.chap.12.11. and below chap.28.verse 19.] but by the strength of the oxe there is much increase.
\p
\v 5 . A true witness [Hebr. A witness of truth. So below verse 25. And in the following words. Hebr. A witness of falsehood] will not lie; but a false witness bloweth lies. [so above chap.6.19. and below verse 25.]
\p
\v 6 . The scorner seeketh wisdom, and there is none: [To wit, at hand, or, to be found, because the scorner seeketh it not, as he ought to do, and where it is to be found] but knowledge is easy [to wit, to be found] to him that hath understanding. [because he seeketh it as her ought to do, and where it is to be found.]
\p
\v 7 . Go away from the presence of a foolish man, for thou shalt nor perceive (within him) the lips of knowledge. [That is, lips that utter wise and virtuous speeches, and consequently he himself is not of wise and virtuous heart: for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh, Mat.12.34. Compare above chap.12.on verse 19.]
\p
\v 8 . The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: [That is, what he ought to intend, do, and leave undone] but the folly of fools is deceit. [to wit, because they, regarding not what is well, or ill done, are hurtful unto others, and in the end are deceived themselves.]
\p
\v 9 . Every fool will set a fair glance upon guilt: [Meaning sin, wherein he findeth himself, or those that are his, to be guilty. The meanings is, that fools will seek to extenuate, cloak, and excuse sin with fair words, and seeming reasons, that it may appear to be more like unto virtue, then to vice. Oth. Will make a mock at sin; that is, make a laughing-stock or a may-game of it, for every one to make it his sport, and pastime, and in no wise to grieve at it] but among the upright (there) is good will. [to wit, whereby one man doth not hurt or wrong another, either in words or in deeds; or if felleth his fault, and the matter is taketh up in a friendly way, so that there is no need of such feigned excuses, and coloured extenuations of sin, when they have trespassed one against another.]
\p
\v 10 . The heart knoweth his own [Hebr. His souls. Compare 1 Kin.19.on verse 4.] bitter grief: [Hebr. Bitterness: that is, bitter grief, and sorrow. See 2 Kin.4.on verse 27.] and a stranger will not mingle himself with his joy: [to wit, with the joy that is hid in another mans heart: for every man alone knoweth the sorrow, and the joy that is in his own heart, 1 Cor.2.11. Rev.2.17.]
\p
\v 11 . The house [That is, the habitation, city, riches, and posterity. See above chapter 12.on verse 7.] of the wicked shall be destroyed: but the Tent of the upright [that is, their mean dwelling. See 2 Kin.13.on verse 5.] shall flourish.
\p
\v 12 . There is a way [That is, a course of life. See above chap.6.on verse 6. So in the following clause of this verse] which seemeth right unto a man; [Heb. before the face of a man; that is, in his eyes, and judgement. So below chapter 16.25. Compare Eccles.2.26. and 7.26.] but the last [or, the hindmost, the end. See of the Hebrew word, Psal.37.on verse 37.] therefore are the ways of death. [that is, courses, which lead unto death, or, which cause death and destruction. Compare Jer.21.8.]
\p
\v 13 . The heart shall have sorrow [To wit, inward sorrow, which is covered with an outward shew of joy] even in laughter: [that is, when a man sheweth outward tokens of joy] and the last of that mirth [to wit, of that laughter] is heaviness. [understand this and the former clause of that which happeneth often, but ones always.]
\p
\v 14 . He that is a back-slinder in heart, [That is, he that is revolted from God, or from his commandments and paths. So Psalm 44.19.] shall be satisfied with his (own) ways; [that is, with his own doings, and omissions or neglects repugnant to the law of God. See Gen.6.on verse 12. That is, he shall, according to his desert, be fed and nourished by God, with just punishments. See Job 7.on verse 4.] but a good man, from himself. [to wit, shall be satisfied, and filled. That is, shall have his sufficiency, to wit, in the reward, wherewith God will graciously recompence his goodiness, and vertous behaviour Oth. But a good man (back-slideth) or, (departed) from him: to wit, from him that is a back-slider in heart, whereby he also escapeth his punishments. Oth. from his; to wit, ways.]
\p
\v 15 . The simple believeth all (or every) word: [Or, thing: to wit, whatsoever it might or could be, whether true or false, honest, or dsihonest, profitable, or hurtful unto him] but the prudent (man) looketh well to his going. [that is, taketh heed to himself, that in his conversation and dealing with men, he go not on through vain credulity upon every mans saying.]
\p
\v 16 . A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth exceedingly, [To wit, against those that warn and threaten him in the name of God, persuading himself that he hath no need of it] and is careless.
\p
\v 17 . He that is hast to wrath [Hebrew short of wraths: that is, soon angry, short-handed, forward, pettish; who below verse 29. Is called short of spirit] shall commit folly: and a man of heinous devices [the Hebrew word, whereof see Job 21, on verse 27. Is here taken in a bad sense, as above chapter 12.2. Others take it a good sense, for discretion, as a man of discretion; that is, that taketh timely deliberation, that rusheth not upon matters rashly and unadvisedly, but breaketh and bridleth himself a whiles; he that is thus qualified, is hated, to wit, of the wicked, or, of wicked men] shall be hated.
\p
\v 18 . The simple inherit folly: [That is, enjoy the hurtful fruit of it, which is to fall more and more into folly, and so to increase Gods displeasure against themselves, and to reap shame and disgrace by men, with the utter ruine and destruction both of soul and body] but the prudent shall crown themselves with knowledge, and so excel, as that they shall be adorned and beautiful with it, as with a crown.]
\p
\v 19 . The evil bow down before the face of the good: [Which sometimes cometh to pass, because they are here humbled and brought low by the mighty hand of God, and the good are exalted, or because their consciences do compel them to honour virtue in those that be virtuous. Compare Gen.4. the annotations on verse 7.] and the wicked before the gates of the righteous. [Oth. Are at the gates, &c. To wit, to beg comfort, advice, and help of them, they having been humbled and cast down by the judgements of God.]
\p
\v 20 . The poor is hated even of his (own) friend: [The Hebrew word signifieth every man, with whom we have any dealings, and whom we term our neighbour, as Gen.11.3. Exod.21.14. Lev.19.18. and here in the next verse, etc. But in this place it is taken for a friend, companion, or acquaintance, as 2 Sam.16.17. Job 16.20. Prov.19.6. Mich.7.5, &c.] but the lovers of the rich are many.
\p
\v 21 . He that despiseth his neighbour, [To wit, because of his poverty, adversity, misery, low estate, or the like, as may be gathered from the opposition] sinneth: [Oth. A sinner despiseth his neighbour] but he that hath mercy on the humble, [or, meek. Understand those, who together with their misery and affliction being of a soft mind, modest, and humble, or lowly, do not easily break out into anger and wrath, and therefore may soon oppressed. See Psalm 10.on verse 17.] happy is he.
\p
\v 22 . Do they not erre, [This kind of asking doth strongly affirm and assert the thing, whereof mention is made. They erre, to wit, not only from the scope, and end, which they propound unto themselves, but chiefly and principally from their welfare and happiness, so that they come to ruine and destruction] that contrive evil? [that is, that do forge, invent, devise, and practise mischief, to hurt and wound their neighbour thereby. See of the Hebrew word, above chapter 3.on verse 29.] but mercy, [to wit, as well from godly men, as from God himself, who according to his promises, is merciful and gracious to those that are good and upright] and faithfulness, is for those that contrive good.
\p
\v 23 . In all painful labour, [To wit, which is well and honestly performed according to a mans calling] there is an overplus: [that is, gain, profit, and something over and above] but the word of the of the lips [meaning all vain and idle words, which tend to another use, then to lose and trifle away precious time, to a mans great hurt and detriment: of which see above chap.to penury.
\p
\v 24 . The crown of the wise [That is, the ornament, which maketh them gracious and honourable in the sight of men. See above ch.12. on verse 4.] is their riches: [to wit, because they use them well, being therewith thankful unto God, merciful unto their neighbour, and sober toward themselves] the foolishness of fools [to wit, that are rich] is folly. [that is, abideth, tendeth not to make them honourable and gracious before men, but to bring them to shame and contempt, as folly is shameful and desicable in the eyes of all men, and whatsoever they have, profiteth them nothing at all, but tendeth to their meer folly and disgrace.]
\p
\v 25 . A true witness [Hebr. Witness of truth; so above verse 5.] delivereth [that is, freeth and delivereth from death] souls: [that is, men, whom they seek to slay by slanderings, and false accusations] but he that bloweth lies, [so above verse 5. And ch.6.19. See the annot. Understanding here lies, wherewith a man is burdened and oppressed unto death] is a deceiver. [Hebr. Deceit. So above chap.12. verse 24. And 13.6. Sin for sinner. Oth. But a deceiver bloweth forth lies.]
\p
\v 26 . In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence: [Hebr. Confidence of strength; that is, strong confidence; namely, for them that fear the Lord. So Psalm 71.7.] and he will be a refuge unto his children. [meaning the children of God, or the children of them that fear him, and rely upon him, unto whom he is therefore favourable.]
\p
\v 27 . The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, [That is, as a fountain out of which life floweth forth. Compare above chap.10,11. And the annot.] to depart from the snares of death. [see above chap.13.on verse 14.]
\p
\v 28 . In the multitude of people is the Kings glory; but in the want of people is the disturbance of a Prince. [Oth. The disturbance, or, the destruction, or, the breaking of a Princedom, or, of a Dominion.]
\p
\v 29 . The long-suffering (person) [Hebr. Long of wraths: that is, not soon angry. See Exod.34.on verse 6.] is of great understanding, [or hath much understanding, which he discovereth by this, in that he knoweth how to bear wrongs and injuries patiently, and can beware of doing any thing that may truly oppose honour and virtue] but he that is hasty of mind, [Hebr. Short of spirit: that is, soon angry. See above on verse 17. And compare Eccles.7.9.] exalteth folly. [that is, setteth it as it were on high, and bringeth it into open light, to be seen of all men, forasmuch as in his anger he doth those things, which cannot consist with honour and virtue.]
\p
\v 30 . A sound heart [Hebr. An heart of soundness, or, health. Meaning an heart, or mind, that is clean and free from all evil affections, passions, and motions against a mans neighbour, and especially from envy, whereof here properly mention is made] is the life of the flesh: [that is, the health and welfare of the body. So to live, is taken for to be healed, and to recover, or to enjoy bodily health, 2 Kings 8.8. See there the annot. The Hebrew word rendered here flesh, is used in the plural number, to signify that a sound and healthy heart doth not onely do good to his own body, but also to the bodies of others] but envy is the rottenness of the bones. [that is, of the innermost parts and members of the body, and consequently also of the innermost powers and facuilties of the soul. See Job 7.on verse 15. Compare above chap.12.4. and the annot. Also below chap.17.22. and the annot.]
\p
\v 31 . He that oppresseth the poor [To wit, by deceit, or violence. Compare below chapter 22.16. and the annot. Ezek.18.18.] reproacheth his Maker: [see Job 4.on verse 17. Compare below chapter 17.5.] but he that hath compassion on the needy, he honoureth him. [compare above verse 21.]
\p
\v 32 . The wicked shall be driven away in his evil: [Meaning the evil of punishment; that is, in his mischief, misery, and adversity: Oth. For his badness, or, wickedness sake, understanding this of the evil of sin] but the righteous trusteth [to wit, in God] (even) in his death. [that is, not only in all manner of adversity incident to this life, but also in death, which either naturally befalleth him, or is violently offered to him. See Job 13.verse 15.]
\p
\v 33 . Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: [To wit, it is locked up in his heart, as in a Cabinet, that he may bring it forth in due time and place. Compare above chapter 10.14. and 12 23. And 13.16.] but that which is in the innermost (parts) of fools is known. [to wit, the folly that is in their heart, or, the wisdom which they pour out indiscreetly and unseasonably. Oth. But in the midst of fools she is known. To wit, when they are convinced in their consciences by the godly, or when the difference, that is betwixt fools and wise men, is perceived.]
\p
\v 34 . Righteousness exalteth a people: [To wit, so as that it is blessed of God, and is famous and renowned among men] but sin is a reproach of nations. [that is, it bringeth shame and reproach of nations. [that is, it bringeth shame and reproach upon nations. See this signification of the Hebrew word chesed, Lev.20.on verse 17.]
\p
\v 35 . The Kings good pleasure is toward an understanding servant: [Of the word servant, see Gen.20.on verse 8.] but his wrath shall be (against) him that maketh ashamed. [to wit, his King, and himself. Compare above cha.10.on verse 5.]
\c 15
\s Wise and foolish speeches, verse 1,2,4,7,23,26,28. Gods ominiscience, 3,11. Discipline, 5,10,12,31,32,33. Riches of the righteous and wicked, 6. Religion and conversation of the wicked and godly, 8,9,29. Joy and heaviness, 13,15. Wisdom and folly, 14,21. Contentment with the fear of God, and love, 16,17: Anger and long-sufferance, 18. Slothness, 19. Good and bad children, 20. Counsellors, 22. The way to heaven, 24. Pride, and widows, 25. Thoughts of the wicked, 26. Covetousness, and gifts, 27. Good report, 30. Fear of God, and humility, 33.
\p
\v 1 . A soft answer [Or, speech: So below verse 23. And 10.1. As the Verb Anah, signifieth not onely to answer, but also to begin a speech. See Judg. chapter 18.on verse 14.] turneth away wrath; [compare below ch.25.15.] but a smarting word [Hebr. A word of smart trouble, or pain; that is, smarting, troublesome, painful, and grievous to be heard] causeth anger to arise.
\p
\v 2 . The tongue of the wise maketh knowledge good: [That is, acceptable, beautiful, profitable, an useful, as being uttered in due time and place, and in a due and right manner. Oth. Knowledge adorneth the tongue of the wise] but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness abundantly. [to wit, as a fountain giveth out water in great abundance. See of the Hebrew word rendered here pouring out abundantly, above chap.7.on verse 23. Compare above chap.12.23. and 13.16. and below verse 28.]
\p
\v 3 . The eyes of the LORD [Understand the Providence of God. See 2 Chronicles 16.on verse 9.] are in all (or every) place, beholding the evil, and the good. [Compare Job 34.21. above chap.5.21. Jer.16.17. and 32.19.]
\p
\v 4 . The physic of the tongue [Or, health of the tongue; that is, wholesome speeches; and soul-saving doctrine, concerning faith and life, which is propounded by the tongue. Compare above chap.12.on verse 18.] is a tree life: [that is, as a tree of life bringing with it the prosperity and happiness, not onely of temporal, but also of eternal life. Compare above chap.3.on verse 18. Also chap.12.18. and 13.14.] but perverseness therein [to wit, in the tongue. See above chapter 2.on verse 12.] is a breach in the spirit. [that is, is a loss or damage of the soul. Oth. A breaking by the wind; that is, vehement destruction: as ships are broken in pieces by mighty winds. Psalm 48.8. Jer.18.17.]
\p
\v 5 . A fool will despise the instruction of his father: but he that regardeth reproof [To wit, his fathers reproof] shall deal prudently. [or, prudent. So below ch.10.verse 25. Compare 1 Sam.23.22.]
\p
\v 6 . (In) the house of the righteous [Understand not onely his habitation, or dwelling, but also his means and estate; as appeareth by the opposition. Compare ab.ch.12. on verse 7.] is a great treasure: [to wit, because he being well furnished and provided of inward goods, is very well contented with the outward estate, that God allotteth unto him. Oth. Strength, or, firmness] but in the revenue of the wicked is trouble. [that is, discontendness, and disquietness of mind; because he is empty of the heavenly treasure or wealth. See of the Hebrew word, Gen.34.on verse 30. And 1 Kings 18.on verse 17.]
\p
\v 7 . The lips of the wise shall disperse [That is, utter, bring forth, to communicate it unto others] knowledge: [that is, good doctrine, which ought to be known, and which maketh a man wise, understanding, and knowing. So Numbers 24.16. Psalm 119.66. below chapter 22.17.] but the heart of the foolish (doth) not so. [that is, it will not disperse knowledge. Oth. Is not right: or, (scattereth) that which is not right.]
\p
\v 8 . The offering of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD: [Hebrew is the Lords abomination. So in the next verse. See below chapter 3.on verse 32. Compare below chapter 21.27. Isa.1.11. Jer.6. verse 20. Amos 5.21.] but the prayer of the upright is his delight.
\p
\v 9 . The way [That is, intent, and purpose, course of life, doing and omitting. See Genesis 6.on verse 17.] of the wicked, is an abomination unto the LORD: but he will love him, that pursueth after righteousness.
\p
\v 10 . Correction is displeasing [Hebrew evil; that is, is displeasing, irksome, grievous, troublesome; although it be, in it self very good. So the word evil is taken, 1 Kings 22.8,18. As also the word good signifieth that which is pleasing and acceptable, or delightful. See 1 Kings 1.on verse 42.] unto him, that forsaketh the path: [to wit, the good, and right path. See above ch.2.on verse 8. Oth. An evil discipline (that is, punishment) is for him that forsaken my path] (and) he that hateth reproof shall die.
\p
\v 11 . Hell, and destruction are before the LORD: [That is, are naked and discovered before his eyes, Heb. 4.13. Compare Job 26.6. and see the annot.] how much more the hearts of the children of men? [to wit, that converse here on earth in the clear light of the sun. This is spoken of God after the manner of men: for with him all things are alike possible, and easy to be done. Compare 2 Chronicles 6.30. Psalm 7.10. and 44.22. Jeremiah 17.9,10. John 2.24, 25. And 21.17. Acts 1.24.]
\p
\v 12 . The scorner [See above on verse 22.] will not love him that reproveth him: he will not go unto the wise. [to wit, because he hateth reproof.]
\p
\v 13 . A merry heart will make the countenance cheerful: [Hebr. Make it good; that is, joyful, glad, cheerful. See Judges 16.on verse 25. And 1 Kings 21.on verse 7. Compare below chap.17.22.] but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is amazed. [by spirit here is meant the activity, courage, and strength of the heart. So Gen.41.8. Jos.5.1. 1 Sam.1.15. Psalm 34.19. Isa.61.3. below chapter 17.verse 22. The meaning is, that a mans courage, which is wont to discover it self in the face and countenance, is by grief or sorrow of heart cast down and broken.]
\p
\v 14 . An understanding heart will seek out knowledge: but the mouth of fools shall be fed with folly. [That is, with false opinions and discourse. The meaning is, that a fools mouth seeketh not onely folly, but findeth therein such a taste and relish, as that he thereby encreaseth and growth strong in his folly, as by sweet and pleasant meat.]
\p
\v 15 . All the days of the afflicted are evil: [That is, sad, and grievous. So Gen.40.on verse 7.] but merry [Hebr. Good; that is, merry, joyful. See above on verse 13.] heart is a continual feast. [that is, as a perpetual be banquet, which is delightful to a man, refreshing him in body with good meat and drink, and in spirit with honest and profitable discourse.]
\p
\v 16 . Better is a little with the fear of the LORD, then great treasure and disquietness [Or, trouble, or, vexation: to wit, which proceedeth from a bad conscience, and a mistrust of Gods favour, and consequently not joined with the fear of God. Compare below chap.16.8.] therewith. [compare bel.ch.16.8. & 17.1. Psalm.37.16.]
\p
\v 17 . Better is a mess of green pottage, [The Hebrew word here translated mess, signifieth properly victual, that a man takes along with him on his journey, Jer.40.5. but is also taken for other food, 2 Kings 25.30. Jer.52.34. and here] where also love is, then a stalled oxe, and hatred therewith. [compare below chap.17.1.]
\p
\v 18 . A wrathful man [Hebrew a man of wrath, or, of fierce anger; that is, that is soon angry, or is easily provoked. So below chap.22. verse 24. And 29.22.] will stir up brawling: [compare below chap.28.25. and 29.22.] but the long-suffering (person) will appear strife.
\p
\v 19 . The way of the slothful (man) [That is, all that he hath to do, to order, and to execute, or perform] is as an hedge of thorns: [for as it is very troublesome, and difficult to pass through briars and thorns: so the slothful person persuade himself, that all that he hath to do is as difficult and troublesome, as to go through a company of briars and thorns, and therefore he seeketh all excuses and subterfuges, to eschew working and taking of pains. Compare bel.ch. 26.13.] but the path of the righteous is well plained. [or, heightened; that is, is even, smooth, easy, and without difficult, that might cause any impediment or block to be laid in the travellers way.]
\p
\v 20 . A wise son will make the father glad: but a foolish man despiseth his mother. [Comp.above cha.10.1.]
\p
\v 21 . Folly is joy to him that is void of understanding; [Compare above chapter 10.23. and 14.9.] but a man of understanding will walk rightly. [Hebrew, will direct to walk; that is, will order, and guide his whole life, words, and works, doing, and omitting, according to that which is good and acceptable unto God: see above ch.3.on verse 6.]
\p
\v 22 . The thoughts [That is, the purposes and resolutions, or that which a man intendeth to set upon, especially if it be a matter of concernment] are frustrated, when there is no counsel: but by the multitude of counsellors [compare above chap.11.on verse 14.] shall every one [to wit, of the fore-mentioned thoughts] subsist.
\p
\v 23 . A man [To wit, a wise, and understanding man] hath joy in the answer of his mouth: [or, in the speech, and discourse of his mouth. Compare above on verse 1. And the annot. Here is spoken of that which is uttered wisely, and profitably; as the following words declare] and how good [that is, honest, or honourable to him that speaketh it, and profitable and acceptable to those that hear it] is a word in due season?
\p
\v 24 . The way of life [That is, which leadeth unto life. See above chapter 2.on verse 19.] is toward heaven, where true life and happiness is onely to be found. See Phil.3.20. and Colossians 3.1.2.] to him that hath understanding: that he may depart from hell [that is, from damnation and everlasting destruction] beneath. [that is, which is below or downward.]
\p
\v 25 . The LORD will pluck down the house of the proud; but he will set fast the border of the widow. [That is make that it shall not be removed nor diminished to her loss and damage: for in those parts the borders were not distinguished by fields, or ditches, but by pales, stakes, and stones.]
\p
\v 26 . The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD: [Compare above chapter 6.18.] but (the speeches) of the pure are pleasant speeches. [Hebr. Speeches of pleasantness: to wit, proceeding from wise and godly men. Understanding words or speeches, that tending onely to honour and virtue, are pleasing to God and profitable unto men. Compare below chapter 16.24. and the annot. Oth. The pleasant speechs are pure; to wit, before the Lord, who accounteth and esteemeth them so, because they flow from an heart that is purified by faith, Acts 15.9.]
\p
\v 27 . He that practiseth covetousness, [Hebrew, he that coveteth covetousness. See above chapter 1.on verse 19.] troubleth [see of the signification of this word, 1 Kings 18.on verse 17.] his (own) house: but he that hateth gifts, shall live. [Compare Exod.23.8. and Deut.chap.16. verse 19.]
\p
\v 28 . The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: [That is, to speak, or to begin a speech. See Judges 18.on verse 14. The meaning is, that the heart of a righteous man doth not rashly and in discreetly pour out whatsoever cometh upon the lips, but doth wisely ponder and consider aforehand what is good, and profitable, or fit to be spoken] but the mouth of the wicked will plentifully pour out [see of the Hebrew word Psalm 19.on verse 3. And above chapter 1.on verse 23.] evil things. [that is, unprofitable and hurtful things.]
\p
\v 29 . The LORD is far from the wicked: [To wit, with, or in respect of his gracious hearing, and Fatherly help. Compare Psalm 10.1. and 22.2. On the contrary, God is said to be nigh unto them, to whom he is gracious, whom he heareth and helpeth, Psalm 34.19. and 145.18.] but he will hear the prayer of the righteous.

\p
\v 30 . The light of the eyes [That is, that which is seen by the clearness of the eyes, as namely, the difference or variety of colours, the beauty and pleasantness of the fields and meadows, the presence of those whom we love and affect, and that are beneficial to us, &c. Or understand the friendly sight and countenance of one, whom we highly esteem of, as below chap.16.15.] rejoice the heart: but a good report [Hebrew hearing. Understand a good report, or, an honest name, which is apprehended and taken hold of by the hearing] maketh the bones fat. [that is, it quickeneth and enliveneth the innermost parts and members of the body, and consequently cheareth and refresheth the soul also. Compare above chapter 12. The annot. On verse 4. Of the phrase making fat, see above chap.11.on verse 25.]
\p
\v 31 . The ear that heareth the reproof of life, and shall overnight in the midst of the wise.
\p
\v 32 . He that rejecteth discipline, he despiseth his (own) soul: [Compare above chap.8.on verse 36.] but he that heareth reproof, getteth understanding. [Heb. An heart; that is, understanding and wisdom. See Job 9.on verse 4.]
\p
\v 33 . The fear of the LORD is the discipline of wisdom: [That is, the instruction, the exhortation, and amendment, that leadeth unto wisdom. See above chap.1.on verse 2.] and humility (goeth) before honour. [to wit, the honour both of this present life, and of that which is to come. Compare below chap.18.12.]

\p
\v 1 . Man hath disposing of the heart; [Understand the thoughts, which a man orderly propoundeth to himself, and intendeth of purposeth, yet not excluding the over-ruling power of Gods providence. See below chap.21.1.] but the answer of the tongue [the Hebrew word indeed signifieth properly answer, but it is also taken for all manner of speech or communication. See above chapter 15.on verse 1.] is of the LORD. [to wit, without whom they can neither utter that which they have thought and imagined, nor perform that which they have said.]
\p
\v 2 . All the ways of a man [That is, his life, his doing, and omitting. See Gen.6.on verse 12.] are pure in his (own) eyes: [that is, in his own judgement and conceit. See Job 18.on verse 3.] but the LORD weigheth [that is, searcheth, examineth, trieth, and proveth. [So below chapter 21.2. and 24.12.] the spirits. [that is, the thoughts, inclinations, motions, and purposes. See 2 Kings ch.19. on verse 7.]
\p
\v 3 . Roll thy works upon the LORD: [See Psalm 22.on verse 9. And 37.on verse 5. And compare Psalm 55.23. Matth.6.25. Luke 12.22. 1 Pet.5.7.] and thy thoughts [which are called disposings, or adornings of the heart, above verse 1. See there the annot.] shall be established.
\p
\v 4 . The LORD hath wrought all things for his own sake: [That is, for his own honour and glory, to wit, that in all his works, his wisdom, power, goodness, justice, and all his other divine attributes and properties might clearly appear. Compare Romans 9.17,22,23. And 11.36.] Ezek.1.5,6,12,14.] yea also the wicked for the day of evil. [meaning the evil of punishment. Compare Job 21.30.]
\p
\v 5 . All (or every) that is lofty in heart [That is, proud, high-minded, lofty, disdainful. See of this vice, above chapter 6.17. and 8.13. also verse 18.] is an abomination to the LORD: [Hebrew, the Lords abomination] hand to hand, he shall not be guiltness. [see the meaning of these words, above ch.11.on verse 21.]
\p
\v 6 . By mercy and faithfulness the offence is expiated: [That is, by the free grace and mercy of God, who is true and faithful in his promises, is sin pardoned and taken away, for the atonement and reconciliation made by Jesus Christ, Romans 3.24. Or, understand this of the goodness and faithfulness, which men shew to one another. To wit, not that they may merit thereby pardon of sin before God, but that they may get assurance to them selves, as by the fruits of justifying faith: and may also make it appear unto others, that they are freely by grace reconciled unto God. Also the reconciliation and atonement here, may be understood of the peace, which we make with him whom we have offended, by shewing him all manner of love and kindness, and so reconciliation our selves unto him. Comp.ab.ch.10. &.12. and the annot.] and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil, [to wit, the evil of sin, and therefore also the evil of punishment.]
\p
\v 7 . When a mans ways please the LORD, then he will also make his enemies to be at peace with him. [That is, he will not onely keep his friends, and those that never were his foes, in peace with him; but will also move and encline his very enemies unto peace and friendship, so that they shall not in any wise hurt or annoy him. See Gen.33.4. Exod.12.36.]
\p
\v 8 . Better is a little with righteousness, then a multitude of revenues without right. [To wit, gotten and gathered. Compare Psalm 37.16. above chapter 15.16.]
\p
\v 9 . The heart of a man considereth his way: [That is, bethinketh, meditateth, pondereth, what it will doe, or leave undone. Comp. Ab.verse 1. And the annotations thereon; also below ch.19.21.] but the LORD directeth his going, [that is, ordereth and disposeth of the intent and purpose of the heart (so as that it shall be either put in practise, or not) to such an end, as suiteth best with the glory of his holy Name.]
\p
\v 10 . Divination [The Hebrew word kesen, signifieth for the most part superstitious, and unlawful divination of future and hidden events, or issues, by things that go not sure, yea are devilish, as Num.22.7. and 23.23. Deut.18.10. 2 Kin.17.7. Jer.14.14. Ezek.13.6. But here it is taken for such a kind of guessing, as proceedeth from a sure certain, and acute or quick apprehension; Such kind of divination was in David, 2 Sam.14.20.and in Salomon, 1 Kings 3.24, etc.] is [Oth. Be] in the lips of the King: his mouth [namely, the mouth of a wise, and religious King] shall not transgress [Oth.transgresseth not] in judgement. [that is, in [pronouncing sentence, or judgementl sitting for that very end and purpose in the place of Judicature, or on the Judgement-seat.]
\p
\v 11 . A right balance, [Hebrew a balance of Judgement, or, right; that is, a right balance. So Lev.19,v .36. balance of righteousness, or, justice; that is, righteous, or just balance. Many Translators understanding by this word balance, a great balance, and by the following word scales, the little balance, which is held in the hand; and that because the Lord is said to weigh the mountains in the balance, but the hills, that are less, in the scales, Isa.40.12. Some understand this verse as spoken figuratively of all the parts and works of judgement] and scales are the LORDS: [to wit, delight, as is said above chap.11.1. or his work, as is said in the following words of this verse. Oth. Are of the Lord] all the weighing-stones [that is, weights. So above ch.11.1. See Lev.19.on verse 36.] of the sack [or, bag; to wit, where into they put their stones or weights, that they might the less wear out, or break. Compare Deuteronomy 25. On verse 13. Mich.6.on verse 11.] are his work. [to wit, which he hath commanded, and which pleaseth him: Meaning when they are as they ought to be. See Lev.19.36. Deut.25.13, &c. Above chap.11.1. below 20.10,23.]
\p
\v 12 . It is the abomination of Kings, [That is, a thing which they ought to abhor and abominate: or, it is an abomination unto Kings; that is, a thing which they abhore and abominate; to wit, wise, and godly Kings. See above chapter 3.on verse 32. Oth. Let it be an abomination unto Kings, &c.] to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.
\p
\v 13 . The lips of righteousness [That is, righteous, and virtuous speeches; or, the mouth that speaketh right things. Compare above chapter 12.on verse 19.] are the delight of Kings: [that is, wherein they ought to take delight. Or, are a delight unto Kings: that is, unto religious Kings. Oth. Let the lips of righteousness be a delight unto Kings: that is, well-pleasing unto them] and every one of them [to wit, Kings] will love him that speaketh right things.
\p
\v 14 . The wrath of the King is (as) the messengers of death: [That is, as messengers, telling him against whom the King is incensed, that he must die. The plural number sheweth the certainty of the message, if the Kings wrath be not appeased. See an example, Esth.7.7. Compare below chapter 19.12. and 20.2.] but a wise man will reconcile it. [to wit, wrath: that is, appease and pacify it. See examples, 1 Sam.24.10, &c. And chap.25.32,33.]
\p
\v 15 . In the light of the Kings countenance [Meaning the friendly countenance, whereby the King looketh favourably upon a man. Compare above chapter 15. The annotations on verse 30.] is life: [that is, as a messenger of life, or a refreshing of life, especially unto him, against whom the King was formerly incensed] and his delight [that is, favour and good will] is a cloud of the latter rain. [to wit, which is very welcome and acceptable, when it falleth after a long drought in the Spring, to cause the fruits to swell and to bring them to ripeness. See Deut.11.on verse 14. Compare below ch.19.12.]
\p
\v 16 . How much better is it to get wisdom, then gold digged out? [Of gold digged out, see above chap.3.on verse 14.] and more excellent to get understanding, then silver? [Compare Job 28.15. how wisdom and understanding do differ, or are distinguished in this book, see above chap.1.on verse 2.]
\p
\v 17 . The high-way of the upright is, to depart from evil: [As the high-way, or road is the safest and surest way for travellers and way-faring men, the other paths and by-ways being full of danger and peril; so there is nothing more safe and better for the godly in their spiritual journey, then to shun and avoid sin] he preserveth his soul, that keepeth his way. [see 1 Kings 2.on verse 4.]
\p
\v 18 . Pride is before breaking to shivers [That is, destruction, ruine, overthrow. So below ch.17.19. Isa.59.7. Jer.14.17.] and loftiness of spirit [that is, high-mindedness. The contrary is lowliness of spirit, whereof see the following verse] before the fall.
\p
\v 19 . It is better to be of an humble spirit [That is, to behave ones self humble and lowly, as those that are taken captive by their enemies, and are become a prey unto them. Compare Isa.57.15. where the same phrase is used] with the meek; [oth. Afflicted, wretched, or poor: who are also commonly meek] then to divide the spoil with the proud. [it is worth our observation, that robbery is here ascribed and attributed unto proud high-minded rich men.]
\p
\v 20 . He that considereth the word [To wit, of God: or, also the instruction, that agreeth with the Word of God] understandingly, shall find good: [to wit, corporal good, belonging to this temporal life; and spiritual good, belonging to life eternal, above chap.8.25. 1 Tim.4.8. Compare the phrase, below chap.17.20. and 18.22. and 19.18. The contrary hereunto is, when evil is said to find a man, Job 31.29. Esth.8.6.] and he that trusteth in the LORD, happy is he. [Compare Psalm 2.12. and 24.9. and 125.1. Isa.30.18. Jer.17.7.]
\p
\v 21 . The wise in heart shall be called understanding; [To wit, because out of true wisdom cometh prudence and understanding, whereby a man knoweth how he ought to live, and to order all things aright] and the sweetness of the lips [that is, of the speech, or discourse. See Gen.11.on verse 1.] shall increase learning. [that is, the eloquence, and dexterity of a man, whereby he is able to speak well, and to place his words right, is of use to teach and instruct others profitably.]
\p
\v 22 . The understanding of them that possess it, [Hebr. Of its masters, owners, lords, or possess it, and are therewith endowed, and have the use of it. See Gen.14.on ver13.] is a well-spring of life; [to wit, which continually enlighteneth by teaching, quickeneth by comforting, strengtheneth by exhorting, &c. Without being diminished or lessened in it self. See above chapter 10.on verse 11. Also chapter 13,14.] but the instruction of fools [the Hebrew word musar, is also taken for bad discipline or instruction, Jer.10.8.] is folly. [to wit, which bringeth death with it.]
\p
\v 23 . A wise mans heart maketh his mouth [That is, the mouth of the wise man] understanding: [that is, directeth, prepareth, and disposeth his mouth, that he may not speak otherwise then judiciously, prudently, and seasonably] and shall increase learning in his lips. [that is, good instruction in his mouth, so that he shall be desirous to communicate it unto others, and pour it forth in great abundance, to the edification and instruction of others.]
\p
\v 24 . Pleasant speeches, [Hebr. Speechs of pleasantness. Meaning the sayings or communications of the wise, which are gracious, and delightful, by their manifold teaching and instruction, exhortation, comfort, admonition. Compare above chapter 15.26. and the annot.] are an honey-comb; sweet to the soul, [ to wit, that is wise and understanding] and physic to the bones. [see above chapter 4.on verse 22. Oth. Health. Compare also above chapter 14.on verse 30.]
\p
\v 25 . There is a way, that seemeth right unto man: but the last thereof, are the ways of death. [See the exposition of this verse, above chapter 14.on verse 12.]
\p
\v 26 . The soul of the laborious man [That is, the man that laboureth, to wit, to get his living. Soul for man, see Gen.12.on verse 5.] laboureth for himself: [that is, for the sustentation of his own body] for the mouth [to wit, which must use and eat food for all the members of the body. Compare Eccles.6.7.] boweth it self before him [to wit, the laboureth, or the man that laboureth: to wit, as it were with reverence, entreating and beseeching the labouring man to work diligently, that he may always have something to offer, and present unto the mouth. It is a similitude taken from those, that put up a Petition to some LORDS or great person, to whom they shew great honour and respect, to gain their favour and good will. Others render this verse thus: A troublesome soul (that is, that causeth trouble by words) causeth trouble to her self: for her mouth is bent against her; that is, her troublesome speeches do fall cross against themselves, and create trouble unto her.]
\p
\v 27 . A man of Belial [See Deut.13.on verse 13.] diggeth up evil: [that is, plotteth, and practiseth to do his neighbour a mischief: as men dig with labour and pains for a thing that they would fain have out of the ground] and in his lips (there) is as a burning fire. [to wit, of slander, whereby he with an hot and eager desire brandeth the good name and repute of his neighbour, that he may utterly undo him. Compare above chapter 12.18.]
\p
\v 28 . A forward man [See above chapter 6.on verse 14.] will cast in strife: [see on the same place. Compare above chapter 15.18. and below chapter 26.21. and 29.22.] and a whisperer [that is, a secret back biter, who privily speaketh evil of his neighbour. So below cha.18.8. and 26.20,21.] separateth the chiefest friend: [or, leader, and predecessor; to wit, of friends: that is, the best and chiefest friend of all. So below chapter 17.9. also compare Psalm 55.14. Oth. Separeteth the Prince: that is, Princes, from one another.]
\p
\v 29 . A man of violence [That is, that practiseth violence, wickedness, and injustice, see Job 11.11. Psalm 5.7. and the annot.] enticeth his neighbour: [he doth not onely oppress and wrong others himself; but striveth also to draw in his neighbour, or companion, to do the same with him. See above ch.1.11. and of the Hebrew word, Judg.14.on verse 15.] and he leadeth him into a way, that is not good: [see above chap.2.on verse 12.]
\p
\v 30 . He shutteth his eyes to devise frowardnesses: [That is, he closet or shutteth his eyes, that he may the better busy himself with forward and perverse thoughts: for by the beholding of outward objects, the inward senses are stopped and hindered in their workings and operations. Compare above chap.6.14. and the annot.] biting his lips [Hebr. Cutting in, or, speedily stirring, and moving, and breaking off his speeches; that is, propounding, or uttering one part of them, and keeping back, or concealing of the other, which he properly intendeth, in his heart] he bringeth evil [to wit, the evil which he intendeth to do unto his neighbour] to pass. [to wit, fully concluding and intending it in the thoughts of his heart.]
\p
\v 31 . The hoariness is a beautiful crown: [That is, that bringeth beauty or glory to a man. See above chap.4.on verse 9. Hebr. Crown of beauty, or, glory. Compare also above chapter 12. On verse 4. Also below cha.20.27.] it is found in the way of righteousness. [Otherwise called the paths of judgement. See above ch.2.8. and the annot. The meaning is, that the godly do often get the Crown, to wit, when it is good for them. Or understand that hoariness (or the hoary head) is a path of righteousness. Compare Psalm 37.11, 18, 27. And the annot. See also above chap.3.on ver.2.]
\p
\v 32 . The long-suffering (man) [Hebr. Long of wraths. See above ch.14.on verse 29.] is better then the mighty (man) : and he that hath rule over his (own) spirit, [that is, his own will, inclination, affections, passions, motions, that are evil. See 2 Kings 19.on verse 7.] then he that taketh a City.
\p
\v 33 . The lot [Which in former times was much used, in the dividing of inheritances, Numb.26.25. Jos.18.10. and 19.1. Mat.2.5. and of Other goods, Psalm 22 19. Above chapter 14. Also in the executing, and ordering of divine, and holy matters, Lev.16.8, etc. 1 Chron.24.5, &c. Acts 1.25. also in the deciding of controversies, and other doubtful things, Jos.7.14. 1 Sa.14.41. below chapter 18.18. Jonah 1.7.] is cast into the lap: [or, in a close vessel, or secret place. Compare below Chapter 17.23.] but the whole disposing thereof [the Hebrew word signifieth principally judgement, but here it is taken for the disposing; that is, the guiding, and governing of a thing: as the word judging, or converse 16. Also Psalm 96.13. Mic.4.3. Zach.3.7, &c. Oth. The whole judgement of it; that is, that which is judged by the lot] is of the LORD. [to wit, who by his providences so ruleth and directeth the lot, as he will have it fall: insomuch that nothing here happeneth by chance, or blind fortune.]

See the annot. There] with strife. [Hebr. Of strife: that is, where there is strife withal. Comp.above chap.15.17.]
\p
\v 2 . An understanding servant shall have rule over a son, that maketh ashamed: [Compare above chap.10.on verse 5.] and he shall divide the inheritance in the midst of the brethren. [the meaning is, that he shall also carry away a part of the inheritance among the brethren of the son, as that he shall be entrusted with, that causeth shame. Others understand he shall be as it were Governor or Guardian of the children, and shall be in such respect among them, as that he shall be entrusted with the disposing of their means and estate, and consequently with the dividing of their inheritances.]
\p
\v 3 . The fining-pot is for silver [By the fining-pot here, is meant a vessel, wherein silver is melted, and refined. So below chapter 27.21.] and the furnace [to wit, wherein, silver, tin, copper, &c. Is melted, and refined. See Ezek.22.18,19,20,&c.] for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts. [meaning, the LORD alone. Men may indeed by their art silver, and gold, to know whether it be good or bad: but none can search into the heart of man, save God alone. Compare Jer.17.10.]
\p
\v 4 . The wicked doer [That is, he that doth evil to his neighbour, or is prone to do evil] giveth heed to the unrighteous lip: [Hebr. Lip of unrighteousness: to wit, which sheweth, how a man may commit iniquity, or unrighteousness, and hurt his neighbour] a liar [Heb. Falsehood, or lying: See Job 35.

Hearing lying in the perverse tongue.]
\p
\v 5 . He that mocketh the poor [To wit, either in gesture, word, or deed.

See below chapter 24.17.] shall not be guiltless.[that is, remain unpunished. See 1 Kings 2.on verse 9.]
\p
\v 6 . Childrens children [To wit, that are wise and godly; in whom, the parents, that are old, enjoy the blessing of God, of which, see Psalm 127.3. and 128.3.] are the Crown [that is, ornament. See ab.chap.12.on verse 4.] of old men: and the ornament of children are their fathers. [for it is an honourable thing to be born of honest and religious parents.]
\p
\v 7 . An excellent lip [Hebr. A lip of excellency, or, eminency; that is, an excellent speech or sentence treating of excellent and transcendent things, as of wisdom, and virtue.

See 1 Sam.25.on verse 25.] much less (doth) a lying a Prince.
\p
\v 8 . The gift is a gracious stone [Hebr. A stone of grace: that is, as a gracious and precious stone, or pearl, which for its beauty and preciousness is wont to be very delightful and pleasant] in the eyes of its lords: [that is, those that are prone to receive it, or that have already received it, and do now enjoy it. See of this word Gen.14.on verse 13.] whithersoever it shall turn it self, [to wit, the gift, by the disposing and offering of the giver. Oth. Whithersoever he (to wit, the giver, or owner) shall turn himself, he shall, &c.] it shall prosper. [that is, it shall perform something with him that receiveth it, to the benefit and advantage of the giver. Salomon speaketh not here of that which ought to be done, but of that which is wont to be done.]
\p
\v 9 . He that covereth [To wit, by forgetting, and forgiving it] the transgression, [to wit, which is committed against him by his neighbour. Compare above chap.10.12.] seeketh love: [that is, he endeavoureth to feed, and maintain the love, wherewith he is loved of his friend] but he that reporteth the matter, [or, the word; to wit, of the transgression] separateth the chiefest friend. [see above chap.16.on verse 28.]
\p
\v 10 . The reproof entereth deeper into the man of understanding, then to smite a fool an hundred times. [To wit, to bring him to amendment.]
\p
\v 11 . Surely the rebellious (person) [Hebr. The rebellion; that is, he that is exceeding rebellious. See Job 35.on verse 13. So above verse 4. Falsehood, for false person. Understand him that is rebellious against God, and against those that are set over him] seeketh evil: [to wit, that he may do it to his neighbour, and especially to the godly man. Or, the rebellious (person) seeketh onely evil: Oth. The evil (man) seeketh onely, or, surely rebellion] but a cruel messenger [to wit, Satan, or some grievous plague, or judgement, which God useth as his executioners] shall be sent [namely, by God] against him.
\p
\v 12 . Let a hear that is robbed of (her) whelps, come and meet a man; but not a fool in his folly: [That is, when by his folly he is driven on to all unreasonable and raging passion. The meaning is, that there is less danger in meeting a bear in his raging cruelty, then to meet a fool, when he is carried on to unruly and raging passions.]
\p
\v 13 . He that rewardeth evil for Good, [Compare Deu.32.35. Prov.20.22. and 24.29. Rom.12.17. 1 Thess.5.15. 1 Pet.3.9.] evil [to wit, the evil of punishment. See Gen.19.on verse 19.] shall not depart from his house. [that is, from his household, or family. See Gen.7.on verse 1. Or from his flock, and posterity; to wit, that imitate and follow his sins. See 1 Kings 14.on verse 10.]
\p
\v 14 . The beginning of strife [That is, that which beginneth the strife, or the difference] is (as) one that giveth the water an opening: [that is, that letteth in the water, by opening the sluce, or breaking the bank, whereby it is withheld from breaking violently in; for as long as this opening, or breach lasteth, there is no stopping of the water from running, yea the passage of it growth still wider and wider] therefore forsake contention, before it [to wit, strife or contention] mingle it self. [Or, be mingled; to wit, that are drawn into it, and are troubled with or about it; or, before thou mingle thy self with it; or, meddle with it.]
\p
\v 15 . Whoso justifieth the wicked [That is, cleareth, and pronounceth them just and righteous. See Genesis 44.on verse 16. And Deut.25.on verse 1.] and condemneth the righteous, [that is, pronounceth them unrighteous, guilty, and worthy to be punished. See Deut.25.on verse 1.] are an abomination unto the LORD, yea they both. See the same phrase below chap.20.10,12.]
\p
\v 16 . Why should (there) now be money in the hand of a fool, [That is, wealth, and means, to learn arts and sciences] to buy wisdom, [to wit, as other things, which may always be had for money or ware, as if (forsooth) wisdom and learning were altogether such, and were also in like manner to be obtained by every one, even by very fools] seeing he hath no understanding? [Hebr. Heart: that is, understanding. See Job 9.on verse 4. He speaketh of understanding, whereby a man is fit to desire wisdom earnestly, to apprehend it deeply, and to use it profitably.]
\p
\v 17 . A friend [To wit, he that is a true friend; that is, that sheweth kindness and faithfulness to his friend, Genesis 24.49. and that loveth truth and peace, Zach.8.19.] loveth at all times: [not onely min prosperity, but also in adversity] and a brother [that is, one that sheweth true brotherly love, to help his friend out of trouble, or at last to give him some ease in it, according to his power] is born in distress. [that is, is by Gods Providence sent, and brought to light, so that in adversity brother. Oth. A brother is born against distress: To wit, to assist a man in it. Or, and he (to wit, the friend) is born a brother in distress.]
\p
\v 18 . A man void of understanding stricketh hands; [See above chap.6.on verse 1.] making himself surety [or, promising suretiship] with [Hebrew before the face of: that is, in the presence of. Oth. Before] his neighbour. [meaning the creditor, for whose security the surety bindeth himself to pay, in case the party principal fail. Others understand the debtor, for whom the suretiship is entered into.]
\p
\v 19 . He that loveth brawling, loveth transgression: [The reason is, because scolding and contention is the original cause of many sins, which the contentious person by his actings seemeth to love] he that exalteth his door, [to wit, the door of his building, which he hath raised high] seeketh breaking, [that is, damage and destruction. So above chap.16.18. see above ch.8.on ver.36. This letter clause is to be understood as a common proverb, of those that go above their estate, in apparel, or otherwise. For as an house that is built very high, is oftentimes subject to fall; so shall a man that lifteth up himself above his estate, and despiseth his neighbour, whom he seeketh to oppress by strifes and contentions, often, get a cruel and terrible fall.]
\p
\v 20 . Whoso is forward [Or, perverse. See above ch.6.on verse 14.] in heart, shall not find the thing that is good: [compare above ch.16.20. and the annot.] and he that is perverse in his tongue, [see above ch.2.on v.12.] shall fall into mischief.
\p
\v 21 . Whoso begetteth a fool, [That is, one that will in time be a fool] (he) shall be a grief unto him: and the father of the fool, [see of this word fool, above on v.7.] shall have no joy.
\p
\v 22 . A merry heart shall make a medicine good: [that is, powerful, efficacious, that it may do the body good. Compare the phrase with above chap.15.2. Oth. Shall do good (as) a medicine, to wit, to the body, to keep and preserve it in good health. Or, maketh good medicine; to wit, which causeth the body to proper] but a wounded spirit shall dry up the bones. [that is, the inward members, and powers of the body. See Job 7.on verse 15.]
\p
\v 23 . The wicked (man) will take the gift out of the bosome; [To wit, of him that presenteth it; that is, he will take it privily, and in secret: for no man would be willingly known to be such a one that perverteth judgement. Compare above chap.16.on verse 33.] to wrest the ways of judgement. [that is, to pervert the course of justice and equity, that may be held in places of Judicature. Compare Exod.23.3. also below chap.18.5. and 21.14. Isa.10.2. Amos 5.12.]
\p
\v 24 . Wisdom is in the face of him that hath understanding: [That is, wisdom is seen in the very eyes of a man of understanding, when a man looks upon the steadiness of his eyes, the melodesty of his countenance, the shamefacedness of his looks. Others understand this thus, that wisdom is always present with those that have understanding, and is not far to seek: or that they have it always ready before their eyes, to order themselves according unto it, Eccles.2.14.] but the eyes of the fool are in the end of the earth. [that is, a fools look moveth, and wandereth to and fro into all corners. The flying or straying eyes are a token of the vanity, and in stability of the mind. Oth. The fool looketh every where to find wisdom, but all in vain, above chapter 14.6.]
\p
\v 25 . A foolish son is a grief to his father; and bitter sorrow to her, that bare him. [Hebr. Bitterness; that is, cause of sorrow, that is of a most bitter taste and relish unto her heart. See 2 Kings 4.on verse 27. Compare also above chap.10.1. and 15.20. and here verse 21. And below chap.19.13.]
\p
\v 26 . It is good, [That is, it very bad, unseemly, and stark haught. So below chap.18.5. and 19.2. and 20.23. So not evil, that which is not good, below chap.31.12.] to cause the righteous [that is, the guiltless or innocent person] also to be amerced; [that is, not onely the wicked, but also the godly: or, it is not good, to set a fine upon the righteous, much less to inflict corporal punishment upon them wrongfully, and underservedly] that Princes should strike (a man) for that which is right. [or, beyond, or, against right, or, equity.]
\p
\v 27 . Whoso knoweth knowledge, [That is, he that hath good and found understanding] refraineth his words; (and) a man of understanding is costly in spirit in mind, not rashly, nor indiscreetly dispersing whatsoever he knoweth, or hath in his heart. Oth. Is cold in spirit, or, of a cold mind and temper; that is, free from passions, or perturbations, and slow to speak. See of the word spirit, taken in this sense, 2 Kings 19.7. and below chap.29.11. See the annot.]
\p
\v 28 . A very fool, that holdeth his peace, shall be counted wise; (and) he that shutteth his lips, a man of understanding.
\c 18
\s Retiredness to the seeking and searching after wisdom, 1. Whereunto a fool hath no desire, 2. Wise speeches, 4. The office and duty of a judge, 5. Foolish speechs, 6,7. Whispering, 8. Slothfulness in working, 9. Confidence in God, 10. In riches, 11. Of pride and humility, 12. Indiscreet answer, 13. Courage and dejectedness, 14. Increasing in knowledge, 15. Gifts, 16. Law-suits, 17. The lot, 18. Differences between brethren, 19. Fruits of the poor and rich, 23. Friends, 24.
\p
\v 1 . He that separateth himself, [To wit, from the society of men, being inclined to live in quietness and retiredness] endeavoureth after something that is desirable: [Hebrew after desire; that is, he commonly intendeth something that is desirable, he diligently pursueth after, seeking to get it in the retiredness. Oth. Seeketh with, or, by desire] he mingleth himself in all durable wisdom. [the wise man speaketh of him, whose desire, and delight is to dive into the search, and seeking out of all good knowledge, and true wisdom, to have thereof a found knowledge and apprehension, which he may lock up in the cabinet of his heart. This sense is strongly confirmed by the opposition of the following verse. Others understand here an evil separating or withdrawing, whereby a man separateth and withdraweth himself from the truly wise and right-meaning, or right-judging ones, being moved and carried thereunto by a greedy desire after vain glory, whereunto he seeketh to attain, by insinuating himself through his crafty and cunning acute wit, into all good wisdom and learning, oppositing himself against it, and sucking his venom and poison out of it, which he afterward upon all occasions poureth out every where, with a great shew of high and transcendent wisdom.]
\p
\v 2 . The fool hath no delight in understanding: but therein [To wit, he will have onely delight] that his heart may discover it self. [or, in the discovery of his heart; or, that he may discover his heart: to wit, by foolish speeches betraying the folly wherewith his heart is freighted.]
\p
\v 3 . When the wicked cometh, (then) cometh also contempt; [To wit, whereby he not onely contemneth and despiseth the godly in his heart, but also affronteth and disgraceth them in words and deeds, or whereby he is contemned and despised of the godly] and with ignominy, reproach. [or, with the ignominious (person;) that is, dishonest man, cometh also reproach, to wit, whereby he reproacheth others, or is reproached of others.]
\p
\v 4 . The words of a mans mouth [To wit, of the mouth of a man of great understanding, and respect] are deep water [that is, as deep waters, which cannot be emptied, or drained; as also such a man never wanteth matter of good instruction, when it is desired of him. Compare below chap.20.5.] and the well-spring of wisdom is a brook pouring out. [that is, that hath always floods and streams in readiness, to utter and give out at pleasure, and is never dried up.]
\p
\v 5 . It is not good [That is, it is bad. See above chap.17.on verse 26.] to accept the face of the wicked; [see Lev.19.on verse 15. Also Deut.1.17. and 16.19. below chap.24.23.] to wrest the righteous in judgement. [that is, to cause him that hath a just cause to lose it, to lie under and to be oppressed in judgement, and to be condemned by the Judge. So Amos 5.12.]
\p
\v 6 . The lips of [That is, the words and speeches. So in the following verse, where also the word mouth is taken in the same sense. See Job 15.on verse 5.] of a fool, enter into contention; [that is, a fool by his foolish talk thrusteth himself into strife and contention, out of which he might have tarried with better credit] and his mouth calleth for stroaks. [that is, bringeth contentious persons together, and provoketh them to fighting: or, he is not quiet till he hath gotten his back full of blows, he calleth for them.]
\p
\v 7 . The fools mouth is a disturbance to himself; [That is, that cause of his disturbance; that is, of his ruine and destruction. Compare chap.10.14. and 13.3.] and his the lips (are) a snare of his soul. [to wit, where he is taken himself. Compare above chapter 12,13. And the annot.]
\p
\v 8 . The words of the whisperer are as (the words) of them that are beaten: [That is, that behave themselves very mournfully, feigning themselves to have suffered wrong, to move them to pity, whose ears they fill with their whispering, and telling of tales, and to set them on against their neighbour. Oth. Are as stripes; to wit, wherewith they hurt and wound their neighbour in his good name. Compare above chapter 12.18. so below chapter 26.22. Or, are as (the words) of those that flatter; that is, sooth and cog] and they go down into the innermost (parts) [Hebrew into the inner chambers] of the belly. [that is, of the mind. See Job 15.on verse 2.]
\p
\v 9 . Also he that behaveth himself slothful in his work [Meaning the sluggard, and lazy or slothful person] he is the brother of a waster. [that is, of a great spend-thirst. Hebrew, of the Lord waster, or, of the master of wasting, or, spending; that is, that is very prone and enclined thereunto, and maketh it his business, or whose employment. See Genesis 14.on verse 13. The meaning is, that he that is slothful in his work, or labour, is to be put in equal degree with the waster, or spend thrift, or to be compared with him. See of such signification of the word brother, Job 30.29. and the annot.]
\p
\v 10 . The Name of the LORD, [That is, the Lord himself, see 1 Kings 5.on verse 3.] is a strong Tower; [Hebrew a tower of strength; that is, as a strong tower, wherein those that are any ways distressed, are not onely protected and defended, but also freed and delivered from all danger of hurt. So Psalm 61.4. The Lord is a strong tower, to wit, for those that know him aright, and call upon him, as they ought. Compare 2 Sam.22.51. and Psalm 18.3.] the righteous shall run unto it, [to wit, unto the Name of the Lord, or to the tower of strength] and be set in an high place of safely. [Compare Psalm 61.4. and below chap.29.25.]
\p
\v 11 . The rich mans wealth is the city of his strength; [So above chap.10.15.] and as an exalted wall in his (own) imagination. [that is, as the rich man persuadeth himself, and fancieth in his own conceit.]
\p
\v 12 . Before breaking, [That is, adversity, ruine, and destruction. See of the Hebrew word, Job 31.on verse 29.] the heart of man will lift up it self: [compare above chap.11.2. and 16.18.] and humility goeth before honour. [so above ch.15.33.]
\p
\v 13 . He that giveth answer, [Hebrew he that returneth a word; that is, he answereth. So 1 Kings 12.verse 6,9. 2 Chron.10.6,9.] before he hath heard (the matter;) it is folly, and shame unto him. [that is, it is justly counted folly unto him, whereby he then getteth shame and disgrace.]
\p
\v 14 . The spirit [That is, the mind, to wit, that is courageous and bold. See above chap.15.on verse 13.] will sustain his infirmity: [to wit, either his own infirmity, as grief, and fear, or his bodies infirmity, as sickness, and pain. All these the courageous and manly spirit is said to uphold or sustain, when it strengtheneth and comforteth a man in them, so that he fainteth not] but a dejected spirit, [which is cast down by his own, or its bodies suffering. Compare above chap.15.13. and the annot.] who shall lift it up? [as he had said, none but God can do this. Oth. Bear.]
\p
\v 15 . The heart of him that hath understanding getteth knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge. [Men of understanding, and wise men here, are those that having gotten a beginning of understanding and wisdom, seek to increase it, by pondering and keeping in their hearts that which they have already learnt, and by listening and giving ear unto that which yet is to be learned. Compare above chap.1.5.]
\p
\v 16 . A mans gift maketh room for him: [That is, openeth a way unto him, to come out of adversity, or to get to the end of a suit, or a trouble] and it bringeth him before the face of great (men). [that is, that are great of estate and repute, and consequently can prevail much, to further a mans cause. Compare 2 Kings 5.1. and 10.6. and 25.9. and the annot.]
\p
\v 17 . He that is first in his (own) cause [That is, he that hath gotten the start of his neighbour in the suit, that he hath against him, by opening his cause before the Judge, and clothing, or colouring it over with reasons and garments] (seemeth) just: [that is, to be in the right, to wit, as long as his adversary hath not been yet heard] but his neighbour [to wit, the defendant] cometh, [to wit, before the Judge, to lay his cause likewise open before him] and he [to wit, the Judge, or the adverse party] searcheth him. [namely, his neighbour, that is, the defendant, to hear him likewise, and to examine him about that which the plaintiff had first alledged.]
\p
\v 18 . The lot causeth controversies to cease; [See abo.chap.16.on verse 33.] and maketh partition between the mighty. [that is, those that harden themselves, and make themselves strong and powerful against another, or that have strength and power enough to hurt one another, if they be not united and reconciled.]
\p
\v 19 . A brother is more refractory [Or, more provoked, by transgression, to wit, against his brother, by whom he conceiveth himself to be wronged, and therefore is at variance with him] then a strong city: [to wit, against her Prince, or any Lord, to whom she will not yield up her self, nor make peace with him, relying upon her own strength. Hebr. City of strength] and the differences [to wit, between brethren, and near kindred] are as a bar of a peace. [that is, they hold very strongly and firmly, and shut or keep out continually the contentious brethren from one another.]
\p
\v 20 . By the fruit of a mans mouth [Meaning the speeches or communication that issueth forth out a mans mouth, and is called in the following words of this verse, the revenue of the lips. Compare above ch.12.on verse 14. And 13. On verse 2.] shall his belly [that is, he himself both in body and soul] be satisfied: he shall be satisfied by the revenue of his lips. [that is, be filled, either by the good of blessing, by his wise and godly communication, or with the evil of punishment, by his foolish and wicked discourse. Compare Job 7.on verse 4. And above ch.12.on verse 14. And 13.2.]
\p
\v 21 . Death, and life are the power [Hebrew hand. Compare Gen.16.6. and see the annot.] of the tongue: [compare below chap.21.23. and James 3.2.] and every one that loveth it, [to wit, the tongue: namely, to use it, either for good, by wise, and virtuous speechs; or for evil, by foolish, and vicious communication. But some take it onely for a good end] shall eat [that is, enjoy with gladness, if he love it so, as to use it well; or suffer with pain and grief: if he love it so, as to abuse it. See Job 21.on verse 25.] the fruit thereof. [see above chap.1.on verse 31.]
\p
\v 22 . Whoso hath found a wise, [To wit, a good, and godly wife. The word good must be understood from that which followeth. So below chap.22.1. name, for good name: also chap.24.6. counsellors, for good counsellor: and the same chapter, verse 20. Reward, for good reward. And chap.29.4. a King, for a good and wise King] hath found a good thing: and he hath drawn [that is, obtained] delight from the LORD. [see above ch.8.on v.35. and 12.2. comp.bel.ch.19.14.]
\p
\v 23 . The poor speaketh intreaties: but the rich answereth hard things.
\p
\v 24 . A man that hath friends, [Hebrew a man of friends; that is, that hath friends] must behave himself friendly: [to wit, toward those with whom he hath entered into friendship] for there is a lover, that cleaveth more [that is, sticketh closer to a man in time of need, and assisteth him more faithfully] then a brother. Compare above ch.17.17.]
\c 19

\p
\v 1 . The poor walking in his uprightness, [That is, living in unfeigned intergrity. See above chapter 2.on verse 7.] is better then the perverse in lips, [see above chapter 2.on verse 12.] and that is a fool. [see above chap.1.on verse 22.]
\p
\v 2 . Also the soul [That is, the desire, and affection, to do a thing , or to leave it undone. See Psalm 27.on verse 12. The Prophet reproveth two things. 1. To be prone and enclined to a thing, of which a man hath no knowledge or understanding. 2. If a man have understanding of it, yet to set upon, and to peruse it rashly, and unadvisedly] without knowledge, [that is, that understandeth not, what is should do, or leave undone, to please God, and to walk circumspectly and profitably towards men] is not good: [that is, very bad, and hurtful. Compare above chapter 17.26. and the annot.] and he that is hasty with (his) feet, [to wit, unto evil. Or understand it thus: he that runneth on hastily, with an unadvised mind, and with posting head-long affections, without first taking counsel, or being well-advised upon the matter he goeth about. See above chap.1.on verse 15.] sinneth.
\p
\v 3 . The foolishness of man will pervert his way: [That is, will disappoint, confound, and destroy all his purposes, resolutions, affairs, and practises] and his heart will fret against the LORD. [that is, will murmur, and vex it self with a conceit, as if the blame or fault were in God, that all his intentions and actions are lost, and come to nothing.]
\p
\v 4 . Wealth maketh many friends: [So above chapter 14.20.] but the poor is separated from his friend. [though he have but one friend, yet even of him he is often left and forsaken. See the same place below verse 7.]
\p
\v 5 . A false witness [Hebr. A witness of falsehoods] shall not be guiltless: [that is, not be unpunished. See 1 Kings 2.on verse 9. Compare Deut.19.19. and bel.chap.21.28.] and he that bloweth lies, [So above ch.6.19. See the annot.. there] shall not escape.
\p
\v 6 . Many entreat the face [That is, the person. See of the Hebrew word taken in the same sense, Job 11.19. and the annot.] of the Prince; and every one is a friend to him, that giveth gifts. [Or, of the liberal man. See of the Hebrew word Nadib, Job 12.on verse 21. Hebrew to the man, or, of the man of gifts; that is, that is prone to give, and to communicate liberally.]
\p
\v 7 . All the brethren [That is, that are of his kindred, though not affected to him with sincere and unfeigned love] of the poor [that is, of him that is improverished and decreased in wealth] do hate him: [that is, forsake him, even as if they hated him: or they love him less now, then they did before he was grown poor. See Genesis 20.on verse 31. Compare above chapter 14.20. and here verse 4.] how much more do his friends [that is, his acquaintance, and companions, though but in shew: for what an unfeigned friend is, see above chapter 17.17. and 18.24.] go far from him? He [to wit, the poor man] runneth after them [to wit, after his brethren, and friends] (with) words, [to wit, whereby he calleth unto them for help] which are not. [to wit, of any force or value; forasmuch as they are not accepted; but despised, and rejected. Or, but they, to wit, his brethren, and friends, are not the same; to wit, that they pretended themselves to be, before the improverished man by reason of his poverty ran after them. Oth. He pursueth words, which are not. That is, he relieth on promises, which they made unto him before he became poor, which are of no value.]
\p
\v 8 . He that getteth understanding, [That is, he that endeavoureth to get understanding. Hebr. The heart; which word is often taken in Scripture for wisdom, and understanding. See Job 9.on verse 4.] loveth his (own) soul; he heedeth understanding, [See above ch.1.on ver.3.] to find good. [see ab.ch.16.on ver.20.]
\p
\v 9 . A false witness [Hebr. A witness of falsehoods, [So above verse 5. See there the annot.] shall not be guiltless: and he that bloweth lies shall perish.
\p
\v 10 . Pleasure becometh not a fool: [The reason is, because he growth polisher thereby; that is, more wanton, and more wilful] how much less a servant to have rule over Princes? [so below ch.30.22.]
\p
\v 11 . Understanding of a man differed his anger: [Hebr. Lengtheneth, or, prolongeth: that is, delayeth his anger, putteth it off, restraineth, or curbeth it. Oth. It is a mans discretion to defer his anger: The same phrase is also used, Isa.48.9.] and (it) is his ornament, [to wit, a mans ornament] to pass by the transgression. [that is, to pass by the wrong that is done to him, by forgetting, and forgiving it, so far as may stand with the glory of God, and with the good of man.]
\p
\v 12 . The Kings wrath is as the roaring of a young lion: [Called by the Hebrews chepir, which is very fierce, and cruel, being older and bigger then a lions whelp, which they call gur. See Ezek.19.2. Compare above chap.16.14. and below chapter 20.2.] but his delight [that is, his favour and good will, which he beareth to a man] is as dew upon the herb. [whereby the herb (or grass) is moistened, refreshed, and fed.]
\p
\v 13 . A foolish son is his fathers great misery: [The Hebrew word is used in the plural number, to express the greatness or abundance of misery, and grief. Comp. Above chapter 10.1. and 15.20. and 17.25.] and the contentions of a woman [meaning a wife, who with her scolding and brawling may occasion much sadness, trouble and hurt in the whole family, and set it out of order] are (as) a continual dropping. [to wit, which rotteth the house, hurteth the household-stuff, annoyeth those of the household ort family, yea in the end driveth them also out of the house. Comp.bel.ch.27.15.]
\p
\v 14 . House and riches are inheritance of the fathers: [that is, are inherited by children from their parents] but an understanding wife is from the LORD. [to wit, as a peculiar and principal gift, which is not given to every one, neither cometh it by inheritance, or succession. See above chapter 18.22.]
\p
\v 15 . Slothness causeth (a man) to fall into deep sleep: [Slothfulness begetteth idleness: causeth sleepiness, whence issueth unhealthiness, languishing of the members, and dullness of the spirit; wherewith poverty is also wont to follow. See ab.ch.6.9,10,11. And bel.ch.20.13.] and a deceitful soul [meaning a man that will not work, and therefore seeketh to get a livelihood by evil and wicked practises. Comp.ab.ch.10.4.] shall suffer hunger.

\v 16 . He that keepeth the commandment [That is, the commandments; to wit, the commandments of God; and especially those which he enjoineth and commandeth in the Moral law.

Comp.ab.ch.13.24. and bel.ch.23.13.] but lift not up thy soul, to kill him. [to wit, through want of punishment, or too much beating, or other severity. That is, break not out into anger, with an evil desire, to &c. The lifting up of the soul signifieth indeed sometimes a good and lawful motion or moving of the mind, united and conjoined with an eager desire, and earnest longing, as Deut.24.15. Psalm 25.1. Jer.44.14. but it signifieth also desire, and moving to that which is evil, as here, and Psalm 24.4. Hos.4.6. Oth. And let not thine heart pardon (him) to his destruction, or, lift not up thy soul for his roaring; that is, care not for it.]
\p
\v 19 . He that is great in wrath, [To wit, the son, that is very witful, and forward, or who because of the puniment roareth mighty, and maketh a loud noise] shall suffer punishment. [that is, ought not to escape punishment, yea even for the immoderate noise and great ado that he maketh] for if thou deliver (him), [to wit, from the punishment which he hath deserved] then thou must yet go on. [to wit, in punishing of him; because he being freed from chastening, will grow worse, and be the cause of much evil and mischief. Or, he shall pay a fine: for if thou ease him of it, that is, pay the fine for him, thou must do it more. Some take these words to be meant in general of all wrathful men, or of all men that are exceedingly bent and prone to wrath.]
\p
\v 20 . Hear counsel, [To wit, good and wise counsel] and receive discipline, [that is, true instruction by words, or, also chastening by blows. See of the Hebrew word, above chapter 7.on verse 22.

\v 22 . The wish of a man is his kindness: [To wit, to be rich, that he might do good to the needy. The wish (or desire) of a man; to wit, that fain would be rich , that he might (as he faith) do every man good, but yet notwithstanding when he is grown rich, doth it not. Oth. Let the wish (or desire) of man be his kindness, or bounty] but the poor (man) [that is, he that hath nothing to help others withal, neither maketh a fair outward shew by vain and empty promises] is better then a lying man. [to wit, who can, and promiseth to shew kindness and liberality, but indeed and in truth doth it not.]
\p
\v 23 . The fear of the LORD is unto life; [That is, is profitable both for temporal, and eternal life, 1 Timothy 4.8.] for men shall [to wit, when they have the true fear of God] being satisfied [to wit, with the benefits and blessings of God] overnight; [that is, enjoy good rest. Compare Psalm 25.13. Of the contrary, see Psalm 59.15,16.] they shall not be visited [namely, to their destruction. Of the word visiting, see Gen.ch.21.on verse 1.] with evil.

\v 24 . A sluggard hideth (his) hand in (his) bosome: [That is, he will not lay hand on any work: Oth. In the dish, or platter; to wit, make meat, to food out of it.

Comp.bel.ch.26.15.] and he will not bring it to his mouth again.]
\p
\v 25 . Smite the scorner, [To wit, to punish him for his scorning. Of the word scorner, see Psalm 1.on verse 1.] then will the simple [this word is here taken in a good sense, for the ignorant, and sincere, that are docible, and fit, or desirous to be taught, and instructed. See above chap.1.on verse 4.] become prudent: and reprove a man of understanding; [to wit, with words, so Gen.ch.21.verse 25. Job 15.3. ab. Ch.9.8.] he will apprehend knowledge. [comp.bel.ch.21.11.]
\p
\v 26 . Whoso wasteth (his) father, [That is, maketh him bare and naked. See of the Hebrew word also, Judg.5.on verse 27.] or chaseth away (his) mother; [to wit, his own father, or his own mother] is a son that maketh ashamed, [see above chapter 10.on verse 5. Oth.

[to wit, which engender knowledge.]
\p
\v 28 . A witness of Belial [Meaning a wicked varlet, that will hearken to no man. See Deut.13.on verse 13.] scorneth judgement: [forasmuch as he deceiveth the Judge by his false testimony, or evidence. Oth. Coloureth the cause: that is, he giveth it a kind of lustre or splendour with his far words, and seeming reasons. See above chapter 14.on verse 9.] and the mouth of the wicked swalloweth down iniquity, [as drunkards swallow down their liquor. Compare Job 15.16. Oth.devoureth iniquity; that is, covereth it, or hiddeth it under a fair shew of words. For that which is devoured, and swallowed down, is hid, and taken away from the sight of men.]
\p
\v 29 . Judgements [Both divine and Humane, temporal and eternal. So Psalm 119.120. Jer.48. verse 47. Luke 24.20. Rom.13.2.] are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.

Wine is a mocker, strong drink is outrageous: [Or, raging, or, a disturber, or causer of trouble and raging: that is, that provoketh a man to cry, roar, make a noise, to child, brawl, scold, sight, squabble, &c. See bel.chapter 23.20. also Hos.4.11.18. and of the Hebrew word, ab.chapter 7.11. The meaning is, that wine, and other strong drink, being abused by excess and intemperance, maketh those men, that do abuse them, to become mockers, and outrageous or raging persons. The word rendered here strong drink, is in Hebrew schechar. See of this word, Levit.ch.10.on verse 9.] whosoever erreth therein, [that is, exceedeth measure in drinking thereof. See the same phrase taken in bad sense, Isa.28.7. and in a good sense, ab.ch.5.19. on the word erreth] shall not be wise. [that is, shall not learn true wisdom, as being unfit for it. Or, is not wise; that is, is not prudent, not well advised, not godly, nor virtuous.]
\p
\v 2 . The terror of a King [To wit, the terror, which a King in his wrath causeth or produceth in a man. Understand so likewise the terror of men, Gen.9.1. The terror of God, Gen.35.5. the terror of the Israelites, Deut.2.25.] is as the roaring of a young lion: [see above chapter 19.on verse 12. Compare also above chapter 16.14.] he that is angerly affected towards him, [namely, the King, that is, he that useth harsh and angry language against the King] sinneth against his (own) soul. [that is, against his own life, which he bringeth into great danger. Compare Numb.16.38. and 1 Kings 2.23. and ab.ch.8.36. together with the annot.]
\p
\v 3 . It is an honour for a man to tarry away [Hebr. To sit. Sitting for straying, or tarrying, see 2 Chron.32.on verse 10.] from strife: [comp.ab.ch.17.14.] but every fool will mingle himself in it.
\p
\v 4 . The sluggard will not plow by reason of winter: [To wit, which is nigh at hand, in seed-time; that is, by reason of the cold that then beginneth to come, or because of the badness of the weather. Oth. The sluggard will not plow in harvest. But the Hebrew word choreph is opposed unto Summer, Gen.8.22. Psalm 74. 17. Amos 3.15. Zach.14.8. And winter is so called, because it is as it were the reproach of the earth; taking away all the beauty, greenness, and loveliness of it] therefore shall he beg [the Hebr. Word is so taken, Psalm 109.10.] in harvest: but there shall be nothing. [to wit, for him to reap, as there is for others, that have plowed, and sowen.]
\p
\v 5 . Counsel [That is, wisdom, whereby men are able to give themselves and others good advice in all things that fall out] in the heart of a man, [to wit, that is wise, understanding, and prudent] is (as) deep waters: [see above chapter 18.on verse 4.] but a man of understanding [that is, a man that is wise and understanding: so above chapter 10.23. and 11.12. will fetch it [to wit, counsel] out. [that is, draw it out, and pluck it out: to wit, by moving questions to wise men, and hearing what they can say to them, and so learning of them. Compare above chap.1.5. Or, the meaning is, that the bent and purpose of a deep witted and retired man may yet in a manner be searched, sifted out, and discovered by a wise and understanding man.]
\p
\v 6 . Every one of the multitude of men proclaimeth his own goodness; [That is, boasteth of his own good deeds, and kindnesses shewed unto others; though oftentimes not in reality, and in truth; but merely out of ambition, and a greedy and eager desire of honour and vain-glory] but who can find a right faithful man? [Hebrew a man faithfulnesses. The question intimateth here, that there be but few such men to be found. See the like manner asking, bel.ch.31.10.]
\p
\v 7 . The righteous walketh continually in his uprightness: [See Gen.20.on verse 5.] his children are blessed after him.
\p
\v 8 . A King to wit, that is was, godly, and righteous] sitting on the throne of judgement, [to pronounce judgement, or give sentence amongst his people] scattereth away all evil with his eyes. [to wit, by summoning malefactors, or wicked doers before him, by taking knowledge of their offences, by convincing them of their wicked crimes, by sentencing and condemning of them, and by causing them to be punished according to their deservings, yea he knowneth how to frighten them, and to chase them away with a very look, or cast of his eye. The meaning is, that a wise, godly, and righteous King, that sitteth among his subjects in the place of Judicature, to execute justice, and judgement, causeth all wickedness, and wicked doers to remove from him, and from his people, yea to be destroyed and rooted out of his land, and that by his very looks, or casting his eyes upon them; even as the sun by its beams and shining dispelleth and driveth away the thick mists and vapours, that arise out of the earth. Compare Psalm 101.4. below verse 26.]
\p
\v 9 . Who can say [To wit, indeed and in truth. It is a question, that implyeth a strong denial. See Gen.18.on verse 17.] I have made mine heart clean? I am pure from my sin? [Compare 1 Kings 8.46. Job14.4. Psa.51.7. Eccles.7.21. 1 John 1.8.]
\p
\v 10 . A twofold weighing stone, [That is, a twofold weight. See Lev.19.on verse 36.] (and) a twofold Epha, [that is, a twofold measure. What kind of measure the Epha properly was, see Exod.16.on verse 36. Hebr. Stone and stone, Epha and Epha; that is, a twofold stone, and a twofold Epha; to wit, a great one, to buy by, and small one, to sell by. So Deut.25.13. see the annot. There, also below verse 23.] is an abomination unto the LORD, [Hebr. Is the Lords abomination. See above chapter 3.on verse 32.] yea they both.

\p
\v 11 . A boy will also make himself known by his dealings, [That is, by his childish manners, that discover themselves in his first years] whether his work [meaning his life, which he shall lead hereafter, in time to come] (shall be) pure, and whether it shall be right.
\p
\v 12 . An hearing ear, and a seeing eye, the LORD hath made, yea both of them. [The meaning is, that of or from God, do proceed not only the instruments, and work tools of the outward senses, but also the power and faculty to use them, and the gift to use them well. Compare Exod.4,11. Psalm 34.9. Some understand this in particular of the obedience and loyalty which subjects owe unto their Prince, or Soveraign, and of the wise and prudent government, whereby Princes and Magistrates ought to have faithful eyes upon, and a tender care of the welfare and prosperity of their subjects.]
\p
\v 13 . Love not sleep, [To wit, that which is immoderate, and which proceedeth from idleness, or laziness, above chapter 19.15.] left thou become poor: open thine eyes, [to wit, after that nature hath had her due sleep. Then apply thy self to honest labour in thy lawful calling, for to get thy living by] satisfy thy self with bread. [it is a commandment, containing in it a promise that we shall be satisfied if we take pains in a lawful and honest calling. See of such kind of phrase, above chapter 3.on verse 25. By bread is meant here all bodily necessaries. See Gen.3.19. and 18.5. together with the annot.]
\p
\v 14 . It is naught, it is naught, will the buyer say: [To wit, the ware, or the commodity, which the buyer cheapeneth, and intendeth to buy: thus out of a desire of seeking his own profit and advantage, he disparageth the commodity as if it were worth nothing, which notwithstanding he eagerly and greedily covers to have] but when h is gone away, then he will boast. [that is, when he hath made the bargain for his own advantage, he goeth his way, and commendeth himself, that by his craft and subtility, he hath bought the commodity at an under rate.]
\p
\v 15 . There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: [Of Rubies, see Job 28.on verse 18.] but the lips of knowledge [that is, the lip which utter, or bring forth knowledge, meaning wise, and virtuous speechs. So above chapter 14.7. Compare also above chapter 12.19. and see the annot.] are a precious jewel. [Hebr. Vessel, or, instrument, furniture. See Job 28.on verse 17. Comp. Above ch.3.14,15.]

Comp.ab.ch.11.15. and bel.ch.27.13.] a stranger, [that is, that is unknown unto thee, and of whose estate thou hast no certain knowledge or assurance, so as to be out fear, that he will pay what he oweth] take [to wit, thou, for whose security the surety standeth bound] his garment; [to wit, the garment of him, that is become surety for one that he knoweth not, and that for a pledge and security, that he will pay the debt for the stranger, in case he come to fail or fall] into want] and pawn it for the unknown. [to wit, persons, or men. Oth. For a stranger, or, outlandish woman. So bel.ch.27.13. Understand by a strange, or, outlandish woman, an harlot, or, she that is unknown to thee. See ab.ch.2.on verse 16.]
\p
\v 17 . Bread of lying [That is, wealth gotten by false and indirect means. See ab.ch.4.on verse 17. Also compare ab.ch.17. and the annot.] is sweet to a man; [comp. Ab.ch.9.17.] but afterwards his mouth shall by full of gravel stones. [or, little sharp stones, or flint stones. See the Hebrew word also, Lam.3.16. The meaning is, that such wealth or riches will prove hurtful to him in the end, and procure much sorrow and grief unto him.]
\p
\v 18 . Every thought is established by counsel, therefore make war with wise deliberations.
\p
\v 19 . He that walketh (as) a backbiter, [See Lev.19.on verse 16.] revealeth the thing that is privy: [that is, the secret another, that he is enstrusted with. So ab.ch.11.13.] mingle not thy self then with him, that enticeth [or, sootheth, flattereth, seduceth] with his lips. [that is, that cometh upon a man with fair enticing flattering words, to catch somewhat out of his mouth, which he afterward goes and carries to others. See of the Hebrew word rendered here enticing, Judg.14.15. upon the word persuading.]
\p
\v 20 . Whoso curseth his father, or his mother, his lamp shall be put out [That is, his welfare prosperity, and happiness shall perish. See Job 18.on verse 6. Comp. Exo.21.17. Lev.20.9. Deut.27.16. Mat.15.4.] in black darkness. [Hebr. In the blackness of darkness; that is, when darkness is so great, that is very black and thick. Comp.ab.ch. 7.9. and the annot. Understand thereby a very sad and miserable estate, wherein the curser shall be left by God. See Genesis 1.5. on verse 12.]
\p
\v 21 . When an inheritance [Meaning all manner of wealth and richs, that might befall a man, and which he might leave behind for his heirs, when he dies] is over-hasted at the first, [that is, is gotten, and heaped up in a short time, with much stirring and moving to and again by all manner of ways and means. Compare bel.ch.21.5.] then its last (or the end thereof) shall not be blessed.
\p
\v 22 . Say not, [To wit, with thy self, or also with thy neighbour] I will recompense evil: [comp. Deut.32.35. ab.ch.17.13. bel.ch.24.29. Rom.12.17. 1 Thess.5.15. 1 Pet.3.9.] wait on the on the LORD, and h shall deliver thee.
\p
\v 23 . A twofold weigh-stone [Heb. Stone and stone. See above on verse 10.] is an abomination unto the LORD; and the deceitful scales [Hebr. The balance of deceit. That is, wherein a man deceiveth and wrongeth his neighbour, by not allowing him his full weight, and by taking for ones self more then is ones due] are not good. [that is, they are very bad; see above chapter 17.on verse 26.]
\p
\v 24 . Mans goings [That is, his thoughts, purposes, words, and works, commissions, and omissions] are of the LORD; [to wit, not onely in regard of the work of Creation, but also in regard of the works of Preservation, and Government.

\p
\v 26 . A wise King scattereth away the wicked: [See the annot. Above verse 8.] and he bringeth the wheel over them. [that is, he causeth a grievous punishment to be inflicted upon them. In former time great malefactors, or evil doers, were thus punished, to wit, that a cart with sharp iron wheels was drawn over them. See 2 Sam.12.on verse 31. Understand under this punishment here mentioned, all sorts of hard and severe punishments.]
\p
\v 27 . The soul of man [Meaning the rational or reasonable soul, which is endowed with the natural light of understanding, and distinction between good and evil, or also with the supernatural light of regeneration, whereby a man is in a capacity to apprehend and understand, what he ought to believe, and how he ought to live] is the lamp of the LORD: [that is, it is a clear and bright shining light or candle of knowledge, given and lighted by God himself, whereby a man knoweth himself both without, and within, and under Gods dispose and government is guided and directed in all his ways, actions and omissions. Compare Matth.6.22,23. Luke 11.34,35. 1 Cor.2.11.] searching all the inner chambers of the belly.

\p
\v 2 . All (Or every) way of a man, is right his (own) eyes: [See the exposition of this verse above chap.16.on verse 2.] but the LORD weighteth the hearts. [or, spirits, as above chap.16.2. In this regard the word hearts signifieth here, as much as the word spirits doth there; to wit, the thoughts, affections, inclinations, motions, and purposes. So Psalm 7.10. and 26.2.]
\p
\v 3 . To do justice, and judgement, [See the exposition of this phrase, Gen.18. on verse 19. And 1 Kings 10. On verse 9.] is a more choice (thing) with the LORD, then offering. [Compare 1 Sam.15.22. Psalm 50.8,14. Isa.1,11,16. Hos.6.6.]

To wit, whatsoever they secretly plot and invent, and do publicly put in practice; so is the word forging taken, see above chapter 3.on verse 29. Where the Hebrew word may likewise be translated plowing] are sin. [or thus: highness of eyes, and broadness of heart, are the plowing, or, the practice of the wicked, (and) sin. Oth.

\p
\v 7 . The wasting of the wicked [To wit, whereby they waste and devour their neighbour, or as some, whereby they themselves shall be wasted] shall cut them whereby they themselves shall be wasted] shall cut them asunder; [or, shall saw them asunder, cast them down; as when a tree is sawn down; that is, shall be an occasion, that by Gods just judgement they be utterly destroyed. It seemeth that here respect is had to that kind of punishment, whereby malefactors were by the Magistrate cut asunder with the saw, or sawen in pieces, See 2 Sam.12. on verse 31. Oth. Shall tarry, or, abide with them; to wit, until they also shall be wasted, or, destroyed. Oth. The robbery of the wicked shall affrighted them] because they refuse to do judgement. [that is, to give every one his due.]
\p

Compare Deut.22.on verse 8.] then with a brawling wife, and that (in) an house of company. [that is, in a wide, or large house, wherein a man may easily dwell with a great company, without being straitened for want of room, as in a corner. An house of company may also be understood of an house, wherein man and wife live together, being comprehended under one family or house-keeping. Compare below verse 19.]
\p
\v 10 . The soul of the wicked desireth evil: and [Meaning the evil of guilt; that is, sin] his neighbour [or, companion, or, friend] getteth no favour in his eyes.

Oth. When he; to wit, the simple, understandingly heedeth the wise] he receiveth knowledge.

\v 12 . The righteous heedeth understandingly the house of the wicked; [to wit, so as to profit by the observation of Gods judgements that come upon it] when (God) poureth thew wicked into evil. [to wit, into the evil of punishment. Oth. Overthroweth the wicked for evil, to wit, for the evil of sin; that is, consumed and destroyeth them for the sins, which they daily commit. Otherwise this verse might be thus rendered, or translated: he, to wit, God, instructeth the righteous by the hand of the wicked, who poureth the wicked into evil. Or thus: which (to wit, house) poureth the wicked into evil.]
\p
\v 13 . He that stoppeth his ear at the cry of the poor; [To wit, whereby he cryeth for help and relief in his poverty] he shall also cry, [to wit, unto God, or unto men, when he is in any strait, or distress] and not be heard.

\p
\v 15 . It is joy to the righteous, to do right: [To wit, either in his private life, or in a peculiar office, wherein he is placed, to administer right and justice unto others] but it is terror [or, amazement, or, trouble; to wit, either when he must do justice himself, or when it is done by others] for the workers of iniquity.

\v 17 . He that loveth gladness, [To wit, unlawful, wicked, and immoderate joy, or gladness] he shall suffer want: [Hebr. Shall be a man of want: or, of need] he that a voluptuous, and intemperate life. Heretofore at merry feast they used many oils and ointments, wherewith they anointed their members, and especially the head, for the preservation of health, and reviving of the spirit. See Ruth 3.on verse 3. Psalm 23.5. below ch.27.9. Cant.1.3. Amos 6.6. Mat.26.7. Besides this, oil had yet other uses in the land of Juda. See Judg.9.on verse 9. And below verse 20. But here is spoken of the abuse of oil, and wine, all other things (that are given for the comfort and chearing of man) being comprehended under these two.]
\p
\v 18 . The wicked is a ransom [By ransom if meant the price, or sum of money, that is paid to redeem a man out of misery, or suffering] for the righteous; and the faithless, for the upright. [the meaning is, that in many common calamities godly persons get out of dangers, that are wont to threaten them most, and wicked men by the wise and just Providence of God come in their stead, as if so be they were their ransom, or redemption-money.

\p
\v 20 . In the dwelling of the wise is a desired treasure; [Serving to the preservation, and cheering of man; under which was also oil comprehended, mentioned in the following words, See above the annotations on verse 17.] and oil: but a foolish man devoureth such things.
\p
\v 21 .

\p
\v 23 . He that keepeth his mouth, and his tongue. [That is, he that taketh heed that he provoked not God, nor incense his neighbour against himself, by evil, vain, and contentious words] keepeth his soul from distresses. [compare above ch.18.21.]
\p
\v 24 . He that is a proud boaster, his name is scorner, [That is, as he indeed and in truth a scorner, so may he likewise be justly so called; because he casteth aside all good admonitions, and falleth proudly upon his neighbour with contempts and disdainings of him. See an example in Haman, Esth.3.5,6.] he dealeth in proud wrath. [that is, he doth all things with a losty and soaring spirit, following not the guide or dictates of reason, but his own loose passions and disordered affections. Or, he that is proud, (and) haughty, or, presumptuous, whose name is scorner, dealeth in proud wrath.
\p
\v 25 . The desire of the slothful [To wit, whereby he desireth to have his want or need supplied, without endeavouring to attain unto it by honest labour] shall kill him; [that is, it shall not onely bring him to great poverty, but also to his utter ruine] for his hands refuse to work.
\p
\v 26 . He covereth all the day long desirable things: [Hebr. The desire. Oth. He coveteth the covetous; that is, the man that is very covetous, or desirous; to wit, to get wealth. See Job 34.on verse 13.] but the righteous shall give, [to wit, unto the poor and needy, and that according to his ability, of that which God hath given him] and not refrain. [compare Psalm 37.26.]
\p
\v 27 . The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination: [Compare above ch.15.8. Isa.1.13. Jer.6.20. Amos 5.21.] how much more when they bring it with a wicked intent? [to wit, expressly intending to effect or accomplish some wicked act thereby, and as it were calling upon God to be an help to advance and set forward their villainy. See an example hereof in Bileam, Numb.23.1.]
\p
\v 28 . A lying witness [Hebr. A witness of lies] shall perish: [Compare above chapter 19.5,9.] and a man that hearkeneth, [to wit, unto the law of God, and especially to the commandment of bearing no false witness; or, he that giveth diligent attention, and witnesseth nothing else, but what he hath heard, or seen] shall speak thing else, but what he hath heard, or seen] shall speak unto victory.

\p
\v 29 . A wicked man strengtheneth himself in his face; [Or, staffeneth himself: that is, hardeneth his face. The meaning is, that he with great obstinacy, and impudency followeth his own mind, without giving heed to that which is just and right, and is enjoined him] but the upright, he maketh his way sure. [to wit, because he ordereth and directeth all actions and affairs according to the Word of God.]
\p
\v 30 . There is no wisdom; neither is there any understanding: neither is there any counsel against the LORD. [That is, that is to be compared with the wisdom, or understanding, or counsel of God; or which is able to withstand or resist it.]
\p
\v 31 . The horse is prepared against the day of battle; [Understand under this word horse, all outward means, that are wont to be used and employed in war, or in battle] but the victory [see 2 Sam.8.on verse 6.] is the LORDS. [That is, cometh from the Lord. Compare Psalm 33.16,17.]

\v 1 . The name [Meaning a good name, and honest report among men. Name for good name. The word good must here be supplied, to make up the sense, from the following branch of this verse. Compare above chapter 18.on verse 22.] is a more choice (thing) then great riches: the good favour, [that is, the good opinion that the godly have of a man, and the good affection which they bear unto him. Compare ab.ch.3.4. the annot. Upon the word favour] then silver, and then gold. [compare Eccles.7.1.]
\p
\v 2 . The rich, and poor, meet together: [That is, they live among one another, and have need of one another. Compare bel.ch.29.13.] the LORD hath made them all. [to wit, the Lord, who forbiddeth the rich to despise the poor are bound to serve the rich , for reward.]
\p
\v 3 . A prudent man [That is, that is provident, and of wise understanding. See ab.ch.1.4.] seeth the evil, and hideth himself: [he foreseeth the evil, to wit, which hangeth over men, and which will certainly fall upon them, and provideth for himself against it, that he may escape it] but the simple pass on, and are punished. [to wit, because they do not foresee the evil that hangeth over them, or because they despise it.]
\p
\v 4 . The reward of humility, (with) the fear of the LORD, [That is, which is joined with the fear of the Lord. In the same sense the words may be also rendered, (and) of the fear of the LORD] is riches, and honour, and life. [that is, as the fear of God is united and conjoined with true humility, so hath also the fear of God the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come, 1 Tim.4.8.]
\p
\v 5 . Thorns, (and) snares are in the way of the forward (one): [That is, calamities, and plagues, wherein the wicked by his evil and wicked doings is so entangled and ensnared, that he cannot deliver himself out them.

\p
\v 6 . Teach a boy the first principles [The Hebrew signifieth properly to instruct a man from his youth, or childhood in some science, and especially in the grounds and principles of Christian Religion, to the comfort and salvation of his soul. Compare Gen.14.on verse 14. It is here as much as Catechizing, which is often so used in the New Testament. See Luke 1.4. Acts 18.25. the nature of his way; [Hebr. According to the mouth (that is, according to the request, or condition) of his way; that is, of his age, apprehension, and tenderness. Oth.in the beginning, or, entrance of his way, that is, in the beginning of his life] also when he shall be grown old, he will not depart from it.

[that is, he must be at his service, and ready to wait upon him. He speaketh not properly of that which ought to be done, but of that which for the most part cometh to pass in the world.]
\p
\v 8 . He that soweth iniquity, shall reap trouble: [See Job 4.on verse 8. Also Hos.10.13.] and the rod of his indignation shall have an end. [that is, the plague, or punishment, whereby he vexed, annoyed, and oppressed others in his fierce wrath, shall cease. It seemeth to be a similitude, borrowed from a staff, wherewith we are wont to thresh seed, or grain.]
\p
\v 9 . He that is of a good eye, [That is, he that is friendly, liberal, compassionate, and bountiful. So Mat.20.15. For commonly the nature and the nature and disposition of a man is seen and discovered in the eyes. The good eye is also called a single eye, Mat.6.22. See of an evil, or, wicked eye, Deut.15.on verse 9. And below chap.23.6.] he shall blessed: [Compare 2 Cor.9. verse 6.] for he hath given of his bread to the poor. [Hebr. To the thin (ones).]
\p
\v 10 . Drive out the scorner, and brawling [to wit, which he is wont to raise] shall go away; and contention with reproach [to wit, the reproach which he offereth to others by his strifes and contentions] shall cease.

Mat.5.8.] whose lips are gracious, [that is, that is so eloquent, that he can utter and express his upright thoughts with a kind of grace. Heb. Whose lips are grave; that is, pleasantness, or acceptableness. See of this, Psalm 45.3. Eccles.10.12.] the King is his friend. [The Translation may be also thus rendered: with, or, because of the grace of his lips the Kings is his friend.]
\p
\v 12 . The eyes of the LORD [That is, the Providence and care of God. See 2 Chron.16.on verse 9.] preserve knowledge: [that is, him that is endowed with true knowledge, and godly wisdom, and ordereth his words and actions according to it. Compare the phrase with Job 35.on verse 13.] but he will overthrow the affairs [Oth. Words] of the faithless (one.) [that is, of the wicked man, who not keeping faithfully the covenant of God, transgresseth wilfully both in words and deeds.]
\p
\v 13 . The slothful man saith there is a lion without: I may be slain in the midst of the streets. [To wit, he speaketh so, that he may escape labour, or pains. When he is bid to work, or take pains to get his living, he then findeth easily a pretence of this or that danger, which he feigneth to be present or ready at hand to hinder him, when he should go about any business.

\p
\v 17 . Incline thine ear, and hear [This exhortation is here inserted, to stir up the Reader to the due and right consideration of these proverbs, yea of all the commandments of God] the words of the wise: [Salomon calleth these proverbs not onely his proverbs, but also the proverbs of all other truly wise, that consented thereunto, and joined in the making and publishing of them, of which some are named below chap.30. and 31.] and apply thine heart unto my knowledge. [that is, my doctrine, and commandments, which thou oughtest to know. See above ch.15.on verse 7. Oth. To know me. Me; to wit, wisdom.]
\p
\v 18 . For it is pleasant when thou keepest them [To wit, the words of the wise] in thy inner most (parts): [Hebr. In thy belly: that is, in the innermost parts of thy heart. See above chapter 18.on verse 8. And 20. On verse 30. Job 15.on verse 2.] they shall be together sitted to thy lips. [to wit, that thou mayest utter them conveniently, and profitably unto men.]
\p
\v 19 . That thy trust may be in the LORD, [Compare above chapter 3.5,6. Hereby is shewed the end of these proverbs, which is, to believe in God, and to expect all good things from him, on condition that we also obey him] I do make (them) known to thee this day, thou also [to wit, who sleekest after wisdom, hearing, or reading these proverbs] (make them known). [oth. (do) thou them also. Compare the phrase with the 15.verse of the next chapter.]
\p
\v 20 . Have not I written to thee glorious things [That is, which become Lords, and Governors, or Rulers, and deserve to be pondered, spoken, and practised by them. Compare above ch.8. on verse 6. Oth. Have I not written three times, that is, often?] of all manner of counsel, and knowledge? [that is, of all manner of good instruction and admonition, to order thy self aright according to the Word of God, both in a public and private course of life.]
\p
\v 21 . To make known unto thee the certainty of the sayings of truth; that thou mightiest answer the sayings of truth to them [That is, that thou mightiest not onely know the truth thy self, but also that thou mightiest make it known unto others, according to the state and condition of thy calling] that send thee. [to wit, to do office or duty for all in general. Oth. That send (unto) thee: to wit, to have some good counsel and instruction from thee.]
\p
\v 22 . Rob not the poor because he is poor: [The rich, and mighty are not excluded: but the poor are specially mentioned, ch.3.on verse 27. Compare Zach.7.10.] neither grind the afflicted in pieces in the gate: [that is, in Judgement, or in the place of Judicature. See Genesis 22.on verse 17. Compare Exodus 23.6. Job 31.13. Psalm 82.3,4.]
\p
\v 23 . For the LORD will plead their cause [That is, defend and maintain their causes, or their suits. See the same phrase, 1 Sam.25.39. below chapter 23.11. Jer.51.36.] and he will spoil the soul [that is, of those that take away the goods and means, or estate, from them that are afflicted and miserable. Compare Exodus 22.22,23. Psalm 10.18.]
\p
\v 24 . Keep not company with an angry man: [Hebr. Lord, or possessor of anger: that is, one that is nature, and by use and custom very prone and bent to anger. So below chapter 29.22. a Lord of wrath. Compare Gen.14.on verse 13.] neither converse with a furious man. [Hebr. Man of furies, or, of burning angers: that is, that is soon kindled with great anger. Compare Job 11.on verse 13. And Psalm 5.on verse 7.]
\p
\v 25 . Lest thou learn his paths, [Or, ways. See Genesis 6.on verse 12.] and get a snare upon thy soul. [That is, bring mischief and destruction upon thy self, which thou shalt not be able to escape. Compare above chapter 18.on verse 7.]
\p
\v 26 . Be not thou among them that strike hands, [To wit, with creditors, for a token, that they are become sureties, and stand bound for the debtor. See Job 17.on verse 3. And above ch.6.on verse 1.] among them, that are surety for debts. [compare above chap.6.1. and 11.15.]
\p
\v 27 . If thou hast nothing to pay, [To wit, unto the creditor, for whose security thou art become surety for the debtor] why should they take away thy bed from under thee? [to wit, if there were nothing else in thine house to satisfy the creditor with, but that. Understand this of him, that undertook to be surety for another mans debt: for thereby he declared that he was rich, and able to pay; so that he might not help himself with that law, that is mentioned, Exod.22.26,27. And repeated, Deut.24.6. Therefore although the law of charity commanded, that the poor mans necessary goods should not be pawned, or taken to pledge; yet the civil law (or the law of nations) permitted it in some cases, yea even to make the debtor himself a slave or vassal for some certain time, 2 Kings 4.1. see also above chapter 20.16.]

\p
\v 29 . Hast thou seen a man that is at his work? He shall be set before the face of Kings: [To be set, or, to stand before a mans face, is to minister unto him, or to be advanced and called to that office. See Deut.1.on verse 38. And 1 Kings 1.on verse 2.] he shall not be set before the face of man not regarded. [Hebr. Dark, abscure; to wit, people, or men; that is, common, unknown, mean, and of no repute, or respect.]

\v 2 . And put a knife to thy throat, [That is, restrain thine inordinate desire, or appetite eat and drink immoderately, as if thy throat were frighten from it by a knife. Or, otherwise thou shouldest out a knife to thy throat; that is, thou shouldest incure the uttermost hazard of bodily sickness, or of some other dangerous grief, if the liquorish meats and dainty dishes should allure thee to intemperance. Oth. Translate the Hebrew word, rendered here knife, thorns: but the sense is all one, or one and the same] if thou be a gluttonous man. [Hebr. A Lord of the soul; that is, of lust, and appetite, or desire. Meaning one that is very greedy and covetous after meat and drink. Compare Job 39. Verse 1. And the annot. Upon the word greediness. Oth. If thou be master, or, lover of thy self.]
\p
\v 3 . Covet not his savoury meats: [Or, dainties, which are very pleasant, and toothsome to the mouth. So below verse 6. Compare Gen.27,4,7,9, &c.] for it is a lying, or deceitful meat. The meaning is, that Court-delights are as a bait, whereby men are enticed and allured, and commonly deceived in their expectations. Compare above chapter 20.17.]

\v 5 . Wilt thou suffer thine eyes to fly upon that which is not? [To wit, upon riches, whereof mention is made in the former verse. That which is not: that is, is very uncertain, and unconstant, and in many necessaries very impotent and weak. Compare Psalm 37.35,36. And 49.13,18. 1 Tim.6.17. Oth. That which (soon) will not be] for it [to wit, temporal wealth, or riches, it will soon get away, and leave thee, as followeth] will certainly make [Hebr. Making, make] it self wings: as an eagle, that flieth toward Heaven. [to wit, that flieth so swiftly on high towards Heaven, as that he is soon vanished away out of a mans sight: even so do riches perish and decay in a short time, so that a man cannot tell whither they are gone, or what is become of them.]
\p
\v 6 . Eat not the bread of him that is of an evil eye, [That is, of him that is covetous, grudging, and envious. See Deut.15.on verse 9. Also below ch.28.22. Mark 7.22.

As he conceiveth in his soul, so is he; that is, thinketh or imagineth evil with himself, to wit, that thou consumes and devourest that which is his] eat and drink; but his heart is not with thee: [to wit, bearing thee no good will at all, but yet so, as that his covetous mind may be in a manner gathered from his gestures and words. Although he seeketh thereby to manifest the contrary.]
\p
\v 8 . Thy morsel which thou hast eaten, shalt thou vomit up; [That is, it will vex and grieve thee that thou hast eaten of his meat, and hast had some friendly discourse at table with him] and thou shalt spoil thy pleasant words. [that is, lose them, and reap no profit or benefit by them.]
\p
\v 9 . Speak not before the ear of a fool: for he will despise the understanding of thy words. [That is, that which thou hast spoken understandingly, learnedly, or prudently. Comp.ch.9.8. Mat.7.6.]
\p
\v 10 . Set not the ancient border back: [See above ch.22.on verse 28. Hebr. Border of eternity] and enter not into the fields of the fatherless: [to wit, to wrong them: by deceit, or violence.]
\p
\v 11 . For their Redeemer [To wit, God] is strong: he shall plead their cause against thee. [See above ch.22.on verse 23.]
\p

\v 24 . The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: [Hebr. Rejoicing rejoice: that is, greatly rejoice; to wit, because he hath a righteous, and gracious son, that is, that is honest, godly, and prudent] and he that begetteth a wise (son) shall be glad because of him.

\p
\v 2 . For their heart deviseth desolation, [That is, harm, and destruction, which they intend to do unto their neighbour, yea will also thereby bring the same upon themselves] and their lips speak trouble. [Compare Psal.107.]
\p
\v 3 . Through wisdom is an house builded; and by, understanding (it is) established.

\p
\v 6 . For by wise counsels [See of the Hebrew word, Job 37.12.] shalt thou wage war for thy self: [That is, for thy good, or for thy benefit, and the welfare of the Land] and in the multitude of counsellors [to wit, of good counsellors. See above chap.18.on verse 22. Or, in the greatness; that is, worthiness, sitness, and wisdom of them] is the victory. [Or, safety.

\p
\v 11 . deliver them that are taken unto death: [Namely, wrongfully. This doth properly concern Judges, and Magistrates, who by virtue of their office are bound to defend the innocent, yea even when they are condemned to die, and have the sentence of death past upon them, if so be that at last their innocency may appear. Compare Psal.82.4. Moreover, it concerneth also all godly people in general, who according to the nature and condition of their calling, and by lawful means, are bound to protect and help those that be innocent] for the reel unto the slaughter, [or, are carried away, or, bend down to the slaughter; that is, they are in danger to be put to death,] if thou refrain thy self. [Oth. For shouldest thou refrain thy self from those that are haled away to be put to death? This question implyeth a strong denial, that this thing should be neglected by those, who by reason of their office are bound to use all good means for the performing of it]
\p
\v 12 . When thou sayest, Behold we know it not; [Namely, that he is innocent, or how we may be able to help him. Oth. We know him not or, we know not this man] shall not he that pondereth the heart, [that is, God. See above chap.16.2. and the annotate.] consider (it)? And he that looketh to thy soul, [to wit, not onely in respect of temporal, but also of eternal death] shall not know it? [namely, whether thy excuse be true, and well-grounded] for he [to wit, God, who pondereth the hearts, &c.] will reward a man according to his work. [Compare Job 34.11. Psal.62.13. Jer.32.19. Rom.2.6. Rev.22.12.]
\p
\v 13 . Eat honey, my son, for it is good: and the honeycomb is sweet for the palate. [That is, in thy mouth. Unto the palate taste is attributed and ascribed, Job 12.1. and 34.3. honey was a common, and a very dainty and pleasant food in Palestina. Compare Exod.3.on verse 8. Now the prophet relateth, that it might indeed be eaten for the good, and nourishment of the body, but that men should chiefly and principally seek and endeavour after wisdom, which is a most pleasant and acceptable food for the soul]
\p
\v 14 . Such is the knowledge of wisdom for thy soul: [Oth. So know wisdom (to be) for thy soul. Compare Psal.19.11. and 119.103.] when thou findest it, [that it, gettest, or obtainest it.

\p
\v 17 . Be not glad when thine enemy falleth: [To wit, into mischief, or trouble. Compare Job 13.29. above chapter 17.5.] and let not thine heart rejoice, when he staumbleth down;

But the Hebrew word is also taken for reward. See above chapter 23.on verse 18. Oth.posterity; the wicked man shall have no posterity, and if he get any, they shall perish, whereunto the following verse is applied by some] the lamp of the wicked shall be put out. [see ab.ch.20.on v.20. Job 18.on v.6. and Prov.13.9.]
\p
\v 21 . My son, fear the LORD, and the King: and mingle not thy self with them that stand for a changed. [Hebr. With them that change.

[As if he had said; A judgement shall light upon them, whereof they had not the least thought: or whereof a man is not able know or conjecture, how heavy it shall be. Of them both; to wit, as well of those that fear not God, as of those that doe not stand in awe of the civil Magistrate. Or, the mischief of those two: to wit, which shall be sent upon them both by God, and the King.]
\p
\v 23 . These (proverbs) are also (the proverbs) of the wise. [Or, (belong) to the wise, or (are) for the wise, or, concern the wise] To know the face in judgement [see Deut.1.17. and the annot.

\p
\v 25 . But for them that rebuke (him), [To wit, the wicked man] shall be delight; [that is, it shall go well with them, matter of joy and comfort shall be given unto them] and the blessing of good shall come upon them. [that is, all good shall happen unto them, both from God and men. Upon them; to wit, upon those that rebuke the wicked.]
\p
\v 26 . They shall kiss the lips of him that answereth right words. [The meaning is, that he uttereth good matter, and speaketh profitable words in due season, shall be honoured, and love of those that hear him, even as if they received and entertained him with a friendly kiss. In old time kissing was a token of reverence, and a manifestation of good will. See Gen.27.on verse 26. And 41. On verse 40. Oth. He kisseth the lips, that answereth right words. That is, he sheweth the most, or the greatest friendship.]
\p
\v 27 . Order thy work without, and prepare it for thy self in the field, and afterwards build thine house [Understand this latter clause not so much of the building of an house, as of the trimming of it up, and setting of it out. The meaning of the whole verse is this: Remember first to furnish thine house with that which is most needful, to get thy living in an honest way, as by means of tillage, and the like; then after that thou mayest think of that which may tend to the recreation and delight of those that be of the family, and to the beautifying and adoring of the house.]
\p
\v 28 . Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; [That is, without considerable and apparent necessity, which bindeth a man to give in evidence: or without good certainty and assurance of the thing, that is to be witnessed] for shouldest thou seduce [that is, by giving in false, or uncertain evidence, or else by suborning witnesses] with thy lip? [that is, with thy words and speeches. See Job 2.on verse 10.]
\p
\v 29 . Say not, Like as he hath done to me, so will I do to him: I will recompense to every one according to his work. [Compare Rom.12.17,19.]
\p
\v 30 . I went by the field of a slothful man, and by the vineyard of a man void of understanding: [See above ch.6.on verse 32.]
\p
\v 31 . And lo, it [To wit, the field, or vineyard] was all grown over with thistles; the face thereof was covered (with) nettles, the stone-partition-wall thereof was broken down. [in Palestina, the fields, farms, and vineyards were for the most part separated and divided one from another by some slight kind of walls made of stones heaped and piled up together, without any lime or morter at all, that wild beasts might not spoil or hurt them.

This is thought to have been done, when King Hizkia settled both the Ecclesiastical and Civil state of his Kingdom in order. For Salomon had spoken three thousand proverbs, 1 Kings 4.32.]
\p
\v 2 . It is the glory of God, [That is, it tendeth to Gods glory] to conceal a matter; [to wit, concerning that which he secretly decreeth with himself, and executeth in due time, which is oftentimes incomprehensible to wisdom and understanding all reasonable creatures, and which we may not curiously dive and search into, but ought with all humility and reverence to admire and adore; whereby he is honoured and exalted. Compare Deut.29.29. Rom.11.33.] but the honour of a King is to search out a matter, [to wit, that concerneth their government, and whereof they ought to have knowledge, and understanding, that they may do justice and judgement unto their subjects, and wisely and prudently manage their government.]

\p
\v 4 . Take away the dross from the silver; and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.
\p
\v 5 . Take away the wicked from the face of the King: and his throne shall be established in righteousness. [As silver that is purified from scum and dross, becometh fit matter for the Gold-smith to make some precious vessel thereof; so a King by putting away from him the scum and dross of wicked and unrighteous persons, maketh his Court honourable, and established his Throne and Kingdom thereby. Compare above chapter 20. Verse 8. And 28.]
\p
\v 6 . Be not proud [Or, do not demean thy self stately, or, haughty; to wit, either in words, or behaviour, or apparel, or any other way] before the face of the King: and stand not in the place of great men.

\p
\v 9 . Debate thy cause with thy neighbour; [That is, if thou hast a controversy with thy neighbour, endeavour first to take up the business among your selves, and be not over hasty to sue one another presently at law] and reveal not anothers secret: [that is, be have thy self so modest and temperate in thy suit, that thou wrong not thy neighbour in his reputation; by discovering that which might very well be concealed. Or discover not that which another hath told thee in private, whether it be he that hath given thee counsel concerning thine own affairs, or whether it but such a thing, as he would by no means have another to know it.]
\p
\v 10 . Lest he that heareth it, reproach thee, [To wit, by calling thee a whisperer, or tale-bearer] for thy ill report will not be turned away. [that is, will not cease, but will abide continually with thee.]

\v 13 . A faithful ambassador is to them that send him, as the cold of snow in the day of harvest; [to wit, is to the reapers, when being very thirsty by reason of the heat of the day, and the hardness of their labour, they long for a draught of cool drink to quench their thirst. He hath respect to the manner or custom of those that dwell in hot countries, and in the heat of summer cool their drink with ice, or snow, which for that very purpose they keep in deep cellars under the ground] for he refresheth the soul of his masters. [to wit, when he bringeth good tidings back. See of the Hebrew word rendered refreshing, Psalm 19.on verse 8. Compare above chapter 13.17.]
\p
\v 14 . A man that boasteth himself of a false gift [That is, which he indeed promiseth in words, but giveth it not in deed, and in truth. Hebr. Gift of falsehood] is (as) clouds, and wind, and where no rain is withal. [See also of the same similitude, 2 Pet.2.17. and Jude verse 12. The Hebrew word geschem rendered here rain, signifieth for the most part a great shower of rain, which falleth down in great abundance, and with a mighty violence, as Gen.7.12. and 8.2. Ezra 10 9. But here it seemeth to signify all kind of rain, as 1 Kings 17.7.]
\p
\v 15 . By long forbearing a Ruler is persuaded; [That is, moved, as with reasons and arguments to do that, whereunto otherways he had no mind nor inclination] and a soft tongue breaketh the bone. [that is, the mind, which is as hard as bone, or (as we use to say) as hard as stone. Compare above chapter 15.1. and 16.14.]
\p
\v 16 . Hast thou found honey? Eat that which is sufficient for thee. [Understand under the word honey all manner of pleasant food, whereof as much as may suffice nature, so as to avoid all excessive and immoderate abuse of the creature. Some understand hereby the searching after high and heavenly things, which are indeed delightful pleasant to the spirit of man, but do exceed and surmount the measure of his apprehension. This verse may be likewise understood of the right use of true friendship, which is very pleasant and delightful, whereof mention is made in the next verse. Hebr. Thy sufficiency; that is, as much as sufficeth nature, as much as thy health will bear, or suffer thee to eat] lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it up. [to wit, thou shouldest eat more then is sufficient for thee, or more then will doe thee good.]
\p
\v 17 . Spare thy foot from thy neighbours house, [Or, withdraw thy foot, &c. Hebr. Keep thy foot precious; that is, sparing, from going too boldly into thy neighbours house, and discourteously abusing the familiarity and kindness which he sheweth towards thee. Compare 1 Sam.3. on verse 1.] left he be full thee, and hate thee.
\p
\v 18 . A man speaking [Hebr. Answering. See Judg.18.on verse 14.] false witness against his neighbour, is a hammer, and a sword, and a sharp arrow. [compare Psalm 11.2. and 57.5. and 59.8. and 120.4. above chapter 12.18.]
\p
\v 19 . Confidence in an unfaithful man in the day of distress, [Hebr. The confidence of an unfaithful man; that is, the confidence that is put in an unfaithful friend, or the confidence which an unfaithful person himself hath in any thing in time of need] is like a broken tooth, [to wit, to chew therewith, when a man is hungry] and a foot out of joint. [to wit, to run therewith, when a man must haste away. The Hebrew word signifieth properly a foot, that because it is out of joint, is ever ready to stumble and fall.]
\p
\v 20 . He that singeth songs to a sorrowful [Hebrew evil, or bad; that is, sorrowful, or heavy, or grieved. See Gen.40.on verse 7. So the word good is likewise taken for merry, or joyful. See 1 Kings 21.on verse 7.] heart, is as he that putteth off a garment in the day of cold, [which is a thing very unseasonable] (and as) vinegar upon salt-peter. [which dissolveth the salt-peter, or causeth it to melt. The meaning is, that it is not a seemly thing to sing mercy songs in the presence of those that are sad and heavy; for with those we ought to be sad and heavy, and to be joyful with those that are joyful, Rom.12.15.]
\p
\v 21 . If he that hateth thee, be hungry, giveth him bread to eat; and if he thirsty, give him water to drink: [Understand by bread, and water, all bodily necessaries; to wit, meat and drink, see 1 Kings 13.8. and the annot.]
\p
\v 22 . For thou shalt heap [Hebr. Take; that is, taking heap. The Hebrews do often comprehend under one word also the signification of another. See Gen.12.on verse 15.] fiery coals upon his head: [that is, thou shalt bring him to this, that he will soon lay aside all malice and enmity, that he hath against thee, as one that should have hot burning coals laid upon his head, eh would presently shake them off from him. Or thou shalt soften his heart, and make it pliable, that he shall be convinced of the wrong that he hath done thee: as Smiths are wont to mollify and sharpen iron with hot burning coals] and the LORD shall reward thee. [to wit, the good that thou hast done to thine enemy, although he be unthankful toward thee.]
\p
\v 23 . The north-wind driveth away [Hebr. Causeth, or, procureth sorrow, or, pain: which some understand of driving away, others of bearing or bringing forth] rain: and an angry countenance [to wit, of a wise, and godly man, who taketh no delight in such a tongue as is here mentioned] the secret tongue. [Hebr. A tongue of secrecy; that is, that speaketh not down-right, but useth deceit, flattering, back-biting, stinging, and provoking, &c.]
\p
\v 24 . It is better to dwell in a corner of the house-top, then with a brawling wife, [Hebr. A wife of brawlings] and that in an house of company. [See the exposition of this verse above chapter 21. On verse 9. Compare also verse 19. Of the same chapter.]
\p
\v 25 . Good news from a far land is as cold water to a wearied soul. [That is, man, or person. See Gen.12.on verse 5. The meaning is, that a man is well refreshed and cheared by hearing good news, as one that is weary and thirsty, is refreshed and cheared with fresh cool water.]
\p
\v 26 . The righteous man stumbling before the face of the wicked, [To wit, commiting some fault in the sight of a wicked man. Or, not daring to do his duty, in reproving a wicked person. Compare Job 4.on verse 4.] is a troubled fountain, and corrupt spring. [the mouths and teachings of godly men are resembled to fountains and springs, whence all good instructions flow, above ch.10.11. and 12.14. and 16.22. When therefore by reason of some cross or affliction, they come to fail in the performance of this duty of theirs, then is it as if the fountain were troubled, and muddy, and the spring or well stopped.]
\p
\v 27 . It is good to eat much honey: [But indeed bad, and hurtful. Compare above verse 16.] but the searching of the glory of such things, [to wit, that are like unto honey; that is, that are sweet, pleasant, and delightful, as the searching of the nature of Gods works, of things done in the world, &c.] is honour. [to wit, when men keep due measure and moderation therein, follow the right line and rule of truth, and obtain the right use and end. This verse is otherwise thus rendered: It is not good (for a man) to eat much honey, and (no) glory the searching of their own glory.]
\p
\v 28 . A man that cannot restrain his (own) spirit, [That is, he that cannot bridle, or master his mind, or affections, and motions. Hebr. Whose spirit hath not restraint, or, rule] is a city broken open without a wall.
\c 26
\s Honouring fools, verse 1,8. Undeserved curse, 2. Correction of fools, 3. To answer fools, 4,5. Foolish messengers, 6. Excellent sayings or sentences of fools,7,9. The oppression done by great men by means of their wicked servants, 10. Repented folly, 11. Self-wisdom, 12. Slothful man, 13,14,15,16. Unnecessarily strife, 17. Deceit, with pretence of jesting, 18,19. Whisperer, 20,22. Contentious people, 21. Hypocrisy, hatred concealed, and devices, 23, &c.
\p
\v 1 . As snow in Summer, and as rain in harvest; [To wit, are not seemly, but unseasonable and hurtful. In the land of Jud it rained not in harvest-time, or very seldom. See 1 Sam.12.17.] so honour is not seemly for a fool. [that is, dignity, and government, whereby he would bring shame upon himself, and oppress others, besitteth him not.]
\p
\v 2 . As a sparrow is (given) to wander away, [See of the Hebrew word (which is here taken for a sparrow), Gen.7.on verse 14. And Lev.14.on verse 4.] as a swallow to flying away; so the curse, which is without cause, [that is, which is done to an innocent person] shall not come. [that is, not hurt him that is cursed, but fly away from him as a bird.]
\p
\v 3 . A whip for the horse, bridle for the ass; [Compare Psalm 32.9,10.] and a rod for the back of fools. [compare above chapter 10.13.]
\p
\v 4 . Answer not the fool according to his folly: [To wit, in that manner, which he useth in his discourse, namely, with teams of reproach, slanderings, false accusations, and derisions; and so, as that thou suffer thy self by contention to be led away unto unseeming passions, as in hinted in the following words] lest thou also be like unto him.
\p
\v 5 . Answer the fool according to his folly: [To wit, according as his folly requireth; namely so, as that it be reproved and confused upon a good and sure ground] lest he be wise in his own eyes. [that is, in his own judgement, or whereby he imagineth and persuadeth himself that he is wife. So below verse 12,16.]
\p
\v 6 . He cutteth off (his own) feet, [That is, he maketh that he cannot go on with his business. Or he taketh away from himself the occasion and fitness to perform his affairs, in regard he may do them far better by himself, or by others, then by a fool] (and) drinketh violence [that is, wrongeth himself, and getteth shame and damage by those, to whom he sendeth the fool. The phrase signifieth as much as to endure any mischief, or to be punished therewith. Compare Psalm 75. The annot.on verse 9.] that sendeth messages [Hebr. Words] by hand [that is, by the Ministery. See Exod.3.on verse 13.] of a fool.
\p
\v 7 . Lift up the legs of the cripple: so is a proverb in the mouth of fools. [Lift up the legs of the cripple, &c. To wit, that he may be able to use them well in any work. But as this cannot be conveniently done, so neither can a fool utter a wise sentence or proverb aright. Oth. The legs of a cripple are lifted up: meaning one leg more then the other, so that they are unequal. The meaning is, as the legs or shanks of a cripple have no proportion, so are the words and speechs of a fool absurd, and agree not together. This verse may be likewise rendered thus: Take away the legs from the cripple; and the proverbs (which) are in the mouth of fools. Some understand also by legs, the ornaments of the legs, which seem not to becomes a cripple well: and so the sense or meaning would be this, that wise speechs or sentences in the mouth of fools suit no better then legs, or ornaments of the legs do to those that be lame or cripple.]
\p
\v 8 . As he that bindeth a (precious) stone [The Hebrew word is likewise taken for a precious stone, Exod.31.5. see the annot] in a sling: [Oth. He that bindeth a (precious) stone in an heap of stones] so is he, that giveth honour to a fool. [that is, dignity, offices, riches, which the fools cannot use aright, but letteth them perish. Hebr. As to bind a precious stone, or, the binding of a precious stone, &c. To wit, is very absurd and unseemly, because the precious stone being slung, cannot effect any special thing, or do any notable exploit, but is lost and gone, as soon as ever it is thrown out of the sling: so is be, etc.]
\p
\v 9 . (As) a thorn entereth [Heb. Goeth up] into the hand of a drunkard; so is a proverb in the mouth of fools. [That is, as a drunkard hurteth himself, or others, when he handleth a thorn: so neither can a fool use a good proverb or sentence well.]
\p
\v 10 . The great ones cause grief to every man: and hire fools, [Of fools, see above chapter 1.on verse 22.] and hire trangressors. [oth. Passengers, or, those that pass by, who ever they might be, if they be but onely bent to do as the great ones that hire them, would have them to do. Heb. The great one causeth grief to every one: and hireth a fool, and hireth trangressors. Meaning Tyrants; or Lords, and Princes, or such kind of great ones, who are so awed and reverenced by them, that they cause trouble and grief to every one. For which end they entertain fools and transgressors in their service, whereof the first cannot, and the other will not do good.]
\p
\v 11 . As a dog returneth to his vomit: [To wit, to swallow it in again, having forgotten that what he had vomited up, did not well agree with him] (so) doth a fool re-assume his folly, [compare 2 Pet.2.22.]
\p
\v 12 . Hast thou seen a man, that is wise in his (own) eyes? [See above on verse 5.] (there) in more expectation [to wit, of becoming wise and virtuous] of a fool, [see above chapter 1.on verse 22.] then of him. [so bel.ch.29.20.]
\p
\v 13 . The slothful man saith, there is a fierce lion in the way; a lion is in the streets. [Compare above ch.22.13.]
\p
\v 14 . (As) a door turneth about upon his hinge; [To wit, whereon it hangeth, and is fastened] so (doth) the slothful man upon his bed. [to wit, without coming off from it, to do the work that concerneth him.]
\p
\v 15 . The slothful hideth his hand in (his) bosome; [Oth. In the dish] he is too weary, to bring it again to his mouth [see above chapter 19.24. and the annotate. Thereon.]
\p
\v 16 . The sluggard is wiser in his (own) eyes, [See ab.on verse 5. Item below chapter 28.11.] then seven men) [that is, then many men. It is a certain number for an uncertain. See above chapter 6.on verse 31.] that answer (with) reason. [that is, that are able to speak rationally, or wisely, or with good understanding, and right judgement. Of the Hebrew word, see Job 12.20.on the word judgement.]
\p
\v 17 . The passenger that fretteth himself at a strife, (that) concerneth him not, [Heb. Not his: that is, that is not his] is (like) him that taketh a dog by the ears. [that is, is like him that without cause runneth into danger of trouble and mischief, as he that pullet a dog by the ears, provoketh him to leap upon him, and bite him.]
\p
\v 18 . As one that feigneth himself to be mad, [That is, behaveth himself as if he were out of his wits, or simple] who casteth fire-sparks, [or, firebrands, or, flames. Oth. Fetters, bond, or, snares, wherewith a man is tied, and made fast, especially about his hands] arrows, and deadly things: [Heb. Death; that is, which are able to bring death unto a man.]
\p
\v 19 . So is a man, that deceiveth his neighbour: and saith, Am not I in sport? [Heb. Am not I sporting, or, jesting; that is, that which I did, was not done wilfully, and with an evil intent, but onely in jest, and in sport, and in way of delight, to recreate my self, to make others merry. As under a pretence of feigned madness, in throwing of fire-brands, arrows and deadly things, no man can excuse himself, when he hath done mischief to a man; so neither is he to be excused, that under a cover and pretence of jesting, and sporting, hurteth his neighbour: Oth. That feigneth himself to faint.]
\p
\v 20 . When there is no word, the fire goeth out: and when there is no whisperer [Of the word whisperer, see above chapter 16.on verse 28.] brawling is stilled. [Hebr. Is silent; that is, is stilled. [Heb. Is silent; that is, is still, and ceaseth. See of the Hebr. Word, Jos.10.on verse 12. Compare above chapter 22.10.]
\p
\v 21 . (As) the dead coal is to the burning coal, and the wood to the fire: so is the brawling man, [Heb. A man of brawlings, or, of contentions] to kindle strife. [Compare ab.ch.15.18. and bel.ch.29.22.]
\p
\v 22 . The words of a whisperer are as (the words) of them that are beaten, and which go down into the innermost (parts) of the belly. [See above chapter 18.8. where the same proverb is propounded in the self-same words.]
\p
\v 23 . Burning lips, and a wicked heart, [Meaning those men, that seem to speak out of fervent love, and good affection, but yet bear an evil heart to those, to whom they speaks] are (as) a pot-sherd over-laid with dross of silver. [Which (to wit, pot-sherd) is in it self but of small value, but outwardly in regard of the brightness and similitude or likeness of the silver, sendeth forth a brave lustre and splendour, which deceiveth many men, who think the pot-sherd that is onely covered over and over-laid with dross and scum of silver, to be nothing but pure beaten or substantial silver.]
\p
\v 24 . He that beareth hatred, behaveth himself strange with his lips: but in his innermost (parts) [That is, in his heart. See Job 20.on verse 14.] he useth deceit. [that is, he feigneth himself to be otherwise, without by his words, then he is really and indeed within in his heart.]
\p
\v 25 . When he [To wit, the hater, or he that beareth hatred, of whom is spoken in the foregoing verse] intreateth with his voice, believe him not: for seven [that is, many, as above verse 16. And chapter 24.16. See above chapter 6.on verse 31.] abominations [that is, abominable thoughts and devices to do mischief] are in his heart.
\p
\v 26 . (Whose) hatred is covereth by deceit, [Oth. (as) in a wilderness; that is, in a place wherein no man is, that seeth, or heareth wickedness] his wickedness shall be discovered in the congregation: [that is, shall be laid open before all the world, either in this life (as oftentimes cometh to pass) or leastwise at the last day in the general and universal judgement, unless he do repent.]
\p
\v 27 . He that diggeth a pit, [To wit, to cause another to fall into it] shall fall therein; [Compare Ps.7.16. and 9.16. and 10.2. and 57.7. Eccles.10.8.] and he that rolleth a stone, it shall return upon him. [to wit, upon him, that rolled the stone upwards against or towards an high place, to cause it to fall upon some or other.]
\p
\v 28 . A false tongue [Hebr. A tongue of falsehood: that is, a man that useth, or dealeth with a false tongue] hateth those whom it bruiseth in pieces: [Or, shall bruise in pieces: that is, consume and destroy] and a slippery [that is, flattering, and soothing. Compare above chap.5.3. and the annot.] mouth, causeth over throw. [that is, striketh a man down to the ground.]

Boast not thy self of tomorrow: for thou knowest not what the day [To wit, not onely the time of tomorrow, or of the next day, but also of all future days, or days to come; as even the remaining part of this present day] will bring forth. [That is, bring to light, whereby thy future intentions and expectations may come to be hindered, and disappointed. Compare James 4.13,14, &c.]
\p
\v 2 . Let a stranger praise thee, and not thine (own) mouth: an unknown (person), and not thine (own) lips.
\p
\v 3 . A stone heavy, and the sand weighty: but a fools wrath is heavier then them both. [That is, is more intolerable; to wit, not onely because it is unequal, and unjust, but also immoderate, unbridled, and united or conjoined with cruelty. See the following phrase. Heb. There is heaviness of a stone, and weight of the sand.]
\p
\v 4 . Wrath and excess of anger [To wit, when a man by reason of his unruly and raging passions poureth himself violently out like a flood] is cruelty: [that is, bringeth forth cruel deeds and works] but who shall stand before envy? [the meaning is, that envy is worse then anger, and wrath, because it is deeper rooted in the heart, and an hardening in wickedness is mixed therewith.]
\p
\v 5 . Open reproof is better [That is, more profitable, and more to be desired] then secret love. [to wit, whereby a man indeed beareth good will unto his neighbour, and wisheth him all good success and happiness, but notwithstanding doth not reprove him, when need requireth, to manifest thereby his true and unfeigned love.]
\p
\v 6 . The wounds [That is, the reproofs, that being done with sharp and smarting words, make as it were a wound in the soul] of the lover are faithful: [that is, they issue from a faithful and constant love, and tend to the well-being and safety or preservation of him that receiveth them. Compare Psalm 145.1.] but the kisses [meaning all manner of feigned demonstration of love] of the hater are to be deprecated. [that is, we ought by fervent and constant prayer to beg of God, that he would keep and preserve us from them, both because they would be hurtful to us, and also because they issue and proceed from a false heart. Oth. The kisses of the hater are various, or manifold.]
\p
\v 7 . A satisfied soul [That is, a satisfied man, or person. So in the following words. See Gen.12.5. and the annot. Or understand the word soul of the desire and appetite that a man hath unto food, as Ezek.7.verse 19. See the annot.] treadeth upon [that is, despiseth, disdaineth, loatheth, abhorreth] the honey-comb: [understand under this name all pleasant, dainty, and delicate food. Compare above chapter 24.on verse 13.] but to an hungry soul all (or, every) bitter (thing) is sweet.
\p
\v 8 . As a bird is, that wandereth from her nest: [To wit, subject to much danger, and in continual disquietness, until she hath gotten a new nest, which she oftentimes can hardly make or attain unto] so is a man, that wandereth from his place. [to wit, rashly, without necessity, and a lawful calling.]
\p
\v 9 . Oil and frankincense rejoice the heart: [Compare above chapter 21.on verse 17.] so is the sweetness of a mans friendly discourse] in respect of the counsel of the soul [that is, by reason of the good counsel, or advice that he giveth him for his soul, or which cometh from a good heart that his friend beareth to him. Oth. More then the counsel of his own soul.]
\p
\v 10 . Forsake not thine (own) friend, nor thy fathers friend; neither go into thy brothers [That is, thy kinsmans. See Genesis 24.on verse 27.] house in the day of thine adversity: better is a neighbour that is near then a brother that is far off. [the reason is, because a friend loveth at all times, above chapter 17. Verse 17. And especially in time of trouble: but oftentimes there is discord and dissention between brethren, above chapter 18. Verse 19.] especially in time of adversity, above chapter 19. Verse 7. Therefore a friend many times beareth stronger love and affection then a brother, above chapter 18.24. Some understand it thus, that a faithful neighbour ought to be highly esteemed of, because he is nigh at hand, whereas a brother may be at a great distance, a far off, and not so ready to help a man, as the other may be.]
\p
\v 11 . My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may have something [Hebr. a word] (wherewith) to answer my reproacher. [understand under this word reproacher, all those that are wont to upbraid Parents, Masters, or Teachers, that their children, or scholars, &c. Are not well tutored, and instructed, or, that they do not behave themselves well.]
\p
\v 12 . The prudent man seeth the evil, (and) hideth himself: the simple go on (and) are punished. [See the exposition of this verse , above chap.22.on verse 3.]

\v 13 . When (a man) is become surety (for) a stranger, take his garment: and pawn it for an unknown (woman) [See the exposition of this verse, above cha.20.on verse 16. Compare also above chap.6.1,2. And 11.15. and 17.18.]
\p
\v 14 . He that blesseth his friend [That is, saluteth him, wishing the blessing of God, and all happiness and good loud voice, [Heb. Great voice; that is, immediately, unbeseemingly, and unseasonably, as slatterers are wont to do] getting up betimes in the morning, it [to wit, such, blessing, or salutation] shall be counted a curse [to wit by God, who hateth flattering: Or, by the friend that is blessed, who will bear no good will to the flatterer, but will who hath so unseasonably blessed or saluted his friend in a publike flattering way to get something of him.]
\p
\v 15 . A continual dropping in a day of a great shower rain; and a brawling wife [Hebr. A wife of brawling or, contentions; that is, a wife that is addicted to brawling and contention, or, that is brawling and contentious] are even alike. [that is, are to be compared, or likened together. The wife may be also rendered thus: a brawling, or, contentious wife is to be likened to a continual dropping in a day, &c. See a further exposition here of a above cha.19.on verse 13.]
\p
\v 16 . Every one that hideth her, [To wit, the brawling or contentious woman] would hide the wind, [The meaning is, that if a man were able to hide, that is, to rule, and tame her, he were able to hide, and shut up the wind: intimating, that neither the one, nor the other is possible to be done] and the oil [meaning the oil or ointment, which casteth such a great smell, as that it cannot in any case be hid or concealed from men, whensoever it cometh before their noses] of his right hand [that is, wherewith he anointed his right hand. The right hand is here specially mentioned, because in all dealings and transactions of men, the same cometh first to light, or is first put forth, whence then the smell of the oil or ointment that is put upon it may be apprehended or perceived] (which) crieth. [that is, which bewrayeth or discovereth it self by its smell, which as it cannot be kept in and hid, so can neither the brawling or contention of bad wife.]
\p
\v 17 . Iron is sharpeneth with iron: so a man sharpeneth the face of his neighbour. [Meaning the visage, or countenance, or behaviour of the face, that bent and composed to grief, fear, anger, &c. Which another man, according to the nature and quality of the thing, by discoursing with his friend, rouseth and stirreth up, when by his good instruction, comfort, and counsel, he setteth and strengtheneth the heart of his friend in a due manner. Others render the words thus: Iron maketh iron glad, (that is, maketh it bright, or shining) so doth a man make glad the face of his neighbour.]
\p
\v 18 . He that keepeth the fig-tree, [Understand hereby all good and faithfully service, which servants do owe unto their masters] shall eat the fruit thereof: and he that heedeth his Lord, shall be honoured. [That is, shall receive recompense, and reward. Compare above chap.13.on verse 18.]
\p
\v 19 . As (in) water face is against face: so is the heart of man against man. [That is, as the face or countenance of a man that looketh into the water, doth in a manner represent and shew it self there, though not fully and perfectly; so the heart of man doth in part discover and make known it self unto others by his gestures, words, and works, but not so, as that a man may certainly and infallibly judge of it, Jer.17.9. 1 Cor.2.11. This verse may also rendered thus: Faces are to faces (that is, men regard of their outward behaviour and countenance compared with other men) as waters: (to wit, that are very like one another, though they differ in colour, thickness, taste, &c.) so is the heart of man to man: (that is, so is man inwardly to be compared with this neighbour, because they have all one corrupt nature, and are subject to like infirmities.) Some take it thus: that as a mans face sheweth, or representeth it self in the water, so is one friend toward another.]
\p
\v 20 . Hell, [Oth. The grave. See Job 26.6. and compare above chap.15.11.] and destruction are not satisfied: [to wit, because whatsoever cometh into it, is devoured and consumed] so the eyes of man [that is, the desires and lusts, which enter through the eyes into the heart of man] are not satisfied.
\p
\v 21 . As (the melting cup is for silver, and the furnace for gold: [See above chap.17.on verse 3.] so is a man (to be tried) according to his praise. [that is, according to that report that goeth, or is spread abroad of him, concerning his words and actions: for according as men observe how taketh the report that goeth of him, so is he then judged what manner of man he is]
\p
\v 22 . Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar with a pestel in the midst of beaten grains; (yet) would not his foolishness depart from him. [This is an hyperbole, or excessive manner of seaking, intimating that some fools do persist so obstinately in their folly, that by no means whatsoever, they can possibly be brought from it]
\p
\v 23 . Be diligently to know thou shalt know, [The word knowing is taken here for taking care, or heeding. See Gen.18.on ver.19.] the face of thy sheep: [that is, the state and condition of thy sheep. This word seemeth to import, that an householder, or a father of a family must by whiles look after his own flock, and not to leave others to have all the care alone] and set thine heart upon the flocks. [the meaning is, that every one should diligently mind the gaining, keeping, and governing of his own estate, which in old times consisted much in cattle, and Beasts. Compare the phrase with Job 1.8. and the annotate.]
\p
\v 24 . For the treasure is not for ever: or shall the crown [That is, dignity, state, and honour, which are wont to accompany riches] be from generation to generation. [as if he should say, By no means. It is a question, which implieth a strong negation.]
\p
\v 25 . When the grass appeareth, and the grass-plants are seen, let the herbs of the mountains be gathered. [To wit, for fodder and provision for thy cattle.]
\p
\v 26 . The lambs [To wit, their skins and wool] shall be for clothing, and the be-goats (shall be) the price of the field. [that is, to buy, or pay therewith a field or meadow, or other necessaries.]
\p
\v 27 . Besides, thou shalt (have) sufficiency of goats-milk for thy food, [Hebr. Bread. So in the following words. See Gen.3.on vers.19.] for the food of thy house, [that is, household. See Gen.7.on ver.1.] and (for) the livelihood [Hebr. Life; that is, whatsoever is requisite and necessary for the sustentation of this present life.] of thy maidens.

\v 1 . The wicked flee, where (there) is no pursuer: [Compare Lev.26.36. Deut.28.28. Isa.57.21.] but every righteous man is bold, [to wit, by reason of the sure trust and confidence, which they put in God] as a young Lion. [which is ordinarily bolder, and less fearful then a Lions whelp, or an old Lion. Compare above chap.19. the annotate.on ver. 12. Oth. The righteous are as a young Lion, (which) is bold. Hebr. Is confident, or trusteth]
\p
\v 2 . For the transgression of the Land [That is, of the inhabitants of the Land] many are the Princes thereof: [to wit, because one dieth soon his natural death, another is murdered and destroyed. See examples, 1 Kings 16. And 2 Kings 24. &c. Hereby great changes and alterations happen in a Land, which are very dangerous, and hurtful to the inhabitants] but for understanding (and) knowing mans state, (there) shall likewise be a lengthening. [To wit, of the life of a good Ruler, and of good government.]
\p
\v 3 . A poor man, that oppresseth mean ones, [The poor man, that is an oppressor of the poor, is here especially named, because he ought to have more pity and compassion, then a rich man hath on those that are poor, for that he also feeleth, and is sensible of the misery they endure, and because the poor cannot restore the means which they have taken away from the poor, as well as the richer sort can, yea also because they being more needy, and in greater want, are oftentimes not contented with a little wrong, or a small injury done to others, but are still desirous to do more] is a sweeping rain, so that there is no bread, [understand this of a rain, which by reason of its greatess and continuance, maketh a great flood, or causeth a great inundation of water, whereby the corn and other grain, and the fruits of the ground are beaten down, destroyed, and as it were swept and carried away, so that there is no store or provision of bread and other victual left in the field.]
\p
\v 4 . They that forsake the Law, praise the wicked: but they that keep the Law, mingle themselves (in battle) against them. [To wit, against those that forsake the Law: namely, by reproving their wickedness by words, and in a good and godly conversation among them, and otherwise, according to the nature and condition of their calling.]
\p
\v 5 . Evil men [Hebr. The men of evil: that is, those that are addicted to evil, and practise it. See Job 11.on v.11.] understand not judgement: [that is, that which they are bound to believe, to do, and to leave undone] but they that seek the LORD, [see 2 Chron.ch.12.on v.16.] understand all things. [to wit, that are requisite and needful for their salvation, concerning matters of faith and conversation.]
\p
\v 6 . The poor, walking in his uprightness, [Compare above chap.2.7. and the annotate.] is better, then he that is perverse in (his) ways, [compare above chap.2.on v.15. The Hebrew word rendered here ways, signifieth two ways. It seemeth that the Holy Ghost speaketh so, because the right way, which is placed in the midst of two extreams, is left by the wicked, in that they decline or turn aside not only one of the two extreams, but also oftentimes unto both. We may also understand it thus, that some ungodly ones do feign themselves so, as if they were godly, and yet walk and deal wickedly and ungodly: which are two ways: the one is, feign ones self outward by words and gestures, to be that which he is not inwardly: the other, to make it appear by deeds that a man is really and truly such as he outwardly appeareth. Or two ways are, to feign ones self in the company and presence of Godly men, as if a man were godly too, and to demean ones self in the company and presence of wicked men, as he that is down right, or extreamly wicked. Compare below v.18.] though he be rich. [compare above chap.19.1.]
\p
\v 7 . He that keepeth the Law, is an understanding son: but he that is a companion [That is, a nourisher and maintainer. Hebr. Feeder. Compare above chap.13.on v.20.] of gluttons, [see of these also, Deut.21.20. and above chap.23.20,21. And understand by them all gross trangressors of the Law] shameth his Father. [see above chap.10.on v.5. Under the name of Father comprehend also the Mother. See above chap.15.20. compare below chap.29.3.]
\p
\v 8 . He that by usury, and by excess of gain, [See of these two words, usury, and excess of gain, Lev.25.on v.36.] increaseth his substance, gathereth it for him, that pittieth the poor [to wit, by the secret dispose of divine providence, without having the least the least thought of it.]
\p
\v 9 . He that turneth away his ear from hearing the Law, [To wit, the Law of God] even his prayer shall be an abomination. [To wit, unto God, see above chap.3.on v.32. and compare above chap.15.8. and 21.27.]
\p
\v 10 . He that causeth the upright to go astray in an evil way, [Of evil way, see above chap.2.on v.12.] shall fall himself into his (own) ditch: [to wit, which he had made for the righteous, or the upright one. See above chap.26.27.] but the godly shall inherit good things.
\p
\v 11 . A rich man is wise in his (own) eyes: but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out. [That is, heedeth him (to wit, the rich man) eyeing more his actions and conversation, then the lustre and splendour of his riches, which can neither give wisdom nor virtue.]
\p
\v 12 . When the righteous [Understand especially the godly Rulers of Countries and Cities] do leap up for joy, [that is, prosper, are happy, flourish and blossom] there is great glory: [or beauty, ornament, that is, good and well-composed order both in Ecclesiastical and Civil affairs, faithful administration and dispensing of all offices, with all manner of blessings from God] but when the wicked rise, a man is narrowly sought. [to wit, because he hideth and concealeth himself, through fear or persecution and oppression, which wicked and ungodly Rulers raise, especially against righteous and godly persons. Compare below v.28.]
\p
\v 13 . He that covereth his transgressions, shall not prosper, but he that confesseth them, [To wit, before the Lord, or also before men when need requireth] and forsaketh (them) shall obtain mercy. [compare Psa.32.3,5. 1 John 1.9,10.]
\p
\v 14 . Happy is the man that feareth continually; [That is, he that being truely and sincerely converted, out of true reverence, and an awful respect which he beareth unto God, feareth to offend him, and setting before his eyes the judgements that are prepared for the wicked, ordereth his conversation in humility, and a child-like fear according to the commandments of God, that he may not perish] but he that hardeneth his heart, [that is, he that behaveth himself very wilfully, and giveth himself over to obstinacy and rebellion. Compare Exod.4.on v.21. and 8.on v.15. and 32,on v.9. and 2. Kin.17.on v.14.] shall fall into mischief.
\p
\v 15 . The wicked (man) ruling over a poor people, is a roaring lion, and a bear that runneth too and fro. [To wit, in regard of hunger, to get a prey, as is said of the Devil, 1 Pet.5.8.]
\p
\v 16 . A Prince [Or Leader, or Ruler, that goeth before the people in the office of ruling or governing. See Nehem.11.11. and the annotate.] that is void of all understanding, is also manifold in oppressions, [that is, is a great oppressor, or oppresseth his subjects many and sundry ways, and is therefore himself liable to Gods judgements, and to many cruel torments and oppressions] but he that hateth covetousness, [or every one (to wit, of the leaders) that hateth filthy lucre, or covetousness] shall prolong the days. [to wit, of his life, that is, he shall enjoy long life by or through the means thereunto appointed by God, compare above chap.3.on v.2.]
\p
\v 17 . A man pressed for the blood [That is, for the murder or slaughter, see Gen.37.on v.26.] of a soul, [that is, of man, see Gen.12.on ver.5. The meaning is, a man that is pursued by the avenger of blood, and is troubled and tormented by his own conscience for shedding of blood, and for murdering and killing of a man. Oth. He that hath done violence to the blood of soul; to wit, which he hath shed wilfully and wrongfully] shall flee [to wit, through fear of divine vengeance so that he taking flight this way, and that way, shall unawares fall into some mischief and danger] to the pit, [that is, to destruction or to his own ruine. So is the word pit taken, Psa.7.16. and 28.1. and 30.4. and 40.3.] let him not be supported.[oth. Let no man stay him, or stop him, or hold him fast; to wit, that he may at least get into the pit, wherein he must needs be. That is, let no man seek to deliver him, or hide him, or any other way to rescue and free him from punishment.]
\p
\v 18 . He that walketh uprightly, [See above chap.2.on v.7.] shall be saved: but he that behaveth himself perversely [see above on v.6.] shall fall into one (of them.) [that is, shall perish in one of those two ways, to wit, whether he join himself to the godly in his outward conversation, that he may seem like unto them, or in some shew to associate himself and keep company with the wicked, to enjoy and taste of their profits and outward contentments.]
\p
\v 19 . He that tilleth his land, shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth vain (men) [Of vain men, or vain persons, see above chap.12.on v.11.] shall be satisfied with poverty. [see Job 7.on v.4.]
\p
\v 20 . A very faithful man [Hebr. A man of truths, or of faithfulnesses, see above chap.11.on v.17. Meaning one that is true, upright and faithfull in his dealing] shall be manifested in blessings: [that is, shall be exceedingly blessed. God will do him good, and godly men will wish good unto him] but he that is hasty to be rich, shall not be guiltless, [that is, shall not be free from suspicion of unrighteous dealings, abuses and sins; and conquently shall not be held to be undeserving of punishment.]
\p
\v 21 . To know faces [See Deut.1.17. and the annot. This is as much as to accept faces, or persons, Lev.19.15. see likewise there the annot.] is not good: [that is, is very bad, see above chap.17.on v.26.23.] for a man will transgress for a piece of bread. [the meaning is, if men might have respect of persons in judgement, they would make no bones of sinning or transgressing. For a bit of bread (as we say) yea for nothing at all, men would commit gross and out-ragious villanies.]
\p
\v 22 . He that hasteth after wealth [Understand an hastening that is united and conjoined with great trouble and unpiety of spirit, as also the Hebrew word is translated for being troubled, 2 Sam.4.1. in the annotate. Job.4.5. and 21.6. and 23.15.] is a man of an evil eye: [that is, a man that hath an evil eye, understand an envious, surely and covetous man. See Deut.15.on v.9. and above chap.23.on v.6.] but he knoweth not that want shall come upon him. [to wit, both from God, whom he offendeth by his covetousness and cruelty; and from men whom he hurteth therewith.]
\p
\v 23 . He that reproveth a man, [To wit, with words. See above chap.15.on v.31.] shall afterward [to wit, when he that was reproved, shall find and perceive, that the reproof hath done him good. Oth. Following me] find more favour, then he that flattereth with the tongue. [compare above chap.2.16. and the annotate. On the word flattering, or to flatter.]
\p
\v 24 . He that robbeth his Father, or His mother, and saith, it is no transgression; [As if he had said; it is no theft, which God forbiddeth in his Law, because the estate belongeth to me after their decease] the same is the companion of a destroying man. [or to the destroying man, or of the man of destroying, or of a murderer; because he taketh away from his Father, or from his Mother, or from both, the means whereby they are to maintain and uphold their life: or of a waster, or spend-thrift; of whom see above chap.18.9. Of the word destroying, see Judg.20.on v.21.]
\p
\v 25 . He that is high minded [Hebr. Broad, or wide in soul] stirreth up brawling, [compare above chap.13.10. and 15.18. and below chap.20.22.] but he that trusteth in the LORD, shall wax fat. [that is, rich and prosperous both in body and soul. To wit, because he being humble, and relying upon God alone, seeketh nothing else but to live in peace and quietness with his neighbour.]
\p
\v 26 . He that trusteth in his (own) heart, [That is, he that will have his own mind fulfilled, and will follow only his own conceit] the same is a fool: but he that walketh in wisdom, [that is, according to the doctrine which is true and right wisdom, prescribed unto us in the word of God, and according to the counsel of those that follow it] he shall not lack.
\p
\v 27 . He that giveth unto the poor, shall not lack, [Compare Deut.15.7,8,10. Above chap.19.17. and 22.9.] but he that hideth his eyes, [to wit, from the poor, through unmercifulness and covetousness] shall be much cursed. [Hebr. Shall be manifold in cursing: that is, shall be exceedingly cursed, see above v.20. manifold in blessings, for him that is exceedingly blessed.]
\p
\v 28 . When the wicked rise, a man hideth himself, [Compare above the last annotate. On v.12.] but when they perish, the righteous do multiply.

\v 1 . A man that being often reproved, [Hebr. A man of reproof; that is, that is much and often reproved. So a man of sorrows, Isa.53.3. for him that endureth many sorrows; a man of desires, Dan.10.on ver.11. for him, that is much desired] hardeneth (his) neck, [see Exod.32.on v.9.] shall suddenly be broken, so that there be no healing (him.) [see above chap.6.on v.15.]
\p
\v 2 . When the righteous become great, [That is, when they come to great authority, and sit in place of government, as may be gathered from the other clause of his verse. Compare 2 Kings 5,1. And 10.6. and 25.9. with the annotate. Oth. Become many, or do multiply] the people rejoice: [compare above chap.11.10. and 28.12.] but when the wicked heareth rule, the people groan. [to wit, under the burden of tyranny, wherewith they are oppressed by wicked Rulers. See an example, Exod.2.23. compare above chap.28.28.]
\p
\v 3 . A man that loveth wisdom, rejoiceth his Father: [Compare above chap.10.1. and 15.20.] but he that is a companion of harlots [that is, a follower, nourisher and maintainer of whores. Hebr. Feeder, see above chap.13.on v.20.] spendeth (his) substance. [compare above chap.28.7. Luke 15.13.]
\p
\v 4 . A King [To wit, that is wise and godly. See above chap.18.on verse.22.] by judgement [that is, by making and maintaining good laws, whereby the good are protected, and the wicked deservedly punished] stablisheth the land; [that is, the government, or the state of the land, and the prosperity of the inhabitants or subjects] but one that inclined to (receive) gifts, [Heb. A man of heavings, or heav-offerings. Of the Hebrew word terumah, see Lev.7.14. and Num.5.9. in the annotate. Here the same is to be understood of the heaving or lifting up of gifts, whereunto a Ruler of the Land might be prone and inclined, to shew favour unto some, without having respect unto Law or equity. The word may be also understood of the imposing of taxes, which a Prince tyrannically levieth and gathereth of his poor subjects, and thereby greatly burdeneth and oppresseth them.] troubleth it.
\p
\v 5 . A man that flattereth his neighbour, [To wit, by praising him excessively, by favouring and sparing him in his sins, and by closely provoking & encouraging him to the commiting of all manner of wickedness, etc.] spreadeth a net abroad for his goings. [that is, bringeth him into danger of destruction, which is hid under flattering words: as a bird is enticing, by the bait, to be caught in the net, which it was not aware of, or not suspected.]
\p
\v 6 . In the transgression of an evil man (there) is a snare: [To wit, hid, which bringeth him into danger of destruction; yea, wherein he shall certainly perish, unless God, by repentance, pluck him out] but the righteous shouteth, and is glad. [to wit, because he, taking heed of sin, feareth no such snare.]
\p
\v 7 . The righteous [To wit, Judge] taketh notice of the cause of the poor: [that is, undertaketh to search into the suit or controversy of the poor, is careful to understand and know it aright, and to help and assist the poor in their cause, so far as may stand with justice and equity. Compare, Job 29,16.] (but) the wicked apprehendeth not knowledge. [namely, whereby he ought to understand, both his duty, which engageth him to help and aid the poor, and also the right manner and way, to do it well and seasonably.]
\p
\v 8 . Scornful men [Hebr. Men of scorning, or mocking] set a City on (fire,) [to wit, by kindling the fire of divine vengeance, through their abominable sins; or also the fire of dissension, or of munity and war, by their evil counsel and disloyalty. Otherwise, ensnare a city, or bring a city into a snare] but the wise turn away wrath.

\p
\v 9 . A wise man going to law with a foolish man, whether be [To wit, the wise man] be troubled, or laugh, yet there is no rest. [to wit, no rest or end of the suit: for the foolish man will always seek some evasion or other, and will always have something or other still to alledge. The meaning is, that a wise man going to law with a foolish man, whether he be displeased, or whether he be well pleased, it is al one; there is no end of the controversy for all that. Others understand this of the foolish man, that is sometimes angry, and sometimes laughteth, but all with one kind of sad or heavy event.]
\p
\v 10 . Blood thirsty men [ Hebr. Men of blood: that is, blood-thirsty men, or they that are prone to shed blood, and to commit murder, see Psal.5.on vers.11.] hate the godly man, [of the godly man, see Gen.6.on v.9. and Job 1.on vers.1.] but the upright seek his soul. [to wit, to save and deliver it from destruction. Compare, Psal.142.5. Otherwise, to seek the soul of a man, is to seek to take away his life. See Exod.4.on vers.19. and 2. Sam.4. on vers.8.]
\p
\v 11 . A fool uttereth his whole spirit: [That is, all his thoughts. Compare above chap.1.on vers.23. also affections, motions, inclinations, see 2 Kings 19.on vers.7. compare also above, cha.14.33.] but a wise man keepeth it in (till) afterwards. [that is, he restraineth and keepeth himself in, so that he doth not reveal and discover all his thoughts, knowledge, mind, and intention at once.]
\p
\v 12 . A Ruler [Meaning one that is supreme head and governor over a Country or people, see 2 Sam.23.on vers.3.] that giveth heed to lying, [to wit, so that he is inclined to believe and maintain it. Heb. The word of falsehood, so above, chap.13.5.] all his servants are wicked. [meaning, the greatest part of them, because a wicked Ruler desireth to have such to wait upon him that are like himself, and by the ordering and managing of those that belong unto him, doth commonly get such servants as are like him; or if so be pious and godly that he getteth, then he indeavoureth to frame and fashion them, according to his mind, or else to discard and cashier them.]
\p
\v 13 . The poor and the deceiver [Heb. The man of deceits, or of usuries, or of subtilities. Understand an unrighteous rich man that getteth his riches by crafty and unjust dealings or devices. Others, a man of crafty diligences, that is, one that gathereth riches by diligence mixt with policy or subtilty] meet together; [that is, live and trade together. Compare above chap.22.2. and the Annotat.] the Lord lighteneth both their eyes. [to wit, with the light of the Sun, so that he preserveth and 45. Some understand it of the enlightening of the natural understanding. Compare Job 1.9.]
\p
\v 14 . A King that in faithfulness doth justice to the poor, [That is, taketh notice of their cause, judgeth rightly thereof, without respect of persons; and, if he find them to be in the right, maintaineth and defendeth them against their oppressors, both by sentence and execution, without growing weary, or fainting therein, by reason of the meanness and poverty of the one, or being subverted and turned about, by reason of the greatness and riches of the other, so Psa.82.3. Isa.17, &c. To the poor, to wit, to those that may easily be oppressed by the unjustice and violence of others, and do hardily find help or aid, by reason of their own disability and poverty] his throne shall be established forever. [compare above, chap.20.28. & 25.5.]
\p
\v 15 . The rod [meaning the punishment which is done by blows, see above, chap.10.on verse 13.] and reproof [to wit, which is done by words: although the word in the original doth sometimes also signify the rebuke or punishment which is done actually by blows, see above, chap.13.24. and 22.15. and 23.13.] but a child that is left (to himself) [that is, that is suffered to be his own master, and is under no mans tuition, guidance or instruction] maketh his mother ashamed. [yea, and also his father; but especially his mother, because she hath been most busied in his education, and bringing for him up, as also the female sex is commonly most subject to the reproach and scorn of wicked and rebellious children, and do least take it to heart. Compare above, chap.10.1. and 17.21,25.]
\p
\v 16 . When the wicked grow many, [Heb. Do multiply, or grow great. Compare above, verse 2.] transgression growth much; but the righteous shall behold their fall. [compare Psal.37.34. and 58.11. and 91.8.]
\p
\v 17 . Correct thy son, [To wit, with words and blows, as the cause requireth, see above chap.9.on vers.7.] and he shall give thee rest; [compare above, chap.13.24. and 22.15. and23.13,14.] and he shall give delight to thy soul.
\p
\v 18 . When there is no prophecy, [Heb. Vision, meaning no preaching of the Word of God, whereby the will of God to us, and our duty to him, is shewed and made known unto us: so is the word vision taken, 1. Sam.3.1. 1 Chron.17.15.] the people are made wicked; [to wit, of the grace, blessing, and protection of God, and consequently of their temporal and eternal welfare, compare Exod.32.25. and the Annotat. Oth. Are forsaken, or cast off: or turn back.] but happy is he that keepeth the law. [that is, that keepeth the way of the Lord, see Gen.18.on vers.19.]
\p
\v 19 . A servant will not be corrected by words; [To wit, to do that which his master commandeth him, and whereunto he is also engaged. The meaning is, that all those that be of a servile and slavish spirit or disposition, they cannot be brought or won to the performance of their duty by soft words, by good instructions and admonitions, but have need to be compelled and forced thereto by hard and heavy blows] although he understand (thee) yet will he not answer. [to wit, neither with unfeigned works, nor with obedient deeds. Or, when he understandeth (thee) and answereth not.]
\p
\v 20 . Hast thou seen a man that is hasty in his words; [Or, works and deeds] there is more expectation [to wit, of speaking prudently and seasonably, or of doing things wish good advice and counsel] of a fool, then of him. [compare above, chap.26.12.]
\p
\v 21 . When a man keepeth his servant delicately from a child, he will at last desire to be a son. [A son of the family, that will draw unto himself the right of son-ship, and of inheritance. Compare the examples of Abner, 2 Sam.3.7,8. Of Jerobeam, 1 Kings 11.26,27,28. Of Simri, 1 Kings 16.9.]
\p
\v 22 . An angry man [Heb. A man of anger; that is, that is prone to anger, see Job 11.on vers.11.] stirreth up brawling, [compare above, chap.15.18. and 26.21.] and the wrathful (man) [Heb. A Lord of wrath, compare above, chap.22.on vers.24.] is manifold in transgression.
\p
\v 23 . A mans pride shall humble him: but the humble in spirit shall hold honour fast. [That is, shall surely get, and constantly keep honour; to wit, in the sight of God, in the presence and esteem of good men, and in the witness and testimony of his own conscience. See the like phrase above chap.11.16. Oth. But honour shall uphold the humble in spirit. Compare Job 22.29. Prov.15.33. and 18.12. Isa.66.2. Mat.23.12. Luke 14.11. and 18.14. Jam.4.6,10. 1 Pet.5.5.]
\p
\v 24 . He that is partner with a thief, hateth his (own) soul; [That is, is his own enemy, bringing great shame and disgrace upon himself. See the like phrase above, chap.8.36. and in the Annotat.] he heareth a curse, and he bewrayeth it not. [the meaning is, that he, being required by the Judge upon his corporal oath, and with a cursed denounced against him that is privy to the theft, discovereth it not, notwithstanding he knowing thereof, utterly denieth to have any knowledge of it. Oth. (so) he that heareth a curse, and bewrayeth it not, (as it is, Levit.5.1.) he hateth also his own soul.]
\p
\v 25 . The trembling of man [To wit, which is too great and immoderate, whereby men do not in dangers and difficulties threatened trust and rely on God so as they ought to do] layeth a snare, [that is, bringeth the fearful man into great danger of sinning more against God, and of being more punished of God by many unhappy disasters and sad accidents] but he that trusteth in the LORD, shall be set in a high place of refuge [to wit, where he shall be safe, free from all dangers.]
\p
\v 26 . Many seek the Rulers face, [To wit, to require something of him, that may tend to the advancing and promoting of their cause, and of their suit, which they have against another. Compare above, chap.19.6.] but every mans judgement is from the LORD. [to wit, who absolutely loveth righteousness, and hath also the hearts of Rulers in his hand, see above, chap.21.1. and therefore must first of all, and before all others be sought unto. See examples hereof, Nehem.1.4. Esther 4.16.]
\p
\v 27 . An unjust man [Hebr. A man of injustice, that is, that loveth injustice. Compare above, chap.6. on verse 14.] is an abomination to the just: but he that is right in way, [that is, he that wise and godly, or upright. Compare, Psalm37.14. and 119.1.] is an abomination to the wicked. [Heb. An abomination of the wicked. See above, chap.3.on v.32.]

\s Agur confesseth his own and all mens ignorance in matters divine, without the word of God, v.1, &c. And declareth, that the wisdom, creation, and governing of all things, pertaineth to God the Father, and to his son, 4. He extolleth the pureness and perfection of the word of God, 5,6. His prayer for two things, 7,8,9. Of accusing a servant to his master, 10. Four evil generations, 11, &c. Four unsatiable things, 15,16. Contempt of parents, 17. Four things hard to be known, 18,19. Four intolerable things, 21,22,23. Four small, but wise creatures, 24, &c. Four creatures, stately in their going, 29,30,31. Ceasing and prevenvetions of wrath, 32,33.
\p
\v 1 . The words of Agur, [Some do understand by this name, Solomon himself, by reason of the gathering of his Proverbs all together into one volume or book; for the name Agur cometh from a word, that signifieth gathering and bringing together. Others conceive, that Agur is the name of a Prophet, that make the Proverbs of this chapter, inscribed and dedicated them to the two persons that are here named or mentioned] the son of Jake, a burden; [that is, the doctrine. See of the Hebrew word, 2 Kings 9.on verse 25. Where it signifieth a prophetical threatening; but it is here taken for all manner of good instruction, whereby a man is edified] the man speaketh unto Ithiel, unto Ithiel and Uchal. [some conceive These two (Ithiel and Uchal) to be names and titles of our blessed Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, of whom mention is made in the fourth verse: Ithiel is as much, as God is with me, agreeing very neer with the name, Immanuel, Isa.7.14. Uchal signifieth, I shall prevail, or be able. Others conceivce them to be the names of Agurs companions, or scholars, or (as some are of opinion) sons, who received the insuing proverbs at his hand, or of him.]
\p
\v 2 . Verily I am more brutish then any man; and I have no human understanding: [The prophet beginneth his Proverbs with a presence concerning the meanness, and (as I may say) nothingness of his understanding and apprehension, both to set bounds and limits unto himself, in the searching and diving into secret and hidden things, and also to instruct and teach others, that they ought not curiously to pry into high and deep matters, that exceed and surmount the capacity of man, but to keep themselves within the bounds of humble docibility] then any man, [Agur, by reason of the mean conceit that he hath himself, maketh himself, in regard of the high, transparent, mysterious quetions, viler and baser then any man.] And I have no human understanding, [or, I have not the understanding of a man. To wit, not as it is now since the fall, but as it was at first, when created in Adam.]
\p
\v 3 . Neither have I learned wisdom, [To wit, that I should be able to apprehend things that are so high] nor known the knowledge of the holy (ones.) [Of the word holy (ones) or Saints, see Job 15.15. and the Annotat. Oth. Should I then know the knowledge of the holy (ones?)
\p
\v 4 . Who hath ascended up into heaven, and descendeth? [It is as much as if he had said; Who is the wisdom of God, and the power of God, as the onely begotten Son of God, the Messias, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge? Compare above, chap.8. from vers.22. to verse 32. And 1 Cor.1.24. Cor.2.3. And see further these very words applied to our Saviour Christ, Joh.3.13. Eph.4.9,10.] who hath gathered the wind in his fists? [as God the father, and his onely begotten son doth, without excluding the Holy Ghost, who proceedeth from them both, and is the spirit of the Father and of the Son. Compare, John 1.3. Heb.1.3. &c.] who hath bound the waters in a garment? [Meaning, the superior waters, or the waters that are above; that is, the clouds, which God alone keepeth and holdeth hanging in the air, as if they were bound and shut up in a garment, which he looseneth and unfoldeth at his pleasure] who hath established all the ends of the earth? [to wit, that they are founded in the midst of the air, upon their own weight. Compare, Job 38.4. Psalm.104.3. Isa.40.12.] how is his name, and how, if thou know it, his sons name? [to wit, God the Fathers name, and his eternal Sons name. Compare, Psal.2.7. and 80.16. Isa.9.5. whose name (that is, whose eternal divine essence) no creature is able to comprehend, see Exod.3,13,14. Judg.13.17,18.]
\p
\v 5 . All (or every) saying of God [Meaning the word of God revealed unto us in in Scripture, containing in it the doctrine which we are to believe, and the commandments which we ought to keep and perform, without troubling our selves too much with the secrets which God hath kept for himself alone, and which excel and transcend our capacity and apprehension, Deut.29.29.] is purified: [compare, Psa.12.7. and 18.31. and 19.9. and 119.40.] he is a shield [compare, Gen.15.1. and the Annotat.] unto them that trust in him.
\p
\v 6 . Add not unto his words, [Compare, Deut.4.2. and 12.32. Rev.22.19.] left he reprove thee, and thou be found lying. [he forbiddeth not to diminish ought from the words of God, not because it is law to do so, for that is likewise firbidden, Deut.4.2. and 12.32. Revel.22.19. but because men are most prone and inclined to adding; and that under a colour of rightly interpreting and expounding the word, and also of singular and eminent holiness.]
\p
\v 7 . Two things have I required of thee; [Namely, O God] with-hold them not from me, before I die. [that is, before I depart out of this transitory life: wherein mans soul is always subject to a sinful nature and condition, and his body hath always need of temporal necessaries to support it.]
\p
\v 8 . Vanity, [Meaning all infidently, error and falsehood in doctrine. So is the word taken, Lament.2.14. Ezek.12.24. and 13.6,7. Zach.10.2.] and lying [meaning all manner of falsehood, hypocrisy, deceit, flattering, circumvention, lewdness and perversness in life, so Psal.4.3. and 62.5. above, chap.19.22. and 23.3.] remove far from me, [to wit, by the illumination and sanctification of thy spirit. This is the first thing that he desireth or requireth at the hand of God] give me neither poverty nor riches, [this is his second request] feed me with the bread of mine appointed distinct portion. [see Job 23.on v.12.]
\p
\v 9 . Lest I being full, should then deny (thee,) and say, who is the LORD? [That is, being full in regard of the possession of great riches, or of a great estate; and wanton, by reason of the immoderate and excessive abuse of them. Compare, Deut.31.20. and 32.15. Neh.925. 26. Below, v.22.] or lest I being improverished, should then steal, and take hold of the Name of my God. [to wit, by vain and idle abuse of it, or by perjury and taking a false oath, to get wealth, or by denying theft committed by me, or by murmuring against God for visiting me with poverty.]
\p
\v 10 . Accuse not a servant unto his master, [That is, accuse him not rashly, and wrongfully, without any fault at all by him committed, see Psal.101. on verse 5.] left he curse thee, [that is, beg vengeance of God upon thee, who hath promised to help and defend the poor that are oppressed and afflicted, Exod.22.23. but when the accusation is well grounded and justly made, a man needeth not to fear any curse at all, above, chap.26.2. but may on the contrary expect a blessing, 2 Sam.16.12.] and thou become guilty. [That is, be not onely convinced of thy sin, but also be punished of God for it. Compare, Gen.41.21. Lev.4.22. Num.5.6,7.]
\p
\v 11 . There is a generation [That is, a sort or kind of men, so Deut.1.35. and 32.5. Psal.14.5. and here in the following 12,13,14 verse] that curseth their father, [the prophet relateth here, and in the three following verses, some sort of sinners that are very odious and abominable in the sight of God] and doth not bless their mother. [that is, will also curse her. That which was before related, again repeated, with a denial of the contrary unto that which was related and asserted, so Deut.33.6. Isa.38.1, &c.]
\p
\v 12 . A generation that is poor in their (own) eyes [That is, in their own conceit and judgement. Compare Job 18.3. and see the Annotat. Understand here by these, all hypocrites, and such as seem holy in outward shew and appearance, who count themselves to be clean and pure from sin, (or at least very little defiled there with) in comparison of others] and is not washed from their dung. [that is sins, which are here called by a word which signifieth filth or excrements, which are voided by going to stool, so, Isa.4.4.]
\p
\v 13 . A generation, whose eyes are lofty, and whose eyelids are lifted up. [Meaning, proud men, that have a high conceit of themselves, despise every one, and desire to look over all men heads, see above, chap.6.on verse.12.]
\p
\v 14 . A generation, whose teeth are swords, [Compare Psal.57.5.] and whose great teeth [see Job 29.on v.17.] (are) knives, to consume [that is, to devour and to destroy, see Exod.15.7. and the Annotat. Deut.32.42.2. Sam.2.26.] the miserable from off the earth, and the needy from among men. [understand in general, those that being extream cruel, and without any pity or compassion at all, abuse their power and authority, to destroy those that are poor and mean in the world: as there are such as are back-biters, defames, or takes away of others good name and repute, and slanderers: also those that violently oppress and wrong the poor, as likewise covetous persons, that wrong and oppress their neighbour by coarsening and fraudulent, or suck them dry by usury and extortion.]
\p
\v 15 . The blood-sucker [Meaning a thick water-worm, otherwise called an horse-leach, that liveth in ponds, or pools, and moors, having a sharp tongue cloven in two branches, wherewith being applied to the body, she pincheth through the skin of it, and then sucketh in so much blood, as that she falleth off from the body of her own accord, her appetite being not fully satisfied, but her body so filled and puffed up with blood, that it can hold no more. The comparison is well to be heeded] hath two daughters, [the Hebrew word signifieth properly daughters, but it is also taken for branches or springs, because they are as daughters of the stock from whence they issue, Gen.49.22. Understand here the split or cloven tongue, whereof mention was made in the former Annotat.] Give, Give [that is, whereof every one sait. Give, or Bring, or both of them may be so called, to express their insatiability thereby] These three things [see above, chap.6.on verse 16.] are not satisfied: (yea) four [see the same place] say not, It is enough.
\p
\v 16 . The grave, [Compare above chap.1.12. and 27.20.] the closed womb, [Heb. The closing up of the womb: that is, the closed and barren womb, see Gen.20.on vers.18. The Israelitish women were in those times exceeding (yea, beyond measure) desirous to have children, see Gen.30.1,23. With the Annotat.] the earth, (that) is not satisfied with water: [to wit, the dry and sandy earth: for although it be much moistened, yet in a short time it becometh again so dry and thirsty, that it seemeth not to have been watered at all] and the fire, [which is never weary of burning, though never so much combustible matter be thrown into it] saith not, it is enough. [Compare, Job 14 7. And the Annotat.]
\p
\v 17 . The eye that mocketh (his) Father, or despiseth the obedience of (his) Mother, the ravens of the brook [That is, the ravens about brooks, rivers and streams of water, to drink there, or to seek their prey from dead bodies or carcases, and other things, and other things, that do often drive or float in them. Oth. The ravens of the valley, such as afterwards was the valley of Hinnom, where there lay sometimes dead carcases, and other filthy and noisome things, 2 Kings 23.10.] shall pick it out, and the Eagles young ones shall eat it. [The meaning is, that stubborn and rebellious children that mock and deride their parents, do at last come to the gallows, to unburied are wont to be cast before birds, as a prey to be eaten and devoured by them. The eyes is specially mentioned in his punishment, because the tokens of mocking, despite, contempt and stubbornness are for the most part seen in the eye.]
\p
\v 18 . These three things are too wonderful for me: yea four, which I know not.
\p
\v 19 . The way [That is, the manner of acting. See above chap.6.on v.6.] of an eagle in the heaven, [Her way of acting is wonderful, because she flieth both exceeding swift and exceeding high all at once. Oth. Because she with her flying rendereth and cutteth the air asunder, and yet leaveth no mark or print to be seen in it] the way of a serpent upon a rock: [which is wonderful, because without feet she creepeth speedily, and climbeth up into slippery rocks. Oth. Because in the rock, upon which she creepeth, she maketh no furrow, nor leaveth any slime behind her, as water-snakes do, nor feathers, as birds do, nor dung, as almost all other creatures do] the way of a ship in the heart of the Sea, [that is, in the midst of the Sea, see above chap.23.on ver.34. This is likewise wonderful, because a ship in the midst of the sea now goeth down into a deep profundity, as into the very bottom of the sea, anon riseth up again, and mounteth aloft as if it would tear the very sky, without tossing upside down and drowning. Oth. Because in a still and calm water it leaveth a kind of print and furrow behind it, but which suddenly vanisheth, neither can it so be discerned in the midst of the sea, by reason of the waves up waves and billows, that drive and carry the waves up and down] and the way of a man with a maid. [which is wonderful, both in the respect of the rare and wonderful briding and uniting of his heart with maid, and also in respect of the wonderful means used by him for the getting and enjoying of her.]
\p
\v 20 . So is the way of an adulterous woman: [That is, so wonderful or hidden, as the four afore-recited things are: To wit, by reason of the great wickedness and vileness, which she knoweth how to use, as well in the practising of her unclean and immodest actions, as in the excusing and hiding of them, when she hath done; as followeth in the text] she eateth [that is, she enjoyeth the unchaste carnal copulation. Compare above chap.9.17. and 20.17.] and wipeth her mouth and saith, I have wrought no iniquity. [that is, she feigneth to know of no wickedness at all, as if she were one of the honestest women in the world.]
\p
\v 21 . For three things [Compare above chap.6.on v.16.] the Earth [that is, the inhabitants of the Earth. Compare Gen.41.30. and the annotate.] is disquieted: yea for you four (which) it cannot bear.
\p
\v 22 . For a servant, when he reigneth: [That is, is in place of authority, and advanced to high dignity, whereby he obtaineth great powers which he abuseth to the oppression of others, and to his own destruction] and a fool [see 1 Sam.25.on v.25.] when he is satisfied [see above on ver.9.] with bread. [that is, all manner of good things tending to the preservation and upholding of his temporal life, see above chap.4.on v.17.]
\p
\v 23 . For an hateful (woman) when she is married; [Meaning a woman that is hated of every body, and deserveth to be hated for her bad qualities and ill conditions: for being married she is intolerable to her husband, children, servants, neighbours, etc. Some understand by this hated woman, the wife of an husband, who among other wives, (which he had all at once, according to the custome of those times) loved her as the first least, but afterwards most of all, whereby she become odious and intolerable unto her companions and corrivals] and an hand-maid, when she is heir of her mistress. [that is, when she marrieth her master after her mistresses decease. Hebr. When she inheriteth her mistress. Compare Judg.11.23,24.]
\p
\v 24 . These four (things) are of the least (things) of the Earth: but they are wise, [That is, are prudent and intelligent, which they manifest and discover by certain works, which they do by the dictate and instinct of nature, whereby men ought to be provoked and stirred up to the practising of sundry vertues] well furnished with wisdom; [Hebr. Made wise: that is, furnished and endued with wisdom: to wit, by God, who by the work of creation infused the same into their natures.]
\p
\v 25 . The Arts are a weak people: [That is, a kind of unreasonable creatures. So in the next verse] yet they prepare their meat [Hebr. Bread] in the summer. [concerning the application of this example unto man, see above chap.6.6, etc.]
\p
\v 26 . The Conies [See Lev.11.on v.5. and of the same creature, Deut.14.7. and Psa.104.18. Oth. Mountain-mice, or bear-mice, because the cony in those countries hath not her holes or burrows in the rocks] are a feeble folk, yet make their house [or hole, or nest, or burrow. Compare Job 8.14. Psa.84.4. and 104.17.] in the rock. [to wit, mixed with earth and sand.]
\p
\v 27 . The Grass-hoppers have no King: yet go yet they all forth, dividing themselves (into heaps.) [That is, as it were in battle array marching into the field, that so, keeping their bands and force together, they might be the more dreadful and terrible, and not so easily driven away from their pasture. Oth. Gathered together, or assembled into one, or they go all forth shooting, to all (as) an arrow, or cutting all asunder; that is, devouring, eating down all.]
\p
\v 28 . The spider [Oth. The Ape] taketh hold with (her) hands [meaning her paws which she maketh use of, not only for to go upon them, but also to make her web withal, for to catch flies and ganats in] and is in Kings palaces. [to wit, where she is in most danger of being hunted away and killed, and in more fear for to do her work.]
\p
\v 29 . These three make a good pace, yea there be four [Compare this phrase with Job 5.19. and the annotate.] that make a good going. [After the recital of four small, weak and fearful creatures, there are here represented and held forth four great, strong and undaunted creatures, which do exhort and stir us up courage and boldness in our calling.]
\p
\v 30 . The old Lion [The word in the Original signifieth properly a Lion, who with his great age, hath also great boldness and courage. Compare above chap.5.on v.11.] strong among the beasts. [that is, the strongest of beasts. So Jos.14.15. Great among the Anakims; that is, the greatest of the Anakims. Item Cant.1.8. fair among women; that is, the fairest of women] who will not turn away for any, to wit, neither for man nor beast, that might come against him.]
\p
\v 31 . A Grey-hound of good loins: [The word rendered here Grey-hound, etc. Hath its original from the Hebrew zeraz; that is, to spread: or as others conceive from the Chalde zeraz; that is, to spread: or as others conceive from the Chalde zeraz; that is, to tuck up, or dress up; and therefore there is meant by it a creature, that is in it self stout and courageous, well set in regard of his body, and strong and lusty in his feet, and ready for the work he is set about, which others conceive to sit the horse well. See Job 39.22. Others translate it a cock, or leopard of good liones, or an he-goat; [who goeth very proudly and stately with an exalted head (or an head lifted up) before his flock. The Grecian Empire, which subdued the Persian, is resembled to an he-goat, Dan.8.3, etc.] and a King, who is not to be resisted.
\p
\v 32 . If thou hast done foolishly, in lifting up thy self, [To wit, unto wrath, whereof mention is made in the following verse, which dependeth on this verse] and if thou hast thought evil; (lay) thine hand upon (thy) mouth. [that is, turn thy self and take heed of speaking, much less of doing the evil which thou intendest, and excuse not thy former wrath, see Job 21.on v.5.]
\p
\v 33 . For the pressing of milk [That is, the churning of milk] bringeth forth butter; and the pressing of the nose [that is, the hard blowing of the nose] bringeth forth blood; and the pressing of wrath [that is, the kindling of wrath; to wit, as well his, that by wrath provoketh another unto wrath, as his, that is provoked unto wrath] bringeth forth strife.
\c 31
\s Lemuels lesson concerning the modesty and sobriety of Kings, v.1, etc. Of comforting and assisting those that are grieved and afflicted, 6, etc. The praise and properities of a virtuous wife, 10 etc.
\p
\v 1 . The words of King Lemuel, [That is, the words which were given unto this King for an instruction, and by him embraced, recorded, and thus left unto all men for them use and edification. This Lemuel is also called Lemuel, below v.4. Which word signifieth as much as unto, or before God; that is, he that belongeth unto God, on is dedicated unto him. The common opinion is, that by this man is meant King Salomon himself, who is also called Jedidja, that is, the beloved of the Lord. See 2 Sam.25. and the annotate.] the burden, [see above chap.30.on v.1.] whereby his Mother [namely, Bethseba, of whom see 2 Sam.11.3. 1 Kings 1.11. and chap.2.13. etc.] instructed him. [to wit, before he was crowned King, or presently after.]
\p
\v 2 . What O my son? And what, O son of my womb? And what, o son of my vow? [These are the words of his Mothers instruction, as if she had said, what (shall I say) ? or how shall the thing be, o my son? I must needs teach and instruct thee in that, which I count to be most needful and necessary for thee. Son of my womb. Compare Isa.49.15. So are children also called in respect of their Father, Job 19.15. So likewise the fruit of the womb; to wit, of their parents, Deut.28.4. 18,53. Son of my vows; that is, for whom I made so many vows unto the Lord, (which I have also performed) to wit, that thou mightiest come to the crown and Kingdom, and therein quit thy self so, as becometh a godly and religious King to do.]
\p
\v 3 . Give not thy strength [That is, the powers and faculties of thy soul and body, together with thy temporal estate. Compare above chap.5.9,10.] unto women; [compare Deut.17.17.] nor thy ways, [that is, thy inclinations, dealing and works] to destroy Kings. [that is, presumptuously and without cause, to conquer the lands and cities of Kings, making war against them out of meer arrogancy, pride and covetousness. Oth.give not thy affections unto women, which tendeth to destroy Kings; that is, utterly to consume them, and to cause them to perish.]
\p
\v 4 . It is not for Kings, O Lemoel, it is not meet for Kings to drink wine; [To wit, inconsiderately. Oth. Be it far from Kings, &c. To drink wine, &c.] and for Princes to desire strong drink. [or, nor Princes strong drink, or, and (to enquire) where strong drink is.
\p
\v 5 . Lest he [To wit, every one of the Kings and Princes] drink, and forget the statute [the Hebrew word signifieth that which is not only once ordained and established, to be kept as a Law; but which is also for such an end and purpose ingraved, carved and written in stone, copper or any other material, according to which the Judges sentence must at all times be formed and framed] and alter the judgement of all afflicted ones. [Heb. Children of affliction; that is, afflicted men. So children of death, Psa.79.1. for men appointed unto death; children of alteration, or of ruine, or destruction, v.8. children of the captivity, Eph.4.1. for men that had been carried away captive: children of the curse, 2 Pet.2.14. for cursed men.]
\p
\v 6 . Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish: [That is, that pineth and melteth away, and (as it were) consumeth away to nothing, by reason of some grief, wherein he is plunged. Compare Deut.26.5.] and wine unto those, that are bitterly grieved in soul; [Heb. That are bitter in soul; that is, that are bitterly grieved in their heart. See 2 Kings 4.on v.27.]
\p
\v 7 . Let him drink, [To wit, he that perisheth and is bitter in soul. Here is a change or alteration of the number. Compare Job 24.on v.8.] and forget his poverty; and remember his trouble no more.
\p
\v 8 . Open thy mouth [So in the next verse, see Job 33.on v.2.] for the dumb; [that is, for him that is not able to speak for himself by reason of his unfitness and impediment in his speech; or date not speak, through fear of his potent adversary] for the cause of all that are about to perish. [Hebr. Children of alteration, or of destruction; that is, that are in danger of suffering wrongfully some hurtful change or alteration, that is, great damage in their estates, body or credit, yea which might tend to their utter undoing. Oth. Of all the children of else but as it were a throw-fare, and stepping over, or passage unto death.]
\p
\v 9 . Open thy mouth, judge righteously: [Heb. Judge righteousness; that is, righteously or rightly, so Deut.1.16. Oth.in or with righteousness, as this full and entire phrase is found, Lev.19.15. Psa.9.9.] and do justice to the afflicted and needy.
\p
\v 10 . Aleph. Who shall find a virtuous wife? [This praise and declaration of the vertues of a prudent and diligent Mother of a family, is here placed, and set down in the first letters of every verse, according to the order of the Hebrew ALPHABET: and therefore the names of the names of the letters are put if the beginning of the verse. See Psa.25.on v.1. Heb. A wife of virtue, or piety, or valour. So Ruth 3.11. see Gen.47.6. the annotate. On the word valiant, compare above chap.12.4.] for her value is far above Rubies. [of Rubies see Job 28.18. and the annotate.]
\p
\v 11 . Beth. The heart of her Lord [That is, of her husband. See 2 Sam.11.26. and the annotate.] trusteth in her, so that no good (thing) shall be wanting unto him. [the Hebrew word Selah, (rendered here good) siginfieth properly spoil, or prey; that is, all moveable goods, which in time of war are spoiled, or taken away from the Enemy: but understand here by way of comparison, or similitude, all kind of Goods, that are gained and gotten by labour or trading. Compare herewith below v.15. the signification of the word tereph, meat, or food.]
\p
\v 12 . Gimel. She doth him good, and not evil, all the days of her life, [Or, she rewardeth good unto him, &c. See of the Hebrew word 2 Chron.20.on v.11. Prov.11.on v.17. The idiom and property of the Hebrew tongue is, to repeat the same thing again with denial of the contrary, Psal.102.18. Luke 1.20. &c.]
\p
\v 13 . Daleth. She seeketh wool and flax, and worketh [The Hebrew word asah is elsewhere taken for working. See Gen.39.on v.30. Exod.31.4. Ruth 2.10. and the annotate. 2 Chron.2.7.] with delight of her hands. [so to the hands is ascribed refusing or dislike and unwillingness, above chap.21.25.]
\p
\v 14 . He. She is like the merchants ships; [That is, like the merchant men; or the ships that go upon merchants affairs, and trade for merchandise] she causeth her bread [that is, whatsoever tendeth to the sustentation and preservation of this temporal life. Compare above chap.4.on v.17.] to come from a far. [that is, she provideth and furnisheth her self opportunity, not only of those things that are to be had there in the country where she liveth, but also of those that must be fetched and brought from far and remote places; for which she either payeth money, or wares made by her own folks.]
\p
\v 15 . Vau. And she riseth, when it is yet night, and giveth meat [The Hebrew word, Tereph, signifieth properly prey, or victual that is gotten by robbing or plundering, as Nuymb.23.24. Job.24.5. but it is also taken for other food or victual, as here, and Psa.111.5. Malach.3.10. as also the word hitriph, above, chap.30.8. is as much as feeding with ordinary food] to her house, [that is, to her household, see Gen.7.on v.1.] and the appointed portion [see Job 23.on v.8.] to her maidens.
\p
\v 16 . Zain. She thinketh of a field, [The word Zaman is for the most part taken in a bad sense, and for evil and wicked thoughts, as Deut.19.19. Psal.37.12. above chap.30.32, &c. But here it is taken in a good sense, for diligent, prudent, and pious thoughts. Compare Zach.8.15. So the word. Mezimmah, signifying thought, is taken likewise both in a good and in a bad sense. See, Job 21.on vers.27.] and getteth it [To wit, with an intention to raise yet more gain and profit thereby for her family. Compare above chap.24.27.] with the fruit of her hands [that is, with the gain and profit which she getteth by her handy-work, and trading] she planteth a vineyard.
\p
\v 17 . Cheth. She girdeth her loines with strength, [That is, she applieth her self with diligence and courage to the work, she goeth roundly to it, as we say, see Exod.12.on v.11.] and she strengtheneth her arms. [That is, she maketh her self ready for the work, or (as we use to say) she strips up her arms. Here mention is made especially of the loines and arms, because therein lieth the greatest strength that is requisite and needful for labour.]
\p
\v 18 . Teth. She tasteth, [That is, judgeth, conceiveth, findeth, and perceiveth. Understand this of the taste of heart. Compare Psal.34.on vers.9. and Job 12.on v.20.] that her merchandize is good: [that is, profitable, so Jerem.5.51. 1 Cor.7.1.] her lamp goeth not out by night. [to wit, because she useth it a long while in the night, or in night-time.]
\p
\v 19 . Jod. She putteth forth her hands to the spindle. [To wit, whereby she windeth or twisteth her threed or yarn. Oth. Where] and the palms of her hand take hold of the distaff. [to wit, to turn it by whiles, and to pull or draw her flax or wool off from it. It is conceived, that the old fashion or custome of spinning was not done with a wheel, but (as at this day, is yet much and frequently used) with a spindle and distaff.]
\p
\v 20 . Coph. She strenghteth out the palm of her hand to the miserable: (or poor) and she putteth forth her hands to the needy. [to wit, to help them; for she is diligent, not onely to provide for her own family, but also to communicate unto the poor.]
\p
\v 21 . Lamed. She feareth not for her house, [That is, household, so above, v.15. and straightway again in this same verse.] because of the snow: [understand hereby all manner of intemperance issuing from the air] for all her house is cloathed with double garments. [that is, with two suits of apparel. Oth. With scarlet, that is, not onely for necessity, to keep off the cold, but also for ornament to those that belong to the family of a great woman or Lady. Some understand by her house, none but her husband, and her children. Yet forasmuch as it seemeth, that scarlet was somewhat common in those countrys, 2. Sam.1.24. it is not incredible, but that some servants and waiting Gentle-women, pertaining to such great houses and families, might have worn such kind of apparel, and therefore (doubtless) were much more stored with other garments, to fence and protect them against the coldness and sharpness of the weather.]
\p
\v 22 . Mem. She maketh for her self Tapestry-ornament, [See above, chap.7.on v.16.] her clothing is fine linen [see Gen.41.on v.42.] and purple. [that is, a garment that is of a dark or deep red, or crimson colour.]
\p
\v 23 . Nun. Her husband is known in the gates; [That is, houses or places of judicature, see Gen.22.on v.17.] when he sitteth with the eldest of the land. [that is, the Rulers and Governors of the land, who are commonly chosen out of those that are old in years (at least old in wisdom and understanding) see 2 Kings 23.1.]
\p
\v 24 . Samech. She maketh fine linen cloth, [See here of Judge.14.on v.12.] and selleth it: and she delivered girdles [which served in war, to be thereby, as by a military token or badge, admitted to the use and practice of 20.8. and to make the members of the body ready, firm, and strong for any work or business, see Exod.12.on v.11. Eph.6.14. The girdle served also for an ornament to the body, Isa.3.on verse.24.] unto the merchant. [Hebr. Unto the Canaanite. See Job 40.on vers.25.]
\p
\v 25 . Ain. Strength, [That is, valour, courage, confidence in God, and undauntedness of spirit] and glory [that is, ornament of piety, and virtuous manners] are her clothing: [that is, she is therewith well stored and provided, and keepeth her self close thereunto as unto an ordinary and daily clothing or wearing apparel, compare Job 29.on vers.14.] and she laughteth at the day that is a coming. [that is, she is quiet, void of care, and without fear, in respect of the time to come, and that by reason of a good conscience, and the order which she hath made and taken in her housekeeping. Laughing is here taken, for being without fear, and for despising, see Job 5.on v.22.] at the day that is a coming. [meaning, the time to come, wherein she might be visited with adversity, want, or poverty. Others understand the time of old age, or the time of death, or the day of judgement that is to come.]
\p
\v 26 . Pe. She openeth her mouth with wisdom, and in her tongue is the doctrine of kindness. [That is, speech of desiring to do well unto all, and exhortation to provoke and stir up others thereunto.]
\p
\v 27 . Tsade. She beholdeth the goings of her house: [That is, how things go in her family, minding her children, her servants, the businesses and employements they are about, the moveables and household-stuff, as also the means and moneys that she is intrusted withal by her husband] and she eateth not the bread of idleness. [that is, the bread that is gotten without honest labour and taking of pains. Compare above, chap.4. on verse 17.]
\p
\v 28 . Koph. Her children [Or sons] rise up, [that is, are ready and prepared to praise and commend her; as they likewise do straightway perform it. So, to rise up, or to get ones self up, is as much as to fit and make one self ready for, or apply ones self to any business, Gen.37.35. Exod.2.17. Jos.18.4. 1 Sam.25.29, &c.] and pronounce her blessed: (also) her husband; [to wit, getteth him up] and he praiseth her; (saying)
\p
\v 29 . Resch. Many daughters [That is, many women, so, Genes.30.13. Luke 23.28.] have done virtuously; [to wit, in house-keeping, so is the word Chail taken, Ruth 3.11. and here above, verse 10.Oth. have done virtue, or, gathered riches] But thou excellest them all. [These and the former words of the verse, are the words of the verse, are the words of the husband and his sons.]
\p
\v 30 . Schin. Favour, [Meaning, outward comeliness, and grace, or handsomeness, which some women-kind might have in or about them. See, Nahum.3.4.] is deceit, [Hebr. A lie, or falsehood, to wit, because they are deceived that rely upon it, as upon a sure and lasting estate; and because oftentimes great and gross vices are hidden under it] and beauty (is) vanty; [That is, fading, and soon or easily vanishing, see Job 15.on verse 31.] (but) a woman that feareth the LORD, [or a woman of the fear of the Lord; that is, a woman that is indued with the fear of the Lord] she shall be praised.
\p
\v 31 . Tau. Give her of fruit [Of the word, fruit see above, chap.1.o verse 31.] of her hands: [that is, works. To give something in words, is to praise, or commend, Jerem.13.16. he intimateth by the forementioned words, that others should from the work of her hands take matter for to praise and commend her] and let her works praise her in the gates. [that is, in the public Congregations and Assemblies of the people, which were wont to be in the gates, where Judgement was kept, and Justice administered.]
