\toc2 Hosea
\s The argument of this book
\p The Prophet Hosea, (as Amos and others also) was especially sent by God unto the kingdom of Israel or the ten Tribes, (though in the mean time Judah is also frequently checkt by him) amongst whom, in testimony of Gods great long - suffering and faithfulness, he prophesied a long time, as appear by chapter 1.verse1. Whereof the holy ghost was pleased, to cause the sum or substance to be comprehended and set down in this book, for the use of his Church; containing first, certain prophetical Types or presentations, and sharp reproofs of the sinful and ruinous state and condition of the whole kingdom, but especially of the heinous idolatry with the golden calves set up among the time Rehabeam the son of Salomon, by their first usurping king Jerobeam the son of Nebat, when Israel first revolted from Juda, and the true worship of God 1King 12.27, 28,&c. Which soon after was followed with an abominable heathenish licentiousness, and overwhelming flood as it were, of all manner of sins and exorbitance, against both the first and second table, of Gods law, and that among all sorts and conditions of people, whom the prophet therefore most sharply reproveth, interweaving many, and those very pathetical exhortation and invitation unto timely and serious repentance. Never the less, in regard their wickedness and obstinacy, even from the kings, down to the meanest of the people, increased daily more and more, and prevailed against all remedies, they are threatened in the second place with the total devastation and destruction of their state and kingdom, and that they should be carried away captives into Assria, and remain a very long time in most desolate and forlorn condition, among the heathen Nations. In the third place the repenting and believing party are comforted with excellent promises of the grace and favour of God,. Their heavenly King the Lord JESUS CHRIST, unto whom all the Elect, not onely of Israel, but of the heathens also, should be converted, and in him be blessed and saved for ever.

\s The time when Hosia prophecied vers. 1 . at Gods command be typisieth or representeth Israels spiritual whosdom, and Gods judgments, by his marrying of Gomer, 2. and on her begetteth Jezreel., 4. Lo – ruchama 6. and Lo – ammi 8. nevertheless God promiseth a glorious restauration of his church by the Messiah, out of Jews and Gentiles.
\p
\v 1 The word of the LORD, which happened unto Hosea, [In the new Greek Testament he is called Osee. Rom. 9 .25. and t’is the same Name which Josua had once, Num.13.16. and the last King of Israel, 2. Kings.17.1,6.] the son of Beeri; in the days of Uzzija, Jothan, Achaz Hizkia, king of Juda: [hence it appeareth, that this prophet prophecied a very long time, anmely, at the least, according to the opinion of some, about.43. years:] and in the days of Jerobeam, Joas son, king of Israel the successors of this Jerobeam ( the son, not of Nebat, but of Joas, and the grand – child of Jehu) yet this king alone is here mentioned, as having reigned longest, viz.41.s together, whence also the divine Character of this prophecie appeareth, that it happened in such a time, whiles the Kingdom of the Tribes, was yet flourishing. See 2 Kings.14. and 15. and withal the histories of the reign of the fore mentioned kings of Jurda.2. Kings from chapter 15. to 21. and 2. Chron. From chapter 26. to 33. and compare Amos 1.1]
\p
\v 2 The beginning of the word [ Or, of the speaking, or, speech] of the LORD by Hosea: [i.e. when the LORD, first began to speak, with, by, and to Hosea, he spake this to him, and by him to the people. Oth. In Hosea (and so elsewhere also) the better to shew, that the thing spoken of in the sequel, did not happen actually, but was revelaed by God unto the prophet in a Vision only, inwardly in the spirit, by way of a parable or multitude, and afterward made out unto the people, as a Propheticall vision; see of the like, Gen.15. 1. and compare bel. chap.3.1. also Ezech.4.3. and 8,8. and 11.24,25,&c.] The LORD then said unto Hosea; Goe to, take thee a wife of whoredoms, [i.e. wholly given up to whoredome. Compare this phrase with Psal.5. on vers.6] etc children of whoredoms; [ the prophet being bid here to take a whore with her children, and it being said to him by and by, that he begat them on that whore, thence it appears yet plainer, that this happened not so in very deed.] for the land altogether goeth a whoring [Hebr. whoring whoreth, i.e. doth practise nothing else. See of spiritual whoredom, Levit, 17. on vers.7.] from after the LORD.[i.e. sothat the inbitants of the land do follow the Lord no more, but turn away from him, and run madly after idols. Compare be. Chap.4.12.]
\p
\v 3 So he went [All this was shewed to the prophet in a vision and afterward by him represented to the people, (as was noted before. V. 2.) fetting this plain looking glass, or lively pourtraict of their wickedness, mentioned in the former verse, before their eyes] and took Gomer [as Gomer in the Hebrew tongue sometimes signifieth fullness or perfection, and sometimes consumption; so God had shewed abundance of good unto this people, but they wasted and consumed it all, and themselves too, by Idolatry and other excesses of sin wherefore they were likewise at last to be confirmed by God judgment] a daughter of Diablaim: [this some take to be mans name, others, the place of the womans nativity. The word doth signifie two lumps of figs, whereby may be implied the wantonnels, lustfulness, and lasciviousness of the people . Some conceive that this name hath respect to the wilderness of Dibla, mentioned Ezek.6.14. (See the note there) to hold forth the mercie, which God had shewed to his people, leding them through the wilderness Canaan, (compare Ezek.16.5,7. Cant. 3. 6 .) Numb. 33. 46. we read of Diblathaim. See further, Jere.2. 2,6.) and she conceived, and bare him a son.
\p
\v 4 And the LORD said to him; [ viz. Hosea] call his name Jezreel: [this name must be distinguished from Israel: nd it hath regard to the place Jezreel. See the Sequel, and further chapter 2. 21,22. with the annot.] for yet a little (time) I shall visit [viz. by punishments, see Gen.21. on vers.1.] the blood guiltiness of Jezreel? [Heb. Bloods in plural, i.c. bloodguiltiness, killing, murtherings; (see Gen.37, on vers.26.) which are layd up and practiced there] upon the house of Jehu, [who had shed much blood in the valley of jezreel, at the command of the LORD, but not of an upright heart, to root out achabs idolatrie, as God had commanded him, but for the kingdoms sake, it being expressly said of him, 2 Kings. 10. 28, 29,31 that he clave to the idolatry of Jerobeam, and walked not in the law of the LORD, with all his heart. Therefore doth God look no otherwise upon him then upon a murtherer. Compare the example of Baesa 1. King. 15., 29. and 16.7. who destroyed likewise the house of Jerobeam, according to the word of God, but not with an honest heart] and shall make the kingdom the house of Israel to cease,
\p
\v 5 And it shall come to pas in that day, that I shall break the bowe of Israel, [i.e. discomfit the power of their ordinary or their militarie forces. Compare Psal. 78.9. and consequently Israel shall become a prey unto their enemies. See 2. Sam.1 18. Jer. 49. 35. with the annot.] in the valley ef Jezreel. [of this valley see Judg.6. on vers. 33. it should seem that Israel had a great overthrow there given them by Salmanasser. See 2. Kings. 17. 4, etc. Other for the valley of Jezreel i.e. for or, by reason of the murthers therein committed.]
\v 6 And the conceived again, and bire a daughter, and he said unto him, [viz. the LORD to Hosea] call her name Lo – Ruchama: [i.e. not puttied] for I shall have no more pitty henceforth upon the house of Israel, but I will surely carry them away. [Heb. Carrying away, (or, taking up) carry the away i.c. take them up, and carry them away. Compare bel. Chap.5. 14. these words are variously rendred by interpreters, in regard of the different significations of the Hebrew verb her, taken not only for taking up, taking, or, carrying away; but also for forgiving, pardoning. See Psal. 25. on vers. 18. Isa. 2. 9 This was fulfilled first, by Tiglath Pilefer, and afterwards by Salmanasser, kings of Assyria.]
\p
\v 7 But upon the house of Juda I will have mercy [ i.e. upon my own church or people especially typified here by Judah, as having the true worship of God, and not by Israel, who had forsaken the true worship of God : wherefore also it Is sais in the sequel, the LORD their God; compare bel. V. 9 and ch.12.1 otherwise Juda and Israel ( together representing the catholick church of Jews and Gentiles) are joined together. See bel. Verl. 11, &c. also chapter 3. 5.] and will deliver them through the LORD their God, [i.e. through mine eternal onely begotten son Jesus Christ, whom I have ordained a Saviour, Redeemer, Deliverer, Head and King of his people. Compare Gen.19 on vers. 24. and Isa 10. 27. Jer. 23. 4, 5, &c. Oth. Through the LORD their God i.e. through my own self, I shall doe and accomplish it my self, to wit, bodily, by delivering them out of Babel, and spiritually by the Messiah, out of the captivity of Stan, &c.] and I will deliver them, not by the bowe, nor by the sword, nor by warre, nor by horses, nor by horse – man. [like as the deliverance of Juda, out of the Babylonian Captivity, shall be ordered and bought about through my special grace and providence, and not by any humane power, so shall the deliverance through Christ, be altogether a heavenly and spiritual salvation; for which they shall have cause to thank none but my self. Compare Mich.5. 10. with the annot. Some do likewise interpret it of the wonderful Providenceof God whereby he delivered Juda from the two Kings, Pekah, of Israel and Bazin of Syria. See Isa.7. 1. &c., 2 King.15.29.30. & 16.9.]
\p
\v 8 Now when she had weaned Lo – ruchamd, she conceived and bare a son.
\p
\v 9 And he [viz. the LORD] said, call his name Lo- ammi; for ye are not my people, so (also) shall not be yours.[I.e. I shall not be your God, as some fill up this viz. according to the expression used elsewhere. Compare ab. Vers. 7. with the annot. And see Gen.17. on vers.7. and Deut. 7. on vers. 6. By the birth of these 3. children here some conceive there is held out a threefold state and condition of the people and deeper plunged in fin, and visited according with heaver Judgments]
\p
\v 10 Nevertheless the number of the children of Israel, [To whome namely I shall show mercie] shall be as the sand of the sea that cannot be measured nor numbered: and and it shall come to pass, that where it shall have been said unto them, ye are not my people, it shall said unto them; ye are the children of the living God. [here God speaketh of the work of Grace, which he intended to show unto his people in the time of the new – testament, to wit, to Jews and Gentiles, the Israel of God. See Rom.9 24.,26 Gal. 3. 28,29. and 6. 16. for the carnal Israel as well as the heathen, were now no more the people of God, and therefore could not be otherwise, then by meer and free grace, which God here doth promise to them both.]
\p
\v 11 And the children of Juda and the children of Israel shall gather together, and appoint themselves one onely head, and march up out of the Land: [viz. of their bodily captivity first, but principally out of the spiritual be taking themselves to the church of God. Through some doe partly understand this of deliverance out of the Babylonian captivity, when as the scattered and remaining godly Israelites being almost reduced to nothing, all the miseries they had endured, would doubtless be very glad to joyn themselves to the Jews returning out of their captivity; nevertheless it principally regardeth the congregation or communion of the church of the new testament of Jews, and gentiles, under one head Jesus Christ, through faith and true conversion. Compare Jer.23 ,6; etc.] for the day of Jezreel shall be great. [or, because of the day of Jezreel shall have been great understand the overthrow and destruction of Israel there, whereof above vers. 5. the meaning is, that this judgement of God, and all the succeeding punishment, should be great means and moving to them thereunto. Some doe understand by the day of Jezreel, the day of Israels deliverance, which should be glorious, in opposition to the day of their overthrow there, and therefore likewise called Jezreels day i.e. Israels, compare bel. Chap.2,21. This exposition agrees well with the matter fore – going. Thus ones day in scripture is called that time wherein by Gods appointment some special good or evil betides him.]
\p
\v 12 Say to your brethren, [I,e. faithfull remnant of Israel say the Jews, and both of you together make it further known to the heathen, through one faith , joined together into one body,. Under one head, Jesus Christ; see Jer, 19. 23,24. Rom.9. 24,26. This verse some do joyn to the next chapter.] Ammi; [i.e. (o) my people. Compare above verse. 7,9. etc. 1 Pet. 2.10] and your fisters, [the faithfull women in Juda, and among the heathen] Ruchama. [i.e (o) pittied, compare above, vers.6.]
\c 2
\s God chargeth the faithfull remnant in Israel, to strive and contend with all the Rebellion company of their fellow – brethren, and set the judgement of God before their eyes, by reason of their abominable Idolatrie and unthankfulness. Ver.1. &c. after that, he promiseth to restore his church, and abundantly to bless the same in time of the Messiah, 14, &c.
\p
\v 1 Contend [Or plead strive, debate] with your mother, [i.e. the people of Israel, the common wealth of the ten tribes, or the synagogue of Israel, so bel. Vers. 4. and chapter 4.5. Compar Isa. 1. 50. &c. The sense is ye the godly prophets and faithful Israelites, which yet remain among the people, be admonished seriously and sharply to reprove the excessive wickednesse of the people, setting before their eyes, my fierce wrath and heavy judgement at hand] because she is not my wife, and I am not her husband: [i.e. she is not true and faithful to me, she doth not acknowledge me her husband; therefore I will not own her neither anymore, without she repent, as followeth; otherwise I shall proceed with her, as is set down verse 2.] and let her put away her whoresdoms from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts, [i.e. all those outward marks and to kens of her whorish and adulterous heart, such as are your painting of the face, and setting out or adorning of the breast, whereby is signified their notorious , shamelesse and uncontrolled idolatry. Compare Jer.4. 30. Ezek. 16. 11,17,18. and 23. 40, etc. and Prov.7.16.]
\p
\v 2 Left I do strip her naked, [Or cause her to be striped, unrayed, despoiled of her garments, i.e. dispossesse and bereave her of all bodily and spiritual ornaments, wherewith I had so gloriously adorn’d her. See Ezek.16.10, 11, 12, 13,. And 23. 26. ] and put her as in the day she was born: [i.e. when I first took them to be my people, in the land of Egypt, form under the grievous bondage they were in] yea, make them as desert, [i.e. far worse in condition then they were in Egypt,] and set [or place] them as dry land,[Heb. Land of drought, or thirstiness] and put them to death, through thirst; [viz. by my righteous judgements. Compare Ezek. 16. 4. etc. Amos 8. 11, 13.]
\p
\v 3 And have no pity on their children:[ i.e. on the people of Israel ] because they are children of whoredom, [i.e. unregenerate, polluted, unholy, (compare Job. 8. 44.) as begotten illegitimate, and in an idolatrous wedlock, the mother being become an adultresse, and unfaithful to me, as followeth.]
\p
\v 4 For their mother playeth the whore, she that conceived them, dealeth shamefully: so she saith, I will go after my lovers, [i.e. idols, and consequently idolatrous nations with whom I thrive and prosper as folleth. See Deut. 8. 12, 19. Jer. 44. 17.] that give me (my) bread and water, my wooll and my flax, mine oil and my drink. [Heb. My drinks, or, drinkings]
\p
\v 5 Therefore behold, I will fence way with thrones and I will make a close wall, [Heb. As if one should say, wall up walls] that they shall not finde their paths. [i.e. I shall so trouble and distresse them on all sides, that they shall begin to loath and be glad to leave their whoring, compare Job 3. 23. and 10.8. Lam.3.7,9. also Ezek.16.41. and 23.22, 23, 24.]
\p
\v 6 And he shall run after her lovers, [Obstinately attempting to break through all the foresaid implediments] but not to meet them: and she shall seek, but not to finde them: she will say: I will go now and turn again to my former husband; [i.e. to the LORD] for then better with me than now.
\p
\v 7 Yet she confesseth not [Or knoweth acknowledgeth not, know nor acknowledge it; it is a willful ignorance of hers; or she takes it not to heart] that I gave her corn, and the wine and the oil, [i.e. all manner of blessings] and multiplied her silver and gold (which) they used for Baal. [or, whereof they made Baal, Heb. Done, made, prepared. God implying here, that they had shamefully abused the good gifts of God unto idolatry. Of Baal, see Jud. 2. on verse. 11, &c. Compare Ezek. 7.20. and 16, 17, 18, 19 and below chap.8. 4. and 12.2.
\p
\v 8 Therefore I will return and take away my corn, [Compare Ezek 16. verse 17, 18, 19. with the annot.] in its time, and my new wine in its set time, [i.e. when I promised and used to give it: or in time of harvest and vintage when it is ripe, and you are ready to gather it] and I will pluck away my wooll and flax, [i.e. I will deprive them of it, as if the LORD should say, it is very ill bestowed on them, they are not worthy of it, therefore I will rescue it out of the hand of such abusers that possesse it wrongly it wrongfully] (serving) to cover their nakednesse.
\p
\v 9 And now will i discover er folly [or, basenesse, See Gen. 34. on verse.7. and Jer. 13. on verse 22. Ezek. 16. on verse 36,37.] before the yes of her lover: and none shall deliver them out of mine hand.
\p
\v 10 And i will cause to cease all her mirth, her feasts, her new moons and her sabbaths; yet all her set high-times. [Heb. feast, new moon, sabbath, set high-times, i.e. they shall have no outward form more left them of divine worship, as bel. chapter 3.4. and consequently, no joy nor comfort in the keeping of their feasts or festivals.]
\p
\v 11 And i will lay waste her vineyard and her fig – tree, whereof she saith; these are to me a harlots – wages, [i.e. the reward of my idolatry, compare bel.9.1. with the annotat.] which my lover [i.e. the idols, Baals, &c.]hhave given me: but shall set them for a wood, and the wilde beasts of the field shall devour them. [Psal. 80.13. Isa 5.5.]
\p
\v 12 And i will visit upon her dayes of Baal, [i.e. i will punish her for her maniford and so long continued idolatry] wherein she burnt incense to the same, [or to whom she burnt incense, i.e. used to burn incense; or for having burnt incense to him.] and adorned her self with her frontlets, [or ear- rings. See Gen. 24. on verse 22.] and her neck – lace, [or jewels, ornaments, precious neck-chains, etc. See Prov. 25. 12. Cent. 7.1. The meaning here is, that as whores do trim and adorn themselves before their lovers, so did Israel brave it in her idolatry. Compare above verse. 1.] and went after her lovers, but forgot me, speaketh the LORD.
\p
\v 13 Therefore,[ viz. least she should utterly perish, and be undone for ever, which would happen, if i did not prevent it with my mercy, humbling her first by my judgements, and afterward , by the preaching of the holy Gospel, raising her up again, and by mine holy spirit, powerfully instructing and comforting her. compare Jer.16. 14. Mich. 2. 12,13, &c.] behold i will allure her [or perswade her; this hath regard to the acceptable preaching of then Gospel , and the perswading of the elect to faith and repantance: See of the Hebrew word, Judg.14. on verse 15. and Jer. 20. on verse 7. and compare Mat. 3. 3,5,6,11, &c. and chapter 11.28. and Isa 50.4, &c.] and i will lead her into the wilderness; and i will speak to her according to her heart.[ i.e. friendly, kindely, comfortable. See Gen. 34. on verse 3. The sence of this latter part of the verse, seemeth to be this; i will first punish, and afterwards comfort them again; wherefore also some read the text thus, when i shall have made her walk in the wildernesse: according as God also former times, according as God also in former times, first led them into the wildernesse, and afterwards into the land of Canaan.]
\p
\v 14 And i will give her vineyards [These are spiritual promises of the covenant of grace, grounded upon the onely Redeemer, Mediatour and Messia, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, in whom through faith, of meer grace, we have peace with God, a quiet conscience, and a sure refuge, a saving protection, abundance of all spiritual gifts, together with an abiding comfort, and summarily, the assured grace of this life, and the eternal glory of that to come; this is the substance of the following verse of this chapter. Set forth under the notions of temporal promises, according to the stile of the Old Testament, appertaining to the universal Church of Jews and Gentiles. compare Isa. 65. 9. and bel. chapter 12.10.] from thence [viz. from that wildernesse having past it through, i.e. when her former afflictions shall be ended; as formerly also, they came not to the border of Canaan, until they were quite past through the wilderness etc] and the valley of Achor: [ of this valley see Jos.7. 24, 26. It lay right before in the land of promise, by the city of Jericho; and this was a door of hope, or expectation, that, God having, by Joshua, brought his people thus far, he would doubtlesse go on to accomplish his promise, and bring them to full possession of Canaan; as also the faithfull in this valley of mirsery and tribulation here, have though the grace of Christ, a beginning of everlasting life in them, and a door of hope, yea a living hope, of the faithfull possession of everlasting glory to come. See Heb 6.18,19,20 etc and compare Isa 65.10.] and there she shall sing, as in the dayes of her youth, and as at the day of her marching forth of the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 15 And it shall come to pass in that day, speaketh the LORD, that thou shalt call me, my husband, and shall no more call me, my Baal. [As meaning my further to honor God through Baal. Compare Exod.3.4,5. and Judg 2. on vers.11. The word Baal indeed doth signifie Lord and master; but in regard they were wont to give that appellation to the appellation to the idols, after them manner of the heathen, therefore God abhors that title.] b
\p
\v 16 And i will put away the names of the Baals from her mouth: and they [viz. the Baals] shall no more be remembered by their names. [i.e. my church shall be cleaned from all pollution of idolatry and superstition.]
\p
\v 17 And i will in that day make covenant for them, [i.e. in their behalf] with the wilde beasts of the field, and with the fowl of heaven, and with the creeping creatures of the earth: and i will break the bow, and the sword, and the war; [i.e. all manner of arms and instruments of war and hostility. Compare Isa. 11. 9. Mich. 5. 10, etc.] and will cause them to lie down [i.e. take rest, and sleep. See Psalm.3 . on verse. 6.] in safety.
\p
\v 18 And i will betroth my self unto thee for ever: [Compare Eph.5.25., etc. where the Apostle sheweth forth the mystery of this spiritual marriage, so often recorded in the scriptures. See moreover the song of Salomon] yea, i will betroth my self unto thee in [or, with, through, and soon.] righteousness, and in judgement, and in kindness, and in compassions.[ i.e, righteousness and mercy shall kindely meet and kiss each other in work of Grace; let the devout reader compare these termes with Psal.85. 10, to 15. Isa. 1. 27. and 45.8, 23, 24, etc.]
\p
\v 19 And i will betroth my self unto thee [Observe, that this gracious promise is repeated three times in this and the former verse, for our further comfort and assurance] in faith: [or, faithfullness] and shalt know the LORD.
\p
\v 20 And it shall come to pass in that day i shall hear, speaketh the LORD: i will hear the heaven: and the same shall hear the earth. [ figurative expressions, whereby God would make it known, that all creatures would serve his church unto salvation, when he is reconciled and at peace with her Compare Rom.8. 20, 21,22,28.]
\p
\v 21 And the earth shall hear the corn, together with the new wine, and the oyl: and they shall hear Jezreel. [i.e. Gods people is so called, not onely for having lived and suffered there (as above chapter 1.5.) but especially in regard of this name Jezreel, signifying the sowed ones or the seed of God, which the next verse hints, i.e. the church of God, especially that of new Testament; See Rom. 9.24, 25, etc.]
\p
\v 22 And i will sow me them on the earth [ See Math. 13.1.1	Pet.1.23. and Psal. 22. on verse. 31, etc. Jer. 31. 27.] and will have mercy upon Lo – ruchama [i.e. the un – pitted as above chapter 1, vers 6.] and i will say to Lo-ammi, [i.e. no people of mine. above chap 1.9] thou [Hebr Ammi atta that is, my people thou or, thou art my people] and the same [viz people] shall say, O my God:[Or (or thou art) my God. Compare Zach. 13.9.]
\c 3
\s By the marrying and long tarrying of an Adulteresse, God commands the Prophet to set before the eyes of the Israelites, their long – lasting desolate condition to come, whereupon should follow at length their conversion unto Christ.
\p
\v 1 An the LORD said to one, [viz. in a vision, compare ab. chapter 1. on verse 2,3.] Go again now , love a women, which being beloved of (her) friend, [i.e. by her own husband] nevertheless commiteth adultery; according as the LORD doth love the children of Israel, [Heb. according to the love of the LORD, wherewith he loveth, etc. as elsewhere] but they do look about after other Gods, and love the other bottles of the grapes [i.e. the wine bottles whereby God checks them for the drunkennes that was so common among them in the feasts which they made for the honour of their idols, according to the customs of the heathens with all manner of excess, dunkenesse and jollity . See bel. chap 4.18. By this vision God did represent unto the ten tribes , the great love which he bare shewed them still, and on the contrary their unfaithfulness and ingratitude, which they shewed forth by their shameless spiritual adultery of idolatry here discribed.]
\p
\v 2 And i bought (her) for me for fifteen silver rings; [See Gen.20. on verse. 16. just half the sum which Judas got for betraying of Christ; also half the price of a man – servant, or maid – servant hurt by an ox. Exod. 21. 23. and of the redemtion of a female Levit. 27. 4 and consequently but a mean and low price] an an homer, [otherwise also called a Cor., see 1 Kings 4. on verse 22.] of barley [ which maybe a token that was to live by barley bread, i.e. to change her pleasant and luxurious estate into a sober one; as also she was bought but at a mean rate, which may have implied the unworthiness and despicableness of Israel, when God first bought and redeemed them for him self.] and half an homer of barley.
\p
\v 3 And i said unto her, Thou shalt tarry for me; [waiting till i marry thee , (compare Deut. 21. 11 and the phrase Ex.24 14 also Ruth. 3. 18) in the mean time; i shall make trial of thy repentance in lowly condition.] many dayes,[ i.e. for a long time.] thou shalt not play the whore, nor became (another) mans ; and i also for thee. [i.e. i do like wise promise my throth to thee, and will stay for thee as long; see the explaining hereof in the sequel. These abrupt speeches are reason of their obscurity, variously compleated and interpreted: the plainest sence is in the text it self. Compare Isa.30. 18]
\p
\v 4 For the children of Israel shall tarry many dayes [ to wit, after the Salmanasser should carry away the ten tribes (represented by this adulterous women) out of their land into to Assyria, and scatter them thence into various countries; until the time of their conversion, as is explained in the following verse. This time of conversion, some determine with the coming of Christ and the preaching of the Gospel of the Apostles: others applie it to the succeeding and present estate and condition, of all the people of the Jews until the time of their last and finall conversion, out of Rom. 11. 25. The one dothh not exclude the other,[ withh out King, and without Prince [viz. from among other brethren.] and without offring etc without (a) reared image, [ such as were the golden calves at Dan. and Bethel, and the Baals.] and without Ephod . [See of the Eph. Exo. 28. on verse. 6. Jerobeam doubtless ordained together with his new Priests, new Priestly garments also, for to keep the people from going up to Jerusalem. See idolatrous . Ephods made without Gods order and institution, Jud.17, 5.&c.] and Teraphim [which they had, according to the manner of the heathen, for to inquire of God by them. See Gen.31. on verse. 29. Eze. 31. 21. Zach. 10. 2. The meaning of all is, that they should be for a long without any form of either civil government and Common – wealth or publike solemn worship true or false, as also it is, and continueth with them to this day, wheresoever they remain scattered thorowout the world.]
\p
\v 5 After that the children of Israel shall covert themselves, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king: [viz. the LORD Jesus Christ their Messia, called David, as whole son he was to be according to the flesh, and whom David typisied, See Jer. 30.9. Eze.34. 23. and 37. 24.] and they shall come to the LORD, fearing, [Heb, they fear to God i.e. come or draw with fear, in acknowledgement of their own unworthiness] and to his goodness . [being amazed at the marvellous great goodness of God to be exhibited them in the Gospel; and full of care and circumspection , how to take timely notice of this time of grace, and to make a right use of it. Compare below Chap 11. 10, 11. Mich.7 17. also Isa. 13 .3.] in the last days. [i.e. after a very long time, in the New Testament, after the coming of Jesus Christ: for this phrase doth not look justly upon the very last time of all, before the consummation of the world . See Gen.49. 1. Isa.2.2. Mich. 4. 1. Heb.1.1. etc. With the annotat. there.]
\c 4
\s God doth vehementaly and threaten Israel, by reason of the general wickedness and stiffneckedness of the people Priests and Prophets, vers.1. etc especially their abominable uncontrolled spiritual and bodily whoredoms, 11.Waringing Juda, not to follow the example of Israel, and foretelling the destruction that hung their head, 15.
\p
\v 1 Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD huth a controverse [Or, Plea, procels, not onely verbal but real; i.e. Judgements and punishments, readie to be executed, as appears ver. 2.3. see above cha 2.2 and 1 Samuel Ch. 25, v 38, 39 Amos 7.4] with the inhabitants of Land; because there is no faithfulness [Or, truth] nor any kindness, or any knowledge of God in the Land. [God implieth that they are stark nought in words and works, making it out plain enough thereby, that they knew him not aright, viz, by a saving knowledge, grounded on his word, and accompanied with Faith and the Love of God and their neighbour. Compare Jr. 9. 24. and 23. 16. and 31. 34. I John 2.4. etc]
\p
\v 2 (But ) cursing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adulterie: they break through [ Oth, cursing, and lying and killing, and stealing, etc. break through; they do prevail like land floods, violently breaking in; or like fierce enemies forcing the walls and entering the breaches pelmell; for thus did they with all manner of fins and abominations, daringly break through without any fear or awe of God Laws and ordinances: of an other use of the Hebrew word, see below ver. 10.] and blood – guiltinesses touch blood guiltinesses. [Heb. Bloods touch bloods i.e. one murther or blood – shed followers in the neck of another See above chapter 1. on vers.4.]
\p
\v 3 therefore the land shall mourn, [for the sinful abominations of the inhabitants ; to let their own deserts the more sensibility before their eyes, the whole land, and all that is must suffer; and so occures frequently in the Prophets.] every one is in it fainteth, [ or, languisheth, droopeth, pineth away] with beasts of the field, and with the fowls of the heaven; yea the fishes of the sea also shall be raked away. [Hebr. properly, gathered. I.e. they shall die, perish, be consumed, and raked together to be cast away like carrion. See of the Heb. Word Psal.26. on vers. 9.]
\p
\v 4 Yet let more contend, nor prove any: [As if the people said; let anyone dare to controul and find fault with our practise; God brins in the very word here, which the people would make use of; foretelling the Prophet, what he and the others faithful men of God were to expect at the hands of godless governours, false Prophets and Idolatrous Priests, with their adherents Generalities, thus namely; Their preaching of repentance, and reproving of sin, would be forbidden and silences; and those that should offer to find fault with their action, should be sure to be called in question, and be punished, as troublesome companions and raisers of seditions] for thy people [viz. the people O Hosea, with whom thou hast to do.] is as those, that contend with the Priests: like unto those, which, without any respect and with a great deal of insolence grow troublesome and hath to such, as on God behalf and by vertueof their charge and office are bound to reprove sin, and whose reprehensions aud admonition the people ought reverently to accept of. Compare Deut. 17.12,]
\p
\v 5 Therefore shalt thou [i.e. every one of you, that are thus backsliding and refractorie] fall [i.e. miscarry, come to ruin and perish. Compare below chapter 5.5. and chapter 14 2.] by day, yea the Prophet himself [ understand the false seducing Prophets, who by promise of peace, animated and hardened the people in their wicked courses] shall fall with thee by night: [ by the words in the verse, by day, by night, one may understand the continual and still successive evils to come, which should follow and take hold one of another; as day and night without any ceasing, or intermission. Oth. to day or this day. i.e. within a short time, very soon, or suddenly. Compare Prov. 12. 16. Or, thou shall fall while it is day yet i.e. when thou shalt conceive thy self in a flourishing estate, void of fear, and free of danger. Compare Jer. 15.9. Amos 8.9 with the annot. And the false Prophets that sediuce thee shall fall by night. Or, in the night. i.e being in darkness, ignorance, without vision, or knowledge of the evil that shall surprise both you and them, when they least think of it, promising themselves and you nothing but peace and welfare Compare Mich. 3.5, 6, 7. some are opinion, that this hath regard to the visions, which the Prophets were wont to receive of God in the night time Gen. 46. 2. Zach. 2.8 and that the false Prophets, falsely boasting of the like, are said to fall in the night] and I will root out thy mother. [i.e. the kingdom of ten Tribes, the people of Israel, or their Church, Synagogue, as above chap.2.1.]
\p
\v 6 My people is destroyed, [i.e. it shall surely be destroyed, Heb. My people are destroyed or, destroying,] being without knowledge [as above ver.1. Compare Isa.5.13.] because thou hast rejected knowledge I have rejected thee also, that thou shalt not administer the Priests office unto me . [the speech is addressed here, to the Idolatrous Priests and other Ecclesiastical person, who ought to have instructed the people in the true pure doctrine. See Deut.33. 10. Malach. 2. 7.]because thou hast forgot the Law of thy God, therefore will I laso forget thy children. [as God remembering for good, doth signifie his favour and blessing, so here his forgetting, implieth his displeasure and desertion whereby he lets men go without his blessing, and giveth them up to all manner of miserie and mischief.]
\p
\v 7 According as they waxed greater ,[ Heb. According, or, after their increase, or, greatness]so have they sinned against me. [ i.e. the more they advance and increased in number, multitude, honour and greatness (especially, being become a peculiar kingdom, and having set up a new self devised priesthood) which the following words seem to have an eye to, principally the Priesthood (whereof in the next verse) the more unthankful they grew to me, and the more abominations they committed against me. Compare the phrase below cha. 11.2.] I will change their [viz. both Kingly and Priestly] honour into shame.
\p
\v 8 They [viz. the Preasts] eat the sin of my people, [i.e. the sin offering. See Levit.4. on verse. 3. The sence is, their aim is not, that the people might be instructed concerning sin - offering and consequently sins, and their demerits, concerning the Messiah and true justification, and how their offering may become pleasing and acceptable to God; but onely how they may get enough to live and spend, glut and feast on] and long every one with his soul, after their unrighteousness.[Hebr. they lift up his soul &c. i.e. every one lifted his soul, that is desereth and longeth for it with all his heart , that the people should sin much, and consequently bring in abundance of sin – offering, that he may the better cram and fatten himself with it; the more the people sin, the more, the Priests think, it makes for them; as the Prophet implieth. See the Heb. Phrase. 24.4.]
\p
\v 9 Therefore, according as the people, so shall the priest be[Or the Governor, or both together, these viz. that are the chiefest in the Church and State. See of the Hebrew word. Gen.41. on v 45. The meaning is; since the one is not better then the other, therefore the one shall fare no better then the other; they shall all share alike, and be involved in one and the same punishment. See Isa.24.2. Mat.15.14.] and I will visit his way upon him, and recompense him his dealings. [i.e. punish the Priests course and practise. See Gen. 6. on vers. 12. and 21. on vers.1. Or, his, that is, very ones of them.]
\p
\v 10 And they shall eat, but not be satisfied, commit whoredom, but not break forth (in multitude) [i.e. they shall not be multiplied. See of the Heb. Word Gen .26. on vers.14. and 30. 30. also Job 1.10. with the annotat.] for they have forborn to take notice of the LORD. [viz. neglecting and not observing the ways of the LORD, and having him no more before their eyes.]
\p
\v 11 Whoredom and wine, and new wine take away the heart, [Heb. Shall, or will take, in the singular, i.e. each or either of these (viz. whoredom or drunkenness) doth bereave a man of his understanding and judgement, and make him consequently so mad and foolish, that he doth, as followeth. See Isa.28. 7. Pro.17.2. and Prov 9. on v 4.]
\p
\v 12 My people ask their wood, [i.e. wooden Idol, for councell, and how shall go with them in after – times, thanking the same shall be able to foretell it them.] and their stick [or staff; i.e. the Idol whereon they relie and repose themselves, as a man leanes upon and supports himself with a staff. Some understand here that wood, whereof the idol Baal was made, (See Deut. 28. ver.36.) some are of opinion it hath respect, to the manner of dividing or footh saying, by staff or rod, or, of those which take heed to the notice of flights of fowls, using to carry a stick or wand in their hand] shall make it known unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms [i.e. the Devil, called the unclean spirit , Zach.13. 2. Mat.12. 43. or their perverse minde, their corrupt inclination and disposedness to both spiritual and bodily fornication, whereunto the evil spirit of Devil doth incite and instigate them. see below chapter 5 4. Compare Rom .1.24, 28, etc doth seduce them, that they go whoring away from under their God. [Or, from istead of their God i.e. So, that refusing to submit themselves unto the God, as to their Lord and husband, or, to be subject to him, they run after the idols, with out any remorce or control; or, so that instead of the rule God they chuse and cleave unto strange gods. Compare above chap.1. 2,7 abnd Ezek. 23.5. with the annotat. These phrases are very remarkable, expressing and setting forth the nature and condition of Idolatry most lively.]
\p
\v 13 They offer upon the high places of the mountains, [According to the manner of the heathen; See Deut.12.2. with the annotat. There] and upon the hills they burn incense, under an oak, and poplar and Ivy – tree [or, elm – tree oth. lime – tree] their shallow being good: [i.e. very pleasing delightful, or also, causing some obscuritie by their thickenss, which served their idolatries and uncleanness. Compare Isa. 57. 5,7. Jer.36. Ezek.6,13. it being usual, that the spiritual whoredom draweth the bodily after it, by the just judgement of God. See Num.25. 1.2, etc Room.1.24. to his relateth the following inference in the Text] therefore do your daughter play the harlots, and your brides [Or, daughters in law] commit adulterie
\p
\v 14 I will make no visitation on your daughter, for their whoring, and your brides, for their committing adulterie; [i.e. I will go about now by punishments to restrain thm, but even let them go on in these abominations to their and your confusion and destruction, as some do take this, a sign of God highest displeasure. See Ps. 89. 32, 33, 34. and Ps. 94. 12, 13. Or else, I shall not so much and heavily punish the young daughters an brides, or the sons, young married wives, (compare below chapter 6.6. Jer. 7.22 and I Sam.15.22.) by reason that the parents and husbands themselves, by their own wicked example do teach and lead their yong daughters and wives no better.[ Oth. should I not make visitation etc. as if God said, I cannot let such go unpunished; your selves must acknowledge it, which likewise dith well agree with the conclusion of this vers. Compare Jer. 5. 91, 29. and chapter 9. verse 9, etc.] for they themselves separate themselves with the whores, and offer with the vilest worker; [I.e. the parent and husbands, separate themselves by troops, and go under pretence of their idol – worship, to joyn themselves with the vilest whores, as they went offering sacrifies with them, when they go but to practise abominable vilenesse, which was all their intent] the people then (that) have no understanding, shall turned upside down. [Or, confounded, enthralled, improverished, scourged, punished, overthrown. The Hebrew word here used, occurres only in this place, and Prov.10. vers.8, 10 signifying, (as by the circumstance of three places appears) a special fort of punishment, or destructions and confusion in general.]
\p
\v 15 If thou, O Israel, wilt go a whoring, let Juda (however) not become guiltie: [As if God, loathing and detesting Israel, (compare below vers. 17.) said; if Israel will needs to go to wrack and ruin, and take no warming at all yet look wrack and ruin, and take no warning at all, yet look thou to it, O Juda, and follow not their ill example: it is a complaint taken up over the stiffneckedness together with a serious exhortation or warning, for Juda] do not ye (I pray) come to Gilgal . [See Jos. 5.9. It should seem that in this place there was very abominable idolatrie practiced; and this having been the famous place, where the first circumcion, and the first Passover were celebrated in Canaan, therefore God was so much the more offended with the profanation and pollution of such a place . See below chapter 9.1. and cha 12.12. Amos 4 4. & 5.5.] and go not up to beth – aven, [i.e. the house of God, called Beth – Aven here reason of the golden calf set up there by Jerobeam, and the idolatry there practiced. See 1 Kings 12. 29. and above chap.5. 8. and 10. This place was formerly likewise very famous because of Gods special apparition there to the Patriarch Jacob Gen.28. 19 and chap 35.6. 7, etc. both thse places Gilgal and Bethel lay neer Juda, so that it was not without danger for the people of Juda to be seduced thither into the communion of Idolatry, there being no small appearance of their own inclination that way, wherefore God doth here so earnestly warn them.] and swear not (as true as) the LORD liveth. [viz. in an hypocritical idolatrous manner, so namely as the idolatrous Israelites, intermixing my Name with their idols, thereby to cloak their idolatry, and to hold forth a clour of religiousness, which was an abomination before God, who will be honored and served singlyand up ightly as God, according to his own prescript Compare above chap.2.15. with the annotat. And concerning the particle, not, compare the annotat on the foregoing verse, and Zeph. 1. 5.]
\p
\v 16 For Israel is unruly, [ Or, obstinate, gain striving, running wilde and loose, refusing to be lead into the right wayes,] like an unruly heifer, [remaining in fat pasture but altogether without restraint or tie, without any yoke, bounds, government, running headlong, neither caring nor knowing whither, therefore shall the LORD deal with her as followeth.] now [i.e. shortly, ere long. See bel. Chap10. vers.3. ] the LORD shall the lord deal with her as followeth.] now [i.e. shortly, ere long. see bel. chapter 10. verse. 3. ] the LORD shall feed them, [ i.e. the Israelite] as a limb at large [even as young silly lamb, that goeth at large, doth ditches pits or pools, or becoming a prey to the wilde beasts: so this people being given so much to licentiousness and libertinism, and loving to rove and range at large, past all bounds and restraints; I will give them scope enough to range, so that is to say, I will carry them away out of their own land and pasture, and scatters them toward all the four windes among the heathen. Some take it thus, that God would first feed and fatten Israel like a lamb, i.e. make them to grow wealthy and powerfull by all manner of prosperity, and then fetch them up, as out of a fat pasture, for to be led unto the slaughter.]
\p
\v 17 Ephraim [i.e. the ten tribes, whereof Ephraim was the principal, and had the kingdome, see Psal. 78. on ver.9. and so below. Chap.5. 3,5,911,13,14, etc and these are likewise understood by Israel, in this prophecie.] is companied with the idols, [i.e. so firmly joined and allied with them, as one companion is with another. See of the Heb. Word 2.sam 5. on 21.] let him alone [compare ab. verse. 15. wit te annot. and Mat.15.15.]
\p
\v 18 Their swilling [i.e. the drunkeness which they use at their idolatries and uncleanness] is revolting: [i.e. by their excesse of drink and companions, they grow but so much more rebellions and exorbitant, in both spiritual and bodily whoredom; they doth but intice and instigate unto the other. Oth. their wine (or, drunkenness) is wishing. i.e. their idol feasts and drunken meeting, are full of loathsum filth and pollution, wherein they lie welting like beast. Compare the manner of speaking wit Prov. 20. 1.] they doe nothing but whore; [Heb. whoring they whore] her [reflecting it should seem upon the unruly heifer above v.16 or te adulterous woman, or harlot above ch.3.1. and 1.2. and so also in the following verse: it may likewise fitly be applied to Ephraim or Israel it self, according to the custom of the Hebrew tongue; and so also vers. 19.] shields [i.e. their defenders and protector, teir governors, as Psal. 47.10. See the annotat there.] (it is a shame) [i.e. a very shameful thing for the Governors and rulers of Gods people ; it is spoken with detestation] do love (the word) Give. [God implieth here, that the governours make such a common and daily use of te word impudently to minde people of (when as it is base enough to accept offred) gifts and presents. Give, give, bring , bring is all they say and sing; meaning either bribes and presents or, as some would have it understood here, wine, to swill. Compare Mich. 7. 3. See the like expression, in matter of unsatiableness Prov 30. 15. or thus, Their wine with draweth: they commit whoredom; give, they love, their Protectors are a shame
\p
\v 19 A winde hath bound her [viz this heiser or harlot, or adulterous woman, or, Israel or Ephraim.]in his wings; [I.e. he shall surely sinde and easily carry and hurrie her way, spoke in phophetical manner. And by the winde he understands the Assyrians, who should most suddenly and unresistably, like a violent winde, carry away captive the ten tribes out of their land, which happened first by Tiglath – Pileser, and afterwards completely by Salmanasser. See 2 Kings 15. 9. and 18. 9,10,11 etc. and compare below chap 13. vers.15. Psal.55. 9. Jer 4.11,12, and 51.1, etc. God is also said to ride upon the wings of the winde. 2 Sam. 22. 11. Psal.104.3.] and they shall be ashamed because od their sacrifies [understand those idolatrous and whorist sacrifices mentioned above.]
\c 5
\s The prophet goeth on, in setting forth the judgements of God, by the enemies, upon the estates of Israel, and upon Juda also, because of their Tyanny, all manner of oppression and idolatry, cutting them off from all divine and humane help in their distresses, verse 1, etc. until they should be brought to conversion at last, 15.
\p
\v 1 Hear this ye Priests, and attend ye house of Isreal, and give car (O) house of the King; [It should seem that the prophet doth make this addresse here to the three of the kingdom of Israel, in several respects : the ecclesiastical men, the eldest of the people, and the King. Yet some conceive, that by the house of Israel here are understood the ten tribes, and by the King, the king of Juda.] for this judgement concerneth you. [He. For men, or, people, to whom this belongeth; See Jer.48. On verse. 21. oth, the judgement or Right would becomes you, I.e. ought indeed to doe and administer right and judgement, and then the following wordsare read, but yeare a snare &c. compare Mich.3.1. And Mal.2.1.4.] because ye are become a snare [I.e. like one] at Mizpa, [there were divers heights and places of name on both sides o the river Jordan: of Mizpa in Gelead, see Judg. 10. 17. with the annot. This may taken thus, that the idolatrous governors and priest of the ten tribes, appointed guards on both sides of Jordan upon eminent places for to wach and apprehend all such, as would go up to Jerusalem, there to perform the worship God, and so to murther them; which also the beginning of the next verse seems to have respect unto. Compare below. chapter 6.9. with the annot, chapter 7.1. also 1 Kings. 15. 17. with the annotat. There. Others understand it so, as if by all kinde of subril wayes and diveces they sought to allure the inhabitants unto their new – broached idolatry, for get the same approved by them, as a service well pleasing to God; dealing with men no otherwise, then fowlers and huntsmen, were wont to do upon both these high mountains.] and net[ I.e. like a net] spread abroad Thabor. [of this amount see Judg. 8. on v.8.]
\p
\v 2 And those that turn aside, go deep for to say : [When the backsliding Israelites, such as were sent forth on purpose, did spie any honest godly passengers from the tops of those mountains, then they presently got them down towards the bottom, for to lay hold on and slay them: some read it thus: They go deep to murther, (or, kill) the with – drawing, or retting ones, or retiring ones, viz. From among the idolatrous Israel, to Juda and Jerusalem; the sence being one and the same: other understand it deep and profound sinning, in murdering the godly, and tender it, make deep, or, multiply the saying which likewise differs but little from the other reading. Or of the deep and profound and subtile device, to beget a good opinion in the people of their idolatrous sacrifices, (as you had in the former note) which God accounts an unprofitable killing and slaying of beasts. The Hebr. Word is used both ways, for to go down, lurk or hide ones self in deep places, as Jer. 49. 8 30. and ff singing deeply, as Isa. 31.6 below chap 9.9. and both together (as it seemeth) Isa. 29. 15. where with both these verses the second and the third may also firtly be compared.] but I will be rebuker to them all. [Heb. A correction, or correctour, correcting – master, imply one that doth use to correct both words and stripes. See Prov. 7. on vers. 22. Oth. Through I was an instructor to them all, I.e. taught and instructed them otherwise by my prophets.]
\p
\v 3 I know Ephraim, and Israel is no hid before me, that thou O Ephraim, and art a whoring now, and Israel is polluted. [As if God said, ye shall not able to obscure your whoredomes before me, by disavowing or cloaking the same, I have too plainly and frequently and taken you in the fact.]
\p
\v 4 They doe not dispose their actions, [Or, their actions give up themsleves (with) their actions, to &c. Oth their works, (or, practises) will not give way, or, permit, that, &c. Compare Psa 36. 3. 5. and 55. 20. and 64. 6.] for to convert themselves unto their God, for the spirit of: whoredomes [See above chapter 4. on vers. 12.] is in the midst of them: and the LORD they know not.[ however they seek to cover and cloak their idolatry with his name See above chapter 4. on verse. 1. and 15. ]
\p
\v 5 There fore shall the pride of Israel witness to his face: [Or doth witness, or, answer, and so below chapter 7. 10. the sence is : their insolent and stifnecked contempt of all the faithful warning a and exhortations of my prophets, is so palpable and manifest, that it cannot be denyed; and it shall stand to confront them, or to the shame and confusion of their faces, witness against them in my judgement, to their conviction, and in testimony, that they are justly punished by me. Compare Isa 59. 12. Jer. 14. 7. Amos 6.8. Zech .2. 10. and like phrase of the contray, Gen 30. 33. Oth the glory, exaltation, excellery, &c. of Israel. I.e. the blesting whereby I have so much exalted them, shall convince them of their unthanfulnes ] and Israel and Ephraim shall, through their iniquiry; [See above. Chap 4,5. and 14. 9.] Juda also shall fall [Heb is fallen] with them.
\p
\v 6 With their sheep and with their oxen shall they go (then) for the seek the LORD, but not finde him [I.e. they shall think and go about to satisfie, or appease God with their sacrifices,thereby to obtain help and succour from him,but in vain.Compare 2 Kings 23.21,] he hath withdraw himself from them.[ or, made himself loose (or free) from them, as one that would have nothing more to do with them, by reason of their offending him so much with their abominations.]
\p
\v 7 They have dealt unfaithfully against the LORD; they have gotten strange children: [By matching themselves with heathish women, against the expresse command of God. Compare Ezek. 9. 1,2. Nehem. 13. 23. Mal. 2. 21. it being one consequence of such matches that the children came thereby to be nursed up in idolatry ] now [ I.e. shortly , or therefore] the now moon shall consume the, [ by the new moon in understood the idolatry, which they commited in the moons. Some take it as similatude of usury, or moneth – money returns very hastily, and consumes the debtor before he is aware of it. Oth. Take a moneth for short time, as Zach. 11. 8. or for appointed time] with their parts. [Or portions shares, I.e. wil all their goods, lands and possessions. Compare Psal. 16. 5. with the annot. Some do understand the sacrifices which were divided into many parts.]
\p
\v 8 Blow the trumpets [Here God very lively sets before their eyes the terrour of the approaching enemie; when as it is usual to found alatum in the places next adjacent] at Gibea, the Trumpet at Rama; [Gibea and Rama lay both in Benjamin, on the borders of Ephraim. See Jud. 19. on verse 13. These fronter – places were doubtless strong and well garison'd, and consequently they reposed much confidence in them; at Gibea, saul dwelt, at Ramah Samuel was born; 1Sam 10. 6 and chapter 1. See likewise 1 Kings. 15. 17, 21, 22.] cry aloud (at) Both – Aven; [See above chapter 4. on verse. 15.] after the Benjamin. [Hereupon may be understood, is the Enemy, or ther is the work, to wit, The enemy is busie in Ephraim, and there he begins to lay waste, whereof next verse. Benjamin lay between Juda and Ephraim; in which regard some do take these words, as a description of the situation of Juda, laying south behind Benjamin; and that thus Juda also should be alrmed like unto the foresaid places. Or it may plainly be taken thus, after, or behind thee Benjamin, I.e. let Benjamin likewise blow the alarm, backwards, to shew that the alarms should spread all about on the neck of one another, from one place to the other].
\p
\v 9 Ephraim shall become a desolation, in the day of punishment; [Or, correction, I.e. at that time, when I shall pronounce and execute the judgement spoken of before, verse. 1. ] among the tribes of Israel, I have made known, [Or I do make known] that which is certain and assured, and I shall come to passe without all peradventure, that they may know, when it dith come to passe, that I am the LORD. Oth. I have made known the faithfulness, I.e. have shewed forth my faithfulnesse to Israel, by mainfold warning of their desolation to come, if they prevented it not by timely repentance. Oth. Thus it is certain. It, viz. The foretold and threatned judgement.]

\v 10 The Princes of Juda are become like unto those that remove the borders; [A thing which God had severely forbidden and accursed, Deut. 19. 14. and 27. 17 Job 24. 2. Prov. 22. 28. This was like wise practised by the Governours of Juda in that time of Achaz, when they trespassed and inchroached upon the limits of God himself, and carefully maintained by the good kings; and went beyond the bounds of their office and administration, bringing all things into confusion, the usual consequence, by God judgement, of confounding true Religion. See 2 Kings 16. and that draweth along with it Deluge of Gods indignation and vengeance, overflowing and destroying all] I will pour out mine indignation over them like water. [See Psal. 79. on verse 6.]
\p
\v 11 Ephraim is oppressed, he is bruised with right (or, judgement;)[Or he is battered, broken, or beaten in places. Heb. Bruising of judgement. The plainest sense of these words seems to be, that all this should come very justly upon them, according to their own demerits; which agreeth well with the following text. Some take it, that Ephraim, as he was accustomed formerly to judge others, should be reduced to that condition, to suffer others to passe jedgement upon, them, and in jedgemnet to bruise and undo them] for so he would (have) it; he hath walked according to the commandment.[ viz of their king Jerobeam, the Founder of their abominable idolatry, and all the ensuing licentiousnesse, in whose paths his successors still insisted; it sufficed them, that they could pretend their king command and authority, and thereupon they went still without the least remorse, having no regard to any warning of God and his Prophets Oth. Thus, He hath walked of good will, voluntary; or be would walk after the command, or precept. Heb. He would, he walked, etc. See Psal. 45. on verse 5.]
\p
\v 12 Therefore shall I be to Ephraim, as a moth: [See Job 13. 28 Psal. 30. 12. Prov. 12. 4. and 14 . 30. Isa 50. 9. and 51. 8.] and to the house of Juda as a corruption [Or putrifaction, worm – breeding, I.e. Even as clothes by moths, and other things by corruption or wormes come insensibly it were ti be consumed; so shall I by judgments consume and destroy the people of both these Nations by degrees, as also come to pass afterwards, first to Israel, and after to Juda]
\p
\v 13 When Ephraim beheld his sickeness, [I.e. was sensible of all this evil now foretold,and saw, or observed it drawing on in good earnest] and Juda built; [Compare Obad. Verse. 7.] then Ephraim went to Assur, [I.e. to Pal the king of Assyria, by gifts and presents to make him become of an enemy, their friend and helper; this seeming to have regard to the history of king Monahem, 2 Kings 15. 19. etc. See further below chapter 7. verse 11 etc. and he sent [this some apply to Juda , by comparing the foregoing and following verse. (see 2 Kings 16. 7. to king Jacob. Compare bel. chapter 10. 6. by which place in appeareth, that this was Name of a certain king of Assyria (as likewise some Chronologers have it) or such a general names as the Jews and Israelites were wont to give unto those foreign kings, whose help and protection they sought unto, dist, usting Gods, Jereh signifying in Hebrew , he shall contend , plead, right , I.e. he is the man that shall take our cause upon him, and maintain it. Compare Judg. 6. 31. 32. with the annotat.] but shall not be able to cure you, nor shall (he) heal the bile from you. [I.e. so as to take it quite away from you of it. Oth. He shall heal the wound of (none) out of, or from (among) you.]
\p
\v 14 For I will be to Ephraim as fierce Lion, and to the house of Juda as young Lion: I, I will tear [or prey; Compare below chapter 6.1.] and b gone; I will carry away and there shall be none to rescue.
\p
\v 15 I will go away, and turn again to my place [Spoken after the manner of men, God said to come down, when he hath some great work to do, or executeth his judgments upon the earth; and to return to his place, and to be silent, when he suffers men to bide in misery, or doth not deliver them until they repent, and his time be come. Compare Gen 11.7 Isa. 26. 21. and 16. 4. etc.] until they acknowledge themselves guilty, and seek my face. [See 2 Chron. 7. on verse. 14. and chapter 11. on verse. 16.] When they shall be in streight, they will seek me early. [I.e timely, diligently and servently See Job. 7. 21. and 8. 5. Prov. 7. 15. Psal. 5. 4. with the annotat and compare Jer. 29. 12,13,14. Dan .9. and the books of Ezra and Nehemia, and besides the time of New – Testament. Especially. Mat. 11. 12etc.]
\c 6
\s The penitent Israelites, are bought in here, exhorting one another to repentance and confidence in Gods mercie ve 1, &c God complaint of Israels and unstedfastness in good, and stiff- neckednesse in evil, 4.
\p
\v 1 Come and let us return to the LORD; [Some joyn these words with the latter end of the foreign chapter, as mutual exhortation to repentance, which the faithfull then should use one to another] for he hath torn , and he shall heal us; [which neither Assur nor Jereb were able to perform, above chap, 5. 13. See further Psa. 30 on verse. 3. ] he hath snitten, [compare Ezek. 7. 9. with the annot.] and he shall binde us. [See Job 5. 18. Psal.147. 3. ]
\p
\v 2 He shall make us alive, after two days: on the third day he shall reise up. [For they (viz, Ephraim and Juda, above chap 5. 14 ) were as dead and buried when they were carried away captive into Assyria and Babel, (as we likewise were all of us spiritually dead through sin) so that their deliverance was like rising from the dead. See Ezek. 37. isa. 27. 19. with the annotat. Now, as the deliverance out of Babel was a type of our spirital deliverance by Christ; so these excellence Evangelical expression in this and the next verse, may very fitly be also applied to the raising of our head and Saviour Jesus Christ, upon the third day, and to the glorious fruits, which the whole body of Christ, that is, his church, enjoyes thereby. See Rom, 6. 8. 11. Col 2. 13. and 3. 1,2, 3, etc.] and we shall live before his face [as new born children, a new ,man, the new creature, shall we lead a blessed life in his house, under his fatherly favour, and chearfully walk before him in newness of life, holiness, and righteousness, both here in time, and hereafter for evermore; see Gen 17. 1. Psal.4. 7 Ezek. 16. 6. with the annotat also Rom. 6. 8. 11. 1 Pet. 2.2 Ephes 2.1. and 4. 24 2 Corin. 5. 17 Gal.6.15. ROM. 6.4. Luk. 1. 7 5. 2Cor. 5. 15. 1Thes. 4.17 and 5. 10.]
\p
\v 3 Then shall we knows ; we shall pursue, to know the LORD; [See of the like connexion of two verbes, Psal 45. on vers. 5. The sence is, well shall by the grace of God, know his Messiah then, be servently zealous, and make it our care, to grow up and increase in his knowledge, until at last, hereafter, we may attain unto perfection: See above chapter 2. 20. 1Cor. 13. 9. 10 and compare with this their former condition, above chapter 1. 1,6. and 5.4.] his going forth [I.e. rising up, compared with the rising of the sun, coming forth like a bridegroom out of his chamber; (psal 19. 6.) understand Gods upproaching for the deliverance of his people, out of the Babylonian captivity, and coming of Christ, for our spiritual redemption] is ready, [ or, fitted, dispodes] as the day break: [ I.e. although as acceptable and delightful, and as firm and sure with all, as the breaking of the day, and the rising of the sun, after the nights obscurity and darkness.] and he shall come unto us, in our good and comfort] as a rain: [viz. After a long drought, when a rain hath been a great while longed for. Compare Job 29. 23. also Deut 32. 2. Psal. 72. 6. and Zek. 34. 26. as the late rain, (and) early rain of the Land.[or earth see Deut. 11. on verse. 13. the meaning is that God, shall not fail to shew and continue his kindness to his church, in the most reasonable time, and especially in and by the wok of grace through Christ]
\p
\v 4 What shall I do unto thee O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee O Juda : [As if the LORD said; how can I deal other wise with thee, then I am daily threating? How should I be able to spare you? Here God returns again to his sermon of reproof, as the sequel of the next sheweth] because your well- doing is as a morning – clouds, and as an early – coming dew, that passeth away. [Suddenly coming, and as soon gone and evaporated; Compare bel. ch. 13. 3. God implying, that sometimes indeed they presented themselves and made a shew, as if they meant to convert themselves in good earnest; but even that very shew did soon vanish and come to nothing; so far they were yet from any true and real conversion.]
\p
\v 5 Therefore I shewed them by the Prophet: [Sharply and earnestly reproving and rebuking them, using, as the saying sis, a hard wedge, or cleaver to hard and knotty piece of timber] I have slain them by speeches of my mouth; [I.e declared them uncapable of all helpe and conform, and on the contrary denounced judgment of death, or deadly destruction, against them; See Jer 1. on verse 10, etc.] and your judgment, [understand the judgments, sentences and decrees or punishments, which I shall cause to pass upon you, O Ephraim and Juda, Heb, your judgments shall etc. the verb in the singular, I.e very one of those judgments, which by your maniford and long continued cause of sinning ye have from time to time deserved] shall come forth (to) light [I.e. shall break out st last, and be brought to light, and made manifest before all the world, by the publique execution, to be past upon your publique and notorious sins, and thereby they will be acknowledged rigthous judgments, Compare the phrase with Job 12. 22 and 28. 11 Mich 7.9. Zeph 3.5. This seems to be the plainest translation of these words. Oth. And (or that) the light of your judgments may come forth.]
\p
\v 6 For I take pleasure in doing good, [As if God said, ye will say peradventure, ye are not behind – hand in offering according to my precept, but ye know well enough what I commanded and taught you concerning this, as followeth. Compare Mich. 6. 6, 7, 8.] and not in suffering: [I.e more then in offering; or not in offering alone, as is expressed in the following text(Compare Gen. 32. 24. Sam. 15. 22. Prov. 10. 8. Jer 7. 2. and 16. 14 with the annotat) or simply, not in offering, viz. An hypocritical one; the outward bare offering confidered in self, without saith and repentance, (Compare Psal 50. 12, 13, 14, 15. Isa. 1. 11. etc.] and in the knowledge of God, more than in burnt – offerings [I.e. likewise not in them as before (compare Luk. 18. 14.) the latter phrase being explained by the former; both expressions are usual in the scriptures certainly this matter: for sometimes the external part (being also in its kinde of Gods institution) is compared with the internal, otherwhiles it is confidered in it self and without the inward, and simply rejected, nay highly reproved, as a disloyal breach of covenant as here also in the sequel.]
\p
\v 7 But they have transgressed the covenant, [Which I had made with them, and they with me, the sacrifies coming between; see Psal50. On vers. 8.] like Adam: following the footsteps of their forefathers, who notwithstanding he was so abundantly endowed and blessed by me, yet transgressed my command, and revolted from me. Compare Job 31. 33. and Isa 43. 27. with the annotat. Oth as men use to do, or as a mans, viz covenant, I.e. as if they had to do with a meet man, not with me the Almighty and righteous God ] there they dealt unfaithfully with me, [i.e. therein, in the substance of the Covenant and divine worship, mocking me with their hypocritical offerings, which they came to obtrude upon me, as if thereby the Covenant were performed. Oth. There, i.e. in my holy land, which I had given them, for to serve and obey me in it.]
\p
\v 8 Gilead is a city of workers of iniquity: [This place is held by some to be the Romoth of Gilead, in the tribe of God, being a city of the Levities, and appointed for a free city on the East – side of Jordan; but under that pretext become a den of wilful murtherers. See Deut 4. 43. Jos. 20. 8 and 21. 38. Nevertheless there is a city of this name Gilead, placed in some maps by mount Gilead, where Laban overtook Jacob, whereof the understanding reader may judge. Some read it thus: each city of Gilead is a city of etc Or Gilead is (as) a city. I.e. all the land of Gilead is combined as one city in evil, and therefore justly punished: See 1 Kings 15. 25, 29,. 1Chro 5. 25, 26.] she is tramples with blood. [I.e. full of murther and bloodshed, so that footsteps of blood, as it were, are every where obvious, this seems to be the plainest meaning of these words. Compare bel. Chap 12.12. 2Kings 21. 16]
\p
\v 9 Like as troops of highway – robbers [Or roving bands, taking theeves, etc such , as by reason of the many mountains and deserts in those parts used to haunt there, especially in times of trouble and commotions in the countrey] wait for a man [viz. The travelling man, for to set upon, rob and murther him] (so) is the company of the Priests; [Or Rulers, officers in Church and state. See ab, ch. 4. on verse 9. ]they murther (on) the way to Sichem: likewise a city of the Levites, and a free city of Refug, on the West- side of Jordan in Canaan, Jos. 21. 22. See further of Sichems situation, Jud 8.31. and 9. 25. with the annotat . Whence it appears that on the top of the mountains there the robbers used to lurk and watch for such as came travelling along the publique road. Now thus the priests did , being animated therunto by the wicked governours. An horrible but usual consequence of idolatry. Compare ab. chapter 5. 1,2 with the annot, Oth. (after) the manner of Sichem: also with (one) shoulder, i.e. unanimously with one accord. See Zeph. 3. 9.] verily they commit vile deeds.[ i.e. thye transgress thus, not out of any inconsideration, haste, provocation, but they commit such abominable base practices, with a deliberate minde and purpose; and that is the Hebrew word aimes at]
\p
\v 10 I do see an abominable thing in the house of Israel, [Compare Jer 5.30. and 18. 13. and 23.14.] there is Ephraims whoredom, Israel is polluted.
\p
\v 11 Also be [viz. Ephraim] hath set thee an harvest of Juda; [God seems to imply here, that the ten Tribes (of whose wickedness mention was made in the former verse) had sowed an evil seed of idolatry among those of Juda, or had imparted a plant, branch, spring, grass from which Juda had reaped nothing but vexation and miserys as feel out in the time of Aha, when God, being angry with Juda, caused them to fall before Pekah the son o Remalia king of Israel, so that there were slain of them upon the place an hundred and twenty thousand men, and two hundred thousand women, sons and daughters were carried away captive to Samaria, with vast booty. So God punished Juda, by Israel it self, whose example they had begun to follow in idolatry. See 2 Chron. 28. 5,6 etc. and compare the phrase with Jer 51. 33. Joel 3. 13. Rev. 14. 15.] when I brought again the captives of my people. [Hebr. the captivity of my people. Viz. of Juda, which was brought to passé by the exhortation of the Prophet Oded, who advised of Israelites, near Samaria, to use their prisoners kindly, and to set them free again, for to return unto their habitation. For enough God was incensed against Juda, for having begun to follow the Israelites in their idolatrous courses, yet he was more wroth with the Israelites, notwithstanding the victory he had given them this time to chastise Juda, See 2 Chron.28.9. &c. Some conceive, in regard that the turning of the captivity, or the bringing back of the captives of Gods people is oft times used, for the deliverance out of the Babylonian captivity, and consequently, for the spiritual Deliverance by the Messiah, and the time of Grace by him, that God doth here also prophesie thereof, and read the next thus. Nevertheless, or however, (o Israel, for all thy present apostasies and corruption) Juda shall set thee an harvest, or plant, viz. of faith and conversion; when shall I bring again, or cause to return the captivity of my people, by the preaching of the Gospel which is to go forth out of Juda and Zion by Christ and his apostles. See Isaiah 2. 3.etc. and compare Job 4.4,5. 20.29,30,41. 42, etc.]
\c 7
\s God complaineth further of their common heat and eagerness in all manner of grosse sins, bearing sway as well among the great one at Court, as among the Vulgar; such as were, falsehood, stealing, robbing, malice, lies, wicked alliances, drunkenness, smokeries into leagues with heathens, verse. 1, etc. accompanied with a stupid pride, obstinacie and senselessness, 8. foretelleth them his righteous judgment, 12. and goeth on complaining of their hypocrisie and incorrigibleness, 13,14, etc.
\p
\v 1 Whiles I am curing Israel, [i.e stir and imploy my Prophets, for to exhort the ten Tribes to repentance, and to reduce them to all spiritual and temporal welfare. See Psal.30. on verse. 3. and below chap 11.3.] the iniquitie of Ephraim is discovered, [ie. Then it appears, that the root and fource of all their wickedness and iniquitie, against both first and second Table, is the Tribe of Ephraim, and especially in the Kings Court at Samaria. Or it is plainly found, that through their obstinancie against all my exhortations, their wickedness and perverness is come to that height that they past all cure and recovery] together with the wickedness of Samaria; [See 1 Kings 16. on vers. 24.] for they work falsehood, whereby they break Covenant with me, Psal. 44.18,21.dealing likewise falsly with their neighbour, See Lev.19. 11.] and the thief goeth in, the troop of robbers[ See above chapter 5. on verse 1,2.] roath abroad. [Implying, that stealing, plundering, murthering was now left free and went unpunished both within and without their cities, so much they had prevailed, and thereby both the Tables of God law was broken.]
\p
\v 2 And they say not in their heart, (that) I do minde all their wickedness: [i.e. they never think once, that I do see, and shall visit all this] now their dealing, surround them, [as cords or ropes, intangling and distressing them, so that they shall not be able to escape; as the officers of Justice do apprehend and bring them as male –factors before the judgment, whereof they shall finde the truth now. I.e. very shortly] they are before my face. [viz. bare and naked, they are all known to me, and I shall take them in hand, to look to their action, and to proceed with them accordingly.]
\p
\v 3 They chear in the King with their wickedness, and the Princes with their lies. [The wickedness of the King and of his Princes was s great, that they took pleasure and delight in the abominations both of Priests and people, as serving mainly to stiffen in Idolatrie, the mystery and basis of their State and Government, and the people knowing the Courts pleasure, they acted accordingly, , to pleasure the Prince best doing worst.]
\p
\v 4 They do all of them commit adulterie; they are like the oven that is heated by the baker: [i.e. they are so hot and servant in their idolatrie and sins depending thereupon, as a fiery flaming oven thoroughly heated; and nevertheless as sencelesse and secure about the danger thereof, as is the sleeping Baker. See vers. 6.] ceasing to be vigilant, [Or, to rewze i.e. he sleepeth both himself, and lets all sleep and be at rest, till it be time to put the bread into the oven, after that the dough is sufficiently risen and thoroughly leaved; even so do they let the leaven of corruption have its full operation, and the oven of idolatry, to be through heated, till all be to their minde, that is to say, come to the highest pitch of iniquitie, Compare Mat. 16. 12. Luke 12. 17.Oth thus, which is heated of the baker, when he ceaseth to raise up, (viz those that are to knead and work the dough) after that the dough shall be kneaded, until it be thoroughly levened ] after that be shall have kneaded the dough, till it be through leavened.
\p
\v 5 It is the day of our King; [This may be taken, as spoken by the Princes and Courties. Oth (on) the day of our King, the Princes make him sick, By the Kings day may be understood his birth – day, as Gen 40. 20. or his Coronation day, as a certain festival day instituted by the King, in honor of the Calves. See 1 Kings 12.32. 33 and comp. Job 1.4. with annotat. Mat 14.6.] the Princes make (him) [viz. the King, from what goes before and followeth, oth. Make themselves] sick through inflammation of the wine; [i.e. through hot draughts of wine, or by drinking of hot wine; Oth. With bottles of wine] he stretcheth forth his hand with the mockers, [I.e when he is sick of wine, then he riseth up with the mockers and jesters, which are at hand to make him some pastime, while he is wine-sick, to ease him or when he is drink, then he doth so, in so much that the Court is full of vanity and wickedness. Of mockers [See Psal. 1. on vers. 1. Prov 1.22. and 9.7, etc]
\p
\v 6 For [Or, surely, certainly] they inure their heart as an oven [Heb. Properly, they make their heart draw near etc. i.e. they give themselves to it, they entice and instigate, set and encourage themselves] to their plots [i.e secretly to plot against those, that diswade or oppose them, and by all manner of practise to bring them into trouble and distress, even to death, because they will not allow of their impieties, or bearing them grudge and hatred in other respects] their baker sleepeth no all night, in the morning he burneth like a flaming fire. [Hereby some understand their King, who having charged his Princes and Counsellours with the conduct and execution of all his wicked devices, and seeing it take, and be in full force and vigour, he takes great pleasure and their complices are up and practicing, for to conspire against him(whereof fee next verse) and before the King dreames of it, the plot is ready, and breaketh forth, setting all fire and in combination.]
\p
\v 7 They are altogether inflamed [viz. in impietie and wickedness] as an oven, and they consume their Judges: [i.e. their Kings, Princes, and Governors, as the following words declare, and below vers. 16. Compare Judge. 2. on vers.16.] all their Kings fall [ I.e they are made away the one conspiring against, and slaying the other. See Gen 14. on vers.10 on ver. 10.&c. and the history hereof 2 Kings 15.8. &c. to vers.32. and below here vers.16.] there is none among them, that calleth on me. [i.e. that knoweth me, and seeketh for favour and help at my hands; compare below verse 10,11,14.]
\p
\v 8 Ephraim, he entangleth himself with the nations: [By heathenish matches, communion of idolatrie & other sins; besides unwarrantable leagues and alliances. See above chap 5.7, 13. and below here vers. 11.] Ephraim is [i.e. is like] a cake [ see of the Heb. Word Gen 18. on vers.6.] that is not turned: [and consequently half raw yet, whom the greedie Assyrians will swallow up nevertheless; or burnt on the one side, and raw, or unready on the other, and in that regard very unsavory and corrupt and good for nothing more (as they say) neither for to cast away , as it with a cake, when there is no care had of it, on the fire, or coals. This simultitude is variously declared, and applied to Ephraim: by what goes before and followes. It should seem, God implies Ephraim had been careless and negligent of both their spiritual and temporal welfare, and running abroad to the Idolatrous Heathens, to seek foe help and safetie were grown so corrupt by their communion with them, that they had scarce an shape, taste or favour left, to make them that they had scarce any shape, taste or favour left, to make themselves desirable; even as a cake, half raw , and half burnt, or quite burnt and spoiled: some apply is to the impententie of Ephraim, notwithstanding Gods punishing of them; whereof vers. 10.]
\p
\v 9 Stranger consume his [viz. Ephraims] vigour: see examples hereof 2 Kings 15.19.28. and verse. 29. there] and he perceives it not; also grayness is spread abroad upon him, and he perceives it not. [I.e he growes weak and seeble; and is not sensible of it, even as old people, gretting gray – hairs over; and yet he remains as obstinate as stiff – necked ever he was before]
\p
\v 10 Therefore the pride of Israel [viz, that in this their miserable conditionthey still continue so senceless, insolent, and reflectorie against me. See above chap 5.5. with the annotat.] shall restifie to his face; because they do not convert themselves to the LORD their God, nor seek him in all this.
\p
\v 11 For Ephraim is as a blant Dove [I.e a dull, silly, simple creature, easily apt to be misled and seduced, prostituion themselves to be abused by any; this is further declared in the sequel ] without heart, [I.e. understanding See Job 9. on verse. 4.] they call upon Egypt, [See 2 Kings 17. 3, 4. and above chap 5.13. and below chap 8.9. and 12. 1,] they go away to Assur.[ I.e to Assyria, or king of Assyria.]
\p
\v 12 When they shall be going thither, I will spread forth my net over them [I.e. I will catch, entangle and ruin them their Treaties or Negotiations with the Egypt and Assur, even as filly birds are entrapt and caught by net. Compare Job 19.6. Ezech 12.13. and 17.20. and 19.8. and 32.3. with the annotat.] I shall make them down,[ where they tought to mount and four on high] as the fowls of heaven; I shall chastile them, [viz. With plague and punishments. See Prov 7. on vers. 22.] as was heard in their congregation.[ Heb according to the hearing of (or, at, or, in) their congregation; that is, according as foretold and threatned them, in my law, and by my Prophets, I their own assemblies before all the congregation. See 2 Kings .17. 13.]
\p
\v 13 Wo unto them for they swarved away from me; [Seeking for idolatrous and carnall help here and there, and swarving or wandering about, like frighted bird, that knoweth not where to rest] destruction (be) upon her, for they have transgressed against me, [or, revolted from me See 1 Kings. 8.50. and 12 on verse. 19 again, Jer 2. 8,9,29 and compare below, chap 8 .1. and 14. 10.] I might indeed deliver them, [or, I delivered them indeed or, I deliver the indeed, or when ideliver them etc See 2 Kings 14.25,26,27,28.] but they receive at mt hands, they return the honour to their idols, or, they do indeed promise amendment and thankfullness but they intend it not.]
\p
\v 14 Neither do they call to me with their heart, when they howl upon their coaches: [I.e. their praying to, and lamenting before me, in meer hypocritisie, it is a howling, for their being vexed and disappointed; a murmuring of impatience, without faith and repentance. Some think that the word, couches, or beds, hath respect to the high places or Temples of their idolatry, which is spiritual whoredom. See Isa 57. 7,8. with the annot. Which following word, gather, doth not unsitly allude unto. Compare also Ezek. 23. 41.] they gather themselves [seemingly for to sue for and obtain blessings at my hand] for corn and new wine (and) turn to me] (but) they strive against me. [I.e. foe all their semblance, they shew indeed that they are revolted from, and rebellion against me. Oth. They turn away from, or, turn aside against me, to wit rebelling, in regard they notwithstanding cleave so close to their idolatry, event whiles in shew, they come using from corn and new wine at my hand. Oth, they make themselves incisions, viz. Into flesh, after the manner of the heathen and gross idolaters See 1. Kings. 18. 28. with the annotat.]
\p
\v 15 I have indeed chastised them, [Both by word and blowes.] and strenthened their arms; implying he had chastifised them moderately yet, affording them strength and power to endure the chastisement; or; so that I did not consume them; or, when I undertook to cure them by wholesom correction, I condescended to their ability, suporting them with necessary means of strength and bearing with their infirmities. Or, I chastised them indeed, but I maintained their state, that they were not destroyed. Others I binde and strengthen their arms, viz. As good Chirurgion of Physician would do. Compare verse 1.] but they devise evil against me. [for my well – doing,they require me in lieu of thankfulness, with evil and wicked practices: divising and going about still to maintain and secure their rottering and ruinous state without me, and against all my warnings and threatenings, as it were in spight and defiance of me, and that by means of idolatrous, carnal and heathenish assistance, when they stand ingaged to thank me alone, for the substistence and preservation, of whatsoever weal and prosperity is left tem yet, which also the sequel aims at]

\v 16 They turn themselves (but) not (to) The most high, [i.e. they run this way and that way, and whither not, but ot me, where their salvation is to be sought, they come not. Compare bel. chapter 11.7. or somewhiles indeed they make shew of turning, but do not really act it, Compare ab. chapter 6.4. with the annotat. Oth. Plainly thus, They do not turn themselves to the most High, they are like a deceitful bowe; [Hebr. bowe of deceit, See Psal.78. 57. with the annotat. The sense is; whereas they ought to turn themselves to me wards, thye go clean contray wayes, and therefore they speed also, as followeth] their princes fall by the sword [See ab. On verse 7.] by reason of the wrathfulness of their tongue. [i.e. because they entertain my prophets and consequently my self with much wrath and bitternesse. Compare Psal.73.9.or because they revile one another with bitter and smart taunts and invectives, which makes them combine and conspire one against the other, even unto death and destruction, as ab. Verse.7.] This is their scornfulness [i.e. the cause of their being scorned] in Egypt. [where they seek for help and think to be in no small credit esteem.]

\s God gives notice unto Israel of the enemies approach, ready to pursue, destroy and carry away the people, and to consume the fruits of the land, because of their forgetting, forsaking, and despising of God, his Covenant, Law, and all wholsom instructions, in word, all that is good; and setting up a kingdom of their own without God, having therewithal instituted and pursued all manner of idolatry, hypocritical worship, and especially that abominable one of their Calves, together with hearthenish leagues and alliances verse1. &c. God threateneth Juda also, 14.
\p
\v 1 The Trumpet to thy mouth; [Heb. Palate. This is hasty and abrupt kinde of expression, such as is usual in unexpected sudden suprisals, it may be taken here, as Gods speech to the prophet, charging him to lift up his voice as a Trumpet, by reason of the people obstinacy, and senceless, as Isa. 58. verse 1, etc. or as a lively represenation of the instant danger and approach of the Enemy, which is signified by sounding alarms. See ab. Chap 5. 8. VERSE. 8.] (He cometh) [viz. the Enemy the King of Assyria] like an eagle, [Compare Jer. 48.40.with annotat.] against the house of the LORD; [to wit, Israel, or ren Tribes (as the sequel sheweth) which bore the Name likewise, and would still accounted God people. Some think that God speaks here gainst Juda, and understand the Temple of Jerusealem, and the Enemy Nebucadnezar] because they have transgressed my Covenant, and are revolted [See above, chap.7. on verse.13.] against my Law
\p
\v 2 . (Then) shall they [viz. they of Israel, as is plain by the next verse] crie unto me; [not out of faith and repentance, but onely through the sense of their foretold and threatened miseries] My God., we Israel know thee. [sure we bear the Name of thy people Israel, and have heard thy word, and prosesse thy worship. Compare Mat 7.21,22. Luke 13.26,27 oth thus, We know thee(we are) Israel, the sense being one and the same.]
\p
\v 3 Israel hath rejected the good;[ I.e. all my wholsom instructions and admonitions, the heeding and keeping whereof would have proved their spiritual and temporal preservation] the enemie shall pursue him.[Spoken of above vers.1.]
\p
\v 4 They have made Kings, but not of me; [Without asking my advice, or staying for my command, for the chusing and setting up of their Kings: although in another sence, the separating of the ten Tribes happened not without Gods righteous disposing and government; See 1 Kings 11.31., &c and 13.11. and compare Isa.30.1. and chapter 54.14.] they have set up Princes, [the words Kings and Princes are taken here interchangeable as above chapter 7.7,16.] but I knew them not: [not as if the all knowing God being only, to expresse by this phrase, that God approved not of it. Compare Psa.1. v.6. with the annotat] of their silver and their gold they have made themselves idols, [see of the Heb. Word, 2 Sam 5. on v. 21. and understand here the golden calves at Dan and Bethel, together with their idolatrous images and resemblances, as below chapter 13.2. and 14. verse 9.] for to be destroyed. [Heb. That he may be destroyed, i.e. every one of them; or Israel. The meaning is, that by this idolatrie they caused their own destruction, comp[are Jer. 18.16. Mich. 6.16. with the annot.]
\p
\v 5 Thy calf, O Samaria,[ i.e our idolatrous Calf worship, which the Kings residing in Samaria had instituted and kept up] hath rejected (thee) [to wit, you the Israelites; the sense being even as they had rejected the good, above verse. 3. from themselves, so should the evil which they chose, that is their idolatry, reject and thrust them forth out of the land; as being the cause thereof. Oth. Thy Calf hath forsaken (thee;) being it self to be carried away, as into captivity. See below ch.10. 6. Or, thus, (the LORD) hath rejected thy Calf, o Samaria even as ye rejected his good things, so he rejecteth your evil .] mine nger is kindled against them: how long will they endure (or, let avail) puritie! [Compare Jer 13.27. it may also be an abrupt kinde of speech, out of anger and vexation; thus: how shall they not puritie be able, viz. to get or practice.]
\p
\v 6 For, that also is out of Israel; [viz. the golden Calf, ( mentioned in the former verse, and in the end of this) came forth in Israel, for, in or themselves; they were not taught it of me; it is a device and workmanship of their own wickedness, as formerly the Calf in the wilderness was a device of their forefathers] a work – master made it, and it is god, but it shall be rent in pieces, the Calf of Samaria. [Or, it shall become sharings, silvers, grindings: this seems to have respect to the golden Calf, Exod.32.20. is if God said; what a pure god is this, that knows nobetter how to preserve himself?]
\p
\v 7 For they have sowed wind, and they shall whirlwind: [ i.e. Gods terrible and unavoidable judgments. See Job 9.17. Psal.82. 16. Prov. 1.27. Jer 4.13. Amos 1.14. with the annotat. The meaning is, they had run after idolatry and heathenish alliances and confederacie, and therefore they should enjoy the fruit of their own works; such as their practice was, such should be their reward and punishment. Compare Job 4.8. with the annotat and below chap.12.1.] I [viz. the seed, or, he viz. Israel] shall have no standing corn; the spronting forth [ or, growth; if any thing come forth of it] shall make [or, yeeld, give] no meal; [ i.e. there shall meal be made of what shall produce; and so in the sequel, and below cha. 9.16. See Psal.1.on v 3.] and if happy it should make, stranger shall swallow it. [or foreigners, i.e. heathenish enemies the sense of the whole is, That as they had busied themselves with vanitie, so all their labour should be in vain, or, bring forth nothing; or, if it produced ought, the enemies should have the benefit thereof.
\p
\v 8 Israel is swallowed up: [ i.e. shall assuredly be destroyed by the enemies, whereof the beginnings are apparent] now they are become among the heathen like a vessel which on e hath no pleasure in. [i.e. they are already a scorn to the neighbouring heathen nations, and shall be more contemptible yet. Compare verse 10. and see Jrer. 22. 28. and Psalm 31.13. and compare Isa.30.14.]
\p
\v 9 For they marched up (to) Assur, [viz. for to secure their state, by the favour and help of the King of Assyria. See 1 Kings 15. 19,20.] a wild asse, that is only for himself;[ i.e. very savage, fierce and undiscreet Prince, preying onely for himself, and seeking nothing but his own advantage, not caring how it fared with others See 24.5. and 39.8. Some applie it to Israel, running every where about for help and allies, like an uruly wild asse, that roaves at random, and seeks for food without foresight, finding oft – times none, and rather becoming a prey himself to others: Compare Jer 2.24.]those of Ephraim have hired lovers for harlots wages [ i.e. have sought and bought themselves helpers and confederates, forsaking their own husband, Lord and confederate, viz. God himself. The Hebr. for lovers hath, loves, woings, i.e. lovers see Job 35. on verse 13.and Jer 27. on vers.9.]
\p
\v 10 Bacause (then) for harlts wages they have hired (lovers) among the heathen, [Or, although, however, but though &c. (yet) will I gather them &c as the Hebr. particles are taken below ch.9.16. as if the LORD should say; let them chuse as many helpers as they lift, it shall avail them nothing] I shall also gather now: [to wit, those heathen helpers, whom they hired, and shall bring them against themselves, instead of help, to destroy them. Compare Ezek 16.37. Oth I will gather them, ( the Israelites) viz. for to deliver them up unto their enemies, and to drive them out of their Land, as this word is likewise taken sometimes for to gather unto punishment . See Psal.26. on verse.9.] Yea, they have even begun a little, [i.e. Those lovers, whom they sought and hired to help them,, have already begun to plague them, yet that is but little in comparison of the rest, which is to follow. Oth. That they shall have small pain of etc. i.e. the succeeding trouble shall be so great, that they shall not value this burthen] because of the burthen of the King of Princes. [ i.e by reason of the Tribute or tax, which the King of Assyria had laid upon Israel. See 2 King 25.19,20. and 17.3. being called the King of Princes, for having many Princes under him. Compare 2 Kings 18.19,24. Isa 10.8. Ezek.31.]
\p
\v 11 Therefore because Ephraim multiplied the altar to sinning, the altars are become sinning unto him [ In regard they would needs give up themselves single to that abominable sin idolatrie, without end and measure; I shall likewise suffer them to go on therein, and by that means, heap sin upon sin, until the time of their righteous punishment: or I shall carry them away among the heathen, where they shall have idolatrous altars to the fill, nay even be compelled to all manner of idolatrie. 1 Kings 15.16. and chap 15.30,34. and above 16.2.again chap 12.30. and 13.35. with the annotat.]
\p
\v 12 I prescribe him the excellencies of my law:[Or, doctrine, see Psal 1. on verse.2. The sense is; I have caused those excellent and glorious instructions of saving word, to be set before them, not only by word of mouth, but in writing also, very abundantly: by the keeping whereof they were sure to grow great and mightie: Compare Isa 4.2.21.] but those [viz. excellent instructions of my word] are counted as a strange thing [ i.e. they do reject the same, as if all my instructions concerned them not at all, and they had nothing to do with them they take delight in nothing, but their own humor, their own fancies and devices, and what they take up from the heathen.]
\p
\v 13 As to the sacrifices of my gifts, [ i.e. the free will thankoffering, which they pretend to offer me, (of those guists which I truly gave them) and whereby they would seem indeed to be mindefull of, and to despise me.] they offer the flesh and eat it, [ turning my sacrifices into profane gurmandizing, having no regard to my service, but onely to their panch and palate. Compare Jer.7. 21.] but the LORD hath no pleasure in them. [ i.e. in those scarifiers whose iniquity he will remember as followeth. Oth theirin, or in the same, viz. offerings. Compare below. Chap.9.3. and chap.11.5.11. or they shall return to Egypt, to treat with Egypt, for seaking the King of Assyria, who growing troubled thereat should destroy them. See 2 Kings.17.3,4,5 (thus by their iniquity should be understood, their perfidiousness and disloyalty against the Assyrian. Compare Ezek.21. 23. and 29.16.) then there should some of them go down into Egypt, eschew the destruction of the Assyrian ,See below chap.9.6.
\p
\v 14 For Israel hath forgotten his maker, [To wit God who not created them, but also made them his people, formed and raised them thus See Job 4. on vers.17. and Psal 100.3. Isa.51.13. and 54.5.] and builded temples [viz. idolatrous one s for the worship of the calves at Dan and Bethel and elsewhere; and thereby for the establishing of their state, to withdraw and keep back the people from Gods temple at Jerusalem, and to allure them to friendship and communion with the idolatrous heathen. Compare Eze.20.32. Oth places. See Isa 9.9.] and Juda hath multiplied fenced cities: [thereby to secure themselves against the enemies approach and surprisal, whereof the Prophets spake so much. See Isa. 22.8, 9. etc] but I will send a fire into his cities, [i.e. engage them in open war, and cause all the consequences of the same, all manner of plagues and miseries, to surrounding and consume them, See Job.15. on ver.34. and Amos1.34, etc.] the same shall consume their palaces.[ viz. in each cities of the land of Juda: in the Heb. We have her places, having respect to the land, or, each cities.]

\s God checks Israel for their idolatrous rejoicing in the harvest time, vers. 1. which he shall cause to take a speedy end, by the famine to come, the carrying of them away captive, the want of the public worship, the mourning and desolation of their land, 2 false and true prophets, are opposed one to the other 7. further complaint of Israel deep corruption, after the example of their thankful idolatrous fore – fathers, 9God threatens them with barrenners and slaughters of their children, 11. The prophet prayer for mitigation of punishment. 14. a further recital of their idolatry, with a denouncing of God wrath and judgment, 15.
\p
\v 1 Rejoyce not, O Israel, unti exulting, [Or, unto chearfulness, or jollity; Save the same phrase Job.3. 22. The Hebr. word hath respect to the outward gestures, and testimonies of rejoicing] like unto the nations; [ who upon a good harvest were to fronllique it, and shew much cheerfulness in honour of their idols, whom they held to be the authors thereof. Compare Psal 4.8 and here in the sequel; also Joel 1 on verse12.] for ye go whoring from your God; ye love harlots wages, on all thereshing – floor of corn. [i.e. ye rejoice in your harvest as the reward which ye suppose your Lovers, the idols, have given you for your spiritual whoredom, that is idolatry: and in all places where you thresh and store up your corn, and where ye presse and cellar wine, ye give thanks unti your idols, for the things which I gave you. Compare above chapter 2.7.]
\p
\v 2 The ( threshing) floor; and the wine – presse shall not feed them, [however they are persuaded otherwise] and the new – wine shall lie to her. [Or against, or under her, to wit, this whore or adulteresse, or Ephraim, Israel i.e. the hope they have conceived thereof shall fail and deceive them, they shall not enjoy it, it shall be laid up for the enemy, and they themselves must void this Countrey, as followeth. Compare above 8.7. and the phrase with Hab.3.17. Isa 58.11.and Job 40.28. and see the annot. There.]
\p
\v 3 They shall not remain in the LORDS land: [viz. in Canaan, which is frequently called Gods land and inheritance. See Psal 68. on verse 10. and Joel 1.6. and above chap 8. on verse13.] and [ or but, it the word going before be understoos of seeking help in Egypt against the Assyria, as if God should say, let them run to Egypt never so much, they must away to Assyria] they shall eat he unclean (thing) [which God had forbidden to eat in his law, and whereby, eating thereof, they became ceremonially unclean. Compare Ezek 4. 12, 13. Dan 1.8. and here in the next verse.] in Assyria [ whither they should be carried away captive.]
\p
\v 4 They shall [To wit, when they shall be carried away captive, and eat unclean things, of which sad condition of the Israelites the former verse spake] make no drink – offering of wine, [Heb. Shedding, pouring forth, or spreading abroad of wine, i.e. drink – offerings. Of wine – offerings see Psalm.16. on verse.4.] unto the LORD; as being forth out the land and place, etc. which God had appointed for sacrifices; and having consequently no opportunity or means to offer any clean thing to the Lord, as appreareth by what goeth before and followeth] also they would not be sweet unto Him [i.e. not acceptable or pleasing, as Jer.6.20. Mal.3.4.] their sacrifices would be tothem as mourning – bread; [Hebr. bread of the sad, or mourning (ones) i.e. such meat as is eaten in mourning – houses over the dead, all which by the ceremonial Law was unclean. See Levit.21.1, etc. and 22.4. etc. Num.19.14. also rhey were enjoined to offer wit joy, Deut.12.6,7.Wheresore some by the bread or meat, do understand the sacrifices. See Lev 3.11.and 21.6. Num.28.2.Ezek 44.7.] all that should eat thereof would become unclean, for their bread shall be for their soul, [i.e. their sustenance, meat, drink, and meals shall then, during their Exile, be over their dead, whom they lost thus, or as over their dead. (Compare Ezek.24.17.) for whom, or which thing they shall mourn continually, and therefore be unclean still. Thus the word soul is taken for a dead body, or dead person, Psal.16.10. and Levt.19.28. See the annot. There Oth for their own person, or for themselves( as the Heb word is likewise taken) that is they eat amnd drink for themselves, and not to honour God thereby (as ab. Ch.8. 13.) because some do understand that this verse doth not speak of the condition of their file, but what the Israelites were a doing new, and would do, until that time . Compare Zach .7.5,6.] it shall not come into the LORDS house.[i.e. the same being unclean may not be brought into the house of God, nor ought to be offered at all.]
\p
\v 5 What would yo do (then) upon a High – times – day, or upon a Feast – day of the LORD? [ To wit, when according to my precept ye should before me with cheerfulness, when as ye shall sit mourning then, and may not offer, and are without your land, and cannot. See Num.10.10. and Deut.12.12, etc. and comp.ab. chap.3. verse 4. and the annotat. On the former verse.]
\p
\v 6 For lo, they passé away [i.e. they shall surely be outed out of their land; Or they pass away, i.e. they perish, vanish away] because of the destruction: [to be made by that Assyrian] Egypt shall assemble them; [from these words it may be conjectured, that some of the Israelites flying before the Assyrians should betake themselves for shelter to Egypt, conceiving they should finde good entertainment and assistance there, forasmuch as they had forsaken the Assyrian, and adhered to the king of Egypt. See ab.ch.8.on vers 13. But how they should speed there, is foretold them here in the following words. Some are opinion, that first they retired among those of Juda, and afterwards together with them into Egypt] Moph [ the city of Memphis in Egypt, otherwise (as some think) also calleth Nop, Isa.19.13. See the annot there.] shall them; [and consequently they shall not return into their own land, but die and perish in exile] their silver shall be desired aster, [i.e. their money shall be greedily sought for, and preyed upon] nettles shall hereditarily possee them; [Heb. Nettle etc., their land and habitation shall lie waste for a long time, and remain without inhabitation shall lie waste for long time, and remain without inhabitant. Compare Isa 32.13. and 34.13. and bel. Chap.10. verse.8.By them, viz. men understand their land places of abode. See Judg.11.23. Jer.49.1. with the annotat. Others read, the pleasant (places ) or desired (shadows) of their silver, the nettle shall possess hereditarily. Desires, for desirable things made silver, or silver, or set forth, adormed with silver dressing of furniture] thorns shall be in their tents. [in stead of the stately dwellings they had there. Hebr. thorn or thistle. Compare Job 31.40 Isa.5.6. and 7.14.]
\p
\v 7 The days of visitation are come, the dayes of recompense are come; they of Israel shall perceive it: [Or, know, acknowledge it, i.e. remember and find then, that the truth was told them, and that they were deceived by their false prophets, whereof in the sequel] the prophet is a fool [ meaning the false prophet prophesying nothing but peace and prosperity] the man of the spirit [i.e. the prophet which falsely boateth to be inspired by the holy spirit, to have spiritual visions or revalations from God. Compare Ezek.13.0.] is mad; [Here God himself averreth that the false prophets, that the seducers, and wordly men use to say ubusively to God true prophets. See 2 Kings 9.11. and Jer.29.26, etc. Oth the man of the winde i.e. he that practiseth vanity and lies Compare Mich 2.11.] because of the greatness of your iniquity, the hatred also is great. [This may be understood of Ephraims great hatred, or obstinacy, violence, contrariousness, against God and his word; or of Gods hatred, which was great against Ephraim, and which he would shew forth in the foresaid dayes of visitation and recompence, and whence also it come, that God punished them with false prophets.]
\p
\v 8 The watchman of Ephraim is with my God: [i.e. the true Prophets whom God raised the ten tribes cleave steadfastly and firmly to my God, and his pure worship, as Elias, Elifa and other did, and I also do my self See of this title of the Prophets, Ezek.3. on vers.17. and Compare further Jer.12.3. and below chap.12. 1. also the phrase to walk with God Gen. 5.22. See the annotat there. Oth is there a watchman of Ephraim with my God? The Prophets &c. Oth. Ephraims watchmen (ought to be) with my God (but) etc. o th He (viz. the false Prophet, mentioned in the former verse) keeps watch against Ephraim, (that is) with my God; i.e. he watcheth to mischief those Israelites, which still keep close to God and his pure worship. See 1 Kings 19.18. wherewith the sequel also pretty well agrees. Compare ab. chapter 5.1, 2. and the annotat there.] (but) the Prophets [understand the fowler: [this may be applied to the spiritual taking & ensnaring of souls, and the bodily watching for, entrapping, imprisoning and murdering of the godly, mentioned in the former note] upon all his wayes; [upon all the streets and ways in Israel: or in all his doings and dealings in the false prophet no better then a snare etc. and hatred in the house of his God. [his viz. Ephraims, or the faithful watchmens; spoken of in the beginning of this vers. The false Prophet is justly hated of God and all good men, provoking and causing also nothing but Gods hatred against Israel, (called ab.8.1. the house of the LORD) by all his seduction and wicked practices]
\p
\v 9 They have corrupted themselves very deep, [Heb. They have deepened, they have corrupted. See of the joining of two such verbs, Psal 45. on vers.5. and of the Heb. Word above, chap.5. on vers.2.] as the dayes of Gibea: [even as those of Benjamin at Gibea, were fallen away to abominable idolatry, and evry one did then in Israel, what he pleased. Sed the History Jod.19. and compare below chapter 10.9] he shall their iniquity, [as above chap.18.13. See the note there] he shall visit their sins.
\p
\v 10 I found Israel as grapes in the wilderness, I saw your fathers, as the first frit on the tree in their beginning:[i.e. when I first took Israel for my people, they were as acceptable to me, as grapes are to wafting men, finding them in a wilderness, and so sweet and pleasing, as the first ripe figs on a fig – tree. Compare Mich.7. on vers.1.] (but) they went in (to) Baal Poer, [The idol of the Moabites, to commit spiritual adultery or whoredom with him, whereupon followed their carnal pollution. See Numb.25. 1,2,3, and the imitation of this example of their forrfathers.1. Kings 16.31,32, etc ] and separated themselves [ith an extraordinary idolatrous preparation for the Religious worship of this idols. The Hebrew word is the same from which the Nazirities, i.e. the separated ones had their name. See Num 6.2.] for that shame [i.e. that vile and base idol Baal. See Jer 3.24., 25.] and grew altogether abominable [Heb. Abomination, abominablenesses] after their lovers. [Oth. There were abominablenesses after their desires. i.e. all manner of abominations had their full sway and swing there, according to their own will and desire, even as their vile hearts could wish it. Some take it, as if God did set in opposition here, that now they were grown as odious and abominable to him, as formerly they had been pleasing & acceptable.]
\p
\v 11 As for Ephraim their glory [i.e. their kingdom happy estate and outward prosperity, and especially the maultitude of their children, wherewith they were adorned, and glorious, as followeth, See Psal.127.5. Prov.17.6.] shall fly away as bird, [ i.e. they shall be berest of them on a sudden, and be as little able to recover them, as the bird that is slown] (even) from the birth [i.e. as soon as they should be born] and from (the mother) [of the parenthesis here inserted. See Jud. 13. on v 5. and Job.3. on v. 10.]womb, and from the conception. [i.e. whiles they are in the womb yet, or, as soon as their mother shall have conceived them]
\p
\v 12 Though they should make their children great, yet will I hereave them theoreof, that they shall not be among men: [Or, that they shall be no men, or, that no man shall be left them. Compare Prov.30. vers.14.] for likewise wo unto them when I shall be removed from them.
\p
\v 13 Ephraim is like as I looked upon Tyrus, [Heb,. Tsor see of this city, Jos.19, on vers. 29, and 1 Kings.5. on vers.1. Isa.23. Ezek.27.]which is planted in a pleasant habitation: [this seems to have regard to the strength, pleasantness and prosperity of both these compared places] but Ephraim shall be made to bring forth [Heb. As if one should say, (is ready disposed, set) to bring forth. Compare Isa 38. 20. with the notes i.e. shall be forced to bring them forth, out of their pleasant habitations, etc.] until the murder. [i.e. to the Assyrians, their enemies Compare Job.27. 14. and Deut.28. 41.]
\p
\v 14 Give unto them, LORD, what shalt thou give them? Give them a miscarrying [Heb. child. bereaving ] womb, and breasts drying up[ the prophets being much troubled and grieved over these dreadful approaching miseries of the people, knoweth not what to crave first of the LORD in their behalf, but that they may rather have no children, at all, then surfer them, being grown up. To be thus murdered by the enemie. Compare Luke 23.29. Oth give them what thou shalt give them. I.e. give them what their sins deserve, and thy justice requireth]
\p
\v 15 All their wickedness is at Gilgal, [i.e. the principal idolatry is committed there, or what ever idolatry there is in the land, there they bring it together, whereas the remembrance of the mercies which God once shewed them there, ought rather to deterred them from idolatry See above chapter 4. on vers.15. and below chap.12.11.] for [ or, certainly, surely] there I hated them for the wickedness of their dealings; I will expel them out of mine house : [i.e. out of my land, or family, that they shall be my children and servants no more good] all their Princes are revolting. [or, rebellious, unruly, refractory.]
\p
\v 16 Ephraim is smitten, their root is withered, [As a green herb smitten by the heat of the sun, or otherwise hurt, that it can never grow nor blossom (Compare Psal 102.11.) so Ephraim is smitten (by God) from above, that his is spoiled underneath. Compare Job 18.16.Amos 2.9. Jon 4.7. and see the contrary Job 29.19.] they shall bring forth [Heb mike above chapter 8.7. see there] no fruits: yea though they engender, yet will I slay the disered (fruit) of their womb. [Heb the desires of their womb. [Heb. The desires o their womb, i.e. the disered and expected fruits of their bodies]
\p
\v 17 My God [Whom I serve and adhere to, as above verse.8. ] shall cast them away, because they do not hearken to him: they shall bbe wandering about among the heathen.[compare Gen. 4. 12, 14. Prov 27.8. 1 Kings 14.15.. and above chapter 7.13.]

\s Gods complains of Israels unthankfulness, idolatry (especially that of the golden calves) perjurie, wickedness, perverness and vain confidence in their own subtilties and champions; and all this, not withstanding his faithful warnings; and therefore he fortels them the destruction of all their idolatrous trumperies, and the carrying away of their golden calves, to their shame and disgrace together with the ruin of their king, and prosperous estate, and their extremity and disconsolate condition, in all the approaching evils, which, trough his just judgment , should by their enemies, be insticted upon them.

\v 1 Israel is an emptied vine; [Or, was etc. viz. by the tax of King Menahem who took a thousand talents silver from his subjects, for the king of Assyria, Pul. See 2 Kings 15.19,20. which some apply this unto. Compare ab. Chp. 7.9. Other understand it of their mad profuseness in spending upon all manner of idolatry, (whereof in sequel) reading the words thus (as seeming to come somewhat nearer the original) Israel is a vine emptying the fruit (which) he bringeth, or layeth up for himself i.e. by this idolatry doth bereave himself of what he receiveth through my blessing or closer yet, Israel emptieth the vine, be layes up the fruit for himself, viz. for idolatrous uses] he bringeth (again) fruit for himself, [i.e. he begins to bear again, through my blessing; which yet he grossely abuseth.

He makes the fruit like to himself , the fruit is like the tree, as he is preyed upon and exhausted by others, so he exhaust and spoils himself no less of his own means] (but) according to the multitude of his fruit he hath multiplied the altars, according to the goodness of his land, [i.e. the fertility and good revenues thereof, which I have graciously bestowed upon them] they made good the erected images.[i.e. Made, set them out very stately and richly, implying, the more I blessed them, the more wanton and vain they grow in their idolatry, spending all upon the same. Compare ab.ch. 2.8. and chapter 4.7.]
\p
\v 2 He [viz. God, expressly spoken of in the sequel, this seems to be the plainest meaning] hath divided their heart; [by the spirit of discord and division, whereby they undo each other. See above chap 7 7. and compare Jud 9. 23. and the annot] now they shall be said waste; [this is explained in the sequel. Oth. Be found guilty] he shall cut – thorow all their idols; [as the neck is cut – thorow to a malefactor, I.e. as it were behead them] he shall destroy their standing images
\p
\v 3 For now they shall say, [I.e. are long, shortly, (as in the former verse, and ab. chapter 2.10. and 4.16. Mich 4. 10, 13. Isa 40.29. Jer 14. 10. Amos 6.7. Mich 4. 10. and 7 10.) when their land, king and kingdom shall be destroyed; then experimentally finding; the truth of Gods threatenings, and being convinced of their selfwilled wickedness, they shall be bought to condemn themselves. [Compare bel. chapter 13. 10.] we have no king; [Compare bel. Vers. 7.15.] for we have not feared the LORD; what then should a king do unto us? [thought we had a king, what help or advantage can we have by him, if God be become or adversarie? Implying, none at all sure.]
\p
\v 4 They spake words, [This may be understood of haughty, bitter and spightful words which they uttered one against the other in their mutual consiracies; or, against God and his Prophets. Compare ab. chapter 7. 16. with the one, also Mal. 3.13 or of their manifold conferences and deliberations, (as words are likewise taken thus See 1 Kings 1 7. Ezek 38. 10. with the annot) for the maintenance of their idolatry and state against God, by Treaties with heathen kings, and confedencies with them, which they lightly sware to, in high words and as lightly brake again; which the following words seem to confirm] falsely swearing in making Covenant: [as doubtless they did, when they engaged themselves with the king of Assyria, and soon after sell off again from hi unto the king of Egypt, 2Kings 17. 34 Oth vainly, or I vain cursing , for wearing themselves, as wicked people use to do; See above ch.4 2.] therefore shall the judgment [I.e. their punishment, my judgment upon them. See Jer 48. on verse 21. and above chap 6.5.] spring forth as a poisonous herb [See Psal 60. on verse 22. I.e their punishment shall come increase abundantly, as worst weed in the field] upon the furrows of the fiel.
\p
\v 5 The inhabitants of Samaria shall be dismayed, [Heb. The inhabitants shall be affrighted over one of the Samaritane inhabitants shall be terrified] over the calfe [ understand the golden Calfe of Bethel. Heb Calves, or, Heifes, even as Behemoth, Beasts, I.e. a great beast, such as an Elephant, etc. For in the sequel this calfe is spoken of in the singular number, which must need have been set out very sumptuously and gorgeously, they having stood in such a frightful awe of it, and it having been carried away afterwards to the King of Assyria, as a great present. Otherwise this Calfe may in contempt be called heifer, because they had made themselves more then one, and fro time to time, the one stately and glorious then the other, see verse 1.] of Beth – Aven: [I.e. Bethel, as below verse. 15. see above chapter 4. on vers. 15] foe this people [ the calf his people, I.e. which adored and adhered to the calf as God. Compare Jer 48. 7 and 49, 3. ] shall mourn over the same, [Heb. Hath mourned, or, doth mourn I.e. shall mourn, from what goeth before and followeth] together with his chermarim, [understand, the idolatrous Priests of the calf, of whom see further, 2 Kings 23. on vers 5.] (who) rejoyced over it, over its glory, it being desperated from it. [I.e. because the glory of this calf is gone and past. Or, they mourn over the glory of this calf, the same calf being carried away into captivity, as followeth, compare Jer.48.7]
\p
\v 6 Yea, the same [viz, calf] shall be carried to Assur, for a present to the King Jareb: [See above chapter 5. on vers.13] Ephraim shall get shame, and Israel shall be made ashamed because of his counsel:[ in that he thought to have strengthened himself against the Assyria with Egypt, or in general, because of all his wicked idolatrous devices, and carnal policies, whereby he conceived he should maintain him self well enough, no thanks to God, (as the saying is) yea against him; and especially that counsel of Jerobeam of setting up the two Calves, which idolatrie he had devised for the establishment of his state and Kingdom. 1 Kin.12,27,28,29. and 2 Kin.17.21.]
\p
\v 7 The king of Samaria is cut off, [Or, concerning Samaria, her King is cut off, chopt off, destroyed or, perijed. I.e. shall assuredly be destroyed. See 2 Kin.17.4 and below vers.15.] as scurn upon the water. [which in boiling and bubbling water doth swell and raise as if it were something, though it soon abates and comes to nothing, thus shall the King wit all his pomp and state decay suddenly, and vilely and contemptibly be made captive, as if he were vanished away in the sight of all his people, like a scurn, together with the confidence they had put in him.]
\p
\v 8 And the high places of Aven [i.e. Beth – aven, as above vers.5. meaning Bethel] Israel sin, [which high places were the chiefest matter and motive, or enticement of Israel for the committing of their abominable idolatry, and all manner of other sins, which there in their Temples, by their Altars, and under every green Tree, and in the groves they constantly committed. Compare Deut 9.21. Isa.27.9. and see above chap4.13. Lev.26.30. Ezek.6,13. and 20.29. with the annotat.] shall be destroyed: thorns and thistes shall come up [compare above chapter 9.6.] upon their Altars: And they shall say unto the Mountains, cover us, and unto the Hills, fall upon us. [words of despairing people, who by rason of the apprehensions and terrour of the present and approaching Judgment of God, together with the Verdict of their own conscience, are so dismaid and disconsolate, that they wish themselves dead and dispatched they care not how, so they may be out of the reach thereof, through all in vain. Compare Luke 23, 30. Rev 6.16. and Isa.2.19.]
\p
\v 9 Since the days of Gibea, [Or, more then in the days &c. See chap.9.9 with the annotat] hast thou sinned O Israel : there they stood to it; [Or simply there they stood. This may be understood of the fearful obstinancie of the Gibeonites and others of the tribe of Benjamin, who shamelessly stood to their wickedness, and put themselves in battle – array like men, (as they were conceited of themselves) against their brethren, but were at last destroyed almost altogether. Or it may be taken thus, (which concernd Israel in general, seems to agree most plainly with the following text) that they, by Gods mercy stood as yet, and were not utterly destroye, though on both sides they stood in danger to be utterly destroyed even the one by the other] the battle at Gibea, against the children of perversness, [See 2 Sam 3. on vers.55. and understand the Gibeonites, with all the rest of the Tribe of Benjamin] shall not seize them [i.e. they shall not have no good, but be far more grievously punished; they shall not be able to stand to it now, as they did.]
\p
\v 10 It is in my longing [Or, I long, i.e. I have decreed it, and long or desire to execute the same, and will do it also. Compare Deut.28.63. Isa.24. and see the like phrase Job10.7.] to bind them; [as in the LORD should say: seeing they will not bow under yoke, nor be tied to my Lawes, nor coerced or constrained for their own good, I shall cause them now to be bound as malefactors by foreign Nations, for punishment, or, as oxen coupling and fastening them together, to draw and bow down under a strange yoke. See further on the next vers. Others binde read correct, chastile] and Nations shall be gathered against them, when I shall binde them, [or when they binde them, or, with, together with their binding or, binding them. I.e. these Nations shall bind them, through my righteous Judgment] in their surrowes. [As Ephraim and Juda had yoked themselves together like yoke of oxen, drawing together under their own yoke in the same surrowes of idolatrie and other sins, so I will likewise couple them together by the enemy for punishment, to go plowing under a strange yoke, &c. oth, in both their habitations, to wit Ephraim’s and Juda’s; or, for their two iniquities, having respect to the Calves of Dan and Bethel.]
\p
\v 11 Because Ephraim is an Heifer used to love threshing, [Heb. taught (See Jer.2. on vers 24.) loving to thresh: see the like joyning of two above chap.9. verse 9. the sence is, like a yong, wanton, skittish Cow, much rather goes treading the full sheaves (which was the manner of the threshing then. See Deut.25. on vers4.) and feeding on them, then drawing the yoke and doing to plough; so (implies God here) is Ephraim inclined to live in the world, according to his own lust and pleasure, rather then under my Government and guidance] therefore I have passed over the beauty of her neck: [i.e. that calf its godly fat, and smooth neck.Heb. goodness I shall bring under the yoke, that the fastness and goodliness of this neck, shall soon passé away, as to plowing oxen: other take it thus; that God for a long time had as it were, past by, winked at and spared Ephraim’s goodly neck, but that now he would serve him as followeth] I will ride Ephraim, Juda shall plough, Jacob shall harrow before him. [i.e. I shall punish them all, and sufficiently order and tame them, but Ephraim shall have the worst of it; Juda and the rest, shall fare ill enough, but more tolerably then ten Tribes; as for the beast it is toilsome enough to plough and horrow (i.e. to break the colds) but to have the ploughman on the back besides, or to ridden by a fierce rider is much harder. By harrowing for or before him, is understood nothing but plain hartowing the words before him, or for himself being a certain redundancies, usual in the Hebrew language, as in other also. Oth. Him, to wit. Juda, understanding, that Ephraim, as the mightiest, had now then overmastered, and gotten the better hand of Juda, see 2 King 14.13. 2 Chro.28.6 and above chap.6.11. with the annotat, or as some, Jacob, I.e. Israel or Ephraim; shall be brought to break the clods to him viz, Juda: Some read thus, I made Ephraim ride, Juda a plow, Jacob must harrow &c. as if God related here what benefits he had shewed him otherwise the whole may admit this reading also. If Ephraim, an heifer, had been used, loving me, to thresh, when I went by his godly neck, I would have made Ephraim to ride, Juda to plough. As in the former reading]
\p
\v 12 Sowe to your selves for (or, in) righteousness, reap for (a, according to ) mercy; [understand here with all; this is that which I ever set before you by my Prophet Compare 2 King 17.13. As to the phrase of sowing and reaping, compare above chapter 8.7. and see Job 4. on vers. 8. the sense is, endovour for true repentance, upright Faith and unsained love, that it may go well with you in soul and body] break up your selves follow ground: [See vers. Jer.4. On vers. 3.] because it is time to seek the LORD, until he come, and rain upon you [I.e. teach, instruct you; compare Joel 2.23.] righteousness. [I.e. the fruit of righteousness abundantly blessing you with his temporal and eternal Covenants bliss, which he promised unto those that walk in faith and love. Compare Psal 24. 5. Ezek. 18.20. and the annotat there. Unless this should directly be applied to the time of grace of the Messiah's who is our righteousness before God. Compare Jer. 23.6. Dan.9, 24, &c and above chapter 2. 18]
\p
\v 13 To ploughed wickedness, reaped perverseness, [The LORD implied hereby, [that all his exhortation and receipts were had in contempt by them, and that they went clean contrary to him in all things. The Hebr. Word rendered perverseness here, otherwise iniquitie, unrighteousness, craftiness, viciousness, hath in is place a letter more then ordinary, which by some, is expressed in the reading with the word meer. Compare Psa.3. On vers. 3. there may be understood by it the punishment of perverseness; as, iniquite, for the punishment of iniquity Lev.5.1 Psa.31.11 sin for the punishment of sin. Zach 14.19, &c. or, by reaping here in the former vers. The growth or increase, the procecution or continuance and steadie progress in good or evil] and eaten the fruit of the lie: [having, conversed with and practised lies, and relied upon the, ye now received the just reward and punishment thereof, as a fruit of your works your idolatrie , and heathenish confederaces: Or, ye eat lying – fruits: ye will be deceived of your expectation; your labour and confidence lies srustrates and disappoints you. Compare above. Cha. 9.2.] for the establishing of Government, to wit, thy idolatry, together with all manner of impiete and carnal confidence in thy self and in the alliances with thy lovers] in the multitude of thy champions.
\p
\v 14 Therefore shall there arise a great noise, [Or, upoar, tumult, clamour, outrie, such as happens in the time of great surprizal by an enemy] among thy nations, [I.e. the ten tribes] and all your strong holds shall be destroyed , [Heb shall in the singular, I.e. every one of them apart] as Salman [otherwise called salmaneser, or Samanasser, that cruel and proud Tyrant of Assyria. See 2 Kings 17.3, and 18.9,34,35. and 19.11,12,13.] destroyed Beth – Arbel [it is certain, where this place lay; some hold it to be a city I Israel beyond Jordan: Joseph, lib.antq.12. c. 18. and bil.14.c.31. Makes mention of city Arbela, lying in Galilee, which seems likewise to have been destroyed 1 Mach.9.2. Others would have it to be a province in Assyria, having its name from the City Arbel, whereabouts Alexander the Great overthrow the Persian King Darius, and ended the Persian Monarch. This history of Slman and Beth – arbel, was doubtless vulgarly known in our Prophets time] in the day of war: [I.e in that expedition, which is summarily related, 2 Kings 17,.13 as some conceive] The mother was dashed in pieces with the sons. [Se Gen 32. on ver.11.]
\p
\v 15 Thus hath Beth -el done unto you, because of the wickedness of your wickedness; [I.e. because your wickedness is so maniford great and abominable idolatrie, and other sins committed at Bethel or Beth – aven, as it is called above chap.5. Or Aven, chap 8. they are caused of all these plagues and miseries upon you ] Israels King [on whom they did relie so much, see above vers.7. And the annotat .] is utterly destroyed [Heb, rooted out, or cut off, he is cut off, I.e. shall surely be etc] in the day break. [I.e. very soon, or suddenly, even as the day break doth soon pass away with the rising of the sun. Or, at unawares; as when one is surprised in the morning. This may also be compared with Ezek.7. Etc. see the annotat there]

\s Gods love and and kindness to Israel, since their being in Egypt, with prophesie inter woven of Christ opposed to their disobedience, idolatry, unthankfulness, and, obstinacie verse 1,2,3,4,7. wherefore they should be carried to Assyria , and tyrannously dealt woth, 5,6. A promise of graciously mivigating the punishment, and Israel conversion to Christ, by the preaching of the Gospel 8, etc.

\v 1 When Israel was a child, [see of the Hebr. word Jer 1. on verse 6. the meaning is, when i first chose Israel to be my people, and made a Covenant with them. Compare Jer 2.2 and see the annotat there.] then i loved him: and i have called my son out of Egypt; [bringing him forth by divine power out of the slavery of Egypt, through the wilderness into the land of promise. By his son is meant Israel, whom God frequently, but especially Exod. 4. 22. by Moseh, in his speech to Pharao, doth call his son, yea, his first born, which place may compare with this, But that under these words there lies further hid a prophecie, touching only forgotten Son of the Father, our Lord Saviour Jesus Christ, the Head of all the spiritual Israel, his Church, appeareth clearly by Math 2. 15, Oth Israel being a child, which i loved, therefore i called my son forth out of Egypt: or though Israel be a child, yet do i love him; therefore i called &c. understand the first cause of Israel want of understanding and dullness and the second of Christ alone, whom the Father had called out of Egypt, for to execute the work of the Redemption in Judea Oth. thus, Because he is called my son out of Egypt: understanding both causes of Christ
\p
\v 2 (But as) [This is inserted here for the compleating of the sense, agreeing with the particle so in the sequel See Psal. 48. on verse 6.] they called them, so they went away from their face; [i.e. from the face of the Prophets, which called them to God; the sense is; the more Moseh and other true servants of God did call upon the Israelites to keep close to their God, and to cleave unto him, the more did they on the contrarie turn away from God, even in the sight of those good Prophets, unto all manner of the idolatry, turning their back to God and his messengers, and lending them but a deaf ear all their exhortations. Compare below vers. 7. and chapter 4.7.] they did offer to the Baals, and burnt incense to the carved images.
\p
\v 3 I nevertheless, taught Ephraim to go , [i.e. i taught him how to set and use his feet, a a mother doth with her child] he took them upon his arms, [these are the Prophets words, which he inserts here, between God, as if he had said; it is very true indeed, that he took them up and carried them upon his arms, as a father or mother and carried them upon his arms, as a father or mother do their child (see above v. 1.) especially being weary of going. See Exod 19.4. Deut. 1. 31. and 32.11, 12 Isa 63, 9. and Moseh, Num 11, 12 Oth And i took the their (Heb. his) arm: there being the like enter change to the singular and plural used in the sequel] but they acknowledge not, that bealed them .[i.e. that in all their streights and troubles i did sweetly and familiarly assist and deliver them Psal 30. on vers 3. and c. compare above chapter 7 1 and Exod 15 vers. 26]
\p
\v 4 I drew them with cords of men, with cordages of love [ i.e with such as man are or may be drawn with withall, kindly, sweetly, as one may well indure with out hurt, or annoyance. Compare the phrase with 2 Sam. 7. verse. 14 Isa. 8.1. These words do very lively set out the sweetness, kindness and long suffering or forbearance of God in leading of his people] and was unto them, as those that lift up the yoke from off their cheeks. [understanding that part of the yoke or muzzle, which bears much upon the cheek of the beasts while the labor, and which man used to remove, or lift up when there are to rest or feed: so, will God say, have i also dealt with Israel, giving the mush ease and the rest and food and followeth] and i reached forth fodder unto him. [viz. Ephraim. Heb. i caused meat, or , eating to encline to him: that is, as we used to say, i reached it to him not withstanding all this they were so disobedience to him, as is related in the foregoing and following words; therefore etc.]
\p
\v 5 He [ viz. Ephraim] shall not return into the land of Egypt, but Assur, he shall be his King: [although they rather which to return into Egypt, and shall also effectually descend thither for help and shelter against the Assyrians yet it shall be all in vain; the generality of the Ten Tribes shall be carried away by the Assyrian out of their own Land, and the more grievously plagued there then they were before in Egypt. See above chap 8 vers. 13 and 9.6. and the annotat. there, and c. compare above chapter 10 on verse 9.] because they refused to repent.
\p
\v 6 And the sword [ i.e war with all its train and consequences, see Lev 26 on verse 7 and Psal. on verse. 21 shall abide in his [ Ephraim's] cities, and devour and eat up the bars thereof; [Oth. members i.e. the parts and members of his Country, devouring and swallowing up the same, as a savage beast its prey: or his branches,(Ezek 17. 6.) i.e villages, laying abroad in the open Country, and being in respect of the Cities, as so many branch thereof] by reason of their consultations. [see above chapter 10 on verse 6.]

Oth they call him indeed upwards] unto the most high, but no one exalts (Him) [i.e. no man. see of the like use of the Heb, word as Ezr.4 on verse 3. Oth (people) doth not together exalt him i.e they do not owner Him in their assemblies. Him i.e. the most High, that they should give him the glory of their repenting, and seeking for comfort and assistance from Him: or, of givingg thanks unto him for his mercy; or exalts or lift up himself i.e. nun bestirs Himself or puts himself in a posture to hear and hearken, as good observers used to do, shewing by their out wards behavour of the body, the inwards motions and stirrings of the heart.]
\p
\v 8 How should i give up or Ephraim; deliver thee up or Israel? how should i make thee as Adama? put thee as Zeboim? [ understand withall, and as the other neighboring Cities] my heart is turned about within me. [ spoken of God, after the manner of man in some sought to set forth the greatness and incomprehensibleness of his compassions. See Lam 1.20. Gen 43. 30. 1 Kins 2. 26] my repenting is kindled together [Heb. as if one should say, my repenting's or repentanesses, or, comfortablenesses are burning together Oth . my bowels etc. God is said to repent, when he with holds, metigates or removes the deserved and treatned punishments, consequently by repentance here may be be understood the compassions and the bowels wit through compassion are warmed, affected and moved. See Gen on verse 6 and 243 and on verse 30. The whole verse, implieth; though he had well deserved, i should destroy all at once like Sodom Gomorra, etc, Gen 19, 24 Deut 29.23.. but the compassion and faithfulness, which i promised you in the Messiah (whereof in the sequel) do not suffer me so to do)

Ezek 16. 53. with the annotat.] for i am God [i.e. true and unchangable in my promises, Num 23. 19 Mal 3. 6 and c.] and no man the Holy (one) in the midsts of you; [ see Psal 71. 22and consequently, i will keep yet a people from my self to remain among you, and sanctifie them, for to serve me, and see. Compare Ezek 16.60] and i shall not come into the Citie.

Compare the phrase, with the above chapter 9.8. and the annot. Otherwise these worlds may also (in respect of the kingdom) be compared with ab. Ch.8.4. (see there) and bel. Ch.13.10,11.]and was faithful with the holy ones.[i.e. following the foot steps of the holy father , and hearkening to the pious and prophets, that were among them. Some do understand here the three persons o the Holy Trinity, comparing it with the words foregoing and Jol.24.19. and some are of opinion that the prophet here discribeth the time when the ten tribes first separated themselves from Juda, and some while after. Otherwise, but Juda is yet reigning etc. Though Juda was also much declined, and is sharply therefore rebuke of God by this very prophet in several places; yet priesthood and the outward worship ordained by God ; insomuch that the pious remnant among the ten Tribes, now and then, privily journeyed to Jerusalem, to attend the true worship there, as above in sundry places hath been observed. But among the ten Tribes, there was nothing of all this. See 2 Chron 12.12. and chap.13.6.etc. and chap 15.3. with the annotat.]

Chap 8.7. as alsoIsa 44.20. with the annotat ] and buneth after the East winde; [i.e. after that which shall be grievous and hurtful to them, as the east winde was in those parts; see Exod 10. on vers 13 and Job 27. on verse 2. an bel. chapter 13.15.] all day long he multiplieth lies, [i.e. false worship, hypocrisy, lies, abd deceit against God and his neighbour] and desolation, [i.e. after that which was in those parts; See Exod 10. on verse 13. and Job 27. on verse2. and bel chapter 13.15.] all the day long he multiplieth lies, [i.e. false worship, hypocrisie, lies and deceit against God and his neighbor] and desolation, [i.e. that which shall cause and hale on his own destruction; or he daily practiseth destruction and desolation of his neighbor; or he did it, during all his reign] and they make (a) covenant with assur, [i.e. the Assyrians, or king of Assyria. See ab. Chap.5.13. and 7.11. and bel. 14.4.] and the oil is carried to Egypt for a present to procure his favour. Compare 2 Kings 17.4. Isa 57.9. and see of such oil, Psal 133. on vers 2, etc.]
\p
\v 3 Also the LORD hath a controversie with Juda, [Or a plea, process, difference, viz. reason of their sins Compare above, chap 4. on verse1] and he shall make visitation on Jacob according to his ways: [Heb. And for to make visitation etc.i.e. He is ready prepared for it Compare the phrase with abive, chapter 9. on verse 13. or for to visit i.e and that to the end that he may visit Oth but over Jacob, .e the ten Tribes, shall be etc. understanding that God was pleading yet with Juda, and would continue warning them yet awhile, but as for the ten Tribes, them he would spare nor wink at no longer it being somewhat obscure, whether Jacob here do signifie Juda, or both together; whereof the opinions vary. Compare ab. Chap.10.11. etc. this is sure and plain, that the danger posterity of Jacob is sorely threatened here] he shall recompense him according to his dealing.
\p
\v 4 In ( the mothers) womb [ Of the infertion of the word mother. See Jud.13. on vers.5 and Job.3. on verse 10. and ab. Chap.9. v.11.] he [ viz. the the Patriarch Jacob their forefather, of whom some extraordinary passages and singular mercies of God shewed to him and to them all by him, are related here, thereby to shame and confound his dagenerate off - spring for their ingratitude] held his brother [Hsau] by the heels : [ in token that God through meer grace, had bestowed the right of primogeniture upon Jacob, forasmuch as by the right of he was incapable of it] and in his vigour, [which God enabled him with all to hold out] he carried himself princely with God. Understand in what wresting combate which he held with the Son of God, see the history Gen.32.24. etc. and the annot there.]
\p
\v 5 Yea, he carried himself princely against the angel [i.e. the son of God, called God in in the former verse, and in the sequel, the LORD, the God of best, see Gen 48. on verse 16.] and overpowered (him) [i.e. had that better in the combate with the angels, to wit the son of God suffered himself to be overcome by Jacob, not out of any weakness or insufficiency, but to hold forth thereby a most sweet and comfortable mystery, of the combate and overcoming of all the children of God] he wept.[ Jacob wept and prayed earnestly for blessing, when he perceived with whom he had to do there, viz. with God himself. Of this weeping we finde nothing recorded in Mosehs history, but here the Holy Ghost inserted it, by way o explanation] and besought him: (at) Beth – El he found him, [the son of God found Jacob there and appeared unto him, See Gen 3 5 .9, etc. and so in the sequel, he spoke, to wit, the same son of God] and there he spake with us: [we being then yet in the loyns of Jacob and our forefathers; so that it concerns us also, what God spake there, and did the, in the behalf of our forefathers See Psal 6. on vers.6.]
\p
\v 6 Namely, the LORD, the God of hosts; [see 1 Kings 18. on vers. 15 and Compare Gen.22. on vers11. and 48. on vers.16. Psal 24.10. Isa 6.1,2,3,4,5. and chap9.5. and 25.9. etc. the son of God being in spoken of before under the name of angel and understood under the word him in the sequel, this title is added here now, to shew forth his divine majesty: now that the Heb letter, or, particle Vau, is frequently take into signifie namely, or, to wit, is sufficiently known and agreeth very well with what goes before, as the discreet pious reader will be easily able to judge.] Lord is his Name of remembrance. [or, Memorial Heb. Remembrance i.e.] JEHOVAH is the name, whereby (as signifying the eternal, self – substing, unalterable etc. being of God ) he is known among his people, and both himself, and all his attributes in remembrance. See Gen 2. on verse 4. and Compare Ex3. 14. 15. with the annot. Some refer this to Jacob thus; the LORD (was) his viz. Jacobs, memorial]
\p
\v 7 Thou then [viz. Ephraim] turn then to [ here in the Hebrew text, there is the letter Beth put for the letter Lamed, or for the particle El, or I nad i.e. to, unto. As in these phrase, 1 Kings 2.33. their blood shall return upon the head of Jacob, and upon the head f his seed; where the letter Beth twice constructed with the verb return is of the same signification with the forgoing particle Nal. I.e. upon, or, unto; as otherwise also the particle in, or, into, both in our own and other languages, is taken for to, unto when it is constructed with words signifying to go, tyravle, turn, return as to go into the field, into the wilderness, into a city, countrey, i.e. to unto, or towards it, insomuch that the some do hold it needless, by reason of the letter Beth to read here, turn thee with (or through) thy God i.e. with or, through the grace or help of thy God; where of the understanding reader may judge himself; and compare the annotat on Joel 2.12,] thy God: that from the beginning shewed so great mercies to your forefather,and by him unto your selves, as above ] keep mercy and judgment, and wait continually upon thy God. [forsaking, all your idols, and vain carnal confidence; so shall give God his honor, and not be forsaken by him.]
\p
\v 8 In the merchants [see of his signification of the Hebrew word Canaan, or Kenaan. Job 4. on verse 25.]hand is [Heb from the beginning of the verse. The Canaanite in his hand is, Oth (he is) a Canaanite, or in anger and detestation. That Canaanite; as if the Prophet should say: That bastard or degenerate issue; he carrieth himself no-more like one of Jacob children, but in both in condition and resemblance more like a heathen, and one of the Cains brood] a deceitful balance, [Heb ballance of deceit . See Lev 19. 13.35. Deut25. 13.1. Thes4.6.] he loves to appresse.[ as well by substil and unjust practise in his dealings, as by willful and violent seizers and robberies. The whole verse implies in opposition to what was sais before: Yr are so far from shewing mercy and doing justice, that ye are practicing the clean contrary]
\p
\v 9 Nevertheless, Ephraim faith, however I am grown rich, and have gotten me great wealth, [hebr. found me etc. as Gen26.12. Ezra 7.16. Prov 8,9. etc. as if they said, Let the prophet say what they will, it goeth still well with us, therefore God cannot be so much displeased with us, as they would make us believe. This was one of their shameless hypocrisies wherewith they encompassed God it were and his prophets. Compassed God as it were and his prophets. Compare Amos 6. ver.13.] (in) all my labour they shall find me no unrighteousness, [understand the labour and pains which they took to grow rich, or the riches which they got by their labour. Oth all my labour is not enough for me, as the Hebrew word to find, or be found, is sometimes used. See Num. 11. on verse 22. we desire to get and to lave more still, we must go on as we began.]that were sin [ as if they said, it is plain by our prosperity, that we do sin so such and such means to grow rich; what need then these busie men, the prophets be thus clamouring and cpating still at our practise? (he hath) unrighteousness. I.e. he is able to suffer for unrighteousness, that (hath) sin, we are not punished, (urge they) therefore, we are clear of sin.]
\p
\v 10 But I am the LORD thy God, [Not to dishearten the faithful and elect, by these sharp reproofs that went before, the LORD, (according to his custom) subjoynes this comfort here, for to assure his, that He, not withstand all this; would faithfully keep his covenant of grace, in the Messiah, with his chosen Israel. But others take two following veres, as a relation of Gods mercies in former and latter times, shewed unto his people, thereby to convince them, that he was the sole Author of all their welfare, and that they have not the least ground to beast of their own abilities, how presumptuously so ever they did it, as was shewed in the precedent text.] even from the land of Egypt, [i.e. ever since I bought you forth by the hand of Moseh, out of Egypt: when I made my convenant with you, and gave you my lawes; which time God elsewhere calls their youth se above chap.2. verse 14. Jer2.verse.2. etc. ] I shall make you dwell in tents yet: [these promises, looking to the time of grace in the new testament, are set forth in terms and phrase taken from the state and condition of the old testament. Compare above chap.2. verse 13,17. and 11 on verse 11.] as in the days of the congregation [as in the wilderness I caused you to camp pleasantly in your tents, round about the tents of the congregation; so also will cause you yet in the time of the new testament to come and take place in my Church, by the preaching of my gospel; where you shall have your assemblies to worship me. Oth as in the days of the set high –time, to wit the feast of the leaf huts, when for a certain time you had your abode in tents or huts, to mind you of your wandring through the wilderness, and to rejoice in the mercies I bestowed upon you. Or it may be understood of all the high – times or feasts, whereon , they were like wise to set up abundance of tents without the cities because of the multitude of the people meeting then together.]
\p
\v 11 And I will speak to [or, by, ] the Prophet, and I will multiply the vision: [ that is, I will most gloriously reveal my self by the plentiful preaching of the Gospel, which shall be made unto you, by the Prophet of all Prophets, the Messiah, and by his Prophets and other teachers of the new testament; with sending forth the gift of my spirit. Compare Joel 2.28.29. Act 2.16,17,18. etc.] and by the ministry [Heb hand] of the prophets, will propound Parables [i.e. teach men in most familiar plain way. Compare Mat13.34,35, etc]
\p
\v 12 Assuredly Gilead [see above chapter 6. verse 8.with the annotat, here Prophetreassumes his former reproof – sermon] is unrighteousness, [i.e. nothing but unrighteousness unjustice full of violence and wickedness. Oth idolatry, because the Hebrew word is sometimes taken for an idol, idolatry, idolatrous worship. See 1 Sam 15.23. Isa.66.3. these words may also be taken thus : is Gilead iniquity? As if they objected to the prophet, Darest thou lay that to their charge? Whereupon the Prophet should make his answer as the followeth]they are meer vanity; [Heb. Onely etc. I.e they are given to nothing but to all manner of Idolatryor, certainly they are vanity] at Gilgal they offer oxen: [See above chapter 4 on verse. 15.] yea their altars are as stone (heaps) upon the forrowes of the field i.e. all the land is full of their idolatrous idols.]
\p
\v 13 Yea Jacob [Here now again is set before their eyes the low and troublesome condition of their forefather Jacob, to shew what would have become of them all, if God had not by a most singular mercy, turned all to the best that happened to him, and dealt with them as followeth in the next verse. Compare Deut 26.5. with the annot.] sled to the field of Assyria: [viz, before his brother Esau; see Gen 27.42, 43 and chap 28.5. etc. This seemeth to be the plainest reading and sence of these words, field, that is to say, land here, as Obad verse 19 .] and Israel served for a wife [ Jacob served Laban for Lea and Rachel] and kept (shheep) for a wife
\p
\v 14 But the LORD carried out of Egypt, [i.e. the people of Israels or Jacobs posterity ] by a Prophet [ the great Prophet Moseh] and by a prophet hhe was kept [i.e. Ggod kept and preserved them by the Moseh, as shepherd doth his flock : this is said in regards of Jacob in his keeping sheep, spoken of in the former vers.]
\p
\v 15 Ephraim (on the contrar) provoked him very histerly to anger, [Heb. (with ) bitterness. Others (with) high places, heights, tops, idolatrous pillars, or, pillar – images; see of the word Tantarim Jer. 31 on verse 21] therefore he [i.e. God, whom he did not know, nor fear, nor serve. See Mal chapter 1. verse 6] shall leave [or spread forth] his blood upon him [Heb, blood i.e. murders and slaying of the innocent and the punishment thereof. See Gen 4. on verse 10. and 37 on verse 26. and Judg 9. on verse 14, or. leave his blood upon him, i.e. leave them in their pollution and sins without cleaning them from the same. Compare Ezek 16. vers. 6.9. Joel 3.21.] and his LORD shall recompose him his reproach. [i.e. Ggod shall avenge upon them the reproach and contempt, which they did put upon him, his prophets, and all the godly.]
\c 13
\s Ephraim's authority and excellency dieth and vanisheth through idolatry, vers.1. &c. a representation of Gods terrible anger, provoked by Ephraim's base unthankfulness against their onely and gracious Saviour, from verse. 1. 104 the cause of Israels corruption and the approaching miseries, is idolatry, avin confidence, and stupid impenitentie, 9. gracious Gospel promises for Ephraim, after the forgoing destruction, 14
\p
\v 1 When Ephraim spake, men trembled; [Oth when Ephraim spake trembling, or with trembling Heb. when Ephraim spake, trembling; (sustantive) the meaning is. The tribe of Ephraim was in for mer times, answerable to the blessing of the Patriarch Jacob, Gen. 48. 19.20. ) Of thhe authority and power in Israel, that very one trembled as it were, when he appeared resolved in business, whereby also in the time of King Rehabeam it came to pass that he first assumed the kingdom of the tribes unto himself by means of the first King Jerobeam, see jud 8.1,2,. etc. and 12.1,2. 1 King 11.26. and chap 12.20.] be exalted himself: [to wit to the kingdom. Of the Hebr,. word that signifying a Prince, ruler, Governour, that is exalted above another, which is here aimed at] but he is become guilty and Raal, [Baals idolatry see ab. chapter 2.8. 13.] and is dead. [that is he hath now lost all authority, and is decayed to very miserable and contemptible estate, both with God and men at home abroad. (Compare the phrase with Psal 31. 13 and 88. 4,5,6. and 143 .3. Isa 59. 10. Amos. 2. 1. Rev 3.1. and 20. 5.) the royal dignite it self is taken away from him see 1 King. 14. 10,11. and chap 15. 27, 28, 29, 30. and compare verse.3.]
\p
\v 2 And now they went on to sin , and made a molten imgge of their silver, [understand the idolatrous image of claf (whereof see in the sequel ) and others such like evn as they pleased and fancied, and not at all, as God would have it. Of the word sins in matters of Idolatry , see above chap 8. on verse11] idols, [see above chap 8.4.] according to their understanding [i.e. shaping and dressing them with all the art and skill they could . Compare Jer 10.3, 14. etc.] which are all together Smith work: [a mocking at the vanity, folly and frivolousness of this idolatry. Compare above chap 8.6, etc.] whereof they say nevertheless ; [they viz, the idolatrous Priest and Governors. Oth they say to them, viz. those of Ephraim unto the other Israelites] the men that offer [Heb, the offering of man, or, men] ought to knife [viz. religiously, with divine worship. Compare Gen. 41. 40 1 Kings 19.18. Job. 31.17. and see the annotat there] the calves. I first set up at Dan and Bethel , and afterwards, probably, in divers other places besides . See 1 King.12.28. according as from time to time they encreased in idolatry; the meaning they drive at is, such men or such among men, as mean or intent to offer unto God, they must worship these calves, as their God. See 1 Kings 13.28. and compare the phrase with Isa 29. 19. where it is said, the needy , or , destitute (ones) of a man (or, men) i.e. among men such among men needy or necessious; again, the miserable of the sheep, Zach. 11. 7, 11. for the miserable among them, and many such like]
\p
\v 3 Therefore they shall be as an early coming dew, that passeth away [i.e. they shall soon and easily pass way come to nought with all their shew and flourishings, as these comparisons import. Compare above chap 6.4. ] as chaff from the threshing floor, and smoke is stormed away out of the chimney, [or, window Oth smoke – hole, or opening whereby the smoke is let forth. ]
\p
\v 4 Yet i am the LORD thy God: from out of Egypt [As above chapter 12.10.] therefore should thou know Ggod but me alone; [Oth and thou knowest no God etc. viz. at that time , when thou wast not fallen away yet to idolatry] for there is no Saviour besides me.
\p
\v 5 I have known thee in the wilderness; [i.e. i loved and provided for thee, there, as Amos 3.2. see Psal 1. on verse. 6.] in very hot country .[ and consequently, a dry and barren one, extreamly troublesome. See Deut 8.15. and ch. 32.10.]
\p
\v 6 After that, according as their pasture was, [i.e. after that they came forth out of the wilderness into the fat foil of Gilead, and further into the land of Canaan, meeting with influence and abundance of all things. See Deut 7.8,9,10. and chapter 32.13,14] they grew full; being full, their hhears exalted it self : [whereof God had timely forewarned, and forthwith punishment them. See Deut 8.11. and chap 32.15,19. 20. etc. ] therefore they forgot me [Hos. 8.14.]
\p
\v 7 For this i became unto them as fierce Lion; [i.e. idealt severely and terribly with them, as happened frequently as first, in the time of Judges, by sundry enemies seated about thhem, and afterwards, whhen they were divided seated about them, and afterwards, when they were divided from Juda by the Assyrian Tiglath – Pileser etc. See 2Kings 15 29. Howbeit some take both this and the following verse for the time to come, as prophesie of that desolation, which should be made by Salmanasser. Compare above chapter 5.14 Lam 3.10.] i lurked for them by the way, as a Leopard. [Compare Jer 5.6.]
\p
\v 8 I encountered them, [or, will encounter them, and so in the sequel] as a Bear berest of hher whelps. [Compare 2 Sam 17.8. Prov. 17.12. ] and tore the lack of their hearts; [i.e. their heart, or hearts cover, to suck the drink their hearts – blood, as savage revenous beasts use to do] and i swallowed them there [upon the place, as they say, or there where thhey had committed the foresaid abominations, in Canaan or Gilead. Some apply it in particular to Tiglath – Pilerser his invitation 2 Kings 15.29.] as an old Lion, the wilde beasts of the filed did tear them [Oth (or as) an (other) wilde beast of the field (that) split (or clave them asunder : understand the cruel heartenish Enemies, by whom God had, or yet would deal thus wit them.]
\p
\v 9 I t hath corrupted thee, O Israel, [it , to wit, thy idolatry and wilful wickedness, spoken of above verse 2. 6. Oth. he hath corrupted thee, viz. Ephraim (spoken of both before and after this passage ) he it is, that brought Israel, (i.e the Ten Tribes ) into this destructive condition, by means of his king Jerobeam,(hinted in the next verse, to which also some apply this, Compared bel. chapter 14.5,6. where him expressed, verse 5. and who that should be, is shewed verse6. viz. Israel. Compare also ab. chhap. 12.5,6. and elsewhere) who together with is princes during the 22 years of his reign (1Kings 14.20.) contrived and advance this abominable idolatry, by all the all the subtilties and violence they could invent, whereby Ephraim not onely died himself, (as above verse 1) but also by his Baals and calves – worship, and all manner of thence – ensuring enormities and abominations precipitated all Israel beside, together with himself, into death and prediction. See 1 Kings 14.15, 22 etc. which could not happen otherwise, for no salvation or help is to be sout or found any where but with the only true God, as followeth here, and is testified above verse. 4. whom they foresaking, and seeking for help and salvation elsewhere, they must needs be wholly corrupted and utterly perish together] for in me is thy help [and not your Baals, golden Calves, Kings, Princes, Champions, strong holds, fenced cities, Leages and Alliances , wealth and riches, etc. wherein ye, according to Ephraim example and advice, did put your hope and confidence : otherwise this verse may be read thus. It is thy perdition, or, undoing, or it hath corrupted (spoiled) thee, O Israel, that thou hast (rebelled) against me, whichh translation,( being somewhat discrepant, in a ggood sense) is like plain and blameless the last words in the Hebrew properly are thus, in me, in thy help. Of such a use of the Hebrew letter Beth see Psal 54. on verse 6. or thus, but in me is (that) which may (be) for (tend to) your help.]
\p
\v 10 Where [see of the Heb. particle on verse 14.] is thy King [viz. on whom thow didst so much relie, and firmly hope, the would have saved and defended the well enough: thus the LORD doth mock their vain confidence speaking of the time to come as ready past or present. Compare above chap 10 verse 3.] now? [thus the Hebrew particle Epho is likewise used for now or then, to compleat a sense: Job 9.24. and chap 17.5. and chap 19.6. Isa 19.12, and 22 Oth i shall (or, should be) thy King, where is there (another) that he &c. or that should save thee. Or, i shall be there (but) where is thy King etc. as if God should say, i am abide the same forever, (see Exod.3. verse 14) therefore ye ought to have sought your help and salvation in me; but ye trusted in your king, who appears no where now. Compare above chap 10.15] to save you in all your Cities; and Judges.[ The Council and Governors, that should have assisted the King, to protect you] of whom ye said; give me a King and Princes: [viz. in the time of the Prophet Samuel. See 1 Sam 8.5. unless it were, that those of Ephraim may have used such language, suitable to their haughtiness and insolence, in the time of Rehabeam, when they separated themselves from Juda, and made them King of their own, over the ten Tribes, which God by secret counsel so ordered and declared, as done by himself (1King 11. 31, 35) although the people guilt was nothing the less]
\p
\v 11 I gave a King in mine anger [Meaning Saul: some apply it to the first King of the ten Tribes, being of the tribe of Ephraim, and having corrupted Israel, as above verse. 9. see further 1 Sam 8.7. and 1 King 11.33 above here 8. vers. 4] and took (him) away in mine indignation[ viz. Saul. see 1 Sam 15.23. and ch 16. 1 chap 31.4,6. Some tender this here, i will take (him) away: applying it to the last King of the ten tribes Hosea, subdued by Salmanasser, and in whom the Kingdom of Israel ended, 2 King 15. Compare above cha. 10. ver.3,7 15. Others understand it is general of the Kings of the ten Tribes, withh whom God is dealing here (compare above chap 8.4. and 7. 16.) and read it thus i gave a King, etc and take (him) &c.]
\p
\v 12 Ephraim iniquitie [ Whereof above on verse. 9, &c.] is bound up together, his sin is laid up. [i.e. their provocations, all of them are wrapt and tied up together in a bundle or bag, close and sealed, and laid up as it were in Gods chamber of Rolls or Chancery, to be produced in due time, for to be fully discovered, judged and sentenced. Compare Job 14. 17. Lam 1.14. Deut 32. 34 and see the annotat there.]
\p
\v 13 Pangs of traveling (women) shall come upon him [i.e. very great and grevous trouble and distress, as elsewhere frequently] he is an unwise child [i.e. as most senseless, or forward, or mis- shapen child, that labours nothing to facilitate his own birth, and stands, (as we use to say) in his own way and light] for (else) he would not be tarying any time in the birth of children. [Or, thus: for he stands not timely, (or, in due time) in the bringing forth of Children, i.e. in the womb, or birth labour. Compare 2 King 19.3. and see the annotat there. Some understand it of the chair , wherein the traveling woman sitteth. The sense is that Ephraim, in stead of timely preventing his approaching calamity, by serious and active repentance, he continueth obstinately to perish in his wickedness and impenitency against all exhortations warning & threatenings whatsoever; even as a child in the birth, that by its un – or ill – disposedness destroying it self and mother at once, when as other, even the most senseless smallest creatures known by a natural instinct, how to dispose themselves for to avoid the danger in this behalf.]
\p
\v 14 (Yet) [Here the LORD inserts again an excellent Evangelical promise, for the comfort of his Elect and penitent children. Compare above chap 12 v 10., 11. with the annotat as if the LORD should say; the unfaithfulness and protracted repentance of the generality of this people, sjall not whit retard or disannual my faithfulness and truth of my gracoius promise , see Rom 3. 3. and 11. 1, &c.] i will deliver them from the power of hell, i will free them from death: [Heb from the hand of hell etc i.e. the graves,See Job 5. on verse. 20. Psal 49. on vers. 16. the meaning is, i will deliver my chosen Israel, through the Messiah, Jesus Christ, from all their spiritual enemies, and cause them to rise from death, (which had power over them through sin) unto the glory of eternal life. See 1 Cor 15. 54, 55] O death, where are thy pestilences? [i.e. where is all thy poison, or, venemous power, or thy strong prestilence, whereby thou didst bear so much sway and madest such havock among my people; the plural number, serving here as elsewhere, for the exaggeration or aggravation of the thing spoken of . The sense is, as if God should inser, these, these plaues are no where more to be found; they are altogether made void , and destroyed. With this allocation God desies & insults over death and grave in triumph as it were over their conquest.(Comp Isa 25. 8) te Hebrew particle is here twice (as also above vers. 10) rendred, where, out of 1 Cor. 15. 55 where the Apostle doth alledge and expound it thus; also the Greek Translator (and the Chaldee paraphrase as like, ver.10.) had done, and some of the Hebrews themselves approve of, otherwise we may also read thus, Death i will be thy prestilence, grave i will be thy destruction}] Hell where is thy destruction ? [or, consumption, rooting out, cutting off, the like Hebrew word we have Deut 32.24. Psa 91..6. Isa28.2.] Repentance shall be bid from mine eyes (i.e. it shall never repent me to have past those gracious Decrees, i will perform the same without fail. That which is hid before Gods eyes is not at all, and therefore there shall be no repentance at all God of is promise.]
\p
\v 15 For he shall bring forth fruit among the brethren [i.e. Ephraim, how small apearance or likelihood soever there be now of it, shall yet, being planted in my Church, bring forth, as a good tree, very good fruit s, i.e. having ggotten faith and repentance, he shall be practisingg of good works, See Mat 3. vers. 8,&c. This promise by the word Japhi i.e. shall bear fruit, or be fruitful , doth very sweetly allude to the name of Ephraim . Compare below cha.14. 7,8,9. Oth for he (the Messiah, Ephraims Redeemer or deliverer spoken of before) he shall make him (Ephraim) fruitful: understanding moreover all the rest of this chapter, of the power and might of Christ against His, and his Churches foresaid enemies] (but) there shall come an eastwind , [Here the Prophet returns to his reproof – sermon. Compare above chap 4. on vers. 19. and 12. 12. and 12 on v 2, and Ezek. 19.12] and a wind of the LORD, coming up out of the wilderness; [and consequently very powerful, uncontrouled, unavoidable, passing through all. Such a one as God himself would raise, through his righteous Judgment, for the punishment of Ephraim, until Christ should gather the again] and his spring vain shall dry up, and his fountain shall grow drie [viz, Ephraims and the rest of the Tribes that did follow is evil example. i.e. they shall bereaved of all the power and wealth, which through Gods blessing they enjoy, as is made plain by the sequel] the same [viz winde, that it is to say, the enemie, the Assyrian, that was just now, compared to the Eastwind] shall spoil the treasure of all desirable [as Nah 2.9.] household staff. [see of the Hebrew word Lev 15. on vers and Ezech 16. on verse. 17.]

\s Israel is exhorted to true repentance, and taught how to practise the same vers. 1, &c. with gracious promises of the grace and blessings to come, under the Messiah a. They are further directed headfuly to observe, consider and put in put in practice both these and all other godly instructions, 10.

\v 1 Samaria shall be laid waste [ Aswell the capital or mother city, as the country and religion about the same, See 1King.13. on verse, 22. and chap 16. on verse, 24 This verse belons yet to the former chapter . See the fulfilling of this prophesy, 2 King 17.5,6, &c.] for shhe hath been rebellious against the LORD fro God: they shall by the sword, [the inhabitants namely] their little children [see the word Ps.8. on verse. 3.] shall be dashed in pieces, [Hos. 10. 14.]] and her [viz. Samaria's] (women) with child [compare above chap 13.8.] shall be cut up.
\p
\v 2 Convert thy self, o Israel, even unto the LORD thy God: [Compare this phrase with Joel 2. on verse 11] for thou are fallen for thine iniquity. [Compare above chap 4. 5. and 5.5.]
\p
\v 3 Take (these) words with you, [understand the conses of your sins, with the servent and faithful prayer for grace and forgiveness, joyned with sincere promised of thankfulness, whereof the pattern followeth] and convert your selves to the LORD, say to him; Take way all iniquity , [i.e. forgive it, imput it not. See Psal 25. on vers. 18 and 32. on verse. 1.] and give the good; [i.e. all manner of spiritual blessings or mercies and benesits: see Mat 7. vers 11. Compare with Luke 11. vers.5, 13] so shall we pay [i.e. shew our due thankfulness for thy undeserved mercie] bullocks of our lips ] or thus, bullocks, i.e. the beasts themselves, of our lips: or bullocks, (with) our lips; or, as if they did say, we know well enough; that thou art not satisfied with the saying and offering of beasts, therefore we shall offer unto thee the spiritual sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving. See Psal 50.14 and 116. 12. 15. Heb 13.15 &c.]
\p
\v 4 Assur shall not save us, [We will not put our trust any more in men, or, without thee; all besides thee being vanity, and the relying on it, apparent ruin. See above chap 12.2, &c.] W e will not ride upon horses, [Heb horse i.e. We will consider no more in any humane means, nor travel to and fro, or send abroad for help an confederacies; compare above chap 5.13. and 7. 11. and 12.2.] nor say (any) more to the work of our hands and idolatrous images and representation; See above chap.13. vers. 1,2, &c] Thou are our God : [or Gods] however [thus the Hebrew word is likewise used, 1 Sam 15.20. or yet, or, let i pray, as petitioning] an orphan be visited by thee; [ a very pathetical conclusion of his panitent and faithful prayer whereby they acknowledge, that there is no salvation for them any where but God alone, they being here on earth, (much like orphan) wholly destitute of any humane help, and are humbly confident, that God will not reject such orphans, crying unto him for mercy and compassion. Compare Lam.5. 3. and Psa.10. 14. and 68. and 146.9. Job 14.8]
\p
\v 5 I will heal (or, cure) their backsliding; [A most sweet and father answer and promise of God, upon the foregoing penitent, forgiving them all their evil, and iving them good things, as they desired above verse. 3. see Psal 30. on vers.3.] i will love them freely [or, liberally, from a good heart (as the saying is) the compare Deut. 30. 9. Jer 32.41,42 Jobn 18.26,27 and see the Heb. word, Lev 7. on vers. 16. Job 12. on vers.21] for mine aner is turned away from him. [viz. from Israel , expressed by the name presently in the next verse, and above verse 2.]
\p
\v 6 I will be unto Israel, as the dew, he shall blossom, as the lily [ These promises, representing by very elegant comparisons, the grace of Jesus Christ ,and the abundance of spiritual gifts, do all belong to the Covenant of grace in the new testament , and are grounded upon the Messiah, our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom all promises are yea and Amen, 2 Chron 1.20. appertaining to all Israel, that is, to the whole church of believing Jews and Gentiles. Compare above chap.13. on verse. 14.] and he shall cast forth his roots, like Lebanon [i.e. like the trees, that stand on mount Lebanon; (and so verse 7.) where the sweet – smelling frankincense doth grow, from which it is conceived this mountain had its name: for Lebona doth signifie frankincense, and this mountain is called in Hebrew Lebanon]
\p
\v 7 His shoots shall spread themselves abroad [Heb. shall go etc] and his glory shall be as the Olive – trees, [compare Isa60. 13. Jer. 11.16. Ezek. 31.3,7,6,9.] and hhe shall have a smell like Lebanon
\p
\v 8 They shall return, [i.e. the true Israelites shall convert themselves; as they are are exhorted to do above vers.2.] sitting [Oth read the verse from the beginning They shall sit again] under his shadow ; [refreshing themselves and being secured under the LORD his fatherly protection. See Ruth 2. on verse. 12 Psal . 91. 1.] they shall bring forth to life, as corn, and bossom as the vine: [i.e. they shall be fruitful and multiply : understand this especially to the spiritual fruits, which they should bring forth as new and regenerate creatures, themselves, and cause like wise others, by means of teaching and edisying, to bring forth the like, through the powerful working of the holy spirit, that quickens us unto good. Compare Psal. 72. 16. and see the annotat there.] his remembrance shall be as sweet vand acceptable as the wine of Lebanon .[viz. the remembrance of the converted Israel ; that is, his Name, Fame and report shall be as sweet and acceptable as the noblest wine of Lebanon. Ot. his fragrancie, or smell; because the Heb, word signifying remembrance seems sometimes to be used for smell, according as sweet perfume causeth one to remember; see Isa 66.3. again Lev.2.2,9. Num.5. 26. and Psal 20.4. with the annotat. Some do apply it to the remembrance of God, which should prove very pleasing and acceptable to the believers, because of his super – abundant grace]
\p
\v 9 Ephraim [This may be taken, as spoken by God, who takes a singular pleasure, (as one doth rejoyce) that Ephraim had rejected all idolatry, and was no more trouble to him by it, as formerly. See above chhap. 12. ver1, &c. or it may be taken for the words of converted Ephraim, thus ; Ephraim (shall say) etc] what have i more to do with the idols? [Heb. what (is) to me and idols? see 1Sam 16. on vers.10. and so the word idols, above chapter above chap.8. on vers.4.] i have heard him, and will look upon him; [this seems to have regard to the prayer mad above vers. 3,4. Oth i will hear (him) or, i do hear and regard (or, look upon) him, viz. graciously: or, take notice of him i.e. mine eyes shall be continually upon him. See Jer 24.6. as before i watched him for evil above chap 13. vers 7. Oth i have regarded him] i will be unto him, as a green fire – tree; [which keeps its verdure or leaf (as Herbarists testifie) all the winter long and yield a very refreshing shadow: so doth God implie, will i refresh them against the heat of all adversities and persecutions] thy fruit is found out of me [whereof see above chap 13,15 that is through my gracious and powerful working ye shall be fruitful fro good; your fruit shall be sure, see Job 15 vers.1, &c and compare above vers. 6,7,8. and for the word found or, with being found, compare Mich 1.13. Zeph 3.13. Mal.2.6. 1Pet.2.22. again Num 11. on vers22 Psa.46. on verse 2.
\p
\v 10 Who is wise ? let him understand these things (who is) understanding: let him acknowledge (or, know) them, [an elegant conclusion of this Prophets,and especially of this chapter, and the foregoing evangelical instructions and promises; the sense is, that true wisdom consists in this, and those that will be wise must understand and know this, and govern themselves accordingly: otherwise they will be fools all their wisdom. See 1 Cor 1.18, 19, &c. and chap 2.2, &c. and so to this manner and asking, compare Deut 20. verse 5.6,7,8. Psa. 25.12. and 34.23. and 107.43. Oth by way of complaint, who is wise and understands these things, understanding and knows them ? as if the prophet had said alass there are but few hhave this wisdom. Compare Jer 9, 12,] for the wayes of the LORD are straight, [i.e. his instruction of government. See Gen.18. on vers.19. and Psa 25. on vers.4. again Deut 32. on verse. 4. Psal.25. on verse 10. Compare also Psal 19.9. and 7.11.] and the righteous shall walk in them, [with content delight and joy, see Psal 119.30. Mat.11.4.1. Job. 5. vers. 3,&c] but the transgressors [or, revolting ones, back – sliders ] shall fall therein. [i.e. they shall take offence and stumble thereat , and fall away. See above chhap. 7.13. and Isa chha. 8.14. Luke 2,34. 2Cor.2. 16,&c.]
