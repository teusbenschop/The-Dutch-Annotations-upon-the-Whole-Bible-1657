\mt Zacharia
\s The Argument of this Book.
\p Zacharia is the second prophet, that preached among the Jews after the Babylonian captivity, beginning but two moneths after the prophet Haggai, to wit, in the eight moneth of the eight moneth of the second year of king Darius. In this book many excellent points are handlea, whereof these are the principal. First, he exhorts the Jews, that were returned back out of the Babylonian captivitie, into Judea, to true repentance and conversion. In the second place, he rehearseth sundry visions, whereby God taught them what a fatherly care he had of them, and especially how graciously how graciously he had delivered them out of the Babylonian captivity, with the promise annexed, that he would also keep and them for the future, if they would but turn to him uprightly, and go on diligently in rebuilding of the temple. Thirdly, he prophesieth of the destruction of all the enemies of God’s people, as also of the coming of the Messia, and the mercies and benefits, which he would shew to his church, together with the enlargement thereof by the conversion of the Gentiles unto it. In the new Testament there are several passengers cited, as well by Christ himself, as by the Evangelists and Apostles. Mat. 21.5 and 26.31. and 27.9. Mark 14.27. Job 12.15. and 19.38. Eph. 4.25. Rev.1.7. all which serves to command unto us the reading of this prophet, and to make him the more acceptable unto us.
\c 1
\s The prophet exhorts the Jews to true repentance, that they may not incurre the like Judgement with their fathers, verse 1, c after that he describes two visions, the former of a man on a red horse, bringing newes that Jerusalem should be built again, 7. the latter, of four hornes and four smith, signifying, that the enemies of God’s people should be defeated, 18. c.
\p
\v 1 In the eighth moneth, [This was two moneths after that the prophet Haggai began to preach, Hag. 1.2.] in the second year of Darius, [the King of Parsia. See Ezra 4. on verse 24] the word of the Lord came to Zacharia, the son of Berechia [thus he is called in the Hebrew, but in the greek barachias. Some conceive, that is the same, of whom mention, Math. 22.35. Oth. Hold them to be distict persons. Compare 2 Chron. 24.2 with the annotate. See further of the persons named in this verse Ezra 5.1.] the son of Iddo the prophet [or of the prophet] saying.
\p
\v 2 . The LORD hath been wroth against your fathers. [Hebr. Anger with anger, c]
\p
\v 3 . Therefore say unto them, thus saith the Lord of hosts: turn again to me saith the LORD of hosts, so shall I turn again to you, saith the LORD of hosts. [God is said to turn himself to us, when he causeth us to finde and taste the fruit, or return of our prayer: we are said to turn to the LORD, when in true saith and unseigned repentance for our sins, we sue for mercie and favour to him. And ye we have not this from our selves: God must give it, as is express in Jeremie, chap. 31.18. LORD convert me, so shall I be converted.]
\p
\v 4 . Be not as fathers [to wit, in impenitencie. See 2 Chro. 36.15, 16.] whom the former prophets called upon, [those namely, which prophesied before before the Babylonian Captivity] saying; thus saith the LORD of hosts, convert your selves from your evil dealings: but they hearkned not, and they lifted not unto me, [i.e. not to that which I cause to be delivered to them by the ministrie of my prophets] saith the LORD.
\p
\v 5 . Your father where are they? [As if he said; though they be dead and gone, it behooves you notwithstanding to take warning by them. See 1 Cor. 10.5, 6.] and the prophets, shall they live for ever? [I.e always. Oth. Doth they live forever? He meanes to shew, though the former prophets be dead and out of the world, yet their prophesies remain alive still, see the next verse and compare. 2 Pet. 1.15. Oth. Read and interpret these words, as the objection and cavils of wicked men, thus but the prophets (those that took us up so) did they live always? What is become of them since; are they not dead and gone as well as others?]
\p
\v 6 . Neverthelesse my words and my institutions, which I commanded my servants, [viz. to declare the same to such people and nations] have they not hit your fathers? [did not the Judgement denounced and threatened come upon your fathers? I think they found and felt it; and therefore ye ought to take heed how to tread in their footsteps] so that returning they said, even as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto as according to our dealings, so he hath done with us. [This they spake as convinced in their consciences, when the Lord punished them, as with other plagues and calamities, so especially with the Babylonian Captivity, wherewith he had often threatened them. Compare Psalms 106.6.]
\p
\v 7 . On the four and twentieth day of the eleventh moneth, (this is the moneth Schebat) [Answering mostly with our January, as having the moon that falls partly in January, and partly in February; insomuch, that this prophesie followed about three moneth after the former] in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came unto Zacharia, the son of Berch-ia, [Hebr. Berech-jebu] the son of Iddo the Prophet saying.
\p
\v 8 . I saw by night, and behold, a man riding, [This was the son of God in the shape of a man: yet others think it was a created angel. Christ did other whiles take a humane shape upon him for a short time; as Dan. 7.13. Ezekiel. 1.26. and chap. 40.3.] on a red horse, [hereby is shewed, that the son of God consumes his Enemies like fire, or as others understand it, that he takes away the sins of his people by his blood. See Isaiah 63.1, 2, 3.] and he stood between the myrtle trees: [oth. Be subsisted, (made a halt) among the myrtle-trees: by the myrtles are shadowed forth the faithfull, being still flourishing and fragrant before God, like unto the myrtle-trees: and by the standing still of this man, is signified the ready and ever present help and assistance of the LORD] which were in the depth: [i.e. in the deep moist place, whereby is typified the condition of the Jewish people: which as the time were purely yet in the Babylonian captivity, and partly in their own land, in great trouble still] and after him, [i.e. after the man that sate on the red horse] were red and brown (and) white horses. [whereon angels sate attending Christ, verse 0 and those signifie all kinde of ministers of the LORD, that serve him for to execute his judgements, whether it be for delivering of his children, or for punishment of the enemies]
\p
\v 9 . And I said, my LORD, what are these? [Or, who are these, i.e. what are they about?] and then the angel that spake with me, [oth. In me; as the Hebrew particles do properly signifie, implying an inward revelation of things which he had seen outwardly: so below verse 13.14 and 2.3 and chap. 4 verse 1, 4, 5 and chap. 5.5,10 and chap. 6.4. see also Numb. 12.2 and 2 Sam.. 23 verse 2. Hos. 1.1. c.] said unto me, I will shew thee what these are.
\p
\v 10 . Then answered the man that stood between the mytles, and said; these are they whom the LORD [i.e. God the Father; for here the son of God speaketh] sent forth [Or, had sent out; for they had been abroad already then, and were now returning] to pass through the whole land: [for to see and observe how things were conditioned everywhere, and to bring in the report thereof. This is said by way of similitude, having regard to the custome of Kings and great ones sending forth their ministers into all parts, for information. Compare Job 1.7. and chap. 2.2. all things are known to God, Psalms 113.6. Jer. 23.24. Heb 4.13. yet he is pleased to make use of his ministering spirits, the angels, for to manifest and make known his wisdom and government.]
\p
\v 11 . And they answered [to answer is here as much as to say, or begin to speak, as also below verse 12 and in many other places] unto the angel of the LORD, [i.e. unto Christ there present, the supream head of all the angels] that stood between the myrtles and said; we have passed through the land, [to wit the land of Chaldea. Oth. The earth, the world, or all the countries of the earth] and behold, the whole land [i.e. all the inhabitants of the land, as may be gathered by verse 15 or the whole earth, except only the poor land of Juda, which lies pitifully wasted and spoiled, and is much annoyed still by its enemies: or except the Jews, which had been captive in Babel for many years and were in a suffering condition yet, many wayes] sitteth and it is still. [or calm, meaning, that the Babylonians and other nations were at rest and quiet.
\p
\v 12 . Then answered the angel of the LORD, and said, Lord of hosts, how long wilt thou have mercy upon Jerusalem and upon the cities of Juda? [The angel here speaking, is Jesus Christ, the mediatour and advocate of his church with his heavenly father; the said church being in trouble and under persecution, whiles all other countries round about enjoyed peace and rest. This church is here meant hereby the names of Jerusalem and Juda, although it be applicable also in the literall sense] with whom thou hast been wroth, these seventy yeares.] hence some do gather, that Zacharias spake this soon after the Babylonian captivity, out of which the Jews were delivered through the intercession of Christ; the time being now fulfilled, spoken of 2 Chron. 36.14,15,21. Jeremiah 25.3, 5, 12. and chapter 29.10.]
\p
\v 13 . And the LORD answered the angel, that spake with me [or, in me. See above verse 9 and understand that the LORD, i.e. God the Father speaketh to the son, and the son to the prophet, of the love of God to his church and his wrath against his enemies thereof, as is further explained, verse 14.15] good words [i.e friendly, kindly and acceptable words] comfortable words. [to wit comfortable for his church.]
\p
\v 14 . And the angel that spake with me, said to me; proclaim, saying, thus saith the Lord, saying, thus saith the Lord of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion, with a great jealousie [viz. to deliver them out of the hands of their enemies: see Isaiah 9.7. Zeph. 1.4 and Jer. 31.20. and below chap. 8.2. though the LORD had for a time withheld his help and assistance from his church, nevertheless he loved the same still, as a father doth his children, or Husband his wife; and in due time he did deliver her out of her troubles and didtresses.]
\p
\v 15 . Ad I am wroth with a very great wrath against these heathens at ease; [i.e. Against the chaldeans, or Babylonian and there adherents, which now sit still and are at rest and ease, whiles my people is afflicted. See above verse 11.] for I was a little wroth, [viz. With the Jews] but they did help for evil, [as if God should say, they looked not to my end and purpose, which was but fatherly to chastise them, for to bring them to repentance and amendment, when all the enemies aimes and endevours were for their utter ruine and extirpation. See Isaiah 10.7. and 47.8. see also Ezekiel 25.3, 6. jeremiah 30.11. Psalms 83.4 ,5.]
\p
\v 16 . Therefore thus saith the Lord, I am returned to Jerusalem with compassions, mine house shall be build therein, saith the LORD of hostes, and the square-line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem. [According as we see carpentes do, being about to set up a new building: the meaning is, Jerusalem should be built again, let the enemies plot and practice to the contrary whatever they are able. This was accomplished by managing and encouragement of Nehemiah. Compare Neh. 2.3, 4, c and Haggai 1.13 under the building up of the city of Jerusalem, they are promised also to the Godly, all manne of spiritual grace and benefits.]
\p
\v 17 . Cry yet, [or preach further] saying thus saith the LORD of hosts, my cities shall be spread abroad yet, [i.e. the cities of Juda shall be too stait or narrow, they must needs be enlarged and made greater] because of the good; [that is, because of the great and abundant blessings which the LORD shall give them. Spiritually it signifieth that God shall so blesse and increase his church that the land of Juda should be too little and narrow for her to contain all: all the world being to be overspread with her members, and the gifts bestowed upon her. Compare Isaiah 49.18. c. and the whole book of Acts of the Apostles] for the LORD shall comfort Zion yet, and he shall yet chuse Jerusalem. [viz. for his people: the sense is, he shall so abundantly blesse them with all manner of gifts and graces, that it shall sufficiently appear, God chose them for his people, especially shall he blesse them with setting up again of his pure worship among them.]
\p
\v 18 . And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw; and behold there were four hornes. [Typifying the several people and Nations, which in an hostile manner made war upon, and molested the people of God from all corners and quartes of the world: see verse 19.]
\p
\v 19 . And I said to the angel that spake with me, what are these? [What mean these hornes, what do they betoken or signifie?] And he said to me, these are those hornes, which destroyed Juda, Israel and Jerusalem; [i.e. they signifieth the Babylonians, and other mighty Nations holding with them; their consederates and associates.]
\p
\v 20 . And the LORD sheewed me for smiths. [Or Carpenters. By these are likewise signified certain people and nations, Gods fellow labourers as it were, whom God should gather together her from all the corners of the world for to break and destroy, those strong horns, that is, those enemies of God, which hinder the building up of the temple and churh of God.]
\p
\v 21 . Then said I, what come they to make? And he spake, saying; those are the hornes which destroyed Juda, so that none lifted up his head, but these are come, to terrifie those [viz. hornes i.e. kingdoms] for to cast down the horns of the heathens, [i.e. to destroy their power, might and kingdoms] which did lift up against the land of Juda, for to destroy the same. [I.e. which invaded the land of Juda with whole armies in a hostile manner and made it desolate all over. Compare Ezekiel 34.21.]
\c 2
\s The third vision, namely a man with a measuring line, measuring the place of the new Jerusalem, verse 1,2 shewing withal the great maltitude of the inhabitants of this city, and how God would protect the same, 3, &c. after the Jews remaining in Babylon are exhorted to repair home, 6. with promises that God would destroy their enemies, 9 of the conversion of the gentiles, 11 and God’s continual care for his church, 12.
\p
\v 1 Again I lifted up mine eyes, and I saw and behold there was a man, [to wit, the same angel who was Christ in the shape of a man, as appears below verse 3. and above chap. 1.8. see Ezek. 40 on verse 3 and 41. and 42 chapters. Rev. 11.1, 2.] and in his hand was a measuring line.
\p
\v 2 . and I said, whither goeth thou, and he said to me, for to measure Jerusalem, to see how great her breadth, and how great her length shall be. [i.e. to view and dispose, how great, large and ample that Jerusalem should be, which was to be built up again. See Ezek. 6.3.]
\p
\v 3 . And behold the angel [see above chap. 1.9] that spake with [or, in] me, went forth: [to wit, from among the myrtles, where he stayed, chap. 1.8. for to be the neer in speaking to me] and another angel [to wit, one of the created angels, that stood behinde Christ chap. 1.8.] went forth [viz. out of the foresaid company of angels] to meet him [namely, at the place, which he was to measure]
\p
\v 4 . And he [viz. the LORD Christ] said to him: [viz. to that created angel last spoken of] run, speak to this yound man, [the Prophet here doth understand himself, being at that time but yet, or a young man is as much as a servant, the same word being likewise attributed to such, even those of riper yeares, Ex. 33.11 and chap. 19.6.] saying, Jerusalem should be inhabited village-wife, because of the maltitude of men and of the beasts, that shall be in the midst thereof [the meaning is, it shall be inhabited without walls, in regard those exceeding great multitudes of men shall not be able to be contained within the compass of any walls. Oth. Jerusalem shall inhabit the village i.e. those of Jerusalem, shall, by reason of their great encrease, be sain, to retire, abundance of them into the villages with their habitations. However this ought to be mainly understood, of the great multitudes of men that were to believe in Christ and submit themselves under his spirit themselves under his spiritual kingdom, in regard the universal church was to extend and spread her self all the world over. See Isaiah 54.1, 23. 60 verse 4.11. compare also Jer. 31.27.]
\p
\v 5 . And I will be unto her, saith the LORD, a fiery wall round about: [i.e. I will so protect them, that their enemies shall not dare not be able to assau itthem, and such as shall presume to set upon them, shall be destroyed and comsumed as with fire. Compare Isaiah 26.1. and 60.18, 19. Jer. 15.20. compare also Psalms 125.2 and 2 Kings 6.17.] and I will be for glory in the midst of her. [i.e. I will be the cause of much honour and glory to them. I will honour and favour the citizens and inhabitants of that city or church with many and great mercies, graces and benefits.]
\p
\v 6 . Ho, bo, [Or, O, O, and so also verse 7.] see now out of the north countrey, [i.e. out of Babylon, which lay toward the north from Juda. See Jer. 6 on verse 27. and chap. 16 verse 15 the speech is addressed here to those Jewes, that were then yet at Babylon; and the meaning is, get you away suddenly out of the eminent danger of those parts, hanging over the heads of the Babylonians, and repair betimes unto the church of God. See Isaiah 48 on verse 20.] saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad toward the four windes of heaven, [i.e. so far as the four windes do extend themselves. Oth. As the four c. compare Ezek. 17.21. otherwise, because I now set you free, out of the Babylonian captivity, in which ye were cooped up and were detained like a bird in cage, ye having the freedom now of all the countrey, and liberty to travel and remove whither you lift. Or, as hereofore I scattered you into the four winds or quarters of the world, so I will like wise gather and recover you again from thence.]
\p
\v 7 . Ho Zion, escape thou that dwellest (with) the daughter of Babel. [The meaning is make all the haste ye can to abandon Babel, and to come in to the church.]
\p
\v 8 . For thus saith the LORD of hosts; after the glory (upon you), [i.e. after that he had resolved to honour you with deliverance out of Babel] he sent me to those heathen, which bereave you: [or, againg the heathen, to wit against the Chaldeans and other Enemies of yours; as if he said; God having begun to be gracious to you, he resolved to continue the same, and thereof he hath sent me to protect you against the force and violence of your enemies that they shall not be able to hurt you, neither in nor after your return homeward] for he that toucheth you he toucheth the apple of his eye [his viz. the LORDs. The sense is, he that doth molest and trouble, afflict or annoy you, in so doing offends the LORD himself most sensibly, which he will surely avenge. See Deut. 32 on verse 10. Psalms 17.8 and Acts 9.4]
\p
\v 9 . For [Or verily] I will move my hand over them [to wit, over or against those heathen, the Babylonians and other nations that preyed upon, i.e will visit and plague them with my power] and they shall be a prey to their servant [viz. to their captives formerly, whom they made to serve and drudge under them, as their bondmen, spiritually, it implies, that the enemies of the church of God being converted unto Christ, they should offer up themselves and all unto Christ] thus shall ye know [these are yet Christ his words: and to know is as much here as to finde by experience] that the LORD of hosts hath sent me. [i.e. ye shall then plainly know and understand, that I am the son of God, and was sent thus before hand, to foretell these unto you, till I shall be sent to fulfill them in due time. Christ is sent by his father as mediatour for the good of his church.]
\p
\v 10 . Shout, and rejoice, thou daughter of Zion: for behold I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD. [thus Christ speaketh here unto the believing Jewes; and the sense is, as if he had said; I shall not appear then in the shadow of the old Testament, but come among you bodily, Col. 2.9 and 1 Tim. 2.16. Job 1.14. see also Lev. 26.12. Ezek. 37.27. and 2 Cor. 6.18.]
\p
\v 11 . And many heathen [O, people, nations, the word many regards principally the times of the times of the preaching of the Apostle. See Isa. 2.2, 3.] shall be joined to the LORD on that day, [i.e in the time of spiritual deliverance of the Christ, which was typified by the corporal deliverance of the Jewes out of the Babylonian captivity] and they shall be a people unto me, and I will dwell in midst of thee [O Zion, O my church. I will be and converse, preach and work miracles among you] and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts sent me unto thee, [i.e. that I am indeed the son of God, sent by the father to make this known unto you, and to come and dwell in the midst among you, that ye being jointly with the heathens united to me, may become my people.]
\p
\v 12 . Then shall the LORD inherit Juda for his portion, [i.e. hold and esteem love and pprotect the elect among the Jewes, the true Israelites, believing in Christ, as his own peculiar people and inheritance. Oth. Then shall the Lord hereditarily possess Juda his inheritance. See Deut. 32.9.] in the holy land, [Heb. In the Land of the Holiness, i.e. in the land of Canaan, typifying the church of god] and he shall yet chuse Jerusalem. [See above chap. 1. on verse 17.]
\p
\v 13 . Be silent [see Hab. 2.20. Zeph. 1.7.] All flesh [i.e. all men or people, mankinde. See Psalms 65 on verse 3.] Before the face of the LORD: for he is awaked [that is, he hath manifested his divine power by the deliverance of his church and people. Oth. When he shall be awaked, viz. for the deliverance of his people] out of his holy habitation. [I.e. out of heaven. See Psalms 11.4. And Deut. 26.15.]
\c 3
\s The fourth vision, to wit, the high-priest Josua, in whose perform is represented, how God loveth, pardoneth, sanctifieth and protecteth his church, verse 1, c. Christ is promised, who destroyeth all our sins, and bringeth true peace along with him 18.
\p
\v 1 After that he [viz. the angel, spoken of above chap. 2. verse 3, 4.] shewed me Josua [of this Josa mention is likewise made, Hag. 1.1, 12. and chap. 2.3.] the high [or, great] priest, [he is brought in here, as a type of the church he having been at that time, the chief overseer or governour thereof on earth, as High-priest; nevertheless in regard he brought or conducted the people out of the Babylonians captivity, and rebuilt the temple, and was actually High-priest. He was likewise a type of Jesus Christ, both in name, and indeed] standing before the face of the angel of the LORD, [Josua stood before the angel who was Christ himself, as an accused person before the judge, Satan being the accuser; others take the word standing, here, for, serving, ministering, as Psalms 135.2.] and Satan [which signifieth an adversary, or withstander. See Job 1.6.] stood at his right hand [viz. Josuas] for to withatand him [laying to his charge before Christ, that he was unworthy, tempe should be repaired under his direction. See Rev. 12.10. the Hebrew words which are used here, import as much, as if one should say, the withstander him. Compare with the words of the text, Eph. 6.12.]
\p
\v 2 . But the LORD [viz. the son of God, whom before he had called the angel of the LORD] said unto Satan, the LORD [i.e. God the father] rebuke thee, [i.e. overthrow and confound thee, with thy false accusation, he judge and condemn thee for it, acquitting and justifying his faithfull servant Josua. See Jude verse 9.] thou satan, yea the LORD rebuke thee, that chooseth Jerusalem: [see above chap. 1.17. and 2.16.] is not this a fire-brand [viz. this high-priest] Josua; see Isa. 7.4] pluckt out of the fire? [viz. of the Babylonian captivity. Oth. As a firebrand rescued out of the fire, namely of the common or general destruction, for to shew him my favour, why then dost thou desire his confusion; see Amos 4.11.]
\p
\v 3 . Now Josua was clothed with filty garments, [i.e. with his personal sins and infirmities, as appears from the next verse] when he stood before the face of the Angel, [spoken of verse who was the LORD Christ himself]
\p
\v 4 . Then be [viz. Christ, that forgiveth sins, and justifieth the unrighteous] answered [i.e. said] and spake to those stood before his face, [i.e unto the rest of the angels, as his ministers, standing always ready to receive and execute his commands, Hebr. 1.14.] saying; put away these filthy garment from him: after that, he [the same LORD Christ, they having taken away those filthy garments, as he bad them] spake to him, [to wit, Josua] before I have taken away thy unrighteousnesse, [i.e. by this act thou mayst perceive the truth of it, that I have away thy unrighteousnesses; which was signified by the filthy garments. Compare Isa. 6.7. Jer. 1.9 and See 2 Sam. 12.13.] and I will array thee with change-garments. [thus they were wont to call new, pure and godly garments, such as people used to wear onely on festival-dayes. See Jud. 14.12. Here by the change-garments are understood, the righteousness of Christ, true holiness, or, spiritual ornament, the gifts and graces of Christ. Compare Matthew 22.11. Luke 15.22.]
\p
\v 5 . Therefore I say, [oth. Then I said, viz. by my self as the prophets words, wishing such a thing might come to pass, by the good pleasure of God] let them set a pure hat upon his head: [of the word Hat see the annotate. Ex. 28.4 the Hat doth signifie the priestly office, unto which the Lord hath ordained & confirmed him, having first cleansed and sanctified him from his sins. See Pet. 2.9.] and they did set that pure Hat upon his head, and they put him on clothes, [to wit, those spoken of in the former verse,] and the angel of the Lord stood (by it): [as ready to execute the father command]
\p
\v 6 . Then the angel of the LORD testified unto Josua, saying:
\p
\v 7 . Thus saith the LORD of hosts, [to wit, God the father, who for those mercies and benefits, which he so freely bestowes upon man, requireth thankfulness from them, viz. continuall practice of true piety. Luke 1.74.75. 1 Pet. 1.15, 16.] if thou shalt walk in my wayes, and if thou shalt observe [or guard] my guard] my guard, [that is, if thou shalt carefully and observe mine ordinances and commands, so as I will have them kept and observed] then thou shalt also judge my house. [i.e. then shalt thou also have the oversight and government of my church, so as thy fore-fathers had it. See 1 Chr. 19.11. the church is oftentimes called the house of God, as Nu. 12.7. Jer. 11.15. and 12.7. Hebr. 3.2.] And also keep my courts. [I.e. thou shalt continually abide in thine High-priest office, and have and keep the inspection over my church: is the same thing in other words, which he said immediately before] and I shall give thee walkers among these that stand here. [That is, after this life, I shall take thee up into the lasting life, and cause thee to converse with and among these holy angels here standing and with the rest of the heavenly hosts. Compare Mat, 22.30. Hebr. 12.22 and 1 Tim. 4.8.]
\p
\v 8 . Hearken now Josua thou High-priest, thou and thy friends that sit before thy face: [i.e. thy co-partners, or, fellow ministers, the priests under thine inspection. Or in general, the godly people, that partake with thee] for they are miracles. [or, wonderment, Hebr. Men of wonder. Some understand this so, that they were wondred at by the wicked men, they lookt upon them with amazement, whilest they heard the word of the LORD. See Isa. 8.18. but some understand it, they were lookt upon as a great wonder, being so wonderfully delivered out of the Babylonish captivity, and brought back again into their own country; the same being a token the spiritual deliverance by Christ. See Psalms 71. on verse 7.] for behold, I [to wit, God the father, whose words Christ here relateth. See above verse 6.] shall cause to come my servant [i.e. Christ. See Isa. 42. on verse 1. and 12.13. the sense is, him shall I cause to appear in the world in the fullness of time, and he shall do my will, even as a faithful servant doth the will and command of his master] the sprout; [i.e. the Messia who is a sprout or branch out of the stem of Isaiah see Jer. 23.5 and 33. 15 and 38.]
\p
\v 9 . For, behold, concerning this stone, viz. Christ, just now verse 8. called a sprout, being indeed the foundation and corner stone of his church; as church formerly was typified by the corner-stone of the Temple. Psalms 118.22. Isaiah 28.16. so here now again, the Temple being to be re edified in the presence of Josua] whom I have laid before the face of Josua; upon that one stone (here) shall be seven eyes; [Oth. In that stone &c. i.e. in Christ there shall be, first the fullness of the God head, and then abundance of spiritual gifts and lastly a tender care of and for his church. Oth. Over, or upon that stone &c. understand thereby, the great care which the father had for Christ and his kingdom. Compare with the words of this verse, those of chap. 4.10. And Rev. 5.6.] To I shall grave his graving, [i.e. I shall curiously hew and fashion him, as they use to polish and garnish a precious stone. That is to say, that is to say, I will adorn Christ with all manner of spiritual graces. Heb. I shall open his openings, which words some do applie to the sufferings and wounds of our saviour Jesus Christ, whereour unrighteousnesse are blotted out and salvation is purchased] saith the LORD of hosts: and I will take away the unrighteousnesse of this land [to wit of the Church of Jewes and Gentiles] in one day; [[namely, that wherein Christ shall be crucified.]
\p
\v 10 . In that day, saith the LORD of hostes, shal ye invite every one his neighbour, even underthe vine, and under the fig-tree: [that is; ye shall live in peace, and enjoy abundance of all things. See 1 Kings 4.2.5. Mich. 4.4. Yet this not so much to be understood of a temporall peace and welfare, as of a contentedness and quietnesse of minde, and peace of conscience, through faith, because of God being reconciled to us in Christ. Comp. Isa. 2.4, 5 and 25.6, 7. Hos. 2.15, 18. and 14.5, 6, 7. Joel 3. 18. Amos 9.13, 14, 15. Mich. 4.4. and 5.4, 5. in which places, under figurative expression, the peace of the Church and every member thereof, is represented]

\s The first vision, namely a golden candlestick, and two olive-trees by it, verse 1, &c which the angel applies to the holy ghost; by whose powerful operation Zerubbabel should perfect the building of the temple, 6, &c. Zacharia prayeth for a further explanation of this vision, and he obtains the same, 11, &c.
\p
\v 1 And the angel that spake with me, [Or, in me] came again: [for after the former vision he was departed for a time] and he weakened me, [for, the prophet was fallen as it were into a trance or fast asleep, upon the great amazement wrought in him by the forementioned visions, compare Dan. 8.17, 27 and 10.8.] as a man is wakened out of his sleep.
\p
\v 2 . And he said unto me, what seest thou? And I said; I see, and behold, a candlestick all gold, and an oil cruse up on the head of it, and his seven lamps thereof; [or, that were a top it: to wit upon the candlestick. Compare Exod. 25.31.] those lamps had seven and seven pipes, [or, conveyances through which the oil past out of the cruse into the seven lamps, each lamp having its pipe for that purse] which were above her head. [his. Viz. the candlesticks; head, for top, upper part.]
\p
\v 3 . And two olive-trees besides it [Or, by, or, on it] one at the right side of the olive-bowl, and one at the left side thereof.
\p
\v 4 . And I answered, [i.e. I spake again, and so also below verse 11.12 and elsewhere] and said to the angel, that spake with me, [or, in me, as also verse 5. se above chap. 11 on verse 4.] saying, my Lord, what are these things? [as above chap. 1.9.]
\p
\v 5 . Then answered the angel, that spake with me, and said unto me; knoweth thou not, what these things are? [Heb. What these same things are?] and I said. No my Lord.
\p
\v 6 . Then he answered and spake to me saying: this the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel. [the meaning is, this is that which is represented by this vision, that thou shalt make in my Name unto Zerubbabel, namely; That this goodly golden candlestick (made without the hands of man) doth betoken, the temple shall certainly be re-edified and accomplished, so that the golden candlestick shall be brought again into the same, as it was in former times. Also God by this means intended to comfort and encourage Zerubbabel in his office and calling, whiles there were but slender outward means at hand for the bulding up of the temple, and for the resisting of those enemies that sought to hinder it] saying; not by power, nor by force, [viz. of men, humane, worldly] but my spirit [i.e. by mine holy spirit, by whom I shall powerfully work and effect all this] (shall it come to passé) [to wit, that the temple shall be built up, and that my people shall be preserved and saved. All this, God is able, when he pleaseth, to do it quite alone, without the help of man, whom neverthelesse he is sometimes pleased to make instrumental] saith the LORD of hostes.
\p
\v 7 . Where art thou, O great mountain? Before the face of Zerabbabel shalt thou become a plain field. [Or, a valley. This speech is addressed to Saneballar and the other enemies of God’s people, who in regard of the mean condition of the same and Zerubbabel, thought themselves great mountains and withstood them with all their power; as ye may see, Ezr. Chap 4 and 5, and 6. but the LORd saith here, that they shall not be able to prevail against Zerubbabel, nor to hinder the building of the temple. Thus it hath always been in vain for the enemies to rage and attempt ought against Christ and his church here on earth; or thus; who art thou, O great mountain, before the face of Zerubbabel! Thou shalt &c.] for he shall bring forth the head stone. [or, the high stone, viz of the temple; that is, he shall compleat the building of the temple, verse 9. yea he shall not onely build up the temple again, but he shall also be a progenitor of Christ the true Corner-stone, or Headstone of his church (Psalms 118.22) for Zerubbabel was a prince of God’s people, and type of Christ our eternal king, descended from him, according to the flesh. Mat. 1.12.] (with) acclamations [eb. (with) cracking: when people cry and shout that they are ready to build with it, or, that the aie seems to rend in pieces by the force of it] grace be to the same. [i.e. all happiness and prosperity attend upon this Headstone, and the whole temple, and upon Christ himself, and his church of whom the temple was a type. The sense is, there shall be a general congratulation made, as well by the angels, as true believers and all creatures besides, acknowledging, the fullness of all gifts and graces to be in Christ, and they shall wish and desire, that the father, through his grace will be pleased to bless and prosper the kingdom of Christ more and more, Psalms 118.26. otherwise: it is grace, grace; then the sense would be; it is of meer grace and mercy indeed, that thou hast made us to re-edifie this temple; it was not brought to passé by our power or worthiness, the doubling or, reiterating of word grace, implyeth a very great grace. Compare Isa. 26.3. and 57.29.]
\p
\v 8 . The word of the lord came further to me, saying: [viz. of the son of God, called above chap. 1.12. the angel of the lord and Ezek. 3 verse 2 the LORD. Otherwise sot the word of the LORD was come to me. Saying; as if the prophet had said, this I speak by charge and command from the Lord.]
\p
\v 9 . The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, his hands shall also absolve it: the ye may know, that the LORD of hostes hath sent me to you.
\p
\v 10 . For, who despiseth the day of small things? [that is, the day of the small beginnings of rebuilding the temple? As if Christ said; the father hath so desposed and ordered this, by his almighty power, who shall despise it?] when as yet these seven [to wit, eyes, spoken of above chap. 3 verse 9 and below chap 5.6. &c Rev. 5.6] shall rejoice, when they shall see te tin-weight [or, plummet. Heb. The stone or, tin-stone, i.e the measuring line, on which the weight of tin or lead called the plummet, doth depend. See Isa. 34. the annotate on verse 11.] in the hand of Zerubbabel: these are the eyes of the LORD, [i.e. the assured providence of the LORD] passing through the whole land. [compare 2 chro. 16.9.]
\p
\v 11 . Further I answered and said to him; what are [i.e. signifie] these two olive-trees, at the right side of the candlestick and at his left side?
\p
\v 12 . And answering (once) again, I said unto him; what are these two branches [Or, berries; or branches with berries] of the olive-trees, which are in the two golden cruse, [heb. Which are in, or the hand of the two, &c. the Hebrew word Jael signifies sometimes a space or room, as neh. 7.4. Psalms 104.25. sometimes a side as 2 Sam 15.2] pouring out gold from themselves [to wit, into the bowl: from themselves, is here as much as, of themselves, withot the help or art of man. By the gold is understood the oil, being as pure, yellow and bright as it were gold. By this pure oil are understood, the gifts and graces of the holy ghost. See the answer to the question here below verse 14.]
\p
\v 13 . And he spake to me, saying; knoweth thou not what these are? [to wit, olive-trees, or olive-branches. Oth. What these things are? i.e. what they signifie; as also verse 14.] and I said, no my lord.
\p
\v 14 . Then he said, these are the two olive-branches, [Heb. Sons of the oil (see of the phrase Gen. 49.22.) i.e. anointed ones, because the kings and high priest used to be anointed with oil, 1 kings 10.1 and chap. 24.7 and Exodus 29.29. and chap. 30.30. Lev. 8.12. hereby the angel answered him his second question verse 12. compare this place with Rev. 11.4. however, by these two branches the LORD Christ is principally to be understood, as the foundation of all the spiritual gifts, being typified in this place by these two faithful ministers of the LORD, to wit, Zerubbabel and Josua, in regard of his Royal and high office] which stand before the lord of the whole earth.
\c 5
\s The sixth vision of the flying roll verse 1, &c and the seventh of a woman sitting in the Epha, 5, &c. sinifying the punishments, which God would bring upon his disobedient people and which he would turn from his penitent people upon the enemies of his church and that they should remain upon them forever.
\p
\v 1 And I lifted up mine eyes again, [Heb. And I returned, and lifted up mine eyes; which, according to our mannaer of speaking, is the same we read in the text] and I saw, and behold, a flying roll; [which flew swiftly all the kand over, that the curse would come suddenly. By the roll is meant a certain writing rolled up, wherein stood written the judgements of God upon thieves and abusers of his name in swearing falsely: of the word roll, see Isa. 8.1 and Ezek. 2.10. and Luke 4.17.]
\p
\v 2 . And he [viz. the angel of the LORD, that spake with me before, see chapter 1.8, 9.] said to me; what seeth thou? And I said, I see a flying roll whose length is of twentie ells, and its breadth of ten ells. [the great length and breadth of this roll, signifieth the great number of sins the people commited, and the great and lasting punishments, which God would inflict upon them. Compare Deut. 27 and 28 and Lev. 26.]
\p
\v 3 . Then he said unto me, this is the curse, [i.e. in this roll the curse is described, which is ready to come upon the whole land] which shall go forth all the land over; [understand the land of Judea: or, over all the earth; understanding it of universal judgements on all the land] for, everyone that stealeth, shall be cut off hence, according to the same (curse) also every one that sweareth (falsely) [this word is inserted here from verse 4 the sense requiring it] shall be cut off from hence, according to the same curse [oth. Everyone that stealeth shall be cut off, as (it is written) on the one side of (the roll) and everyone that sweareth falsely shall be cut off, (as it is written) on the other side (of the wall) under these two sorts of grosse sins, the rest are comprehended & understood. Oth. All thieves are cut off hence, viz. out of this country according to this (roll) or everyone that stealeth holds himself guiltless, namely, by colouring his evil practices, being so impudent in justifying the same, as if God had never known anything of it: sinning thereby both against the first and second table of the law: which is exemplified in the two sins here named.]
\p
\v 4 . I bring forh this (curse) saith the LORD of hostes, [implying that God would punish the sins of his people, according to their desert] that it shall come into [or, upon, or unto] the house, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely [Heb. For (or in) falsehood] by my name; and it shall lodge [or, remain] in the midst of his house [both the thieves and him that sweareth falsely] and it shall consume the same, with the wood thereof and with the stones thereof: [i.e. so utterly destroy and ruine the same, that there shall nothing remain entire. Compare Deut. 28.30. at. 24.2. Luke 19.44.]
\p
\v 5 . And the angel that spake with, [Or in] me, went forth [viz. from among the troop of the horsemen, that were behind him, as chap. 1. verse 8.] and said to me; lift up thine eyes now, and behold what this is, that cometh forth; [i.e. is represented to thee in a vision. Here the provident governing of God is described: as verse 6.]
\p
\v 6 . And I said; what is that? And he said, this is an Epha [a certain measure of dry wares, see the annotate. On Exod. 16.36. here it signifies, according to some, the measure, or proportion of Gods judgements, whereby he punisheth the sines he said. This is the eye upon them in all the land. [Heb. This is their eye in all the land. i.e this is the eye that observeth them, whithersoever they move or turn themselves. By the eye must be understood here, the providence and care of God: as above chap. 3 verse 9. & chap. 4.10 and below chap. 9.1. otherwise this is the eye i.e the face, shape, or condition of all the Land.]
\p
\v 7 . And behold, a plate of lead was lift up [Or, was elevated, or brought on, hereby is signified the heavy and insupportable judgement of God against the Jews] and there was a woman, sitting in the midst of the Epha.
\p
\v 8 . And he said, this is the wickedness, [i.e. this woman represents the wicked people among the Jews, or the wicked members in the church, who are cooped, kept and sealed thus for the judgement of God, spoken of immediately after] and [or, when] he cast her [viz. the woman] into the midst of the Epha: and he cast the leaden weight [or lamp of lead. Heb. The stone of lead; understand such a lump of lead, as was flat and broad, so made that it just sitted for a cover upon the Epha] upon the mouth thereof, [to wit, of the Epha, so that the wickedness was, as it were, close shut up and kept therein, intimating, that the wicked should not be able to escape the judgement of God.]
\p
\v 9 . And I lift up mine eyes and I saw, and behold, two women came forth, [by the one woman, some conceive, should be understood the mercy of God toward his people; and by the other, his severe Justice against their enemies. Both these woman take up the Epha, that is the punishment for sin, from the people of God, and carry the same into the enemies country, that those punishments may remain upon their necks] and winde was in their wings, and they had wings, as the wings of a stork: and they carried the Epha between the earth and between the heaven. [this denotes, that when the time is come once wherein God execute his judgements then the same shall be done forwith, speedily, without delay.]
\p
\v 10 . Then said I to the angel that spake with me; whither do they carry the Epha?
\p
\v 11 . And he said to me; for to build her an house in the land of sinear: [that is, in the land of Babylon. See Gen. 10.10 and 11.2. implying, that the punishment were constantly to abide upon the enemies] that it may be established and settled there, upon her foundation. [hereby is intimated, that under the idolatarious and vile Babylonians, both the wicked Jews and all impious people besides, are to be comprehended and punished accordingly altogether.]
\c 6
\s The eighth vision of four charets, shewing that God would execute his judgement upon the Enemies of his church, verse 1 &c. A charge of making crowns, whereby is signified, the royal and priestly office of Christ, who was to build up the temple of the lord, that is, his church, unto which the Gentiles also should be called, 9, &c.
\p
\v 1 And I lift up my eyes again, [Heb. And I returned and lift up mine eyes] and I saw, and behold, four charets went forth [signifying the four Angels, that were sent forth, speedily to executeth judgements of god in the our quarters of the world: the horses, verse 2,3 signifie expedition. Some understand it, that this hath regard to the four monarchies] from between two mountains, and these mountains were mountains of copper. [understand here, by the mountains of copper, the everlasting and unmoveable councel and decree of Gods providence, who from all eternities foresaw and determined, what should happen in all ages.]
\p
\v 2 . In the first charet were red horses; and in the second charet were black horses.
\p
\v 3 . And in the third charet, white horses: and in the fourth charet hail-spoted [see gen. 31 on verse 10] horses that were strong. [or ash-coloured, and so in the sequel: the difference of these colours signifieth, according to some, the different working of the divine providence: black sadnesse; white, joy; red, bloodshed; hail-spotted, varios operations.]
\p
\v 4 . And I answered and said unto the angel that spake with me, [Or in me] what are these, my Lord?
\p
\v 5 . And the angel answered and said to me: these are the four windes of heaven. [or the four spirits, i.e. the four angels appointed to execute the judgements of God, towards the four windes, or in all the four quarters of the world] going forth where they stood. [or where they had themselves. See 1 Kings 22.19 and Job 1.6.] before the Lord of the whole earth: [a description of the true God, occurring also elsewhere.]
\p
\v 6 . In the (charet) wherein the black horses are (those horses) go forth to the north-country, [i.e. towards Babylon, lying northward to the land of Juda. Oth. Those that are in this (charet) (and) the black horses go forth to, c. understanding that the former words have regard to the red horses: but others that applie this vision to the four Monarchies, conceive that the first is not mentioned, because the first Monarchie was past then] and the white go forth after them: and the hail-spotted, go forth to the south-country. [i.e. towards the land of Judea, lying south to Babylon.]
\p
\v 7 . And those strong (horses) went forth, and sought to go forth, for the passé through the land, for he [to wit, the angel that spake with me, i.e. Christ] had said, go your wayes, passé through the land, and they did passé through the land. [to wit, all those horses.]
\p
\v 8 . And he called me, [Or, he caused me to be called] and spake to me, saying, behold those that are gone forth to the north-country, [from which quarter the Jews suffered most, by the Babylonians] have caused my spirit to rest in the north-country. [i.e. they have pacified, or satisfied me, by executing my judgements against the Babylonians, and avenging my people to the purpose. Compare Ezek. 5.13.]
\p
\v 9 . And the word of the LORD came unto me saying;
\p
\v 10 . Take of the captives-carried away; [to wit, of or from the Jews, that were carried away captive by Nebuchadnezzar; or of their children; for probably, there were but few left alive by this time, of those that were personally carried away. Take of them: namely the gold and silver, which they bring, for to offer in the temple] of Cheldai, [called Chalem, verse 14.] of Tobia, [Heb. Tobijahu] and of Jedaja and come thou on that day, and go into the house of Josia, the son of Zephanja, which came out of Babel: [to wit, the aforesaid Valiant men, being of the chiefest of those that were returned out of the Babylonian captivity.]
\p
\v 11 . To wit, take silver and gold and make crowns. [viz. two crowns, one of silver and one gold: this betokening the kingdom, and that the priesthood of Christ] and put them upon the head of Josua, [representing the Messia, that is, both King and high-priest] the son of Jozadak the high-priest.
\p
\v 12 . And speak to him, saying, thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying behold a man, [Or, loe there shall be, (or come) a man: to wit, Christ, true God, and true man, whose type thou art] whose name is sprout, [see above chap. 3.8.] the same shall sprout forth out of his place, [to wit, out of Bethlehem, out of the stem, or root of David, to whom he was promised. Compare Mich. 5.1. Isa. 11.1.] and he shall build the temple of the LORD. [i.e the church of the faithfull, namely, by the preaching of the holy Gospel.]
\p
\v 13 . Yea, he shall build the temple of the Lord, and he shall wear the ornament, [or, Majestic; that is, he shall be king and high-priest, whereof Josua was but a shadow. Others understand these words thus; he shall so govern, that he will be had in honour for it] and he shall sit and bear sway upon his throne; [i.e. he shall bear sway, rule and govern, sitting upon his throne c.] and he shall be priest upon his throne and the counsel of peace, shall be between them both: [that is, there shall be peaceable consultations between them two; to wit, between that king and high-priest; for he shall be both King and High-priestly together, which is shewed by both the Crownes before spoken off. See Heb. 2.7 and chap. 3.3. other understand this, as if here it were foretold, that both those offices, the priestly and Royal, should always and evermore be and remain united in the person of Christ. Some understand by both, both the Jews and the Gentiles, whom Christ would gather into his church, the one as well as the other. Ephe. 2. verse 16.]
\p
\v 14 . And those crownes shall be for Chelem [verse 10 called Cheldai] and for Jedaja and for Chen [verse 10 called Josia] the son Sephanja: for a memorial in the temple of the LORD. [the meaning is, after that these Crownes shall have been set upon the head of Jusua, as was commanded above verse 11 and when that prophecie shall be performed, then shall the Crownes be taken off again, and laid up in the Temple, for an honourable remembrance of those four men, that gave the gold and silver to make them.]
\p
\v 15 . And those that are afar off, shall come and shall build in the Temple of the Lord, [i.e the heathen shall help to advance the building of the spiritual temple. See Isa. 57.19. Ephe. 2.19. being themselves living stones of it] and ye shall know that the Lord of hostes hath sent me unto you: this shall come to passé, if ye shall hearken diligently [Heb hearing ye shall hear] to the voice of the LORD your God.
\c 7
\s The Jewes enquire of the priests and prophets, whether they are still bound to observe those fast dayes, which their forefathers had instituted of old, in cases of necessity? Verse 1, &c. the LORD answers by Zacharia, that he had commanded them no such such fasting, 4 but indeed, that they should practice justice, righteousness and mercy towards their neigbour, 9. which they having not done, he was therefore constrained to punish them 11.
\p
\v 1 Now it happened in the fourth year of the King darius, [See above chap. 1.1] (that) the word of the LORD came unto Zacharia, on the fourth of the ninth moneth (namely) in Chisleu [agreeing mostly with our November. See Neh. 1.]
\p
\v 2 . When they had sent [viz. in the name and behalf of the people (as appears by verse 5) which was eturned out of the Bablonian captivity; or, as others conceive, which yet was in Babylonia] (to) the house of God, [i.e to the Temple, where the priests and prophets were, as appears by verse 3. oth. When Bathel had sent] Sarezer, and Regum Melech, [these doubtless were some of the chiefest men among the Jews at that time] and his men, [that is, together with other men, that were joined in this Embassie, or commission; or, with their men, that is, with their servants and retinue] for to petition [or, beseech] the face of the LORD.
\p
\v 3 . Saying to the Priests that were in the house of the Lord of hostes, and to the Prophets, [to wit, Haggai, Zacharia and Malachi] must I weep [i.e. be sad and sorrowfull and fast] in the fifth moneth [agreeing partly with our July, and being that moneth, in which many years before the first temple was destroyed, 2 Kings 25.9. and Jer. 52.12.] separating my self, [that is, abstaining or withholding my self, from eating, drinking and other bodily reflections, and afflicting my soul. See Joel 2.15, &c] according as I have done now so amny years? [the meaning of their proposition is, as if they had demanded, whether they stood-bound yet, now the Temple was almost set up again, still to observe that day of humiliation, which formerly was instituted in remembrance of its destruction.]
\p
\v 4 . Then came the word of the LORD of hostes unto me saying;
\p
\v 5 . Speak unto all the people of this land, and unto the priests, saying: when ye fasted and mourned in the fifth [in remembrance of the destruction of the temple, verse 3. in the annotate.] and in the seventh (moneth) [this fastday was instituted in remembrance of Gedalia, who in this moneth was treacherously assassinated. 2 kings 25.25. Jer. 41.2.] namely now seventy years: [viz. as long as the Babylonian captivity lasted, and after that hitherto] did ye fast unto me, at all to me? [Heb. Did ye fast unto me, at all to me? [Heb. Did ye fasting fast to me: i.e for to please me, or, to do me pleasure thereby; or, as if some special honour and worship were conferred thereby upon me? Intimating, that the rue worship of God consisted not properly in fasting, nor in eating and drinking, but in the keeping of God’s commands.]
\p
\v 6 . Or, when ye did eat, and when ye drank, were not ye they that did eat, and ye they that did drink? [i.e. have ye not eaten and drunk for your selves? Not I, but ye yourselves were the better for, or, had the benefit of it.]
\p
\v 7 . Are they not the words which the LORD proclaimed by the ministery [Heb. Hand, as also below verse 12.] of the prophets, [the sense is, your question is easie to be resolved: look but into the prophets, and read what they preached and published formerly, on several occasions, and ye will soon finde, in what esteem I hold your fastings. See Isa. 58.3, 4. But other read the words of the text thus, (ought ye not (to do) the words which the LORD proclaimed by &c or thus: (have) ye not (head) &c.] when Jerusalem was inhabited and at rest, [viz. before the Babylonian captivity, or, whiles Jerusalem was yet in a flourishing condition] and her cities round about her? And the south, and the plain was inhabited. [see Jos. 15.1, 2. the meaning is; when the Kingdom of Juda was in good estate yet, and the Tribes entire.]
\p
\v 8 . Moreover the word of the LORD came of Zacharia, saying;
\p
\v 9 . Thus spake the LORD of hostes, [viz. unto your fathers] saying: Judge [the meaning is: this indeed is a true fast, well pleasing to me. See further of a true Fast. Isa. 1.16, 17, 18. Mat. 23.23.] a true judgement, [Heb. A judgement of truth, or faithfulness] and practice kindness and compassions the one on the other: [Hebr. The man with his brother, or, with his neighbour.]
\p
\v 10 . And do not oppress the window, nor the fatherless, nor the afflicted: and think not evil in your heart, [i.e devise, contrive no mischief, damage, prejudice, the very thoughts whereof are sin] the one of the other. [Heb. The man of his brother.]
\p
\v 11 . But they refused [viz. their fathers and forefathes. See above chap. 1.4.] to attend, and withdrew their shoulders, and they made their ears heavy, that they might not hear, [compare Isa. 6.10. i.e. they would not bear the york of the LORD, nor hear of it. Heb. They gave a backsliding shoulders. See Neh. 9 on verse 29.]
\p
\v 12 . And they made [Hb. Put set,] their heart like a Diamond, [i.e. exceeding hard and refractiorie. Compare Jer. 48.4. Ezek. 11.19. and 36.26. Heb. As a durable (stone) see the annotate. On Jer. 17.1.] that they might not hear the law, [viz. of the LORD] and the words which the LORD of hosts sent in his spirit, by the ministery of former prophets, [Hence it appears, that they were refractory, not so much against the prophets, as against the spirit of God, that spake in and by the prophets] from whence arose great anger of the LORD of hosts.
\p
\v 13 . Therefore it came to passé, that as he had called, [He, viz the LORD, or the prophet of the LORD. See above chap. 7. and Hos. 11.2 and Mich. 3.4.] yet they heard not; so they also called, [Isa. 1.15. Jer. 11.11 and 14.12. Prov. 1.28.] but I heard not, saith the LORD of hosts.
\p
\v 14 . But I have stormed them away among all the heathen, whom they knew not, and the land became desolate behinde them, [And it remained desolate a long time, namely after they were carried away captive] so that no man passed thorow, nor returned there, [i.e none past to or, fro, in out there, all that time, till I brought you back again] for they [viz. your fathers, as above verse 11. oth. So they] made [or, put, set] the desired land to be (be) a desolation: meaning the land of Juda. The sense s, that though their disobedience and obstinancie they were themselves the cause, that so excellent a countrie, as god had given the for their inheritance, was made so lamentably desolate: as they confessed at length themselves. Dan. 9.16.]
\c 8
\s The prophet comferteth the Jewes, that were active in the building of the temple, that God would blesse them abundantly, and restore his decayed church by Christ verse 1, &c after that he exhorts them to godliness, 16. with promise, that then instead of the former miseries, they should have cause to rejoyce, 18 and lastly he speaks of the calling of the Gentiles, 20.
\p
\v 1 After that came the word of the lord of hosts unto me saying:
\p
\v 2 . Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I have been zealous for Zion [i.e. for Jerusalem, build upon mount Zion] with a great Zealousie: [viz. to redeem Zion from the shame and damage, which their enemies put upon them] yea I have jealous for her, with great fierceness. [i.e. I have been provoked to great wrath against those that persecuted and afflicted them so Tyrannically to wit, against the Babylonians. Compare Isa. 9.6. and the annotate there.]
\p
\v 3 . Thus saith the LORD, I am returned to Zion, and I will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called, a city of truth, [That is, a city, which the lovers of the truth shall inhabit; and where the truth shall be preached and embraced. Compare below verse 8.16 and Zeph. 3.13. 1 Tim. 3.15 and see the contrarie, Isa. 1.12.] and the mountain of the LORD of hosts, a mountain of holiness.
\p
\v 4 . Thus saith the LORD of hosts; there shall sit yet old men and old women in the streets of Jerusalem: and every one shall have his staff in his hand, because of the multitude of dayes: [i.e. because of his great age. The sense here is, that God would bless the inhabitants of Jerusalem with great age and abundance of children verse 5. this blessing Zerubbabel, Josua, Ezra, Nehemiah and other godly people were made partakers of according to the letter. But these temporal promises and blessings must especially be applied to the spiritual benefits of the Kingdom of Christ, for the children of God are to live eternally contented and joyfull in the celestial Jerusalem.]
\p
\v 5 . And the streets of the city shall be filled with boyes and girls, playing upon her streets. [viz. Jerusalems. See the note on the former verse.]
\p
\v 6 . Thus saith the LORD of hosts; because it [i.e. that which was foretold just now, verse 4 and 5.] is wonderful [or, impossible, as Gen. 18.14.] in the eye of the remnant of this people in these dayes, [i.e at this time, so also below verse 9 and 23.] should it (therefore) he also wonderful in mine eyes? Saith the LORD of hosts. [That which is impossible to men. Is possible to God.]
\p
\v 7 . Thus saith the LORD of hosts: behold I will deliver my people, out of the land of the rising, and out of the land of the going down of the sun. [Heb. Entrance viz. of the sun, see Psalms 19.6. The meaning is, I will assemble and gather my people together by the preaching of the gospel, fro all the corners and quarters of the world. Compare mat. 8.11 and Luke 12.29.]
\p
\v 8 . And I will bring them hitherwards, that they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: [i.e that they shall become true members of my church] and they shall be a people unto me, and will be a God unto them in truth and in righteousness. [i.e. I will assuredly give them what I promised and will justice them through Jesus Christ. Compare Hos. 2.19, 20.]
\p
\v 9 . Thus saith the LORD of hosts; let your hands be strong, ye who in these dayes have heard out of the mouth of the prophets, that were in the dayes when the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid, that the temple should be built [Oth. That from that day, when the foundation was laid in the house of the LORD of hosts, the Temple should have been built. In this verse the prophet doth encourage the people, to go on courageously in the building of the temple, not so much looking at their own profit, nor heeding the discouraging counsel of timorous men, nor being daunted by the enemies threats and attempts, but only hearking to, and obeying the words and exhortations of the prophets, such as were then Haggai, Zacharia himself and Malachi.]
\p
\v 10 . For, for those days, [viz. wherein they went not on in the building of the temple] a man ages came to nothing, [according to the Hebrew letter: the wages of man was not. That meaning is, as ye were slack and sparing toward the building of the Temple, so the LORD also was slack and sparing, to impart his blessing unto you, but there was a dearth of all things, and ye were grievously plagued by your enemies: yea it was all in vain, what ever ye took in hand, Gods curse was upon all your labour; see hag. 1.6, 10 and 2.16, 17.] and the wages of the cattel was none: [Or, of the beast viz. of such as bear burdens, horses, camels, asses, oxen &c. people earned no money by them, their labour was all in vain, the land yielded no fruit, though it was never so well manured, ploughed and husband] and they that went forth and that came in had no peace, because of the enemie, [or because of the distress. The Hebrew word doth signifie an enemy, and an hostile distress: the sense is; no body could get safely into or out of Jerusalem; the straigling and licentious souldiers and divers of your enemyies, that grudge you the prosperitie ye enjoyed and were vexed to see Jerusalem building up again, did hinder and mischieve you, how and where-ever they could. Compare herewith the devine threatenings, Deut. 28 verse 16.19 and 2 Chro. 15.5.] for I sent all men, every one against his neighbour. [The sense is, I did so order it in my righteous Judgement, that people persecuted and undid one another: nay I, even, did set them one against another. The LORD makes often use of evil instruments, to execute his good intents. See Joel 2.25.]
\p
\v 11 . But now [to wit, since ye go on so cheerfully in the building of my temple, making it evident, that ye took my worship to heart] I shall not to the remnant of this people as in the former dayes, [viz. whiles the building of the temple stood still: henceforth, implyeth he, will I not be so severe to the remnant] saith the LORD of hosts.
\p
\v 12 . For the seed shall be prosperous, [Heb. shall be seed of peace i.e it shall take well, and yield good encrease; it shall be sown, and grow up in peace] the vine shall give its fruits, and the earth shall give her encrease, and the heavens shall yield their dew, and I will cause this people to inherit all this [i.e. to enjoy it, possess it, according to Gods promise, Deut. 28.8, 11, 12. Psalms 65.10 and 67.7. Joel 2.22.]
\p
\v 13 . And it shall come to passé, that as ye O house of Juda, and ye O house of Israel, have been a curse among the Heathen; [i.e. Overwhelmed with all manner of miserie and calamity, the effect Gods curse] so I will keep you, and ye shall be a blessing: [i.e ye shall be blessed by me, and favoured with all manner of graces and mercies. See gen. 12.2 and compare Hag. 2.19.] fear not, let your hearts be strong;
\p
\v 14 . For thus saith the LORd of the hosts, even as I thought [see Ezek. 18 on verse 19, 20.] to do evil unto you, [i.e. to plague, both your father and yourself their remnant, returned out of the captivity] when your fathers provoked me greatly to anger, said the LORD of hosts, and I repented not:
\p
\v 15 . So I think again in do these dayes, to good to Jerusalem and to the house of Juda, fear not:
\p
\v 16 . These are the things which ye shall do; speak the truth, and a judgement of peace in your gates. [i.e in your publick assemblies and judication, which of old were held in the gates. See gen. 34.10. Deut. 22.16.]
\p
\v 17 . And do not think the one the others evil in your heart; and do not love a false oath: for all these are (things) which I hate, saith the LORD: [Or, all these are that I hate and therefore ye ought to hate them likewise.]
\p
\v 18 . Again the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me saying:
\p
\v 19 . Thus saith the LORD of hosts; the fasting of the fourth, [intituled in remembrance of the city broken thorow. Jer. 52.7.] and the fasting of the fifth, [see above chap. 7.3.] and the fasting of the seventh, [see above chap. 7.5.] and the fasting of the tenth (moneth) [in remembrance, that Jerusalem, that Jerusalem was then begun to be besieged. Jer. 52.4. see also 2 Kings 25.] shall be unto the house of Juda [i.e. to the tribe, or people of Juda] for joy and for gladness and for cheerful festival: [the sense is, all the trouble and sorrow which ye had hitherto, shall be turned into rejoycing and cheerfulness, to wit, if so be, that ye turn seriously to the LORD and diligently in the building up of my house] love ye therefore truth and peace.
\p
\v 20 . Thus saith the LORD of hosts; yet it shall come to pass, that the people, and the inhabitants of many cities shall come: [this is a prophecy of the calling and conversion of the heathen unto Christ. See the fulfilling, Acts 2.5, c and 8.27 and 10.1.]
\p
\v 21 . And the inhabitants of the one (city) shall go to the inhabitants of the other, saying; let diligently go (now), [Oth. Let us go let us go. Heb. Let us going go] for to entreat the face of the LORD, and for to seek the LORD, and face LORD, and for to seek the LORD of hosts, I also will goe. [Thus shall the one speak to the other. Oth. Let me go also.]
\p
\v 22 . Thus many nations, and mighty heathen [or, exceeding many, i.e. strong numbers, great heapes, multitude of them] shall come for to seek the LORD of hosts at Jerusalem, and for to entreat the face of the LORD.
\p
\v 23 . Thus saith the LORD of hosts, it shall come to passe in those dayes, that ten [i.e. many Lev. 26.16.] men of all tongues of the heathen, shall take hold, yea take hold of the skirt [or seam, Heb. Wing i.e skirt or loose part of the garment] of a Jewish man, saying; we will go with you [or, let us go with you for we have heard, that God is with you. [by this prophecy is shewed, that the Gentiles shall with great numbers and with as great a zeal, come in and joyn themselves unto the church of God, which formerly consisted onely of the Jewes. Compare Isa. 2.3 and Mich. 4.2.]
\c 9
\s A prophecy touching the destruction of the enemies of God’s people, verse 1. &c and of the deliverance and protection of his church by Christ her everlasting kings, 8. whose entrance into Jerusalem is plainly described, 9. an exhortation to the rest of the Jewes, ramainng in Babel yet, to depart thence, and to return to Jerusalem, 12. and God doth promise them victory against their enemies and all manner of blessings 13, c.
\p
\v 1 The burthen of the word of the LORD upon [Or, in or, against] the land of chadrach, [the burthen here signifies a burthenson and grievous prophesie, or foretelling what should befall the land of Chadrach 9see Isa. 12. on verse 1.) whereby Syrian seemes to be understood, seeing Damascus is presently joined with it, the Metropolis of Syria. Some hold that Chadrach was the name of an idol, which the Syrians worshipped. Others read for, the land of Chaldrach, the land of honour or glory, or, the glorious land; Oth. The land that lies round thee O Judea,] and Damascus, [Heb. Damesek] the rest thereof, [Oth. Though Damascus he its rest, i.e. that which it doth rely on or though it relie and repose it self upon it, Oth. But Damascus shall be its (viz. that burthens) rest, i.e. t shall light on Damscus at last. Oth. And Damascus are shall be his rest, i.e. Gods wrath shall rest upon Damascus; he shall spare that city as little as any other place] for the LORD hath an eye (upon) man, as upon all the tribes of Israel. [Heb. To the LORD (there) is an eye, i.e the LORD hath a watchful or providential eye upon all mankind, wheresover they are all the world over, as well as upon the Jewes; by the eye of the LORd there being understood here his providence, that is, God’s omnipresent power, influence, whereby he governeth heaven and earth and all within them]
\p
\v 2 . And he [viz. the LORD] shall limit Hamath also with the same: [viz. with his eye. Oth. Hamath shall limit the same. i.e. Hamath shall lie upon the borders therof. See Jos. 19.35. see of Hamath Numb. 12.21. Oth. By the same, viz. the foresaid burthen of the land, The sense seems to be, God shall order the Syrians, how far they shall advance and extend themselves, for the good of his church. Others take it thus, also shall that (burthen) limit Hamath, in the same sense] Tyre, and Zidon, though she [viz. Tyre, i.e the inhabitants or Citizens of Tyre, as also the Zidonians] be very wise; [viz. in her own conceit. See Ezech. 28. the annota. On verse 3.c.]
\p
\v 3 . And tyre built her self strong holds, and gathered silver like dust, [i.e very great abundance. Compare 1 Kings 10.27. see also Psalms 78.27.] and fine, as mire upon the street.
\p
\v 4 . Behold the LORd shall her out of the possession, [or, dispossesse, or improverish her, whereas before she was so rich and glorious] and he shall smite her sorts into the sea: and she shall be consumed with fire. [i.e. although the Tyrians do hold themselves invisible, because of their situation, being round about environed with the sea, yet shall they not escape the judgement of God, but they shall be destroyed by fire, which was executed by Alexander the great as curtius Lib. 4. and Diod. Siculus Lib. 17. testifie. Some do here, by their Forts, understand their strong and mighty Navies.]
\p
\v 5 . Askelon shall see it, and shall be afraid, [i.e. when Askelon shall see the destruction of Tyre it shall make them be afraid of the like. Askelon and the other cities named in this verse, lay in the land of the Philistines themselves are understood.] likewise Gaza and shall have great pain [viz. as a woman in laboour] together with Ekron, because that which they lookt upon [i.e. which they relied on, viz the city of Tyre, which they held invincible] did confound (them): [i.e. deceived and disappointed their expectation; for Alexander the great took and destroyed Tyre. See the like example, Isa. 20.5, 6.] and the king of gaza [i.e. the prince: for the countrey of the Philistines was divided into five principalities] shall perish, [i.e. there shall be no king or prince more in Gaza] and Askelon shall not be inhabited.
\p
\v 6 . And the bastard [i.e. a foreign, outlandish prince or King, with a rabble of foreign, bas, unruly people] shall dwell at Asdod, [viz. the prince as LORD and master of the city, and the rabble as the possessours of all the houses, goods and lands thereof] and I will extirpate, the haughtiness of the Philistines i.e. their pride, glory and excellency, with whatsoever made them proud and insolent. Compare Lev. 16.19.]
\p
\v 7 . And I will put away his blood out of his mouth [That is to say, after that I shall have punished, chastised the Philistines, and received them to be my people then will I cleanse them from their sins, especially from the murders which they committed. Heb. Bloods. Here god promiseth, that he will receive the heathen also into his church, and make his people, that were not] and his abominations [understand the idols and their sacrifice] from between his teeth: [i.e. I shall cause them to mention them no more, Psalms 16.4. or, that they shall eat no flesh or meat more, that is offered or consecrated to the idols] thus be also also [to wit the Philistine, the Philistine people, or he also, that is, not only common people, but the king himself also] shall remain to our God: [i.e. be brought to and received among the people of God, and into the church of true believers. See above chap. 8.23.] yea he shall be as a prince in Juda [or, as a leader, i.e they shall be of great repute in the church of God, and goe before others with exemplary piety] and Ekron shall likewise dwell at Jerusalem, to wit, in the spirituall Jerusalem, as formerly the Jebusites the material city of Jerusalem, and the Jebusites shall likewise be taken in to be Gods people.]
\p
\v 8 . And I will camp round about [or, by] mine house [i.e. church 1. Tim. 3.15. to wit by mine angels, Psalms 34.8 and 121.3.4 and 124.1, 2, 8.] because of the camped army, because of the through-passing, and because of the returning, [understand it of the enemies forces, that they may not set upon nor do any hurt to mine house, in their campings, marching and removings. See above chap. 2.5.] that the driver [i.e. the enemy] may pass no more through them, [to wit, through my people, family, true belivevers, meaning it especially of the spiritual deliverance and freedom of them from the force of the Law] for now I have regarded it [to wit, mine house] with mine eyes. [Understand this of a kinde and gracious regard, whereof see Deut. 12 on verse 13. compare Ex. 3.7. Acts 7.34.]
\p
\v 9 . Rejoice much, thou daughter of Zion, shout thou daughter of Jerusalem, [i.e. thou people of Jerusalem, yea all thou people of God, both Jews and Gentiles] behold thy king [Christ Jesus] shall come (to) thee [i.e. for thy good and succour. See Isa. 62.11, c. Mat. 21.5.] righteous, and he is a saviour; [or Redeemer, Deliverer that shall save and deliver all his chosen ones, out of the power of the devil, death and all their enemies. Oth. That is provided with salvation or is saved, viz. from his sufferings, through his own divine power, for to save his church also. Compare Isa. 53.8. Heb 5.7.] poor, and riding upon a asse, [i.e. in a very mean and despicable condition, in the shape or form of a servant, Phil. 2.7. c] and [or, namely] upon a colt, a young one of the shee asses. [the same in other words, which he had said just now.]
\p
\v 10 . And I will destroy the charets out of Ephraim, and the horses out of Jerusalem, [that is, I will give peace to my church so that they shall need no charets nor horsemen, nor any other warlike provisions the heathen being reconciled and united to the church of Christ. See Isa. 2.2, 4. Hos. 2.18. Acts 10.34, c. Eph. 2.17. by Ephraim are understood all the ten tribes of Israel; by Jerusalem the tribe of Juda, by both the whole church of God] also the battl-bow shall be destroyed, and he shall speak peace to the heathen; [i.e. reach peace to the heathen: [i.e. teach peace; by the preaching of the gospel declare and publish peace and reconciliation with God] and his domination shall be from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth, [by the river here is understood the river Phrat, or Euphrates. See Psalms 72 on verse 8 and Ex. 25.31. by these places best known to the Jewes, others also are to be understood, and meaning is, that the dominion of Christ should extend and spread iself mightily all the world over.]
\p
\v 11 . concerning thee also, (o Zion) [i.e. O my church and people. The parenthesis is put in here for clearness out of verse 9.] by [or, in] the blood of the covenant have I let forth thy bounden ones of the pit, wherein no water is [meaning that the LORD, in or by the efficacie of the blood of Christ, whereby he purposed to establish the covenant made with them, had or would deliver their prisoners, bound with the bonds of sin, out of the pit. i.e. out of the power of hell and the devil, under which they had been made to starve and perish through a spiritual thirst that is to say the grevious sense & feeling of Gods heavy wrath lying upon.]
\p
\v 12 . Return unto the strength ye bounden ones, that hope: [Heb. Ye bounden ones of hope, or of expectation. i.e. ye to whom hope is given, ye that are in good hope of being delivered out of your bonds and bondage. Here the Jews, which stayed in Babel yet, are invited to return and repair to and temple at Jerusalem: yet withal this, declare unto all such are desirous to participate of God’s deliverances promised by the Messia, and to be protected and defended against the power and malice of Satan, that their only way is to get themselves incorporated into the church of Christ in the true heavenly Jerusalem] this day also I declare unto you, [i.e. as in former times I have declared it often, so I doe it now again] that I will render you double. [the meaning is, I will bestow far greater gifts upon you, than is the deliverance out of the Babylonian captivity, namely spiritual mercies and benefits, such as are, forgiveness of sin, renewing of the minde by the holy ghost, and life everlasting]
\p
\v 13 . When [here God promiseth aid and protection to his people, against the enemies that shall assult and fight against themselves so nevertheless, that it shall not be without combat and gain striving as afterwards it was manifested in the wars, which the Macchabees were engaged in with the kings of Asia and Syria] I shall have bent Juda (and) shall have filled the bow to Ephrain: [(bent) Hebr. Trodden as the foot bow was to get it bent. (filled) viz. with arrows for to shoot in the fight. Some read thus in this verse after that I shall have bent my Juda (like) a bow, and shall have filled Ephraim (like a quiver)] and I shall have raised thy children, O Zion, against thy children O Greece, [to wit, against the posterity of successours of Alexander the great, the kings in Asia and Syria, against whom the LORD most wonderfully defended and protected the Jews. See the books of the Macchabees and the history of Josephus] and shall have set thee [O Zion] as the sword of a champion.
\p
\v 14 . And the LORD shall appear over them, [to wit, the Jews. Oth. Over Juda and Ephraim. Oth. Against them, viz. the greekes] and his arrows [Heb. His arrow] shall shoot forth [viz. out of heaven against the enemies of his people] like lightning: and the lord LORD shall blow with the trumpet,and he shall step-forth wit storms out of the south. [or, like a storm,or tempest. The sense is, he shall come and fall upon the enemies of the church with that fierceness and violence that it shall be like unto the tempests coming from the south. See Isa 2. the annotate on verse 1 and compare Jos. 10.11 and 2 Sam. 5.24.]
\p
\v 15 . The Lord of hosts shall protect them, [viz. the Jewes, fighting against the Greeks] and they shall eat [i.e. they shall enjoy their goods quietly and comfortably] after that they shall have subdued the sling-stones: [i.e. overcome their enemies that used to thro sling stones. Others render these words thus, and they shall subdue them (with) sling-stones, as of old it was the practice to fight, not only with arrows, but with slings also. See Jud. 20.16.] they shall drink also (and) make a noise, as the wine: [this noise or stir shall proceed from an holy rejoicing] and they shall be filled, like unto the basin, like unto the corners of the altar. [i.e. they shall have abundance of all manner of good things, according as the basin, which used to stand by the altar, was full of the blood of the slain beasts, and as they were wont to moisten or sprinkle the corners of the altar with the same blood. See Lev. 4.18, 30 and chap. 7.4. spiritually it signifies their thankfulness to God for all his mercies. Compare Eph. 5.18, 19, 20.]
\p
\v 16 . And the LORD their God, shall keep them in that day, [Or, deliver them, save them, procure salvation fot them] as being the stock of his people: [and himself their shepherd. See Psalms 100.3. John 10.] for in his land [to wit, in the land of Judea, which is called god’s land and the holy land] there shall be set up crowned stones, [i.e. pillars, or monuments adorned with crownes or garland. Others take it in this sense, for they shall be exalted upon, or in the earth, as stones of the crown. i.e. as rare precious stones, such as are worn by Kings in their Crowns. Heb. Stones of the crown] like unto a banner; [viz. in token and remembrance of the victorie, which God had, or should grant them over their enemies.]
\p
\v 17 . For how great shall his good [i.e. the LORDS beautie or her good, i.e. the churches benefit] and how great shall his beautie be! [i.e. his happiness. The meaning is, how greatly shall the LORD blesse his church, filling the same with honour and glory!] the corn shall make the young men speaking, [Or, bring forth fruit abundantly. Viz. the fruit of the lips. Compare Isa. 57 on verse 19.] and the new wine the maides [i.e. God shall give such plenty of corn and wine, that the young people shall be cheerful and rejoicing. Compare Isa. 9.2 Compare also jer. 48.33.]
\c 10
\s The prophet exhorts the Jewes, to betake themselves to God for refuge in all their distresses, who would blesse them verse 1, &c, which because their fathers had not done but repaired for refuge to the Idols, therefore did all these calamities befall them, 2 after that the prophet speakes of spiritual mercies and benefits, and the victorie, which the LORD would give his church in the time of the Messia, 4, &c.
\p
\v 1 Desire rain of the LORD in time of the latter rain; [Of which see Deut. 11.14 and compare Hag. 1.6. and 2.15. Zach. 8.12. see also Joel 2.23. and Prov. 16.15. The sense is, if ye want anything, make your address unto the LORD for it, by your prayers; whether it be rain, for the growth and encrease of your fruits, or whatever else it may be, do not ye run unto the idols, as your fathers did, and by me were punished for it] the LORD makes the lightnings; [or, showring clouds or storms. See Job 38.25.] and he shall give them [to wit, to them, that shall define and ask it of him. Here is a change of person, to them, for you, or, unto you] rain enough [Heb. Rain of the shower or, rain, (yea) showers; so Psalms 40 verse 3. dirt of the mire i.e. a sink of it, deep mire, quag-mire] for every herb of the field.
\p
\v 2 . For the Teraphim speak vanity, [Or, verily, (surely) the Teraphim &c. here the reason is given why the godly ought to addresse themselves to God, for what they stand in need of, to wit, because the idols are nothing but vanity. See Psalms 115.3, 4, &c. see also Jer. 10.8. Hab. 2.18. Of Teraphim, see Gen. 31.19.] and the foothsayers seefalshood, [see is here as much to say as to prophesie, sore-see, foretell; viz. by the mouth of their false Prophets] and they speak vain dreams, they comfort with vanity: therefore [viz. because they worshipped the images of their idols, and believed their sooth-savers] they [to wit, the Jewes, your fathers] went their way, to wit, into the Babylonian captivity] like sheep, they were oppressed, [i.e. they openly confessed (said uttered)] for there was no shepherd: [or, that there was no shepherd: because neither priests nor government heeded their office, nor took any course, or pains to withdraw the people from the idolatrie. Compare Jer. 23.1. Ezek. 34.2. Mat. 9.36.]
\p
\v 3 . Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, [spoken in the former verse] and upon the goates [i.e. the governours, or the rich and mightie ones, using violence, as Isa. 14.9. Ezek. 34.17. Dan. 8.5.] I have made visitation: [viz. in my wrath] but the LORD of hostes will visit his flock, the house of Juda, and he shall set [or appoint, (prepare)] them, as the hosts of his majestie in the battle. [i.e. as his own horse of war, deckt and set out gloriously and which he honoureth with his own person going to war, and entering the battle confidently upon it. The meaning here is, that the LORD, after that he shall have chastened his people, he was resolved to prepare and set them out, as a well managed stately horse: implying he would give them heart and courage and every way enable them, both to resist and subdue their enemies. Spiritually, his signifieth, that God endueth, armeth and strengthneth his church with the power of his holy spirit, so as they becaome sufficiently able to withstand the devil and all his enemies, valiantly, and trample them under foot at length, Rom. 16.20.]
\p
\v 4 . From the same shall the cornerstone, [Heb. The corner. See Zeph. 1. the annotate on verse 16. and chap. 3.6. the chief of the people are likewise called corners, 1 Sam. 14.38. and Isa. 19.13.] from the same shall the nail, [or pin to wit, such wherewith they used to pitch and fasten their tents. By it is here signified the chief ruler, or commander, as Isa. 22.23, 25. but here especially a military one; as is plain by the sequel] from the same shall the battle-bow; together from the same, shall all drivers [Hebr. All (or, every) driver] come forth.
\p
\v 5 . And they shall be [they, viz. of the house of Juda, and all true members of the church. From these words have relations to that which was said before verse 3.] As the champions, which tread in the mire of the street, in the battle: [Oth. Which shall trample (their enemies) in the battle, as the mire of the street] and they shall fight; for the LORD shall be with them: and they shall shame those, [that is, consound them] that ride upon horses. [I.e. the enemies of Gods church, notwithstanding they were so well horse and armed for the battle.]
\p
\v 6 . And I will strengthen the house of Juda, and I will save [Or deliver, as above chap. 9.16.] the house of Joseph, [understand hereby, first the ten tribes and then all true Israelites, which were yet to be gathered with the literal ones, to make up the church of Christ] and I will set them in again, [the Hebrew verb here, seemes to be made of two melted together, signifying setting in, and bringing again. Oth. I will set, (or cause them to dwell) quickly] for I have had compassion on them: and they shall be as if I had not cast them off; for I am their LORD their God, and I will hear them.
\p
\v 7 . And they shall be as a champion of Ephraim, [i.e. stout and caragios. Compare Psalms 78 verse 9, c. oth. And the Ephraimites shall be as a champion] and their hearts shall rejoice as (with) wine: and their children shall see it [that is, behold, hear, get and take notice of it] and rejoice; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD; that is, because of his gracious and mighty protection.]
\p
\v 8 . I will hisse to them, and gather them, [i.e. call and gather them into my church by the preaching of the gospel, Matt. 11.28. Mark. 16.20. Job 7.37. If this hissing be understood of the calling together an assemble of God’s people, for to withstand their enemies; then is it an argument, that it is very easie for God whenever it pleaseth him, to raise and get great hosts together. See Isa. 5. the annotate on verse 26. and chap. 7.18.] for I will deliver them, [or, when I shall deliver them, viz. by the blood and spirit of the sin Jesus Christ] and they shall be multiplied [or, they shall grow many, or great] according as (before) they were multiplied.
\p
\v 9 . And I will sowe them among the nations, [that is to say, I will cause my church, that shall be dispersed all the world over, to spread it self more ad more and to be fruitfull as seed, sown in the fruitfull soil. See Hos. 2. on verse 23. see the fulfilling Acts 2.5. and 8.1, 4. 1 Peter 1.1.] and they shall remember me in far (or, remote) places, [i.e. they shall believe in me, call upon and save me as also make known and publish my holy name. this came to pass especially in the time of the preaching of the gospel, by the apostles and their associates] and they shall live with their children, [this is to be understood of the spiritual life; yet some atke it, for a happy and prosperous life here on earth] and return. [viz. into God conversion, or unto their earthly possessions, after their deliverance out of the hand of their enemies.]
\p
\v 10 . For I will bring them back out of Egypt, and I will gather them out of Assyria and I will bring them into the land of Gilead, and of Libanon; [the sense is, as in former times I delivered and lead forth my people Israel out of Egypt and other countreyed, where for a time they were kept in misery and bondage and brought them into the land of Canaan: so I will likewise deliver my chosen people out of the blindnesse, idolatry and service of satan, to bring them into the church, and save them everlastingly] but it shall not be enough for them. [oth. But there shall not be found place enough for them. Viz. for to inhabit: their numbers shall so mightily encrease. Of the signification of the Heb. Word, see Numbers 11. the annotate on verse 22. Hos. 12.9.]
\p
\v 11 . And he [viz. the Lord Christ] shall passé through the sea, distressing the same, [heb. With striat, or distress: the meaning is, he shall terrifie the sea, as it were and put it to striats, as formerly he did to the red sea. See psalms 114.3. Isa. 11.15, &c. the meaning, that God would discover and open a free passage, for his elect, whereby to go forth out of the spiritual Egypt of this world, and to enter into the heavenly Canaan. Oth. And it (to wit, my people) shall passé through the sea of distress, or anguishm before it shall be transported into the heavenly Canaan] and he [viz. the LORD shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the river shall drie up, [i.e. the Lord shall take away all impediments] then shall the haughtiness [or, eminency] of Assur be cast down; and the scepter of Egypt shall remove. [i.e. all their state and government: as gen. 49.10 for the Assyrians and Egyptians together with all other heathen nations, which were wont to persecute the church of God, they shall subject themselves to the scepter and government of Christ.]
\p
\v 12 . And I will strengthen them [God the father will strengthen his people] in the LORD, [i.e. in the faith in Jesus Christ, that is the head of his church] and they shall walk in his name, saith the LORD.
\c 11
\s A prophecie of the destruction of the city of Jerusalem and the Jewish nation, verse 1. because of their great unthankfulness to Christ, their good and faithful shepherd, 4. whom they sold for thirty silverlings, 12. wherefore God would give them wicked leaders, for their destruction, 15.
\p
\v 1 Open thy doors [gates, strongholds, sorts, castles; here the prophet begins to foretell, that the Jewes, rejecting Christ and the preaching of the gospel, should be destroyed and scattered] O Lebanon, [the prophet turns his address to the woods and mountains, here and in the next verse: implying that nothing at all, shall be able to hinder or withstand God, when he is once resolved to punish: Lebanon is a mountain lying in the north-part of Canaan] that the fire may devour thy cedars. [i.e. that your enemies, and here by name the Romans, may take your cities and waste your country, and more especially the greatest and lostieth among you. See Jud. 9. on verse 15.]
\p
\v 2 . Howl ye firre-trees [i.e. commons, the common and ordinarie people of the land] because the cedars are fallen; [i.e the chiefest and principal men among the Jews] because the glorious (trees) are wasted; [i.e. the most excellent of them all] howl ye oakes of Bashan, [i.e. ye mighty inhabitants of Bashan. Comp. Ezek. 27.6.] because the strong wood [to wit, of Lebanon] is fallen down [Heb. Gone down, or come down. i.e. cut off; felled down.]
\p
\v 3 . There is a voice of the howling of the herdsmen, [i.e. one hears the herdsmen or shepherd that is, the rulers and governours of the people, as well Ecclesiastical as civil, to howl and make greta and sad complaints] because their glory is wasted: [i.e. their people are destroyed, the chief glory of princes consisting in their people number and welfare; Prov. 14.28. others understand here, by the glory, the temple, or the whole city of Jerusalem: some also, the whole countrie of Judea. See Dan. 11.16, 41.] a voice of the roaring of the yong lions, [viz the stout men of war] because the haughtinesse [or, excellencie] of Jordan, [i.e. of Juda, lying by the Jordan] is wasted.
\p
\v 4 . Thus saith the LORD my God. Feed these slaughter-sheep: [understand the common people among the Jews, who were grievously oppressed by the great ones and accounted little better then sheep for the slaughter. This charge here of feeding them, was given to Zacharie in a vision, or under figure, to shew, that Christ, the true and chief shepherd of his church, had received command of his heavenly father, to take care for his poor people, that was so much oppressed by wicked governours. And this charge is likewise given, to all faith patours, in their respective functions under him.]
\p
\v 5 . Whose possessours [i.e. governours, the mighty ones among the people, such as were the high-priest, Herod, the scribes, Pharisees, sadduces &c.] put them to death, [i.e. squeeze out their substance, by their greedy avarice, usurie, unjustice and violence] and hold it no guilt: [i.e. they are not troubled for it in their consciences: nor are they censured, taxed, judged or punished for it. Heb. They become not guilty] and every one of those that fell them, saith, blessed be God that I am grown rich, [the power which the great ones practice upon the poor, s grown so common, that the great one think, they are allowed to deal with the poor, as if they were their bondslaves, putting them to sale, as free and lawfull merchandize. And besides they dare ascribe that which they got upon their poor brethren by hook and crook, by all manner of oppression, violence and unjustice, unto the blessing of God. Compare Mat. 23.14, 15. c.] and none of them, that feed them, spares them. [i.e. none of their shepherds sapre them, nor shewes any pity or compassion on them. See Ezek. 34.2, 3, 4, c.]
\p
\v 6 . Surely, I shall no more spare the inhabitants of his land, saith the LORD: [understand this of those evil men, spoken of verse 5. who made farre the greatest number among the Jewes. But God the father notwithstanding would have Christ to take care of the poor slaughter-sheep, as also effectually he did, after his appearing in the flesh here on earth] but behold, I will deliver up the men, [Hebr. I shall cause the men to be found. See 2 Sam. 3.8. meaning the wicked Jewes] every one in the hand of his neighour, [i.e. I shall smite and destroy the one by the other. And so it came to passé; for by their civil, or intenstine divisions and seditions many thousands of the Jewes were miserably destroyed after that time. See josephus de bello Jud.lib.6. cap. 1. and 4.] and in his hand of his King; [after many differences betwixt the high-priest Aristobulus, Alexander and Hircanus, the Romans were called into Judea, who becoming masters of the Jewes, made and constituted Antipater and Herod the great, kings over them, who put most of the chiefest among the Jewes to death; yet some do here by the King, understand the Roman Emperour] and they [to wit, the Enemies of the Jewish Nation, whether they were the Romans, or others] shall smite them to shivers, [as with hammers] and I will not deliver them [or it, viz. the land] out of their hands.
\p
\v 7 . Therefore have I fed [Or, will I feed, or keep: they are christ’s words] these slaughter-sheep, [see ab. Verse 4.] because they are afflicted sheep: [Oth. O ye most afflicted among the stock; understanding the pious and godly ones amons the Jewes] and I have taken me two stones; the one I called Pleasantnesse, [or amiablenesse. Oth. Keep the Hebrew word Noham, signifying pleasantnesse, and shewing, that the LORD is dealing very friendly and tenderly with the poor sinners] and the other I called Combinders, [Oth. Keep the Hebrew word Chobelim, or hobelim, that is to say; binders or Bands or Co-binders. The staff of Combinders shewed, that his care and endeavour was, to joyne and binde Juda and Israel together again. Oth. Render it destroyers or corrupters] and I did feed those sheep. [viz. the slaughter-sheep before mentioned:]
\p
\v 8 . And I cut off three shepherds in one moneth, [i.e. in very short time; understanding by the shepherds, all the teachers of the Jewish people, who were divided into three sects, to wit, Pharisees, sadduces and Esseans. Others take it thus, that he had berest them of their Kings, priests and prophets; and abserve, that the things to come yet, are here set down in propheticall terms as if they were done already: by the cutting off, otherwise may also be understood, the convincing them of their false doctrines and dangerous Errours: but if it be meant of the wicked kings, priests and prophets; the cutting off, is as much as to say, keep off, or remove, or confound, destroy. And this is a mercy, which God promiseth unto his people, to wit, that he would take their evil governours from them, in token of his love and favour to them] for my soul was vaxed over them, [Hebr. My soul was shortned for their sakes, i.e. I could not endure them and they could not endure me, to wit, those ungratefull Jewes, or because of their false teachers, c of the phrase see Jud. 10 the annotate. On verse 16.] and their souls also loathed me. [see Mat. 27.21.]
\p
\v 9 . And I said, [viz. unto those unthankfull Jewes; or as others understand it, unto the Jewish people in generall, as Mat. 23.37.] I will feed you no (more) [i.e. I, (viz. Christ) will take no further care on your behalf; I will preach the gospel o longer unto you, immediately by my selfe, nor mediately by others. Hereby the Lord implies, that he was resolved to cast off the Jews, because of their great unthankfulnesse, and to own them no more for his people. See Deut. 31.17.] that which dies, let it die, and that which is cut off, be cut off, [the sense is, seeing you contemn and despise my instruction, even take what followes, and be subject to all the ensuing troubles and calamities, both foreign and intestine. See further verse 10 and Jer. 15.2. c. and Rev. 22.11.] and let the Remnant swallow the one the others flesh. [Hebr. The woman swallow the flesh of her she-friend or companion.]
\p
\v 10 . And I [to wit, Christ] took my staff pleasantness, [see above verse 7.] and I broke the same, [thereby shewing, that he would guide and govern them no longer with that sweetness, as he was wont to do in the former times] making void my covenant, [which I had made with them on this condition, that they should walke in my precepts, Exod. 19.5, 6. Lev. 26.3. Deut. 28.1.] which I had made [see of this phrase gen. 15.18.] with all these nation. [understand the twelve tribes, which were to be looked upon as so many nations.]
\p
\v 11 . Thus it was made void on that day, and so the afflicted ones among the sheep [see above verse 7.] that waited upon me, confessed, that it was the word of the LORD, [that is, came to passé thus, according to the word and pleasure of the LORD.]
\p
\v 12 . For I had told them, if it be good in your eyes, bring my wages, ad if not, let it alone: [Here Christ renders the reason, why he had given over his care of feeding the Jewes any longer, and cast or cut off their shepherd. I had faith he, exhorted them, to bring them, to bring me my wages, that is, fruits worthy of repentance, that being the wages or amends, which I had deserved at their hands, for keeping and feeding them] and they have weighed my wages, thirty silverlings. [implying, that on the contrary, out of the bitter hatred which they bore him, they had weighed down money to his betrayer, by him to destroy me: see Mat. 26.15 and 27.9. valuing me at no higher a rate. See of the weighing of monies Gen. 23.16. Exod. 22.17. Ezra 8.25. Esther 3.9.]
\p
\v 13 . Yet the LORD said unto me, throw it (away) for the potter, [Or unto, i.e. it be given to the potter and so straightway again in the same verse] a glorious price; which I have been counted worthy of by them: [Hebr. That glory, or excellency of the price, or worth, value. Understand this ironically spoken, to shew the vileneste and unworthinesse of the same] and I took the thirty silverlings and threw them (into) the house of the LORD, [i.e. into the temple] for the potter. [viz. to buy a potters field with it.]
\p
\v 14 . Then I broke my second staff, (the) combinders, [see above verse 7] to make voyd the Brotherhood, between Juda and between Israel. [hereby is intimated, since Juda and Israel refused to acknowledge God’s grace and favour, when he would have joyned them together, and owned them both alike for his people and kept and fed them as his own flock; for which end and purpose he had sent severall prophets unto them; therefore he would trouble himself no further with them, to reunite them, but leave them in their divisions and to perish together.]
\p
\v 15 . Moreover the LORD said to me, take thee yet [i.e. beside this] the furniture of a foolish shepherd. [the Heb. Word for furniture, signifies sometimes a shepherds pouch or wallet. 1 Sam. 17.40. sometimes a garmen, Deut. 22.5. sometimes, all kind of furniture. Lev 5. 4, &c. hereby is representd, as in a Type, the sottish and strange government of the Jews, after christs time; namely, how the same would be conditioned and managed, before its last and utter destruction.]
\p
\v 16 . For behold, I will raise up a shepherd in this land, oth. Shepherds; understanding the scribes and Pharisees, as also other bad teachers, who should live in christs time, and be teaching of the people, others understand here, by the word shepherds, the bad governours that ruled the land of Judea] that which is ready to be cut ff [Heb. Those which are cut off. i.e. ready to be] he shall not visit, the young he shall not seek; [meaning the yong and tender lambs. Comp. this with Ezek34.2, &c] and the broken, [i.e. such as are hurt and wounded] he shall not care; and that which stands still, [as not able for weakness to follow the other. Oth. The standing one, i.e that which is in good health and well to passé yet; standing upon his own lesgs still] he shall not carry: [or, not apprehend, maintain, take care for, feed] but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, [viz. lamb] and he shall tear their clawes in pieces: [theirs namely, that stand still, and are not able to go further; being weak; and that by hard driving of them, over hills and dales, rocks and woods. Compare Jer. 23.2. Ezek. 34.2, 3.4.]
\p
\v 17 . Wo to the shepherd of nought, [oth. Wo to my shepherd of nought] the forsaker of the flock, the sword [i.e. the hand and the punishment of the LORD. Oth. Drought, see Deut. 28.22. or the destruction, ruin, damage] shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall wither altogether, [Heb. Withering wither] and his right eye shall be altogether dark: [shall grow dark growing dark.]
\c 12
\s A prophecie, that the Lord shall destroy the enemies of the Christian church: but defend and protect his own people, verse 1, &c promising withal that he would endue the elect Jewes with faith and repentance, by the Holy Ghost, 10.
\p
\v 1 The burthen [Or, prophesie] of the LORD over [or, concerning, for or unto. See above chap. 9.1.] Israel: [understand here by the Israel the Christian church, or the Assemblie of the faithfull, consisting both of Jews and gentiles, whom the apostle calls the Israel of God. Gal 6.16 and who are promised here victory aover their enemies] the LORD speaketh, [viz. that which followeth verse 2] that speaketh forth the heaven, and foundeth the earth, and formeth [or fashioneth, shapeth as a potter his vessel] the spirit of man [i.e. his soul] in the inmost of him.
\p
\v 2 . Behold, I will put Jerusalem, [That is here, the Christian church or assembly, as Gal. 4.26. Heb. 12.18, 20.] (to be) a cup giddlinesse [or, a poisonous beaker, or a reeling cup or, a sleep & c] to all Nations round about: [the meaning is; god shall make his church to be as it were a cup, or vessel, out of which all nations, that rise up against the Israel of God, shall be made to drink so, that it shall cause them to reel, or fall asleep. This is that he means, the enemies of all Nations, that afflict and persecute my church, shall thereby get and gain for themselves, nothing nut that whiles they are in the very act of persecuting the same. I will smite them with rage and madness, or dullness and stupidity, that they shall run headlong into their own turn and destruction. Compare Psalms 60.5. Isa. 51.22, 23. Jer. 25.15, 16 with the annotate.] yea it shall be likewise upon Juda, in the siege against Jerusalem: [it, viz. the same cup of giddiness. The meaning is, not onely the heathen nations, but the Jews also themselves, viz. all such as shall persecute the christioan church, shall be confounded and destroyed by it: or and it shall be also in the siege against Jerusalem.]
\p
\v 3 . And it shall come to passé in that day, that I will put Jerusalem [i.e. the church of Christ (to be) a burdensome stone [Or, a most heavy stone] to all Nations; all that load themselves with it, shall assuredly be cut through; [the meaning is, even as those which go about to shew their strength, by lifting up a great and heavie stone, and by tha means come to be overborn and crushed by the weight: so shall those likewise, which go about to trie and practice their strength, thereby to subvert the church of God, themselves be overthrown and destroyed by it; and so find indeed, how hard a matter it is, to kick against the pricks. Compare Luke 20.18. Acts 9.4.] and all the nations of the earth shall assemble themselves against her. [or, through all Nations do assemble &c. namely to fightagainst my church]
\p
\v 4 . In that day, saith the LORD, will I smite all horses with shienesse, [or, with dismayednesse, that is, I will disable them away all their strength and vigour. Compare Psalms 76.6, 7., &c.] and their riders with senseless: [or, stupidity] but over the house of Juda, [i.e. over my church] will I open mine eyes, [i.e. take notice of, and care for them, as pittying their condition. Compare jer 39.12.] and all the horses of the nations [viz. being, or such as are, enemies to my church] will I strike with blindness.
\p
\v 5 . Then shall the leaders of Juda [i.e. te church governours] say in their hearts, the inhabitants of Jerusalem [i.e. the members of the church] shall be a strength to me, [or are a strength unto me: or, that the inhabitants of Jerusalem have me a strong wall] in the Lord of hosts their God [i.e. because the LORD is with them, for the LORDS’ sake.]
\p
\v 6 . In that day will I put the leaders of Juda, (to be) as a fiery hearth under the wood, and as a fiery torch [Heb. An hearth of fire &c a torch of fire] under the sheaves, and they shall consume all nations, on the right and on the left side: [the sense is; they shall get the victorie of and subdue all their enemies, which is to be understood spiritually of the true believers victorie over their spiritual enemies. Comp. Psalms 48. and 87 and 125. and 129.] and Jerusalem [i.e. the true citizens of Jerusalem, the whole church of Christ] shall remain [Heb. Sit or dwell. i.e. abide, continue] in her place at Jerusalem: [in that place where god is called upon in true faith and served according to his will, where ever it be, all the world over.]
\p
\v 7 . And the Lord shall save the tents of Juda [i.e. the meaner and poorer sort of Juda, which dwelt without Jerusalem and were nor of the house of David] with the foremost, [or, first or (as) formerly, in former times] that the glory of the house [i.e. family] of David, i.e. those which are in more authority and esteem then the rest of Juda] and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, do not lift up [Heb magnifie] themselves against Judah: [i.e. left the rich and mightie ones exalt themselves against the meaner sort.]
\p
\v 8 . In that day the LORD shall protect the inhabitans of Jerusalem, and they that are stumbling [i.e. are but weak and feeble] among them, shall be in that day like David: [i.e. as valiant and courageous as David was uderstant this spiritual valour and courage, which the holy ghost begets in Gods children] and the house of david, [i.e. the governours and over seers of the church] shall be as God’s, [oth. God; otherwise, as God’s (house); by God here may likewise be understood the angel] as the angel of the Lord [i.e. as Christ himself, for so it appears by what followes] before their face: [i.e. that goeth before, or passeth along before their face. Compare Mich. 2.13.]
\p
\v 9 . And it shall come to passé in that day, that I shall seek to destroy all the heathen, that come against Jerusalem.
\p
\v 10 . But upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, will I pour out the spirit of grace and of prayers, [i.e. the holy ghost, bearing witnesses to the elect, that god will be gracious unto them: and the same doth stir them up to prayer and supplication, to sue unto God for grace and forgiveness of sins. Compare Acts 2.37.] and they shall look upon me, [partly with corporal eyes in the time of his suffering. See Job 19.37. partly, by faith, in regard of the penitent and believers, Acts 2.37. and with terrour, in regard of the unbelievers at the last day, Revel.. 1.7.] whom the pierced through: [this piercing through of Christ, comprehends his whole crucifying. See Job 10.34 and 37 and through but one souldier did this particular act of piercing his side, yet it is imputed to the whole Jewish nation, who importuned and pressed pilate so much to crucifie Christ, and put him to death in this manner] and they shall mourn over him, [i.e. be heartily forry and grieved for this their horrible sin and gratitude] as (with) the mourning for an only son; [departed this life. See Jer. 6 on verse 26 and Amos 8.10.] And they shall wail bitterly [Heb. Make bitter] as one wailes bitterly for a first born.
\p
\v 11 . In that day shall the lamentation be great at Jerusalem, like the lamentation of Hadadrimmon, in the valley of Megiddo: [where King Josias was slain, who was exceedingly lamented and bemoaned by his good subjects. See the history 2 Kings 23 verse 29, 30. And 2 Chron. 35 verse 22, 24, 25.]
\p
\v 12 And the land [i.e. the inhabitants of the land] shall mourn, each family a part; [Heb. Family, family a part] the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart, and the family of the house of Nathan [see 2 Sam. 5.14. 1 Chro. 3.5. Luke 3.31.] Apart and their wives apart. [The meaning is that this should be an extraordinary mourning among all families: it hath regard to the manner of the Jewes mourning, as then was in use among them.]
\p
\v 13 . The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Simei, [Who according to the opinion of some, was a son of Gerson, the son of Levi. 1 Chron. 6.16, 17. this man is set down by name for an example, but the same is said in general of the rest of the tribes and their wives apart.
\p
\v 14 . All the remaining families: each family apart, and their wives apart.

\s A prophecy of the forginess and washing away of sins, by Christ, verse 1 of the expiration of the idolatrous worship and false doctrine, 2 of the suffering and death of Christ, 7 of the destruction of the wicked and salvation of the elect, after their trial and retirement by the cross, 8, c.
\p
\v 1 In that day [viz, when the Messia shall be come] there shall be opened [namely, by the preaching of the gospel] a fountain [or, spring-vein, well-spring [i.e. the grace of God, for the pardon of sin, by the blood of Jesus Christ, wherein we are washed] for the house of David, and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem [i.e. for the believing children of God] against the sin, [i.e. for the washing away of sin, and defilement from and by sin contracted] and against the uncleanness. [the Heb. Word doth properly signifie the separation by reason of the monethly uncleanness, treated of Levi. 12 and 15]
\p
\v 2 . And it shall come to passé in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will destroy out of the land, the names of the idols, [i.e. all idolatry whatsoever, so that the same shall not be much as named any more among. Compare Psalms 16.4. Hosia 2.16 of the name idols see 1 Sam. 31.9] that they shall be remembred no more: yea also the prophets [viz. the false prophets. Oth. (their) prophets, to wit, those of the idols] and the unclean spirit [i.e. the false teachers, teaching impure doctrines, through the inspiration of the unclean spirit, the devil. Compare 1 Job 4.1, 2, 3.] will I put away out of the land. [viz. either by judgements of destruction, Deut. 13 or by perswading the people to renounce and abolish them.]
\p
\v 3 . And it shall come to pass, when any one prpophesieth more, [to wit, falsely, making use of God’s name for a cloke of his lies, or when any one shall prophecy any more, by the inspiration of the unclean spirit] that his father and his mother begat him, shall say unto him, thou shalt not live, [i.e. thou art not worthy to live, tho shalt not suffered to live any longer but dersevest to be put to death according to the law, Deut. 13.1, c] because thou hast spoken falsehood in the name of the LORD: [the meaning is, the faithfull shall be so zealous that they shall not suffer nor endure a false prophet; his very parents and nearest relation shall not spare to tell and shew him, what he deserves according to the law Deut. 13.6.8.] and his father and his mother which begat him, shall pierce him through, when he prophesieth [to wit falsely, being acted and driven by a godly zeal, they shall deliver him up, to the judges, for to be punished according to the law. Yet some take the Hebrew word, here rendered pierced through, for, correcting, not onely by words, but also by fore stripes.]
\p
\v 4 . And it shall come to pass, in that day, that those prophets, [viz. the false ones] shall become ashamed [as being convinced of their false doctrime, by the clear light of Truth, and their own parent remonstrance] every one because of his vision [i.e. his false prophecie] when he prophesieth: and they shall on no hairy cloack, [such as Elia wore formerly. 2 kings 1.8 and john the Baptist. Mat.3.4. compare Isa. 20.2. and this the false prophets imated, to gain so much the more shew and credit of holiness, in what they propounded] for for lie.
\p
\v 5 . But he shall say, [i.e. every one of these false prophets] I am no prophet, I am a man that tilleth the land, [as if he should say, I have given over that prosession; I was brought up to husbandry from a child, and I am now fallen to it again] for a man got me (to it) from my youth. [or, they put me over the cattel, r, to bring up the cattel & c or for onne taught me to deal with the cattle,]
\p
\v 6 . And if any one sayes to him, what are these wounds in thine hands? [i.e. what mean or signifie these wounds, Heb. Strokes, i.e. stripes, or, scares of wounds. Compare 1 kings 18.28. By the hands here mentioned are likewise understood, the other parts of the body] then he shall say, they are the wounds, wherewith I was smitten in the house of my lover, [or, of those that love me. To wit, of my parents, or neer friends and kindred, who by sore stripes and chastisements (whereof I bear the markes yet) have reclaimed and withdraw me f rom lying, and prophesying falsly any more. It is a common saying, hard stripes, leave good impossions and hard knots require keen wedge. Some read, wherefore are these wounds in thine bands? Then he shall answer was smitten &c.]
\p
\v 7 . Awake sword, against my shepherd, [because it is said in the former verse, how the false prophet was entertained by his own friends, the LORD, viz. God the father, takes occasion thereby, to foretell, how Christ, his beloved son, and the chief shepherd, shall be smitten and pt to death, as if he also himself were a false prophet; yet that should not happen accidentally, but according to divine appointment. Compare Matt. 26.31. Job 14 and 16 and 18. Acts 2.23. and 4.28] and against the man, that is my companion, [viz, my only begotten son, coeffentiall with my self] saith the LORD of hosts: smite that shepherd shall be scattered, but I will turn my hand to the little ones. [to wit for to gather them, and to strengthen their faith. Of this phrase see Ezek. 38. on verse 12. oth. And I will turn my hand against the little ones, implying that they shall suffer persecution as well as their shepherd. By the little ones seem chiefly here to understood, the disciples of Christ, who were but men, of small account and regard, of whom Christ said to those that took him, if ye seek me, let these alone and after that they were scattered the LORD gathered them again. John 18.8. yet we may well also understand here by these little ones the elect children of God, who are small and little enough in the eyes of the world. See Mat. 18.10, 14.]
\p
\v 8 . And it shall come to passé in all the land, saith the LORD, the two parts therein [heb. The mouth of two as Deut. 21.17. i.e. the two parts] shall be destroyed and give (up) the ghost, [see of this phrase, and compare gen. 6.17. and Num. 17.12, 13.] but the third part therein shall remain. [the sense is the far greater part of men shall be cast away, that is, continue and perish in their sins and unbelief; and the smaller part or number shall be saved, through Gods gracious sparing and redeeming of them. See Matthew 1.13. Like 8.5, c]
\p
\v 9 . And that third part [to wit my chosen ones] will I bring into the fire, [understand here the fire of persecution and the cross. See Isa. 1.25 and 48.10. and 1 Pet. 2.7.] and I will refine them, as one refineth silver and I will try them, as one tryeth gold [oth, that third part, every one of them, whom I shall have refined and tried thus] shall call upon my name, and I will bear them, I will say, they are my people, and they shall say, [viz. every one of them] the Lord is my God. Psalms 144.15. Job 20.28.]
\c 14
\s A prophecie of the great miserie, which was to befall the city of Jerusalem, verse 1, &c with the promise nevertheless, that the LORD would save and preserve his, 3. mention is made also of the rare gifts, which the LORD would pour forth upon his church, of their blessed and glorious estate, 8 and of the punishment and destruction of their enemies, 12 as also of the conversion of some of them, 16 together with the holy zeal of the church.
\p
\v 1 Behold, the day cometh to the LORD, that your prey shall be divided in the midst of thee (O Jerusalem) [understand withal, and land of Juda: the day comes to the LORD i.e. for the LORD. Oth. The day of the LORD cometh or, the day from the LORD i.e. that day which is well known to the LORD, as it is verse 7. some understand this of the destruction of Jerusalem by Vespasoan and Titus; other of the persecution of the church, under the cruel Tyrant Antiochus, in the time of the Macchabees. Others refer it to Anti-christ, and his cruel persecutions.]
\p
\v 2 . For I will gather all the heathen against Jerusalem in battle, [compare Ezek. 38.4, 6, 9, 15 and Hab. 1.6. all is here as much as many, all sorts, as Jona 2.3.] and the city shall be taken, and the houses shall be plundered; [Isa. 13.16.] and the women shall be abused, and half of the cty shall go forth into captivitie, [i.e. great many of the inhabitants of the city, shall be carried away captive: to wit, of them, that shall have escape the sword, the plague and te famine] but the remnant of the people, shall not be destroyed out of the city. [if we understand this prophecie of the besieging of Jerusalem, by Vespasian and Titus; then the meaning is here, that the godly people, shall get out of Jerusalem before the close siege and withdraw themselves into the small city of Pella, and so be sayed alive. And this is the third part before spoken of, chap. 13. verse 8.9.]
\p
\v 3 . And the LORD shall march forth, and he shall fight against those heathen, [viz. against those heathen, [viz. against all those people and nation, which shall be enemies to his church] even as in the day, when he sought in the day of the battle: [or; according as he used to fight (for you) in the day of the battle, viz in the time of Moseh, Josua, Gideon, Debora, david, Asa, and others]
\p
\v 4 . And his sect shall stand in that day, upon the mount of Olives [viz. in the time of Christ conversed much on that mount, and there began his suffering and thence he ascended up to heaven. See Luke 22.39. Acts 1.12.] that lieth before Jerusalem, towards the cast: [see Acts 1.12. Heb. That is before the face of Jerusalem] and the mount of Olives shall be split in twain, [Heb. In the midst thereof: or: in its moytie] to the east and to the west, [in length from the east to the wesr] (so that there) shall be a very great valley; and the one half of the mount shall remove toward the North, and the (other) half thereof towards the south. By means of this division of the mount Olives and the large valley that should be between the two parts, removed so far asunder, it should come to pass, that Jerusalem would lie clearly in view whereas it lay hid and obscured in a manner before, by this mount and others adjacent. Understand this of the spiritual Jerusalem, viz. the church of God, of which, the Gentiles, before the coming of Christ, had no knowledge: but together with his coming, all hindrances and impediments, which kept them from the fight of the coming to Christ and his church, should be taken out of the way, and free passage opened for their approach and reception. Compare Isa. 57.14 and 62.10.]
\p
\v 5 . Then shall ye [O my chosen] flee [i.e. come running hastily, as those that flee to a place of safitie: or it may be understood of the wicked Jews, who for fear and terrour of punishment, should flee away and make room for Go’d people coming on] (through) the valley of my mountains; [Oth. Unto the valley &c. i.e. to my church; of the mountains i.e. the two parts of the mounts of Olives, meaning that valley which God had made by splitting and dividing the mount Olives] (for this valley of the mountains, shall reach to Azal) [oth. To the mountain whom he had separated, or chosen, to wit mount Zion. He, to wit, the LORD: the meaning is; there shall be a large passage, so that every one shall have room and place enough, to come unto the church of Christ. As for the mountain of Azal., it is uncertain where it lay, there being no mention made of it elsewhere] and ye shall flee [oth. Ye shall I say,] as ye sted before the earthquake, [or, because or, for fear of the earthquake. See Amos 1.1.] in te dayes of Uzzia, the King of Juda; [of whom see 2 Chro. 26.19] then the Lord my God shall come, [this the prophet speaketh in his own person: the meaning is, after the first appearing of Christ in the flesh, the other shall succeed, at the holy (ones) [i.e. the blessed angels. See Dan. 8.13.] with thee o LORD: [here the prophet addresseth his speech to Christ, which, as some conceive, is done therefore because the prophet knew well, that the wicked Jews would not believe him. Compare Joel 3.11.]
\p
\v 6 . And it shall come to passé in that there shall not be the precious light, [i.e. the clear light as Job 31.26.] and the thick darkness. [Heb. Contraction, to wit, of darkness. Oth. Twilight. The sense is, there shall be no vicissitudes, or turns of light and darkness, bright day and dark night, it shall be day still everlastingly, see Isa. 60.19, 20. Rev. 21.23 and 22.5. yet some do understand this of the light of the Holy Gospel, which should shine in Christ time. Others refer it to the obscuring or darkening of the sun, at the time of Christ’s suffering.]
\p
\v 7 . But it shall be onely day, [i.e. a day to last for ever] that shall be known to the LORD, [The Lord alone doth know when that day shall begin. Mat. 24.36.] it shall be neither day, [to wit, such an one, as begins with the rising of the sun’s absence] and it shall come to passé in the eventime, [understand here by the evening, the whole night; or that time, when the evening begins. See Isa. 60.20. Rev. 21.23.] that it shall be light.
\p
\v 8 . Also it shall come to passé in that day, [i.e. in the time of Christ’s appearing in the flesh] that there shall flow living water, [i.e. ever-flowing and running. Hereby must be understood the gifts of the holy Ghost, which Christ should pour out abundantly upon his church. See Ezek. 47.1. Joel 3.18. Rev. 22.1. Compare Job 4.14. and 7.38.] out of Jerusalem; half of them toward the east-sea, and half of them unto the hind-most sea, [i.e. all true believers, where ever they have their abode in the word, towards the rising or setting of the sun, shall be made partakers of these spiritual gifts] they shall be [i.e. last, continue] summer and winter: [i.e. for ever, without change or, intermission. Oth. It shall come to passé summer and winter]
\p
\v 9 . And the LORD [viz. Jesus Christ] shall be king over the whole earth: in that day the LORD shall be [i.e. be made known, or be acknowledged to be; thus the word be is likewise used, Job 15.8. ye shall be my disciples, i.e. known and acknowledged for such] one, and his name: [i.e. he shall be honoured and wrshipped, as being the onely true God and Saviour; all the idols shall be destroyed, above chap. 13.2.]
\p
\v 10 . And this shall be made as a champain countrey round about, from Geba even to Rimmon, southwards of Jerusalem: [to with the land of Judea, from the one end of the land to the other. For geba, otherwise Gibea, lay on the borders of Benjamin, 1 Kings 15.22. and rimmon on the borders of the tribe of Juda. Jos. 15.32. and 19.7. see of Geba. Jos. 21.17. and 1 Kings 15.22 and Isa.10.29.] and flee [to wit, the city of Jerusalem, whereby the church of God is meant here, especially that of the New Testament shall exalted [i.e. her same and glory shall rife and spread much] and inhabited in her place. [i.e. many shall come to and joyn themselves with her] from the gate of Benjamin, unto the place of the first gate, even unto the corner-gate; and from the tower of Hananeel, even to the Kings Wine-presses. [see Neh. 3.1. and Jer. 31.38. all by all these places, are to be understood all the parts and places of the world, when the LORD shall have his church. Of the gate of Benjamin see likewise, Jer. 20.2. and 37.13.]
\p
\v 11 . And they shall dwell therein, [viz. in the city of Jerusalem, that is in God’s church] and there shall be no banning more, [i.e she shall be no more destroyed as formerly, when it seemed, that the LORD had altogether banned and rejected her. See Deut. 2.34.] for Jerusalem [i.e. the inhabitants of Jerusalem] shall dwell safety. [Heb. In safety, or security.]
\p
\v 12 . And that shall be the plague, wherewith the LORD shall plague all Nations, that shall have made war against Jerusalem: [after that the prophets had spoken of the state and condition of the faithful, he now speakes of the plagues and miseries which should befall the wicked, their enemies and persecutors] he shall cause every ones flesh [Heb. His flesh i.e. every ones flesh, body, limbs, members, or, the flesh of the same, and so presently, his eyes, and his tongue] where he stands upon his feet [i.e. suddenly, unwares, unawares, when they least expect any evil. See an example in Herod, Acts 12.21. &c.] to consume, [i.e. utterly to be destroyed] and everyones eyes shall consume in their holes, and every one’s tongue shall consume in their mouth. [Having blasphemed and reviled God and his people with it]
\p
\v 13 . Also it shall come to passé in that day, that there shall be a great rushing-noise [Or, a great tumult, uproar] from the LORD [Heb. Of the LORD, i.e. which the LORD shall send] among them, so that they shall take hold, every one of his neighbour’s hand, [whether in an hostile manner, or out of fear and anguish, seeking for shelter, help and comfort to his friend, companion, or neighbour. Compare Jud. 7.22 and 1 Sam. 14.20. and Ezek. 38.21,22.] and every ones hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour: [whether to strike, or, according to others requesting help and assistance. The sense of the whole verse is, God shall not onely plague them by his own hand, as verse 12. but also by themselves, on rising another,a nd likewise by his own people, as folleweth in the next verse. Compare Ezek. 30.21, &c.]
\p
\v 14 . And Juda also [i.e. the people of Juda, the Jews] shall fight [viz. against the people spoken of verse 12. oth. Also thou Judas halt fight against Jerusalem] and the substance of all heathen round about shall be gathered; [viz. to be carried away] gold and silver, and garments in great quantitie: [the sense is; God shall unto his church an absolute victorie, overall their enemies, so that they shall even plunder and bereave them of all their goods, according to the use and practice of wars, when enemies are overcome by force of arms: this is a figurative speech borrowed from worldly wars and warious.]
\p
\v 15 . So also shall be the plague of the horses, of the mules, of the camels, and of the asses, and of all beasts, [Heb. Of the horses, of the mule &c.] that shall have been in those camps, [viz. which shall been round about Jerusalem] according as the plague of them hath been: [viz. the plague of those men spoken of before verse 11, 12, 13, 14. the sense is, the LORD shall not only destroy the enemies of his church, but also spoil and consume all their might and power, together with all the means and instruments which they imploved against against God’s people.]
\p
\v 16 . And it shall come passé, that all the remnant of all the heathen that shall come against Jerusalem. [i.e. all those of them, whom the LORD shall not have destroyed; to wit, all the Elect among them, who by the preaching of the Gospel shall be brought to the true knowledge of God] those shall march up, [viz. to Jerusalem] from year to year, to worship the king [i.e Christ] the Christ] the LORD of hosts, [the sense is, the LORD shall convert them, so that they also shall be joined to the Christian church, for to serve the LORD. The prophet describes the inwards worship of the church of the New Testament, by the outward worship used in the Old] and to celebrate the feast of the leave-huts: [i.e. to blesse and praise God for his mercies, as the people, as the people of God were wont to do, when they kept the feast of the Tabernacles. See Lev. 13.34, &c and under the Name of this feast, he comprehends all the honor and worship we owe to God.]
\p
\v 17 . And it shall come to passé, it any of the families of the earth shall not go up to Jerusalem; for to worship the the Kings the LORD of hosts, that there shall be no rain over them: [i.e. the LORD shall not bless but rather curse them, the rain being an outward token of the blessing of the Lord. Compare Isa. 30.23. and Deut. 28.23, 24.]
\p
\v 18 . And if the family of the Egyptians [some do here by the Egyptians (who were very great enemies to the people of God) understand likewise all other heathen nations, enemies of God’s church] over whom (the rain) is not, shall not march up, nor come, then shall plague be (over them) where (with) the LORD shall plague these heathen, that shall not march up, to celebrate the feast of leave-hurts. [the Egyptians are here described, over whom the rain is not, it raining very seldom in Egypt; the moistening of the land being supplied by the ordinary overflowings of the river Nilus twice a year. See Deut. 11.10. others read here: although it (used not to rain) (yet) shall that plague (come upon them) where (with) the LORD shall plague those heathen, that &c. as if the LORD had said, although it usually rain not with them, yet shall they not escape the curse here threatened; for the plague, which shall come upon others by the withholding of rain from them, shall light upon the Egyptians by other means: or thus; and if the family of the Egyptians shall not march up not come, then (the rain) shall not be over them, the plague shall be, wherewith &c.]
\p
\v 19 . This shall be the sin of the Egyptians [i.e. the punishment of their sins] together with the sins] together with the sins of all the heathen that shall not go up, to celebrate the feast of the leave-huts. [i.e. to serve the LORD.]
\p
\v 20 . In that day there shall stand [heb. Be] upon the bels of the horses, [it is the custome of countries, that the carries hang bells on the necks of their horses, conceiveing that the sound of them doth somewhat refresh and encourage the horses] THE HOLINESS OF THE LORD: [this implies, that all things, even the least, yea creatures and things which had been made use of in war against Gods people &c. should at last be consecrated to the service of God. These words to be inscribed in the bells here, are the same which stood written upon a golden plate,which the high-priest used to wear on his forehead. See thereof Exe. 28.36.] and the pots in the house of the LORD, shall be as the sprinkling-basins before the Altar: [to wit for quantitie and number. The sense is, there shall be plenty of means for the service of God and of ministers store, for the divine worship, as also there shall be great aboundance of offers.
\p
\v 21 . Yea all the the pots in Jerusalem [i.e those that then shall be there] and in Juda shall be holy unto the LORd of hosts, [Heb. Holiness i.e. hallowed, consecrated] so that all those that will offer, shall come and take of them, and dresse meat in the same: [viz. their offerings. See 1 Sam 2.13.] and there shall be no Canaanite more in the house of the house of the LORD of hosts on that day. [i.e. no unclean or wicked man. Compare Rev. 21.27. see also Isa. 35.8 and joel 3.17. understand withal, that those which shall be and converse in the house of the LORD, shall be cleaned from their sins, and regenerated. Eph. 5.27. others understand it thus, in the time of the Messia, no people no Nation shall be excluded from the worship of God, or out of the temple; for the Nations, which formerly were unclean, shall then be holy and pure before the LORD.]
