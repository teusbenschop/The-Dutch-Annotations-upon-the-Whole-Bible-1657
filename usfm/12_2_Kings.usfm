\mt2 THE SECOND BOOK OF
\mt KINGS
\s THE ARGUMENTS OF THIS BOOK
\p The history of the Kings of Israel and Juda, begun in the former Book, is now finished in this. And as for the Kings of Israel, they with their subjects continued obstinately in their Idolatry, although the one more abominably then the other. Therefore the LORD stedfastly called them to repentance, not onely by the Ministry of his Prophets, also by his grievous judgments; yea for a fore-running and forecast of their utter ruin, if they should not repent, he suffered the tribe of Naphtali to be carried away captive into Assyria by Tiglath-Pilezer: But it availed not all; God indeed at all times reserved to himself a chosen remnant of true Believers; whereunto the Schools and Colleges of the Prophets were very useful and assisting: but in regard the back-sliders made no end of sinning, therefore the Lord did at last, in his Judgment, cast them away from his presence. For Salmanaseer the King of Assyria having invaded the land of Israel with a great army, after a three years siege took the city of Samaria, and carried the Israelites away captive into his own land; to wit, into Assyria: whereby this Kingdom ended, having continued, according to the account of some, from the division of the tribes, about the space of two hundred threescore and two years. A judgment not much unlike, did at length befall the Kingdom of Juda. For although the true and lawful worship of God did for a long time take place with the Jews, and continue among them, especially when godly Kings, and zealous High. Priests, used all diligence to have Idolatry banished, and the decay in Religion and worship of God faithfully respired; yet the people did intermingled the lawful worship with many idolatrous superstitions, or at least did not the same aright. Now although the earnest and zealous exhortations of the Prophets, and the actual chastisements of the Lord, whereby they were called to repentance, ceased not; yet notwithstanding the abominations in Religion, and the transgressions in mens lives, did still so increase and multiply, that God at length delivered this people into hand of Nebuchadnezar the King of Babel, who destroyed the land, took the city of Jerusalem, burnt the Temple, and carried the Jews away captive to Babel. Which came to pass, when this Kingdom of Juda, after that the ten tribes were rent from it, had continued for the space of above three hundred ninety and five years, according to the opinion of some. But God did so moderate his anger, that he continued faithful in his word and promises, seeing he hath always by his fatherly care kept and reserved a chosen people, and the family of David, out of promises, seeing he hath always by his fatherly care kept and reserved a chosen people, and the family of David, out of which the Messiah was to come according to the flesh, until the very time of his coming. The History of this Book containeth the time of about three hundred and twenty years.
\c 1
\s Moab revolted from Israel, v.1. &c. Ahazia seeketh to know of the idol Baal-Zebub the event of his sickness, 2. but Elia foretelleth his death, 3. the same is told to Ahazia, 5. He sendeth two Captains, one after another, with fifty men apiece, to bring Elia to him, who are devoured by fine from heaven, 9. with the third Elia goeth to the King, 13. And foretelleth him his death, 16. he dieth, and Joram reigneth in his stead, 17.
\p
\v 1 And Moab [Whom David by force of arms had brought under the power of the Israelites, 2 Sam.8.2.] revolted from Israel, [see further of this revolting, below ch.3.v.4, 5. Oth. transgressed against Israel. See of the Hebrew word, 1 Kings 12.on v.19.] after Achabs death. [see 2 Kings 3.5.]
\p
\v 2 . And Ahazia fell (down) thorough a lattes in his upper chamber, that was at Samaria, [To wit, walking upon the roof of his house, wherein was a lattes window, to give light to the upper chamber] and fell sick; and he sent messengers, and said unto them; go, enquire of Baal-Zebub [the name of an idol, signifying a Lord, or, Master of flies. Thus he was called, (as is conceived) because he was called upon to drive away certain hurtful flies, wherewith the inhabitants of Palestine were plagued; or because there were always flies in his Temple, sitting upon the sacrifices, which were slain in great abundance to his honour: Or also, because this idol (as some write) had the form and shape of a fly. This name the Jews gave to the Prince of Devils, Mat.12.24. Mark 3.22. as well out of hatred, and detestation of the idol, as to extenuate and despise the power of the Devil] the God of Ekron, [see of this city, Jos.15.45. and 19.43. and Judg.1.18.] whether I shall recover [Heb. shall live. So Num.21.8, 9.] of this sickness.
\p
\v 3 . But the Angel of the LORD spake to Elia the Tisbite, get thee up, go up, to meet the messengers of the King of Samaria: and spake unto them; it is so wise, as to know future things, so good as to be willing to reveal them to those that be his; so powerful, as to be able to help them in their need. Understand this according to the foolish conceit and unbelieving heart of Kahazia. So in the sequel or it is not therefore that thou hast done this, that thou foolishly thinkest there is no God, etc.] that ye go to enquire of Baal-Zebub the God of Ekron [viz. whether he should recover and get up of his sickness as in the following verse is held forth.]
\p
\v 4 . Now therefore thus saith the LORD: Thou shalt not come down from that bed, on which thou art gone up; but thou shalt die the death; [Heb. dying die. So below v.6. and 16.]
\p
\v 5 . So the messengers came back to him; [Namely, to King Ahazia] and he said unto them; what is this (that) ye come back? [he asketh this, because he was able to discern by their speedy and quick return that they had not been at Ekron to enquire of the idol.]
\p
\v 6 . And they said unto him; (there) came a man up to meet us, and said unto us; go, turn again unto the King that sent you, and speak unto him; Thus saith the LORD is it because there is no God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baal-Zebub the God of Ekron? [see above on v.3.] therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed, on which thou art gone up, but thou shalt die the death.
\p
\v 7 . And he spake unto them; what was the shape of the man, [Heb. the judgement, etc. which word is here taken by many for the quality and shape or fashion of garments: By others for the form or shape of the body. By the answers of the messengers in the next verse, it seemeth that the question or interrogation is to be understood of the shape and fashion of the garment. The same word is used, Exod.26.30. of the shape, form and fashion of the Tabernacle; for which the word type, or pattern is put, Exod.25.40. which Acts 7.44. and Heb.8.5. is expressed by the Greek word T U P O S] that came up to meet you, and spake these words unto you?
\p
\v 8 . And they said unto him: he was a man with an hairy (garment), [Heb. a man Lord of the hair, that is a man that had much hair on. See of such kind of phrase Gen.14.on v.13. and understand this of the Prophets upper garments made of hair, which is conceived to have been the mantle spoken of 1 King.19.19. See the annotat. And compare Zach.13.4. Mat.3.4. Others apply it to be the length of the hair and beardof the prophet] and girt with a leathern girdle about his loines: then he said; it is Elia the Tisbite.
\p
\v 9 . And he sent to him a Captain of fifty with his fifty: [Which were under the Captains command, all these were sent, not conduct the Prophet in a reverend and honourable manner but to compel him in a spiteful manner, and to take him prisoner, if he refuse to go along with him] and when he went up to him; (for behold he sat on the top of an hill), then he spake unto him; thou man of God, [see Judg.13.on vers.6. Thus he called Elia, not out of reverence, but in a disdainful way, being ready to use violence against him] the King saith, come down.
\p
\v 10 . But Elia answered; and spake unto the Captain of the fifty; if I then be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven. [To wit, fire, which God in an extraordinary manner by his divine power sent out of the skie. Compare Numb.11.1. and see the annotate.] and consume thee and thy fifty, [as much as if he had said, in scorn and spite, thou callest me a man of God; but I pray God to shew immediately by the token which I now desire, that I am one indeed and in truth] then fire came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
\p
\v 11 . And he [Namely, the King] sent again [Heb. he turned again, and sent, that is, he sent again, so v.13. See Num.11.on v.4.] unto him another Captain of fifty with his fifty: This (man) answered, [that is, he began to utter that which he had to say in the Kings name unto the Prophet Elia. See 1 Kings.13.on v.6.] and spake unto him; thou man of God, thus saith the King, come down quickly.
\p
\v 12 . And Elia answered and spake unto them; if I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty: Then the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
\p
\v 13 . And he sent again [Heb. he turned again, and sent. See above on vers.11.] a Captain of the third fifty with his fifty; so the third went up, and came and bowed himself on his knees [Heb. bended himself on his knees] before Elia, and besought him, and spake unto him; Thou man of God, let, I pray thee my soul, [i.e. life, and so in the following words. See Gen.19.on v.17.] and the soul of thy servants, [i.e. that are addicted to thee, to acknowledge thee, and to honour thee as our Lord] of these fifty be precious in thine eyes! [i.e. spare our life, that it may not be taken away from us, as the lives of the former two fifties were.]
\p
\v 14 . Behold, (there) came fire down from heaven, and consumed the two former Captains of fifties, with their fifties: but now let my soul be precious in thine eye.
\p
\v 15 . Then the Angel of the LORD spake unto Elia, [viz. by inward communing and inspiration, or by apparition, which was visible to the Prophet, but not to the Captain. So the Angel of the LORD was seen by Bileam’s ass, but not at first by Bileam, Num.22.25, 31.] Go down with him, be not afraid before his face; And he arose, and went down with him to the King.
\p
\v 16 . And he spake unto him; Thus saith the LORD because thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baal-Zebub the god of Ekron, (is it) becuse there is no God in Israel, to enquire of his word? [see above on vers.3.] Therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed, on which thou art gone up, but thou shalt die the death. [Heb. dying die.]
\p
\v 17 . So he died, according to the word of the LORD, which Elia had spoken: and Joram [To wit, his brother, the son of Achab, below chap.3.1.] became King in his stead, in the second year of Joram, the son of Josaphat, the King of Juda: [to wit, after that he as deputy of his father had begun to reign: which was in the seventeenth year of his fathers reign. See 1 Kings 22.on v.42.] for he had no son.
\p
\v 18 Now the rest of the acts of Ahazia, which he did, are they not written in the book of the Chonicles of the Kings of Israel? [See 1 Kings 14. on v. 19.]
\c 2
\s Elia divideth the Jordan, v.1. &c. he granteth Elisa his request on a certain condition, and ascendeth into heaven in a fiery charet, 9. Elisa divideth the Jordan also, 13. is acknowledged to be a Prophet by the children of the Prophets, 15. who seek elia, but in vain, 16. Elia healeth the waters at Jericho 19. He curseth certain children, that mockingly cryed after him, and are devoured by two bears, 23.
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elia into heaven by a tempest; that Elia went with Elisa from Gilgal. [See of this place, Deut.11, 30. Jos.4.19. and 5.9.]
\p
\v 2 . And Elia said unto Elisa; tarry here, I pray; [He giveth this in charge to try Elisa, or out of an holy humility to hide and conceal the manner of his taking up, it being not revealed to him, that Elisa was to be present at it] for the LORD hath sent me to Bethel, [see of this city, Gen.12.on vers.8.] but Elisa said; (as of true as) the LORD liveth, and soul liveth; I will not leave thee: [i.e. as it is true, that the Lord liveth, and that thou livest, so true it is also that I will not part from thee. This is here properly no oath, respect of the second branch or member, but an asseveration of that which he faith by comparing it with somewhat else, which is out of doubt. So in the sequel, and 1 Sam.1. 26. and 25.26. and below chap.4.30, &c. Heb. if I shall leave thee! So v.4, 6.] So they went down to Bethel.
\p
\v 3 . Then the sons of the Prophets, [See 1 Kings 20.on v.35.] that were at Bethel, went, forth to Elisa, and said unto him; knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy Lord [namely, Elia, whose discipline and servant Elisa was] from thine head [Heb. from upon, or over thine head: that is, from thee. They speak thus, looking at the manner of sitting in the schools, where the master or teacher, sitting in an high or exalted place, had his disciples heads at his feet, so that the parting from them, went as it were away from their heads. Compare Deu.33.3. below chap.4.38. and Acts 22.3.] to day? And he said; I also know it well, [they and Elisa knew this, doubtless by Gods revelation, and by the spirit of prophecy] hold you your peace.
\p
\v 4 . And Elisa said unto him, Elisa tarry here, I pray: for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho: [A city lying in the tribe of Benjamin, not far from the Jordan. It is surnamed the Palm-city, Deut,34.3. See the annot.] but he said; (as true as) the LORD liveth, and thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee: so they came to Jericho.
\p
\v 5 . Then the sons of the Prophets which were at Jericho [Hence it appeareth that the Prophets had their Colleges in many cities, wherein young Prophets and Teachers were trained up for the converting of back sliding Israel] stepped to Elisa, and said unto him, knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy Lord from thine head to day? And he said, I also know it well, hold you your peace.
\p
\v 6 . And Elia said unto him, tarry here I pray, for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan; but he said; (as true as) the LORD liveth, and thy soul liveth, I will not forsake thee: and they both went on.
\p
\v 7 . And fifty men of the sons of the Prophets went, and stood over against (them) afar off: [viz. to see and observed what would befall the prophet Elia] and they both stood by the Jordan.
\p
\v 8 . Then Elia took his mantle, and wept (it) together and smote the water; and it was divided hither and thither: and they both went thorough it on dry (ground).
\p
\v 9 . Now it came to pass, when they were got over, that Elia said unto Elisa: ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee: And Elisa said: I pray thee, let two parts of thy spirit be upon me. [Heb. the mouth of two, in, or of thy spirit, upon, or to me. That is, the part of two; which is two parts. The word mouth is taken for the part of any thing, Deu.21.17. Zach.13.8. The meaning is, as if he had said: Seeing thou, my father, leavest many children, that is, young Prophets behind, who will all stand in need of a part of thy gifts, therefore my request is, I that I may have parts, that is, that my part may be double to theirs, I being as thy first-born, and chiefest disciple, that must succeed in thy room. Others take the double portion in respect, and in comparison of Elisa, so that Elisa should have desired to have once again as much of the Prophetical gifts, as Elia had. Elisa’s request may be also simply thus understood, that he desired the two kinds of Prophetical gifts, wherein Elia was very eminent above other Prophets, which were, First, the foretelling of things to come. Secondly, the working of great miracles. Or else he understandeth that part or portion of prophecy, which Elia had, which was twofold, that is, exceeding great, in respect of many other Prophets.]
\p
\v 10 . And he said; thou hast asked a hard thing: [Heb. thou hast made the matter hard by asking. Hard is taken in this place for that which men cannot, but God only can give, yea and doth give very seldom] if thou shalt see me when I am taken away from thee, [Heb. shalt see from being taken away from thee] it shall so come to pass unto thee; but if not, it shall not come to pass. [this is propounded to him as a token of that which God would do touching his request, that in the mean while he might long with servant prayers for the fulfilling of the token, and have received it, might a new be strengthened and confirmed in the call of his prophetical office.]
\p
\v 11 . And it came to pass, when they went on, going and talking, behold, there was then a fiery charets with fiery horses, [Guided and governed by the Holy Angels. Compare below chap.6.17.] which made a partition between them both both: so Elia went up by a tempest to Heaven.
\p
\v 12 . And Elisa saw it, and he cryed: My Father, my Father, [So he calleth his master, out of love and reverence: as also on the other side disciples and scholars are called sons of their masters. See 1 Kings 20.3 5. and the annotate. thereon] the charet of Israel, and the horsemen thereof; [i.e. the power and strength of Israel, which in war lay most in charets and horsemen, The meaning is, that there was more strength for the lands defence, in Elia’s doctrine, prayers and works, then in the power of war. Compare below chap.13.14.] and he saw him no more: and he took hold of his (own) cloathes, and rent them in two pieces. [Heb. rents, viz. in token of sorrow and grief for the loss of his master. See Gen.37.on v.29.]
\p
\v 13 . He took up also Elia’s mantle, that was fallen down from him; and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan.
\p
\v 14 . And be took the mantle of Elia that was fallen down from him; and smote the water and said; where is the LORD the God of Elia? [viz. who in a like action had immediately before by Elia manifested his power in dividing the waters See above v.8.] yea the same, and he smote the water and it was divided hither and thither and Elisa went thorough it.
\p
\v 15 . Now when the children of the Prophets which were over against at Jericho, saw him, then they said, the spirit of Elia resteth on Elisa: and they came to meet him, and bowed themselves down to the ground before him. [Giving him civil honour and respect, as a Prophet come in Elia’s room, and abundantly furnished with his Prophetical gifts. Gen.18.on v.2.]
\p
\v 16 . And they said unto him, behold now, there are with thy servants [i.e. with us, who are ready to serve thee] fifty valiant [or, strong] men, [Heb. men, [Heb. men, sons of valour, strength. Understand such as were sit to undertake this journey, and this work] let them go, we pray, and seek thy LORD, left peradvernture the spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon one of the mountains, or into one of the valleys: [they thought that he was not taken away from them forever, but only for certain days. Compare 1 Kings 18. the annotat.on v. 12.] but he said , send not. [for he knew certainly, that he was both in body and soul taken up to God into heaven.]
\p
\v 17 . But they were instant with him, even unto shame, [This may fitly be understand of Elisa, for being so long entreated before he would yield: although it may also be understood of the sons of the Prophets, because they were sain to entreat so long while, and so much] and he said; and they sent fifty men, who sought three days, but found him not.
\p
\v 18 . Then they came to him again, while he tarried at Jericho; and he said them; did I not say unto you, go not?
\p
\v 19 . And the men of the city said unto Elisa; Behold, now the dwelling of this city is good, according as my Lord seeth, but the water is bad, and the land barren. [i.e. The land brings not the fruits of the Earth to maturity and ripeness, yea, its also hurtful to the lives of men and beasts, and likewise to the fruit of their body, whereby the land is bare and left desolate of inhabitants: at which the Hebrew word looketh, signifying bereaving of children, men, and whatever is dear unto man.]
\p
\v 20 . And he said; bring me [Heb. take me; that is, take it and bring it to me. See Gen.12 on v.15.] a new bowl, and put salt therein: and they brought it to him.
\p
\v 21 . Then he went forth to the water well, and cast the salt therein: and said; Thus saith the LORD; I have healed this water; there shall be no more death, [On men and beasts] nor barrenness [to wit, not only on men and beasts, but also on the land, and the fruits of the Earth. See above on ver.19.] from thence.
\p
\v 22 . So that water was healed unto this day: according to the word of Elisa, which he had spoken.
\p
\v 23 . And he went up from thence unto Bethel: Now as he went up the way, there came little boys out of the city, which mocked him, and said unto him, bald-paie [Heb. bald; that is, who is bald] go up, bald-paie up. [they mocked him thus, not only out of contempt of his person, because he was bald, but also of his of his office, because he was a Prophet of the Lord, and consequently a continual reprove of idolatry, which these boys from their infancy had sucked in, and was so practised in Bethel, that the Prophets called this city Bethaven, that is, the house of vanity and wickedness, Hos.4.15. Amos 5.5.]
\p
\v 24 . And he turned himself back, and looked on them, and cursed them [Not out of hatred of their persons, but of their idolatry, which they had so exceedingly loved, that ever since they had any knowledge or understanding, they were taught and accustomed to hate the true God and his faithful ministers with a deadly hatred] in the name of the LORD: [i.e. by command and inspiration of the Lord, or with calling upon his name. To do any thing in the name of the Lord, is to do it, First, by command, charge and motion, or compulsion of God, Deut.18.19. 2 Chron.33.18. Job.5.43. Secondly, with confidence on God, and with calling on his name, Psa.44.6. and 63.5. Thirdly, for Gods sake, or because of him, Mat.18.5. Fourthly, to the glory of God, Col.3.17.] Then there came forth two bears out of the wood, and tare two and fourty children of them.
\p
\v 25 . And h went from thence to mount Carmel; [See 1 Kings 18.on v.19.] and from thence he returned to Samaria.
\c 3
\s Joram reigneth, and followeth the sin of Jerobeam, vers.1 &c. goeth to battle against the Moabites, with Josaphat, and with the King of Edom, 4. they living in want of water, God is enquired by the Prophet Elisa, 10. God promiseth water and victory over the Enemies, 16. and performeth his promise, 20.
\p
\v 1 Now Joram the son of Achab became King over Israel at Samaria, in the eighteenth year of Josaphat the of Juda, [Which was the twelfth year of Ahazia’s reign. Compare herewith above chap.1.17. and the annotat.] and he reigned twelve years.
\p
\v 2 . And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, but not like his father, and like his mother: For he put away the reared image of Baal, which his Father had made. [Understand the reared image of the idol of the Zidonians, reared up at Samaria by Achab. See 1 Kings 16.32.]
\p
\v 3 . Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jerobeam the son of Nebat, [For he served the golden calves, which Jerobeam had caused to be made, 1 Kings 12.28, 29, etc.] that made Israel to sin, he departed not from the same.
\p
\v 4 . Now Mesa the King of the Moabites was a dealer in cattle, and delivered up to the King of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams with the wool. [That is, he had great trading and riches in cattle, of which he was to pay tribute from that time that David had brought him under his subjection, 2 Sa.8.12. Now after the separation of the ten tribes from the house of Juda, the Kings of Israel took this jurisdiction over the Moabites to themselves, as the Kings of Juda on the contrary kept to themselves the command over the Edomites, who revolted under Joram the son of Josaphat, below chap.8.20. as the Moabites revolted from Israel under Joram the so of Achab, in the following verse, and above chap.1.1.]
\p
\v 5 . But it came to pass, when Achab was dead, that the King of the Moabites revolted from the King of Israel. [Heb. transgressed against the King Israel: so in the sequel. This revolt was made in the reign of his brother Ahaza; after the death of his Fathers Achab, above chap.1.1.]
\p
\v 6 . So King Joram went out of Samaria the same time, and mustered all Israel.
\p
\v 7 . And he went, and sent Josaphat the King of Juda, saying; The King of the Moabites is revolted from me, [That am the lawful successor in my fathers Kingdom, and therefore must take such revolt to heart, although it hath been committed herefore. See above chap.1.1.] wilt thou go to war with me against the Moabites? and he said, I will come up, I will be so, as thou art, my people so as thy people, my horses so as thy horses. [compare 1 Kings 22.4. and see the annotat.]
\p
\v 8 . And he said; which way shall we go up? [He; namely, Josaphat, asked this, because he would take the King of Edom along with him. It may be also meant of Joram, as willing to advise with Josaphat] then he said; by the way of the wilderness of Edom. [viz. to surprise on the Moabites behind.]
\p
\v 9 . So the King of Israel went, and the King of Juda, and the King of Edom: [Who was still as this time the deputy of the King of Juda, 1 Kings 22.48. Compare herewith the annotat. above on vers.4. He is called a King in this place, because he kept the room of a King, as this word is also used elsewhere for a governor, or ruler. See Judg.17.on v.6.] and when they had fetch a compass of seven days journey, the camp and the cattle that followed them, [Hebr. that was in, or at their feet See Judg.4.on v.10.] had no water.
\p
\v 10 . Then said the King of Israel; Ah! that the LORD hath called these three Kings (together) to deliver them into hands of the Moabites.
\p
\v 11 . And Josaphat said; is (there) not here a Prophet of the LORD, that we might enquire of the LORD by him? [see 1 Kings 22.4.] then answered one of the servants of the Kings of Israel, and said; here is Elisa the son of Sephat, who poured water on Elia’s hands. [i.e. who ministered unto Elia: for this is one of the services, which the servants and ministers were wont to perform to their Lords and master.]
\p
\v 12 . And Josaphat said; the word of the LORD is with him: [Intimating that he was a Prophet of the true God, and consequently was able to give them good counsel from God] so the King of Israel and Josaphat, and the King of Edom went down to him. [viz. to Elisa, who is conceived to have followed the camp by Gods instinct, and to have been not far off without the camp at that time.]
\p
\v 13 . But Elisa said unto the King of Israel; what have I to do with thee: [Heb. what me, and thee? So 2 Sa.16.10. Mark 1.24. Luke 4.34. John 2.4.] go thy ways to the Prophets of thy Father, and to the Prophets of Baal, of the idolatrous groves, and of the calves of Jerobeam. Of such, see 1 Kings 18.19.] but the King of Israel said unto him; Nay. [i.e. meddle not with those things, or speak not of them] for the LORD hath called hands of the Moabites. [he implyeth that the reason for which they desired his advice, was of great moment, in regard that by the present distress, not only his life, but likewise that of the two other Kings were in great danger.]
\p
\v 14 . And Elisa said; (as true as) the LORD of hosts liveth, before whose face I stand, [i.e. whom I serve. See Deut.10.on v.8.] if I did not accept the face of Josaphat the King of Juda, [i.e. if I did not with affection, regard his person for his piety and virtue sake] I would not look toward thee, nor regard thee. [Heb. if I would look toward thee, or if I would see thee.]
\p
\v 15 . Now then bring me [Heb. take me. See above chap.2.20.] a minstrel: [the Hebrew word signifieth properly one that playeth upon musical instruments, as Harps, Citren, Lute.etc. Such kind of player the Prophets seemeth to have called for, partly to quiet his heart about the discontentedness which he bare toward the King Joram, partly to stir up unto God by songs of praise and players, which were played, and so to sit himself for the receiving of that, which God should reveal unto him, in a well prepared heart. Compare 1 Sam.10.5.] and it came to pass when the player played on the stringed instrument, that the hand of the LORD came [Heb. was, or waxed] upon him. [by the hand of the Lord, is here to be meant the power of prophesying, to give counsel and advice to these Kings, and to foretell what should come to pass. Such abilities the Prophets had not at all times, but when it pleased God to give the same unto them. See below chap.4.27. and Ezek.1.on v.3. Although they were to sit and prepared themselves by fasting, singing, praying, and reading the Holy Scripture, for the receiving of them, Dan.2.17,18.]
\p
\v 16 . And he said; Thus saith the LORD; Make many ditches [Heb. Ditches, ditches; that is, many ditches here and there. See of this doubling of a word, Gen.14.on v.10.] in this valley.
\p
\v 17 . For thus saith the LORD: Ye shall see no wind, neither shall ye see any rain, yet this valley shall be filled with water, so that ye shall drink, ye, and your cattle and your beasts. [see Gen.36.on v.6.]
\p
\v 18 . Moreover, that is slight, [Heb. Light] in the eyes of the LORD: he will also deliver the Moabites into your hand. [i.e. Besides the mercy which ye have asked, to wit, abundance of water, the Lord will give you yet the thing which ye have not asked, to wit, Victory over your enemies.]
\p
\v 19 . And ye shall smite all fenced Cities, and all choice Cities, and shall fell all good trees, [This is a particular and special command, excepted from the general and common rule, Deut.20.19. Or, this rule is to be understood onely of the long-continuing siege of a particular City, and not of the speedy desolation of a Country] and shall stop all Fountains of water, and ye shall mar [Heb. cause to grieve, or, lament] all good pieces of land with stones. [i.e. make them barren and unuseful, by casting stones upon them; so that it shall be therewith by means of this devastation, or laying waste, as it is with a man, that being endammage and forsake by all, mourneth and lamenteth. That which is related in this verse, is not onely a bare command of what they were to do, but also a promise of what they should do with it for their own benefit and advantage, and annoying of the enemy.]
\p
\v 20 . And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat-offering was offered, [See 1 Kings 18.on ver.29.] that behold there came water by the way of Edom; and the land was filled with water.
\p
\v 21 . Now when all the Moabites heard, that the Kings were marched up to fight against them, then they were called together, from all those that girt on the girdle, [To wit, warlike girdle with the weapons or arms belonging to it, and that for their first time; that is, who were now first found fit to bear arms, and to go to wars] and upward, and stood at the border. [Meaning of their Land, to wit, to keep their enemies out.]
\p
\v 22 . And when they gat them up early in the morning, and the Sun rose upon that water; the Moabites saw that water on the other side red as blood. [This redness was caused by the Sun-beams, which now first began to appear on the earth.]
\p
\v 23 . And they said; This is blood: the Kings have surely spoiled themselves [Heb. Spoiling spoiled themselves; that is, surely, or utterly marred, undone, or, destroyed. The Hebrew word signifieth properly to lay waste, from whence the word sowed, with the Hebrews, hath its denomination, because it causeth desolation, or wasting. The meaning then is, that they have destroyed themselves by mutual murdering and killing of one another, as in the following words is declared, and so have made the camp desolate, and laid it waste] with the sword, and have smitten one another: Now then to the prey, ye Moabites:
\p
\v 24 . But when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites gat them up, and smote the Moabites, and they fled from their face: yea they [To wit, the Israelites] came (into the land), smitting also the Moabites. [Heb. into their, &c. understanding the land of the Moabites, out of which these intended to turn out the Israelites above ver.21. Otherwise, these words may be thus translated: and they smote them in their (land) smitten also (the land) of the Moabites. The meaning is one and the same. The Israelites following their victory, chased the Moabites in their own Country, and smote them also there, and quelled them.]
\p
\v 25 . Now they brake down the cities, and every man did cast his stone upon all good pieces of land, and filled them up, and stopped all fountains of water, and felled all good trees, until they onely left in Kir-Hareseth [One of the chiefest, and strong cities of the Moabites, having a wall of stone, whereof it seemeth to have gotten its name so of this city likewise, Jer.16.7.] the stone thereof: [understand the stone-wall of the fore-named City which the Israelites left undermolished, after they had broker down all their cities, over-run and laid waste all the Champion Country] and the slingers compassed it about, and smote it. [i.e. they acted such violence with their slingers, and other instruments of war, that the Citizens were not able to defend their City walls, and many of them were slain]
\p
\v 26 . But when the King of the Moabites saw, that the battle was too strong for him, he took unto him seven hundred men that drew the sword, [See the signification of this phrase, Judg.8. on ver.10.] to break thorough against the King of Edom, [or, unto, or, thorough the Kings Camp] but they could not.
\p
\v 27 . Then he [To wit, the King of Moab] took his firstborn son, that should be King in his stead, and offered him for a burnt-offering upon the wall: [This King of the Moabites, to obtain the aid and assistance of his Idol Chamos in this distress of his, offered up his eldest son for a burnt-offering upon the wall of the City; in the view of the besiegers: for by such kind of sacrifice Idolters thought they performed the greatest service and honour that could be, unto their Idols; vainly persuading themselves that they were herein followers of Abraham. Others conceive that he did not offer up his own son, but the King of Edoms son, whom (as they say) he took prisoner in the sally, when he assayed with seven hundred men to break thorough the King Edoms camp, in the former verse. For proof of this opinion is alleged Amos.2.1. See examples of those that have offered up their children unto Idols, Psal.106.37. Ezek.20 31. which God had forbidden upon pain of death, Lev.20.2.] thence (there) was very great wrath in Israel: To wit, because by this hard siege, and implacable ware they had brought the King of the Moabites to this desperate and cruel act. Oth. against Israel, understanding by this wrath or indignation to be meant especially the wrath or indignation of the King of Edom, and his Camp, because of the abominable murder of his son] therefore they departed from him, and returned to (their own) land.
\c 4
\s Elisa by a miracle multiplieth the oil of a poor widow, vers 1, &c. He is lodged by the Sunamite, 8. He promiseth her a son, 12. Whom she obtaineth, 17. The son dieth, 18. Whom Elisa restoreth to life, 29. He taketh away the venomous quality from the wild gourds, 38. And feedeth an hundred men with twenty barely loaves, and green ears, 42.
\p
\v 1 Now a (certain) woman of the wives of the sons of the Prophets [See 1 Kings 20.on ver.35.] cried unto Elisa, saying; Thy servant, my husband, is dead, and thou knowest, that thy servant feared the LORD; now the creditour [to whom I am indebted for moneys borrowed, or Wares bought, or otherwise] is come, to take both my children (to be) his servants. [i.e. bond-men, slaves: to wit, either that he himself may use them as such, or else fell them to others, for that which I owe him, and am not able up pay. See the: Law of God concerning this kind of bondage, Lev.25.39.]
\p
\v 2 And Elisa said unto her; What shall I do for thee? tell me; What hast thou in the house? and she said, Thine hand-maid hath nothing at all in the house, save a pitcher with oil. [To wit, which was full of oil, or at least wherein some oil was yet left.]
\p
\v 3 . Then he said; Go ask for thy self vessels abroad, of all thy neighbour, empty vessels; see that thou hast not a few. [As well out of thine own house, as borrowed of others, and brought all together.]
\p
\v 4 . Then come in, and shut the door before thee [Or, upon, or, by thee] and before thy sons: [viz. That none may hinder thee, either in the work, which I enjoy thee to do, or in the devotion, which thou must have therein unto the LORD] then pour into all these vessels, [to wit, oil out of thy pitcher] and fell away that which is full.
\p
\v 5 . So she went from him, and shut up the door before her, and before her sons; they brought her the vessels, and she poured in.
\p
\v 6 . And it came to pass, when these vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel: but he said unto her, There is not a vessel more: and the oil stood still. [i.e. Was not multitude more, forasmuch as the pitcher, out of which she had poured, yielded no more oil.]
\p
\v 7 . Then she came, and told it to the man of God; [Namely Elisa: see Judg.13.on v.6.] and he said, Go thy ways, sell thy oil, and pay thy Creditour: thou then (with) thy sons live by the rest. [To wit, of the oil, or the money, that thou shalt have made of the oil over and above thy debt.]
\p
\v 8 . Also it came to pass on a day, when Elisa passed on to Sunem, [See 1 Kings 1 on v.3.] that there was a great woman, [great, in descent, name, and means. See Gen.14.35. and the annotate. also compare 1 Sam.25.2.] that besought him, to eat bread: [i.e. to take his repast with her. See Gen.31.on v.54. so in the sequel] more over, it came to pass, (that) as oft (as) he passed by, he turned in thither, to eat bread.
\p
\v 9 . And he said unto her husband; Behold now, I have perceived that this man of God is holy; [See Lev.19.on v.2.] which passeth by us continually.
\p
\v 10 . Let us, I pray, make a little upper chamber of a wall, [Heb.upper chamber of the wall; that is, a little chamber, that butted out with a wall. The Hebrew word is used both of stone-walls, above chap.3.25. and of board, or timber-walls, Levit.1.15. where mention is made of the wall of the Altar, which was made of wood, Exod.17.1. Oth.of, or, with walls] and let us set for him there a bed, and (a) table, and (a) candlestick, so it shall come to pass, when he cometh to us, (that) he shall turn in thither.
\p
\v 11 . And it came to pass on a day, that he came thither; and he turned into that upper chamber, and laid himself down there.
\p
\v 12 . Then he said unto his lad, [Or, servant, or, minister. The Hebrew word is affirmed not only of youths, or young men, but also of men of full growth and age. See Gen.22.on v.5. Such an one seemeth Gehazi to have been, by what is related below, chap.5.ver.27.] Gehazi, Call this Sunamitish (woman) and when he had called her, she stood before his face, [i.e. before Elisa.]
\p
\v 13 . (For he said him, [Namely to his servant Gehazi] say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this carefulness, [The word signifieth such a care as is accompanied with fear and trembling, whereby a man is afraid to omit, or neglect anything that is needful and necessary, or not do it so as it ought to be done. Compare Luke 10.40,41.] what is there to be done for thee? Is there any thing to be spoken for thee to the King; or to the chief Captain? and she had said, I dwell in the midst of my people. [i.e. I have peace and friendship with the people among whom I dwell, so that I am at variance with none, for which cause I should have need to trouble either the King, or his chief Captain.]
\p
\v 14 . Then he [Namely Elisa] had said; [to wit, to his servant Gehazi, when he had told his master Elisa, what the woman had answered] What is there then to be done for her? And Gehazi had said; She hath indeed no son, and her husband is old.
\p
\v 15 . Therefore he [Namely Elisa] had said, [to wit, to his servant Gehazi] Call her; and when he had called her, she stood in the door. [to wit, to the door. [to wit, of the Prophets little chamber. Compare this with the foregoing 12. verse, unto which it must be applied, according to the relation of what is spoken between, contained in the 13,14, and 15.verses.]
\p
\v 16 . And he said, On this appointed time, [i.e. On, or at time of the year: so in the following verse: see these very same words, Gen.18.14.] about this time of life [see Gen.18.on ver.10.] thou shalt embrace a son: and she said, Nay, my LORD, thou man of God, do not lie unto thine hand-maid. [i.e. make me not a promise of any good thing, whereof the performance may not follow.]
\p
\v 17 . And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that appointed time, about the time of life, that Elisa had spoken to her.
\p
\v 18 . Now when the child grew great, it happened on a day, that it went forth to his Father to the Reapers.
\p
\v 19 . And it said unto his Father, My head, my head: [It acquaints him thus with the pain, that it fell in his head] then he [to wit, the Father] said unto a lad, Carry him to his mother.
\p
\v 20 . And he carried him, and brought him to his Mother: and he sat on her knees till noon, then he died.
\p
\v 21 . And she went up [To wit, to the upper chamber, which she had caused to be made for Elisa: see above v.10.] and laid him on the bed of the man of God: then she shut [to wit, the door] before him [see above on verse 4.] and went forth.
\p
\v 22 . And she called for her husband, and said, [i.e. Sent word to him] send me, I pray, one of the lads, and one of the she-asses, that I may run to the man of God, and return.
\p
\v 23 . And he said, Why doest thou go to him to day? It is neither new Moon, nor Sabbath: [He said this, because the godly ones, that were yet left in Israel, employed the New Moons, Sabbaths, and other Festivals in Religious Works; and to this end, repaired to the prophets of the Lord, who kept Assemblis and Meerings for the preservation of found Doctrine, and pure Religion] and she said, it shall be well. [Heb. Peace. See Gen. 37. on ver.14. Intimating that all would be well, forasmuch as she made this journey for good end; in the mean while she concealeth from her husband the death of her son, as well not suddenly to deceive him, as also that her Journey might not be hindered.]
\p
\v 24 . Then she sadled the she-ass, and said unto her lad; Drive, and go forward: cease not for me ride on, except I tell thee. [That is, slack not, or hinder not the journey for my ease sake, unless I bid thee.]
\p
\v 25 . So she went, and came to the man of God, to mount Carmel: [See 1 Kings 18.on ver.19.] and it came to pass, when the men of God saw her over against (him), that he said unto his lad Gehasi; Behold, there is the Sunamites (woman)
\p
\v 26 . Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her; Is it well with thee? Is it well with thy husband? Is it well with thy child? [Heb. hast thou peace? hath thine husband peace? &c. See Gen.29.on v.6.] and she said, it is well.
\p
\v 27 . Now when she came to the man of God on the hill, she caught hold on his feet; [she did this not onely out of humble reverence, but also out of servant affection, to crave something from Elisa, desiring that he would not stir out of his place, until he had heard her. Compare Matth.28 9.] but Gehasi step forth to thrust her away; [to wit, that she might not be troublesome to his master. Compare Matth.10.13.] but the man of God said, Let her alone, for her soul is bitterly grieved within her, (Hebr. bitter to her; that is, possest with some grief, that goeth exceedingly to her heart. Butterness, is taken for grief, and vexation or trouble of heart, Gen.26 35. Ruth 1.20. 1 Sam.1.10. and 22.2. Job 3.20. and 7.11. and 9.18. Prov.14.10.] and the LORD hath hid it from me, and made me not acquainted with it.
\p
\v 28 . And she said, Did I desire a son of my Lord? [Intimating that she had not desired him of Elisa, but that had promised him her of his own accord, and therefore ought now to cease with his prayers, that she might get him again] did I say, do not deceive me? [oth. promise no luck to me.]
\p
\v 29 . And he said unto Gehasi, Gird up thy loins, [To wit, to dispatch the Journey the speedier, which he was commanded to make; for which long garments that men wore in those times, were a great hinderance. Compare 1 Kings 18 46. 2 kings 9.1. Jer.1.17.] and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy ways: if thou find any man, salute him not; [Heb. bless him not: see Gen.31.on v.35.’Tis a phrase, signifying that he was to make haste in his journey, and to cast off all lets and hinderances that he might meet withal by the way. Compare Luke 10 4] and if any man salute thee, answer him not; and lay my staff upon the lads face. [for a token of the miracle, which God shall do. Thus God wrought by the staff of Moseh, Exod.14.16. by the mantle of Elia, 2 Kings 2.8. by the handkerchiefs, and girdle of Paul, Act.19.12. which proceeded onely from the power of God, whereof these things were but means and tokens, when it pleased God to work by them.]
\p
\v 30 . But the mother of the lad said, (As true as) the LORD liveth, and thy soul liveth, [See above chap.2.on v.2.] I will not leave thee: [Heb. if I leave thee!] then he arose, and followed her.
\p
\v 31 . Now Gehasi passed on before their face: and he laid the staff upon the face of the lad; but there was no voice, [i.e. No token of life. The reason was, because Elisa had not yet made his prayer to God, without which the laying on of the staff was fruitless. Now he had not made his prayer, because by the mother earnest importunity he was minded himself to go the child, and there to pour out his prayer unto the LORD, which otherwise he would have done at home in his own house] nor any attention [i.e. hearing, or listening] so he turned back to meet him, and brought him word, saying; The lad is not awaked. [to wit, from the sleep of death. Compare Isa.26.19. Da.12.2.]
\p
\v 32 . And when Elisa came into the house, [To wit, of the Shunamite] Behold, the lad was dead, being laid upon his bed. [to wit, upon the man of Gods bed, above ver.21.which bed was in the chamber, which the Sunamite had caused to be made in her house for the prophet, above ver.10.]
\p
\v 33 . So he went in, [To wit, into the chamber, wherein he had been sometimes lodged, and where the dead body lay upon the bed] and shut the door upon both: [Namely, before him, and before the child] and prayed unto the LORD.
\p
\v 34 . And he went up, [To wit, upon the bed, whereon the dead child lay: so in the following verse] and laid himself down upon the child, and laying his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands, spreading himself upon him, [see the examples, 1 Kings hands, spread himself upon him, [see the examples, 1 Kings 17.21. Act.20.10.] and the flesh of the child waxed warm.
\p
\v 35 . Then he returned, and walked in the house once hither, and once thither, and went up (again), and stretched himself out upon him, and the lad sneezed seven times, after that the lad opened his eyes. [Miracle are finished two manner of ways: First, sometimes forthwith, and immediately, as 1 Kings 18.37,38. Job.11.43,44. below ver.41.&c. Secondly sometimes by little and little, or by degrees, as here; so 1 Kings 18.44 45. Mark 8. ver.24, 52.]
\p
\v 36 . And he called Gehezi, and said, call this Sunamite; and he called her, and she came to him: and he said, Take up thy son.
\p
\v 37 . So she came, and fell before his feet, and bowed herself to the ground: [With civil reverence, to give him thanks for the mercy, that God had bestowed upon her by his Ministery] and she took up her son, and went forth.
\p
\v 38 . Now when Elisa came again to Gigal, [See above chap.2.on v.1.] then there was (a) famine in that land, and the sons of the Prophets sat before his face: [To wit, as Disciples at his feet, to be instructed by him, as by their Master and Teacher: see above chap.2.on verse 3.] and he said unto his lad; Set on the great pot, [or, order, or make ready the great pot] and see the pottage sons of the Prophets.
\p
\v 39 . Then one went out into the field to gather pottage herbs, and he found a wild vine, [Heb. Vine of the field; that is, that growth in the field, or in some wild place: so ye have straightway Gourds of the field, that is, wild gourds, or colorinints] and gathered thereof, his garment full of wild gourds, [the branches whereof they writ that they be not unlike to the vine. It may be that they did shoot up neer this wild vine, and were mingled with the branches and leaves thereof, as wild gourds are wont to do: or that the names of wild vine, and wild gourds, in respect of the likeness of leaves and branches, were changed] and came, and shred them into the pot of pottage, for they knew them not. [namely, that their fruit was so bitter and dangerous.]
\p
\v 40 . Then they filled up [Heb. Poured out, that is filled up, and poured in, to wit, into the vessels out of which they were to eat] for the men [namely, the sons of the Prophets] to eat: and it came to pass, when they did eat of that pottage, that they cried, and said, Man of God, death is in the pot: [that is, a kind of meat, whereof a man may eat his bane, or, death. Compare Exod.10.on v.17.] and they could not eat it. [to wit, because of the great bitterness.]
\p
\v 41 . But he said, Then bring [Heb. Take; that is, take and bring: see Gen.12.on v.15.] meal: and he cast it into the pot: [see Exod.15.25.] and he said, take up for the people that they may eat; Then there was no barm in the pot. [Heb. no evil thing, &c. the meal had not taken this away, but the power of God, whereof the meal was onely a token and means.]
\p
\v 42 . And there came a man from Baal Salisa, [A country in Benjamin: see 1 Sam 9.4.] and brought the man of God (loaves of) bread, of the fruits, twenty barley loaves, and green ears in their husks: [or, in their little houses; understand, that they stuck yet in their chaff, being not thrashed, or beaten out, oth. in his garment] and he said, Give unto the people [i.e. unto the sons of the Prophets] that they may eat.
\p
\v 43 . But his servant said; What should I set that before an hundred men? [Heb. Set that before their face. He counteth the loaves to be few, comparing the multitude of the people, which were an hundred in number, with the smallness of the loaves, of which one man (as is conceived) might easily carry twenty. Compare Job.6 9.] and he said, Give unto people, that they may eat; for thus saith the LORD; They shall eat, and leave (thereof) [see Job.6.11.]
\p
\v 44 . So he set it before them, and they did eat, and they left (thereof) according to the Word of the LORD.
\c 5
\s Naaman cometh to Elisa, to be healed of his Leprosy, ver.1, &c. Being commanded to wash himself in the Jordan, he taketh it disdainfully at first, 10. Afterward he doth it, 13. He is healed, 14. Taketh his leave of Elisa, who refuseth to take his gifts, and lets him depart in peace, 15. His servant Gehazi taketh gifts from him, 20. For which he is punished with Naamans leprosy, 25.
\p
\v 1 Now Naama the chief Captain of the king of Syria, was a great man, [i.e. Of great power and antiquity, in regard of his qualities, and valiant acts. Compare Exod.11.on vers.3.] before the face of his Lord, [namely, the King of Syria: so below v.4. and 18.] and of high respect: [Heb. exalted of face; i.e. highly esteemed, and regarded by all. Oth. acceptable; according to a certain phrase, or manner of speaking; of which see Gen.32.on v.20.] for by him the LORD had given deliverance unto the Syrians: [to wit, by his wise counsel, and valiant acts] so this man a warlike champion, (but) leprous.
\p
\v 2 . And there were hands [The Hebrew word signifieth heaps, and assembies of souldiers, that fall into a country to rob and plunder: so 1 Sam.30 8. below ch.13.21. and 24.2.] marched out of Syria, [or, the Syrians had marched forth by hands] and had brought (away) captive out of the land of Israel a little maid, which was in the servant of Naamans wife; [Hebr. before the face of Naamans wife; that is, which waited on Naamans wife, or was servant to her. So, to stand before ones face, is to serve him, or waited on him; see Deut.1.on v.38. 1 Kings on ver.2. Oth. which was before the face of Naamans wife; that is, in her presence.]
\p
\v 3 . This (maid) said unto her mistress; Oh if my Lord were before the face of the Prophet, that is at Samaria, then he would recover him of his leprosy. Some conceiveth that this hath regard to the separation of the Lepers, and their gathering unto the people when they were healed: see Numb.12.on v.14. So below chap.6. vers.7,11. Heb. gather, &c. which phrase, to gather one of, or from his leprosy, is as much as, to gather the leprosy on, i.e. to take it away from him, because that which is gathered, is taken away from the place, from which it is gathered: see Prov.26.on v.9.]
\p
\v 4 . Then he [Namely, Naaman the Syrian, when these words of the Israelitish woman were told him] went in, [to wit, unto the King his Lord] and made his Lord acquainted with it, saying: Thus and thus spake the maid, that is of the Land of Israel.
\p
\v 5 . Then said the King of Syria: Go to, come, and I will send a letter to the King of Israel; and he went his way, and took in his hand [i.e. With him. Compare 1 Sam.9.8. 2 Sam.8.10. 1 Kings 14.3. and below chap.8.8.] ten talents of silver, [see of a talent, Exod.25.on ver.3 9.] and six thousand (shekels) of gold, [see of the value of a common shekel of gold, Gen.14.on ver.22. and Numb.7.on v.14] and ten changes of raiment. [see Gen.45.on v.22. These things he took along with him as a free present, to gratify the Prophet therewith. See 1 Kings 14.on v.3.]
\p
\v 6 . And he brought the letter to the King of Israel, saying; Now when this letter shall come unto thee; behold, I have sent Naaman my servant unto thee, that thou mayest deliver him of his leprosy. [To wit, by means of thy Prophet Elisa; as a man may judge that this was his meaning, by what was related above v.4. But the King of Israel understood this thus, as if he himself in his own person were charged by the letter, to cure Prince Naaman of his leprosy, as appeareth by the following verse.]
\p
\v 7 . And it came to pass, when the King of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said; Am I then a God, to kill, and to make alive, that this (man) doth send to me, to deliver a man of his leprosy? For, of a truth, consider, I pray, and see (how) that he seeketh occasion against me. [viz. to make war against me, if I do not cure this Naaman: for he knoweth right well that it is not in my power to do it.]
\p
\v 8 . But it came to pass, when Elisa, the man of God, had heard, that the King of Israel had rent his clothes; that he sent to the King to tell (him); Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? [Intimating, that he ought not for this cause to have rent his clothes, but rather to have asked counsel of the Lord by him. Compare above chap.1.ver.6 16.] Let him come now to me, then he shall know, that there is a Prophet in Israel.
\p
\v 9 . So Naaman come with his horses, and with his charet; [Or, charets. For the singular number is oft with this word, in such transaction as this, taken for the plural; as Gen.50.9. 1 Kings 1.5. & 10.26. Isa.37.24.] and stood before the door of Elisa’s house.
\p
\v 10 . Then Elisa sent a messenger unto him, saying: Go thy ways, and wash thy self seven times in the Jordan, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, [viz. which by the leprosy was taken off, and consumed away from thee] and thou shalt be clean, [Heb. be thou clean: that is, thou shalt surely be clean. So vers.13. Neither the Jordan, nor the seven-fold washing, had the virtue to cure the leprosy, but onely the power of God, who was pleased to work by that means.]
\p
\v 11 . But Naaman grew very angry, and went away, and said; Behold, I said with my self, he will surely come out, [Heb. Coming out, come out. Oth. I said, he will surely come out to me, etc.] and stand, and call on the Name of the LORD his God, and strike [Heb. move] his hand over the place, and recover the leper, [i.e. cure me of my leprosy. oth. that which is leprous: that is, take away the leprosy: see above on v.3.]
\p
\v 12 . Are not Abana, [Otherwise called Amana, and by Historians Adonis] and Pharpar [in Histories called Orontes] the Rivers of Damascus, better then all the waters of Israel? might I not wash my self in them, and be clean? [he thought that the virtue of the water could cure him, whereas it was but a token and means of the promised cure] so he turned himself, and went away with indignation.
\p
\v 13 . Then his servants step forth, and spake unto him, and said, my Father, [This is an appellation of reverence, love, and fear, which inferiors are wont to give to their superiors, when they carry themselves indeed as Fathers. Compare the annotate. Gen.41.on v.43.] (if) that Prophet had spoken a great thing unto thee, [i.e. had bid thee do some difficult thing] wouldest thou not have done it? how much ,ore, seeing he hath said unto thee, Wash thy self, and thou shalt be clean?
\p
\v 14 . Then he went down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the Word of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he became clean.
\p
\v 15 . Then be returned to the man of God, he, and his host, [Heb. all his camp. Understand hereby all those that he had taken along with him in journey, which were for multitude like an army] and came, and stood before his face, and said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all earth, but in Israel: now then, I pray thee, take a blessing [i.e. Gift, Present: see Gen.33.on ver.11.] of thy servant.
\p
\v 16 . But he said (As true as) the LORD liveth, before whose face I stand, [i.e. Whom I serve: see Deut.10.on ver.8.] of I take it; [understand withal, the Lord punish me. For in oaths the Hebrew did commonly conceal this punishment: see Gen.14.on v.23.] and he was instant with him, to take it; but he refuseth it.
\p
\v 17 . And Naaman said, If not [i.e. If thou wilt not receive my gifts, grant me at least another request, which I intend now to put up unto thee: see the like phrase, 2 Sam.13.26.] let (there then), I pray be given to thy servant [that is, to me, that do owe thee service] a burden of earth of a mules: [i.e. as much as two mules are able to carry at once] for thy servant will no more offer burnt-offering, or slay-offering unto other Gods, but unto the LORD.
\p
\v 18 . In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant: when my Lord [To wit, the King of Syria: see above v.1,4.] shall go into the house of Rimmon, [the name of an Idol, which the Syrians worshipped] to how down himself there, [to wit, to worship the Idol] and he shall lean on mine hand, and I shall how down me self in the house of Rimmon; [not to worship the Idol, or to perform any religious honor or service unto it, but to wait and attend upon his King, that leaned on his hand, when he bowed himself down his Idol: for which cause Naaman was also constraint to bow himself] when I shall (thus) bow down me self in the house of Rimmon, the LORD now pardon thy servant in this thing: [he then knew full well, that bowing down before Idols, though it be not done to their honour, cannot be done or performed without sin. In these two verses, viz. the 17, and 18. he requesteth two things of the Prophet. First, to carry some quantity of the Countrys earth along with him into Syria, to build an altar therewith, on which he might offer sacrifice unto the LORD. Secondly, that he might be pardoned, when so ever he should be present in the house of the Idol Rimmon, to wait upon his Lord there, whereby indeed he bewrayeth a good intention to serve the true God, but not according to knowledge, thinking that one kind of earth was holier then another, and that a just man might offer sacrifice to God in any other place, as well as in Jerusalem, and praying for pardon of that which could not be done, without wounding his own conscience, and offending others.]
\p
\v 19 . And he said unto him, Go in peace: [The Prophet without answering hereby to his request, or consenting to it, wisheth him onely the blessing of the LORD. The 18. verse may be thus also sitly translated, according to the Hebrew text; The Lord pardon thy servant in this thing, when my Lord went into the house of Rimmon to bow down himself there, and he loaned on mine hand, and I bowed down my self in the house of Rimmon; when I (thus) bowed down my self in the house of Rimmon, the LORD now pardon thy servant in this thing: speaking thus not of that which was to come, or to be done, but of that which was already done and past, of which he desireth pardon: see alike answer, 1 Sam.1.17.] and he departed from him a little space of ground. [see Gen.35.on v.16.]
\p
\v 20 . Now Gehazi the lad of Elisa the man of God said, [To wit, with himself, as above v.11. and Gen.20.on ver.11.] Behold; my Lord hath hindred Naaman that Syrian, that what he had brought, hath not been received at his hand: but (as true as) the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and will take somewhat of him.
\p
\v 21 . So Gehazi followed after Naaman: and when Naamman saw that he ran after him, he fell down from the charet, [That is, he step down with all sped from it. Compare Gen.24 64. Item, Jos.15.18. and Judg.1.14.] to meet him; and he said, is it well? [Heb. is it peace? see above chap.4. on vers.26. and so in the sequel.]
\p
\v 22 . And he said, It is well? my Lord sent me, to say (to thee), Behold even now (there) be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the Prophets; give then, I pray, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.
\p
\v 23 . And Naaman said, If it please thee, take two talents; and he was importunate with him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and he laid them on two of his lads, that carried them before his face.
\p
\v 24 . Now when he came upon the high place, [An high place, or hill, lying not far from Samaria, where Elisa now dwelt] he took them from their hand, and bestowed them [or, laid them away, or, gave them to be kept] in an house, and let the men go, and they departed.
\p
\v 25 . Then he came in, and stood before his Lord: and Elisa said unto him; From whence (comest thou), Gehazi? and he said, Thy servant went neither hither, nor thither.
\p
\v 26 . But he said unto him; Went not mine heart with (thee), when that man turned him about from his charet to meet thee? [As if he should say, Hath not the Lord acquainted me in the spirit, and shewed me in a vision, whither thou wentest, what thou hast spoken, and done, and received, as if I my had been there present in person, and had seen all with mine own eyes?] was it (a) time to receive that silver, and receive agarments, and olive-trees, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and (men-) servants, and maid-servants? [i.e. with which silver, or money, thou didst intend to buy these things.]
\p
\v 27 . Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed forever: [That is, the leprosy that Naaman had, shall come upon thee, and upon thy children, for an example of the just judgement of God for covetousness, simony, and lying] then he went out from before his face, a leper, (white) as the snow. [i.e. in leprosy as white as snow. See Numb.12.on v.10. 2 Chron.26.19,20.]
\c 6
\s Elisa maketh iron to swine, ver.1,&c. He discovereth the secret Plots of the King of Syria, 8. who seeketh to apprehend him Dothan, 11. but is preserved by the Angels, 17. The Syrians are smitten with blindness, brought into Samaria, and from thence sent away in peace, 18. Samaria is besieged, and brought to such extreme want and famine, that two women eat the child of one of them, 19. The King searcheth for Elisa to put him death, 31.
\p
\v 1 And the children of the Prophets said unto Elisa; Behold now, the place where we dwell before thy face, [Or, sit, &c. to wit, as Disciples and Scholars, to be instructed by thee, as our Master: see above chap.2.on v.3. & chap.4.on v.38. and here in the following verse] is too strait for us.
\p
\v 2 . Let us, we pray, go to the Jordan, and fetch [Hebr. Take; that is, take and bring; which is fetching: see Gen 12.on ver.15.] thence every man a piece of timber, [to wit, to make beams, or somewhat else of it] to make us a place there, where we may dwell: and he said, Go your ways.
\p
\v 3 . And there (was) one (that) said; Let it please thee, I pray, to go with thy servants: and he said, I will go.
\p
\v 4 . So he went with them: now when they were come to the Jordan, they cut down wood.
\p
\v 5 . And it came to pass, as one felled the timber, that the iron fell into the water: [Understand the ax which was made of iron; or the iron of the ax, which fell from the helve of it into the water] and he cried, and said; Ah, my Lord! for it was borrowed.
\p
\v 6 . And the man of God said; Where did it fall? and when he [To wit, his Disciple out of whose hand that iron fell] had shewed him the place, he [to wit, Elisa] cut down a stick, and cast it in thither, and made the iron to swim above. [others, then the iron did swim.]
\p
\v 7 . And he said; Take it up to thee: then he put forth his hand, and took it.
\p
\v 8 . And the King of Syria made war against Israel, and took counsel with servants saying; My camping shall be in the place of such a one. [Here be two words, Peloni, Almoni, which the Hebrew use, when they denote or describe some certain person, or any mans place, whom they do not name, or are not minded to express his name: and are wont to be declared and set forth by us by letters or characters in like case: see Ruth 4.on v.1. 1 Sam.21.2.]
\p
\v 9 . But the man of God sent to the King of Israel, saying; Beware, that thou pass not by that place; for the Syrians are come down thither. [Or, lie lurking there, or, come down to lie wait, and to watch the people that should come forth.]
\p
\v 10 . Therefore the King of Israel sent to that place, that the man of God had told and warned him of; [To wit, to know if it were so, as the Prophet had forewarned him, and finding it so, might stand upon his guard, and be the better provided] and look to himself there [i.e. he stood there upon his guard to turn away what ever might hurt or endanger him] not once, nor twice. [i.e. frequently, often, and sundry times.]
\p
\v 11 . Then the heart of the King of Syria was boisterous [The Hebrew word signifieth properly the tempestuousness of the sea, when it is troubled with winds and tempests. To this is here compared the vexation and distemper that was in the King of Syria’s heart] at this; and he called his servants, and said unto them; Will ye not then tell me, who of ours is for the King of Israel?
\p
\v 12 . And one of his servants said; Nay, my Lord, (O) King; [The meaning is, that it was not so as the King suspected] but Elisa the Prophet that is in Israel, acquainteth the King of Israel with the words that thou speakest in thy innermost bed-chamber.
\p
\v 13 . And he said, Go thy ways, and see where he is, that I may send, and cause him to be fetch: and it was told him, saying; Behold, he is at Dothan. [A city lying in the tribe of Manasseh, not far from Sichem and Samaria: see Gen.37.on v.17.]
\p
\v 14 . Then he sent thither horses and charets, and a heavy host, [i.e. Many in number, and great in power. Compare 1 King.3.9. & 10.2. and see Gen.50. on v.9.] which came by night, and compassed the city about.
\p
\v 15 . And the servant of the man of God rose very early, [Heb. Gat him up betimes to rise] and went out, and behold, an host compassed the city with horse and charets: then his lad said unto him; Ah, my Lord, how shall we do?
\p
\v 16 . And he said; Fear not; for those that be with us, are more then those that be with them.
\p
\v 17 . And Elisa prayed, and said; LORD, open his eyes, I pray, that he may see: [That is, given him to behold with his bodily eyes the outward forms or shapes, in which thy heavenly hosts do appear, that he may with spiritual eyes apprend thy great power, and the present aid which thou hast prepared for us] and the LORD opened the eyes of the lad, that he saw; and behold, the mountain was full of fiery horses and charets round about Elisa. [Heb. horses and charet of fire, etc. Understand hereby a great multitude of Angels, sent from God to defend and protect the Prophet. Compare above chap.2.11.]
\p
\v 18 . Now when they [To wit, the Syrians] came down to him, Elisa prayed unto the LORD, and said; Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness; [Understand not such blindness, whereby they saw not at all, but whereby they would not rightly discern, or know that which they saw. Compare Gen.19.11. and see the annotate.] and he smote them with blindness, according to the word of Elisa.
\p
\v 19 . Then said Elisa unto them; This is not the way, neither is this the city; [Understand this in respect of the event of things: For by this way, and in this city of Dothan they found not the Prophet, but by the way, in which he led them, and in the city of Samaria, when he had brought them into it, and they were cured of their blindness] follow me, and I will lead you to the man, whom ye seek: and he led them to Samaria.
\p
\v 20 . And it came to pass, when they were come to Samaria, that Elisa said; LORD, open these (mens) eyes, that they may see; and the LORD opened their eyes, that they saw, and behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.
\p
\v 21 . And the King of Israel said unto Elisa, when he saw them; My Father [Compare above chap.2.on v.12.] shall I smite them? shall I smite them?
\p
\v 22 . But he said; Thou shalt not smite them; shouldest thou also slay them, whom thou hadst taken captive with is not meet to slay all that are taken captive in war, that it much less became King Joram to slay these, whom he had not taken captive in war] set bread and water [i.e. meat and drink. Compare Ezek.10.6. before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their Lord.
\p
\v 23 . And he prepared a great Feast for them, (so) that they did eat and drink, after that he let them go, and they went to their Lord: so the hands of the Syrians came no more into the land of Israel. [The meaning is, that the Syrians that time invaded no more the land of Israel with bands of robbing and plundering souldiers, but indeed made open war against them: as appeareth by the following verse.]
\p
\v 24 . And it came to pass afterwards, That Benhadad the King of Syria gathered all his army, and marched up, and besiege Samaria.
\p
\v 25 . And there was a great famine in Samaria, for behold, they besieged them until an asses head was (sold) for fourscore silverings, [That is, twenty Rycx-dollers: see gen.20.on ver.16.] and a fourth part of a Kab [a measure of corn, containing the quantity of twenty four hen-egg-shells: the fourth part of which measure in moist Wares, was called a LOG: of which measure, see Lev.14.on ver.10.] of Doves dung [some understand hereby the grains, which the Doves or Pigeons had gathered in their crop out of the field: Others, the bowels of them: some also simple or bare Doves-dung, which the Samaritans in this siege it may be used in stead of wood, to make fires therewith: having much provision thereof in the city, otherwise to dung the land, and the gardens therewith, peradventure they did also eat it. Josephus thinketh that this dung was to the besieged in stead of salt. In the 9 book of the Jewish Antiquities, chap.2.] for five silverlings.
\p
\v 26 . And it came to pass, when the King passed by upon the wall, that a woman cried too him, saying; Help me (my) Lord (O) King.
\p
\v 27 . And he said; The LORD helpeth thee not; whence should I help thee? [i.e. seeing the LORD, who alone is able to help all men, doth not help thee, I know not how, or wherewith I should be able to help thee. Oth. the LORD help thee not, as words of a wicked and angry man. Compare v.31. It may be also thus translated, not: the Lord help thee: that is, speak not so, etc.] out of the threshing-floor, or out the wine-press? [i.e. by delivering the corn out of the threshing-floor, or furnishing thee with win and oil out of the press.]
\p
\v 28 . Moreover the King said unto her; what ailest thou? and she said; this woman said unto me, give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and tomorrow we will eat my son.
\p
\v 29 . So we boiled my son, and did eat him: but when I said to her on the next day; give thy son, that we may eat him, then she hid her son.
\p
\v 30 . And it came to pass, when the King had heard the words of this woman, that he rent his clothes, [As it were in token of grief, conceived by the womans relation, but the true and right cause was his better and vehement wrath, wherewith his mind was kindled against the Prophet Elisa. See the sequel] as he passed by upon the wall: and the people saw that, behold, (there) was a sack within upon his flesh. [the meaning is, that the people perceived, when the King had rent his upper garment, that he had a sack or rough garment upon his bare body, and that (it may be) to do penance, and so to reconcile himself unto God, continuing still an hypocrite, and without true repentance. Compare 1 Kings 21.27. Isa.58.5.]
\p
\v 31 . And he said: Let God do so to me, and let him so add thereto, [See of this manner of swearing, 1 King.19 2.] if the head of Elisa the son of Sephat shall remain standing on him this day! [he was incensed against Elisa, because he turned not the Enemy away from the city, as he had done formerly, ab.v.18. or because he did not take away the famine, according to the example of Elisa, 1 Kings 17.1. and 18.42. It seemeth also below by .v.33. that the Prophet had promised him the aid and assistance of God, which because it was not as yet come, he thought perhaps, himself to be deceived by him.]
\p
\v 32 . (Now Elisa sat in his house, and the Eldest [Its conceived, that these were either some of the chief of the people, that were come to Elisa, to find comfort by him; or some Prophets, or sons of the Prophets, or some godly persons among the people, that were the leader and examples, or partakers of believers yet remaining in Israel. They are called the Eldest, not because they were all old in years, but all old in gifts of understanding, and worthiness of the work wherein they were employed, and in honestly of life, although it may be some were but young in years] sat with him) [in this sad and distressed time being busy with teaching, admonishing, comforting, and praying Gods people, and the common weal] and he sent a man from before his face; [who this man was, see below chap.7.v.2.] but before the messenger was come to him, he had said to the Eldest; have ye seen, [to wit, in a prophetical vision, which the Lord now shewed me. Of the like vision see above chap.5.26.] how that murderers [viz. Achabs, by whose means and consent Naboth and the Prophets of the LORD were murdered, 1 Kings 18.4. and 21.9.] son hath sent to take off mine head? look, when the messenger cometh; shut the door close, and thrust him out him with the door. [i.e. keep him, namely, the messenger, by force out of the house, that he may not come in, and hinder me from speaking the word which the Lord hath commanded me to speak] is not the sound of his Lords feet behind him? [i.e. doth not King Joram that sent him follow him close at heels? As if he should say, surely he doth. See Gen.13.on v.9. See the like phrase 1 Kin.14.6.]
\p
\v 33 . While he yet speak with them, [To wit, with the Eldest] behold, the messenger came down to him, and he said, [to wit, the messenger spake it, in the name, and by command from the King. Others conceive that the king himself spake it, being come to the Prophets house before the messenger gat thither, because he made hast to prevent the messenger, and to hinder the Prophets death, which he after repented of] behold, that evil [meaning the murder of the child, occasioned by the famine] is of the LORD; what should I want on the LORD (any) longer? [words of a wicked and an unbelieving man, who disdainfully rejecteth the promises of divine help, foretold by the Prophet Elisa.]
\c 7
\s Elisa foretelleth what should be in Samaria, and likewise the death of a great Chieftain; that would not believe this Prophesy, v.1, &c. Four Lepers visit the camp of the Syrians, where they find no man, 3. The Syrians being hasted away by God, 6. the lepers report this in the city, 8. The truth whereof is enquired after, 12. The matter appearing to be so, Elia’s Prophecy is fulfilled, 16.
\p
\v 1 Then Elisa said; [To wit, to the Eldest, that were assembled with him; to the messenger that was sent by the King; and to the King himself, who immediately followed after his messenger. See the two last verses of the former chapter, and below v.17.18.] hear the word of the LORD: thus saith the LORD, tomorrow about this time shall a measure [called with the Hebrews Seah. See of this measure Gen.18.on v.6.] of meal-flower he (sold) for a shekel, [the common shekel of silver, whereof mention is made here, was full out, or a little more than a fourth part of a Rycks Doller. See Gen.23.on v.16.] and two measures of barley for one shekel, in the gate at Samaria.
\p
\v 2 . But a Captain, whose hand the King leaned, [According to the custom of Kings and great Princes. See above chap.5.18. This man is thought to have been that man that was sent out by the King, to take off the Prophets head, above chap.6.v.32.] answered the man of God, and said; behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, [viz. to pour out thorough the same meal and corn in great abundance, as rain is poured down from heaven. See of the Hebrew word, Gen.7. on ver.11.] (could) that thing come to pass. [thus he strongly denyeth that is was possible. See Gen.18.on vers.17.] And he said; behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but not eat thereof.
\p
\v 3 . Now there were four leprous men before the door of the gate: [The lepers might not dwelling in the camp, nor in the cities, but without those places, being separated from the society and company of men, Lev.13.46. Now these had approached to the very gate of the city, being fled, because of the camp of the Syrians that lay before it] those said the one to the other; why tarry we here, until we die?
\p
\v 4 . If we say, let us enter into the city, [i.e. Think, or determine with our selves, to enter into the city. See Gen.20.on v.11.] then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; and if we tarry here, we shall also die: now then come and fall into the camp of the Syrians; if they let us live, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.
\p
\v 5 . And they rose up in the twilight, [The Hebrew word signifieth the morning or evening-time, when it is between light and dark. There it’s taken for the evening twilight, as appeareth by v.9. just when the Syrians fled away, v.7.9. For the morning twilight it is taken, Psa.119.v.147. See also 1 Sam.30.on v.17.] to enter into the camp of the Syrians: Now when he came to the uttermost (part) of the camp of the Syrians, [understand the foremost end of the camp, that lay nearest to the place where the lepers came. So below v.8.] behold, then no man was there.
\p
\v 6 . For the LORD had caused the host of the Syrians to hear a sound of charets, and a sound of horses, the sound of a great army, [which was either in their ears only, or also in the air, made by God by the ministry of his Angels] so that they said the one to the other, [Heb. the man to his brother] Behold, the King of Israel hath hired against us the Kings of the Hithites, [by these are understood, not the Hethites descended from Heth, Gen.10.15. who were long before time destroyed, but (as some conceive) the Kings of the Islands, Cyprus, Crete, etc.] and the Kings of the Egyptians, to come against us.
\p
\v 7 . Therefore they had got them up, and were fled (away) in the twilight, [To wit, just before the lepers were come to the camp. See above on.v.5.] and had left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, the camp as it was: [viz. when they were in it before the slight, which came upon them so unawares, and with such terror, that looking after nothing at all, they left all behind, as it was, barely to save their lives. Compare herewith below v.10.] and were fled for their life. [Heb. soul. See Gen.19.on v.17.]
\p
\v 8 . Now when these lepers came to the uttermost (part) of the camp, then they went into one tent, and did eat, and drink, and took thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went away and hid it: Then they returned and went into another tent, took from thence also, and went away and hid it.
\p
\v 9 . Then they said the one to the other, [Heb. the the man to his neighbour, or companion. Compare above the anotat. on v.6.] We do not well: This day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: If we tarry till the morning light, then iniquity will find us: [i.e. the punishment of sin will light upon us. For sin is said to find us, not only when we are found and overtaken in it, but are also punished for it. See Num.32.23. and the annotate. thereon] therefore bow come, let us go, and report (this) to the Kings house.
\p
\v 10 . So they came, and called unto the Porter [Oth.unto the Porters] of the city, and told them, saying; we came to the camp of the Syrians, and behold, (there) was no man there, nor any mans voice; but horses tied, and asses tied, and tents according as they were.
\p
\v 11 . And he [To wit, the city Porter, that had the watch] called the Porters: [to wit, his fellows, or companions, that kept guard with him at the gate; or the Porters of the Kings house. Oth. the Porters cryed] and they made the report within to the Kings house.
\p
\v 12 . And the King arose in the night, and said unto his servants; [i.e. Counsellors, and chiefest Officers. See Gen.20.on v.8.] I will tell you now what the Syrians have done to us: They know that we be hungry, therefore they are gone out of the camp, to hide themselves in the field, saying; when they shall be come out of the city, then we shall catch them alive, and we shall come into the city.
\p
\v 13 . Then one of his servants answered, and said; let them take five of the remaining horses, that are left here within, [i.e. in this city] (behold, they are as all the multitude of the Israelites, that are left here within, behold, they are as all the multitude of the Israelites, that are perished) [intimating, that these horses were no more to be esteemed then the besiege Israelites, who needs must die as well as the rest that were already dead, if no relief came] let us send them, and see.
\p
\v 14 . They took then two charet-horses: And the King sent after the camp of the Syrians, saying; go your ways, and see. [Heb. two charets of horses, etc. i.e. two horses of charets: Understand which are wont to be fastned to the charet. Oth. two horsemen on horseback: to wit, whom the King had commanded to view the camp of the Syrians, and to enquire how the case stood with them.]
\p
\v 15 . And they followed them to the Jordan, and behold all the way was full of garments and furniture, [Or, vessels] which the Syrians had thrown away in their hastening: [the Hebrew word signifieth properly such an hastening as is accompanied with fear of eminent danger Compare 2 Sam.4.4. Psa.48.6.] Now the messengers returned, and reported it to the King.
\p
\v 16 . Then the people went forth, and spoiled the camp of the Syrians: and a measure of meal flower was (sold) for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.
\p
\v 17 . Now the King had set the Captain, on whose hand he leaned, [See above on v.2.] over that gate, [thorough which they passed to the camp of the Syrians] and the people [to wit which in great multitude and hast sought to be out of the city, very greedy after food and prey, that were to be had in great abundance both in the camp and out of it; and partly came in, loaden with meat, drink, garments, arms, etc. and bringing many beasts and cattle along with them] trod upon him in the gate, that he died: as the man of God had spoken, who spake it, when the King was come down unto him.
\p
\v 18 . For it came to pass, as the man of God had spoken unto the King, saying; tomorrow about this time shall two measures of barley be (sold) for one shekel, and one measure of meal flower for one shekel in the gate of Samaria. [See above on v.1.]
\p
\v 19 . And that Captain had answered the man of God, and said; behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, [See above on v.2.] were it (possible) to be done according to this word? [or could also such a thing be done] And he [namely, the Prophet Elisa] had said; behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but not eat of it.
\p
\v 20 . Even so it happened to him: for the people trod upon him in the gate, that he died.
\c 8
\s The Shunamite by Elisa’s advice having left the land because of the famine, returneth home, v.1.&c. and hather whole estate restored to her by the Kings command, 4. Elisa foretelleth the death of Benhadad, 7. and Hazaels reign over Syria, 12. Joram becometh King after Josaphat.16. He forsaketh the LORD, 18. wherefore the Edomites revolt from him, and likewise those of Libna, 20. He dieth, and Ahazia becometh King in his stead, 24. He entertaineth friendship with Joram King of Israel, 28.
\p
\v 1 Now Elisa had spoken unto that woman, whose son he had restored to life, [See above chap.4.34.] saying; get thee up, and go thy ways, thou and thy household, [Heb. house. See Gen 8.v.1.] and sojourn, where so ever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a famine, which shall also come upon the land seven years. [i.e. he hath in his justice sent a famine upon the land; as his minister and executioner, to execute his judgement. See likewise Psa.105.v.10. Thus God is also said to call for other judgements, as if they were living and reasonable creatures, apt to understand, and wishing to obey, Jer.25.29. Hag.1.11.]
\p
\v 2 . And the woman had gat her up, and had done according to the word of the man of God: for she was gone with her household, and had sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
\p
\v 3 . And it came to pass at the seven years end, that the woman returned out of the Philistines; and she went forth, to cry unto the King for her house, and for her field. [That is, she did earnestly, and with importunity beg, to have house and land, which some possessed in her absence, restored to her. Compare the following 6.verse.]
\p
\v 4 . Now the King talked with Gehasi, the lad of the man of God, [It seemeth that this happened before the History Naaman the Syrian, and the leprosy of Gehasi, whereof see above chap.5. because none might easily talk or discourse with Lepers, who by the Law of God were separated from the society of men, Lev.13.46. Others conceive that this Law onely forbade co-habitation, and not conference, which the Israelites as well permitted, above chap.7.10. as the Heathen, above chap.5. vers.4.5.] saying; Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisa hath done. [i.e. the miracles and wonders done by him, which this idolatrous King was desirous to hear of, not out of true faith, but out of vain curiosity.]
\p
\v 5 . And it came to pass, when he told the King how he had restored a dead (body) to life, behold, the woman whose son he had restoreth to life, cried then to the King, for her house, and for her field: Then said Gehazi; My Lord, (O) King, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisa restoreth to life.
\p
\v 6 . And the King examined the woman, [To wit, whether her son was raised from death to life by Elisa] and she related it to him: then the King appointed to her one of the chamber, [See Gen.37.on ver.36.] saying; cause (her) to have again all that was hers, besides, all revenues of the field, from the day that she left the land, until now.
\p
\v 7 . After that Elisa came to Damascus, [See Gen.14.on ver.15.] when Benhadad the King of Syria was sick, and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.
\p
\v 8 . Then said the King unto Hazael; Take a Present in thine hand, [i.e. With thee: see above chap.5.on ver.5. So in the following verse] and go meet the man of God: [see 1 Kings 14.on ver.3.] and enquire of the LORD by him, saying; shall I recover [Heb. live. So Numb.21.8. & Jos.5.8. and below ver.9,10,14. Joh.4.50.] of this disease.
\p
\v 9 . So Hazael went to meet him, and took a Present in his hand, to wit, (of) all (or every) [i.e. All manner of] good (thing) of Damascus, fourty camels burden; and he came, and stood before his face, and said; Thy son Benhadad [i.e. that honoureth thee as his Father. Thus King Joram called this Prophet his Father, above chap.6.21.] King of Syria hath sent me unto thee, to say; shall I recover of this disease?
\p
\v 10 . And Elisa said unto him; Go, say, thou shalt not recover at all; [Heb. Thou shalt living not live. Oth. thus: tell him thou shalt living live: understanding this to be spoken ironically. Compare 1 King.22.15. The words are likewise translated thus: Thou mayest certainly recover. And the meaning then is, that Benhadads sickness in its own nature was not indeed unto death, so that he might recover and get up from it, but not with standing that he should die some other way, before the sickness should have an end: see below v.15.] for the LORD hath shewed me, that he shall die the death. [Heb. dying die.]
\p
\v 11 . And he [To wit, the Prophet] held his countenance standing, and set it fast, till very shame: [see this phrase also Judg.3.25. and above chap.2.17. otherw. along while, or, until weariness] and the man of God wept. [because of the evil which by revelation from God he foresaw would befall the children of Israel by Hazaels means. Compare Jer.14.17. and Luke 19.41. The meaning of the words of this verse is, that the Prophet Elisa having cast his eyes on Hazael, held them so long six upon him, till he was ashamed to look any longer upon him, or, till Hazael was ashamed to be look upon any longer. Others understand this thus; that the Prophet held his countenance fixed, not upon Hazael, but upon somewhat else, being in contemplation of the cruelty that Hazael should act against Israel, until tears trickled down from his eyes threat, although he strove to refrain himself as much as possibly he could. According to the other translation, some take it to be meant of Hazael, as if he should have had his countenance stedfastly fixed upon the Prophet, admiring why he should seem to enjoin him to report unto his Lord Benhadad, things that were repugnant and contradictory.]
\p
\v 12 . Then said Hazael; Why weepeth my Lord? and he said; Because I know what evil thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: thou wilt set their strong holds on fire, and slay their young men with the sword, and dash their young children in pieces, and rip up their women with child.
\p
\v 13 . And Hazael said; But what is thy servant, that is a dog, [i.e. Most unworthy despised, and impotent Compare 1.Sam.24.15. 2 Sam.3.8. & 9.8. Job 30.1. Oth. What is thy servant? a dog? i.e. So cruel, fierce.murderous, and merciless, as a dog. Thus wicked and blood-thirty men are resembled to dogs, Psal.22.17,21. & 59.7.] that he should do this great thing? and Elisa said; The LORD hath shewed me, that thou shall be King over Syria.
\p
\v 14 . So he departed from Elisa, and came to his Lord, [The King of Syria] who said unto him; What said Elisa unto thee? and he said; He said unto me, Thou shalt surely recover. [Heb. being living thou shalt live: that is, surely recover. He relateth the clean contrary to what Elisa had told him, according to the translation of v.10.]
\p
\v 15 . And it came to pass on the next day, that he took a blanket, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his [Namely, King Benhadads] face, that he died: [Hazael did this of set purpose to kill him] and Hazael became King in his stead.
\p
\v 16 . Now in the fifth year of Joram, the son of Achab, King of Israel, [Which was the 22. year of Josaphats reign. Compare above chap.3.1.] when Josaphat was King of Juda, [for being yet alive, and holding still a right and interest in the Kingly Throne, he had made his son his Deputy, and reigned jointly with him some certain years. Compare herewith the annotate. 1 King.22. 42. and above chap.1.17.] Jehoram the son of Josaphat, King of Juda, (began) to reign.
\p
\v 17 . He was two and thirty years old when he became King: and he reigned 8.years at Jerusalem.
\p
\v 18 . And he walked in the way of the Kings of Israel, according as the house of Achab did: for the daughter of Achab [Called Athalia, below v.26. where she is said to be the daughter of Omri, because he was Achabs Father, and consequently her Grandfather] became his wife, and he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD. [see 1 King.11.on v.6.]
\p
\v 19 . Yet the LORD would not destroy Juda, for David his servant sake: [See 1 King.11.on v.12.] according as he had said unto him; [see 2 Sam.7.13. 1 King.11. 36. and 15.4. Psal.132.17.] that he would give to him at all times [Heb. all days. See 1 King.11.on ver.36.] a lamp for his sons. [see 1 Kings 11.on verse 36.]
\p
\v 20 . In his days the Edomites revolted from under the Dominion [Heb. hand: i.e. Power and Dominion. So below v.22. See Gen.16.on v.6.] of Juda, [thus was Isaacs prophecy fulfilled, Gen.27.40.] and made a King over themselves. [For since Davids time there had been no king among them, but onely a Kings Deputy, appointed by the King of Juda. See 1 King.22.48. and the annotate. thereon.]
\p
\v 21 . Therefore Joram went over to Zair, [Hebr. Tsair: the name of a city, or place, lying in Idumea] and all the charets with him, and he gat him up by night, and smote the Edomites that were round about him; moreover the Captains of the charets, and the people fled into their tents.
\p
\v 22 . Not with standing the Edomites revolted from under the Dominion of Juda, unto this day: [i.e. Which revolt lasteth unto this day, in which this Book was written] then Liban [a city lying in the tribe of Juda, Jos.15.42. and given to the Priest to inhabit, Jos.21.13.] revolted at the same time. [the cause of this cities revolted was, because Joram had forsaken the Lord, the God of his Fathers, 2 Chron.21.10. By this revolt Joram was hindered from prosecuting his Victory against the Edomites, whereby they continued still in their revolt.]
\p
\v 23 . Now the rest of the acts of Joram and all that he did, is not that written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Juda? [See 1 King.14.on v.29.]
\p
\v 24 . And Joram fell a sleep with his Fathers, [See Deut.21.on v.16. and 1 King.1.on v.21.] and was buried by his fathers in the city of David; [but not in the Sepulchres of the Kings, but in a private Sepulchre, severed from the rest, and without the usual solemnity: see 2 Chron.21.19,20.] and Ahazia his son became King in his stead.
\p
\v 25 . In the twelfth year of Joram, the son of Achab, King of Israel, Ahazia the son of Joram King of Juda (began) to reign. [Heb. reigned.]
\p
\v 26 . Ahazia was two and twenty years old, [Heb. A son of two and twenty years] when he became King, and reigned one year at Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Athalia, the daughter of Omri, King of Israel. [understand his sons daughter: for this Athalia was the daughter of Achab, above v.18. and Achab was the son Omri, 1 King.16.28,29.]
\p
\v 27 . And he walked in the way of the house of Achab, [See 1 King.15.on v.26.] and did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, [see 1 King.11.on v.6.] as (did) the house of Achab: for he was a son in law of the house of Achab. [to wit, by marriage of Athalia the daughter of Achab, with Joram the son of Josaphat King of Juda.]
\p
\v 28 . And he went with Joram, the son of Achab, to battle, at Ramoth in Gilead, against Hazael the King of Syria: and the Syrians smote [i.e. wounded, or hurt] Joram.
\p
\v 29 . Then King Joram went back to cause himself to be healed of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Rama, when he fought against Hazael King of Syria: and Ahazia the son of Jehoram, the King of Juda, came down to see Jeram the son of Achab at Jezreel, for he was sick.
\c 9
\s A Prophet by Elisa’s appointment, anointeh Jehu King over Israel, ver. &c. whom he chargeto destroy the house of Achab,7. Jehu is acknowledge to be King by the Commanders and officers of the army, and likewise proclaimed, 11. He maketh a league against Joram, 14. Marcheth against him to Jezreel, 15. Sbooteth him Thorough, 24. Killeth also Ahazia King of Juda, 27. And causeth Izebel to be thrown out of the window, 30. She is devoured by dogs, 34.
\p
\v 1 Then the Prophet Elisa called of the sons of the Prophets: [See 1 King.2.on v.35.] and he said unto him; Gird (up) thy loins, [see 1 King.18.on v.46. and above chap.4.on v.29.] and take this pot of oil in thine hand, and go to Rammoth in Gilead. [see Duet.4.on ver.43. It appeareth by this relation, that Israelites had recovered this city again from the Syrians: see below v.14. and the annotate.]
\p
\v 2 . When thou shalt be come thither, then see where Jehu the son of Josaphat, [And consequently is to distinguished from one Jehu that was a Prophet, and was the son of Hanani: see 1 King.16.on ver.1.] the son of Nimsi; and go in, and make him rise up from the midst of his brethren [i.e. of his companions, the rest of the Officers and Commanders of the Army: see below vers.5.] and bring him into an inner chamber. [Heb. chamber in chamber.]
\p
\v 3 . And take the pot of oil, and pour it on his head, and say; Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee King over Israel: [see 1 King.1. on v.34.] then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.
\p
\v 4 . So the youth, that youth of the Prophet, [Oth. the youth the Prophet,] went to Ramoth in Gilead.
\p
\v 5 . And when he came in, behold, there sat the Captains of the host, and he said; I have a word to thee Captain: [i.e. I have somewhat to tell thee alone in secret; Therefore may it please thee to rise up, and to hear me in private] and Jehu said: To which of us all? and he said; To thee, O Captain.
\p
\v 6 . Then he [Namely Jehu] arose, and went into the house; [into the inner chamber, as above v.2.] then he [to wit, the Prophets youth] poured the oil on his head: and he said unto him: Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; I have anointed thee King over people of the LORD, over Israel.
\p
\v 7 . And thou shalt smite [i.e. Kill and destroy: see Gen.8.on v.21.] the house [i.e. the family: see 1 King.14.on v.10.] of Achab thy Lord; that I may avenge the blood of my servants the Prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD at the hand of Izebel. [i.e. which was shed by charge and command from Izebel.]
\p
\v 8 . And the whole house of Achab shall perish: and I will cut off from Achab, him that pisseth against the wall, [See 1 King.14.on v.10.] also him that is shut up, and left in Israel. [i.e. I will let none remain: see Deut.32.on v.36.]
\p
\v 9 . For I will make the house of Achab, as the house of Jerobeam, the son of Nebat; [See 1 King.14 10 and 15.29.] and as the house of Baesa, the son of Ahia. [see 1 King.16.3,11.]
\p
\v 10 . Also the dogs shall eat Izebel, on the piece, [Heb.part, or, possession: so below vers.21,25,26,&c.] (of land) [this word is here inserted out of the 25. verse of this Chapter] of Jizreel, [understand the piece or portion of land, or field, which by the false accusations, and cunning plots of Izebel was violently taken away from honest Naboth: see 1 King.21.23. & below v.21,25.] and there shall be none to bury (her) then he opened the door, and fled.
\p
\v 11 . And when Jebu went forth to the servants of his Lord, they said unto him; Is all well? [Heb. is peace? so below ver.17. See Gen.29.on v.6.] wherefore came this mad (fellow) [thus are the Prophets and Ministers of God called by worldings and wicked men, because they are not able to apprehend their doctrine, nor their practice, Job.10.20. Act.26.24. Perhaps they gave this name to the Prophets, because they had some extraordinary gestures, or manner of a action with them, when the Spirit of the Lord came upon them: see 1 Sam.18.10.] to thee? and he said unto them? Ye know the man. and his communication. [that is, ye may perceive that he is a prophet, and because he is such a one, ye may judge what he is wont to speak, to wit, to exhort every one to his duty, as he hath done to me.]
\p
\v 12 . But he said; thus and thus [Heb. according to this, and according to this] spake he to me, saying; thus saith the LORD; I have anointed thee King over Israel.
\p
\v 13 . Then they hasted, and every man took his garment, and put it under him, [In token of subjection unto Jehu, as to their King. Compare Mat.21.7.] upon the highest stair, [Heb. upon the stairs. Understand (according to the common opinion of the learned) an high and exalted place, over-spread with the upper garments of the Captains, which served instead of Tapistry, on which they set Jehu] and blew with the trumpet, and said; Jehu is become King.
\p
\v 14 . So Jehu the son of Josaphat, the son of Nimsi made a conspiracy [See concerning the signification of the Hebrew word, 1 Kings 15.on v.27.] against Joram: (Now Joram had kept [i.e. furnished, fenced, and fortified with souldier with souldiers] Ramoth in Gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael King of Syria.
\p
\v 15 . But King Joram was turned to cause himself to he healed at Jizreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought against Hazael King of Syria) [see hereof above chap.8.v.29.] and Jehu said; if it be your will, [Heb. soul. See Gen.23.on ver.8. That is, if ye think good, if it pleaseth you] let none go forth out of the city that may escape, to go to tell (this) [viz. that I am made King] in Jizreel. [where King Joram was.]
\p
\v 16 . Then Jehu rode, and went to Jizreel; for Joram lay there: [To wit, sick of wounds, which the Syrians had given him. See the former verse] and Ahazia King of Juda was come down to see Joram.
\p
\v 17 . Now the watchman stood at the tower at Jizreel, and saw the company of Jehu as he came on, and said; I see a company: then said Joram; take an horseman, and send (him) to meet them, and let him say, is it peace.
\p
\v 18 . And the horseman went on horseback to meet him, and said; thus saith the King, is it peace? [i.e. Do things go well? Is there no cause of fear or danger? So below v.19.22. see Gen.29.on vers.6.] and Jehu said; what hast thou to do with peace? [Heb. what is it to thee, and the peace: that is, what hast thou to do with peace? So in the following verse. See 2 Sam.16. on v.10.] Turn (thee) behind me: And the watchman told; saying; the messenger came to them, but he cometh not again.
\p
\v 19 . Then he sent another horseman on horseback, and when this (man) was come to them, he said; thus saith the King, is it peace? And Jebu said ; what hast thou to do with peace? turn (thee) behind me.
\p
\v 20 . And the watchman told this, saying; he came even unto them, but he cometh not again: And the driving is as the driving of Jehu, the son of Nimsi, for he driveth furiously. [Heb. in outrageousness, or, with outrageousness: that is, with such swiftness and boisterousness, as if he were mad, and meant to ride the horses to death.]
\p
\v 21 . Then said Joram; make ready; and they made ready his charet: So Joram the King of Israel went forth, and Ahazia the King of Juda, each in his charet; and they went forth to meet Jehu, and found him on the piece (of land) of Naboth the Jizreelite. [See above on v.10.]
\p
\v 22 . Now it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said; is it also peace, Jehu, but he said; what peace, as long as the whoredomes [Understand spiritual, which is idolatry. See lev.17.on vers.7. and 20.on vers.5.] of thy mother Izebel, and her witchcrafts [Understand the deceitful practises, whereby Izebel enticed and seduced men to idolatry. Compare Nahum.3.4.] are so many.
\p
\v 23 . Then Joram turned his hand, [To wit, wherewith he turned himself about in the charets, or pointed to his charet-driver, or also himself caught hold of the reines, to turn the charet about, and to take flight. Compare 1 Kings 22.34.] and fled, and said to Ahazia, it is deceit Ahazia. [i.e. Jehu is come hither in a deceitful and treacherous way, to surprise and murder me.]
\p
\v 24 . But Jehu bent the bow with (a) full hand [Heb.filled his hand with the how. Understand, that he put forth all the strength of hi9s arm, to bend the bow to the full, and to stretch it out to the utmost, to give a mighty shot therewith] and shot [Heb. smote] Joram between his arms, that the arrow went out thorough his heart; and he bowed himself in his charet. [i.e. sunk down in his charet.]
\p
\v 25 . Then said (Jehu) to Bidka his Captain; Take (and) cast him upon that piece of Land of Naboth the Jizreelite: for remember, when I and thou rode one by another after Achab his father, that the LORD laid this burden [That is, this prophetical threatening, or this aforesaid judgement. So is the word burden frequently taken by the Prophets: because judgements are heavy and grievous, as well in hearing, when they are denounced, as in feeling, when they do actually sieze upon a man, Isa.13.1. and 15.1. Jerem.23.33,34. Nah.1.1. Habak.1.1. Zach.9.1.] upon him, [it seemeth that Achab when after the death of Naboth, he went to take possession of his vineyard, had with him certain Courtiers and Officers of the Army, and that amongst them there were Jehu and Bidkar, who had heard the words (mentioned in the following verse) altered by Elia against Achab] (saying;)
\p
\v 26 . If I have not seen yester night the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, [Hence appeareth, that not only Naboth was murthered, but also his children, that Achab might the quieter enjoy Naboths estate] saith the LORD! and (if) I do not recompense thee that on this piece (of land) ! [see above on v.10.] saith the LORD: [These are the words of the LORD uttered with an oath against Achab, and they do import as much as if he should have said: Surely I have seen it, and will surely recompense it unto thee on this plat of ground. See of this kind of oath also ascribed to God, Num.14.on v.23.] Now then take and cast him upon that plat (of ground), according to the word of the LORD.
\p
\v 27 . When Ahazia King of Juda saw (that); then he fled by the way of the garden-house: [Which was planted with trees, so that in fleeing a man could hide himself better then elsewhere, to get safely away] but Jehu pursued after him, and said; smite him also [that is, kill him; for he was also of Achabs family, to wit, by his Mothers side, which was Achabs daughter. See above chap.8.on vers.18.] on the charet, at the going up to the Gur, [This seemeth to have been a place on the way to Samaria, by which Ahazia fled, when Jehu was busy in killing Joram. Now Jehu perceiving that Ahazia was got away from him, sent his souldiers after him. These (as some conceive) came so near to him in this place, that they wounded him there, but not mortally, so that he escaped to Samaria, where he hid himself, 2 Chron.22.9. Until he being there also pursued to be brought to Jehu, was mortally wounded, but escaped to Megiddo, where he died as the following words set forth] which is by Jibleam, [see Jos.17.11.] and he fled to Megiddo, [See 1 Kings 9.on v.15.] and died there.
\p
\v 28 . And his servants carried him to Jerusalem, and they buried him in his sepulchre, by his fathers in the city of David. [See 1 Kings chapter 2. on verse 10.]
\p
\v 29 . Now in the eleventh year [i.e. in the end of the eleventh, and beginning of the twelfth year. See above chap.8.25.] of Joram the son of Achab, did Ahazia become King over Juda.
\p
\v 30 . And Jahu came to Jizreel: When Izebel heard (that) then she painted her face, [Heb. put her eyes in painting: that is, besmeared face with painting] and tired her head, [it seemeth that she boldly dressed and adorned her self, as it were to awe and daunt Jehu by her Majestic and stately countenance] and looked out at the window.
\p
\v 31 . Now when Jehu entered in at the gate, [To wit of the Kings Palace, out of which Izebel looked] she said; is it well, O Zimri the slayer of his LORD? [she calleth Jehu a second Zimri, who had murdered his Lord Ela the King of Israel, 1 Kings 16.9,10. which murder had a fearful and abominable end in Zimri by Omri’s means. With this Izebel now upbraideth Jehu, to affeighten him, but in vain, because he was commanded by God to do that which he did. Oth. did Zimri prosper, that slew his LORD.]
\p
\v 32 . And he lift up his face towards the window, and said; who is with me? Who? [Jehu spake this to those that were with Izebel, asking if any were affected to his cause] Then there looked on him two (or) three of the chamber [that is, Gentlemen, Noble men, Court-officers, that were in Izebels company, as she looked out of the window. The Hebrew word signifieth properly, Eunuchs, or, gelded men: such as were the Chamberlaines of Queens and Princesses for the most part in those times: And such peradventure these were. See Gen.37.on v.36.]
\p
\v 33 . And he [Namely, Jehu] said; Through her down: and they [to wit, the Chamberlaines] threw her down, so that (some) of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses, and he [Namely Jehu] trampled upon her.
\p
\v 34 . Now when he was come in [viz. into the Palace] and had eaten and drunk, he said; look now after that cursed (woman), and bury her, for she is a Kings daughter. [namely, the daughter of the King of the Kings chap.16.1.]
\p
\v 35 . And they went to bury her; but they found nothing of her, save the scull, and the feet, and the palmes of her hands.
\p
\v 36 . Then they returned, and told him; and he said; this is the word LORD, which he spake by the ministery [Heb. hand] of his servant Elia the Tisbite, saying; On the plat (of ground) of Jizreel shall the dogs eat the flesh of Izebel. [see above on v.10. And concerning this prophecy, see 1 Kings 21.23. where, although so many words are no there extant, yet the meaning of this aforesaid accomplishment is to be found.]
\p
\v 37 . And the carcase of Izebel shall be as dung upon the field, [Heb. upon the face of the field] in the plat (of ground) of Jizreel; (so) that they shall not be able to say, this is Izebel.

\s Jehu slayeth seventy of Achabs sons, vers.1.&c. and the kindred of King Ahazia, 12. cometh with Jonadab the Rechabite to Samaria, 15. where he slayeth all the Prophets of Achab, breaketh down his images and Temple, 18. but cleaveth to the sin of Jerobeam, 29. is oppressed by Hazael King of Syria, 32. dieth, Joahaz his son reigneth, 35.
\p
\v 1 Now Achab had seventy sons [Which doubtless were born to him of sundry wives; there being also under them comprehended the children of his son Joram, and of his other sons, of which Achab was the Grandfather. See below vers.3.] at Samaria: And Jehu wrote letters, which he sent to Samaria, to the Rulers of Jizreel, [understand some chief Courtiers, who although they had their ordinary abode and dwelling at Jizreel, yet were sent by Joram to Samaria, to look to the Kings children, while he was busy in war against the Syrians] (to) the eldest, [so called, either because of their office, because they were counsellors, or because of their age, for that they being not sit for war, yet were able to go before the commonalty with advice and counsel, and before the youth with authority and gravity] and to them that brought up Achabs (children), [who as overseers and guardians took care for the education and instruction of these young Lords] saying;
\p
\v 2 . Now when this letter shall come to you, [Thus beginneth also the letter of the King of Syria to the King of Israel, above chap.5.6.] seeing your Lords sons are likewise a fenced city, [namely, at Samaria] and arms.
\p
\v 3 . Look then out the best and justest [Heb. that is good and just: that is, that is fit and meet to govern] of your Lords [viz. Achabs or Jorams] sons, set him on his Fathers Throne: [he meant not this in good earnest, but was minded to try the Rulers of the Samaritans, to know how they stood affected, and with whom they sided. To set any one upon his Fathers throne, is to make him King in his Fathers room. See 1 King.2.on v,24. and compare v.5.] and fight for your Lords house.
\p
\v 4 . But they were very sore [Heb. sore, sore] afraid, and said; behold, two Kings [namely, Joram King of Israel, and Ahazia King of Juda, above chap.9.24,27.] subsisted not before his face; how then should we subsist.
\p
\v 5 . He then that was over the house, and he that was over the city, and the eldest, and the bringers up (of the children) sent to Jebu, saying; We are thy servants, and whatsoever thou shalt say to us, we will do; we will make no man King, do what is good in thine eyes.
\p
\v 6 . Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying; if ye be mine, and ye hearken to my voice, take the heads of the men, your Lords sons, [It is judged by the Hebrew word, that some of these sons or posterity of Achab were come to a reasonable age, who as they were probably followers of Achabs wickedness, so they were partakers of his punishment, according to the righteous threatening of God, Exod.20.5. Deut.5.9.] and come to me tomorrow about this time to Jizreel: (now the Kings sons, seventy men were with the great (men) [i.e. the chiefest in state and dignity. Compare below chap.25.9. and see the annotate.] of the city, which brought them up.) [Heb. made them great.]
\p
\v 7 . It came to pass then, when that letter came to them that they took the Kings sons, and smote [Heb. slew, eat the throats. So v.14.] seventy men: and they put their heads in baskets, which they sent to him to Jizreel.
\p
\v 8 . And there came a messenger, and told him, saying; they have brought the heads of the Kings sons: and he said; Lay then in two heaps, at the door of the gate [which was the place of Judicature: see Gen.22.on v.17.] until the morning.
\p
\v 9 . And it came to pass in the morning, when he went forth, that he stood still, and said to all the people: Ye are righteous; Behold, I made a conspiracy against my LORD, and slew him; [that is, I pronounce you innocent and guiltless touching the death of these sons of Achab; think not that I am come to accuse you for it: but if you will lay the blame upon any man, look upon me, that have made a Covenant against my Lord King me, that have made Covenant against my Lord King Joram, yea have also slain him: but not out of mine own presumption, but according to the Lords determination, and express command. Therefore as ye are guiltless, because ye have followed my command, so am I also, because I have followed Gods command] and who hath smitten all these? [these were smitten by the Eldest of Samaria, at Jehu’s command: both by the Lords direction, as followeth.]
\p
\v 10 . Know now that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the Word of the LORD, [See 1 Kings 8.on ver.56.] which the LORD spake against the house of Achab: [He testifieth here publicly, that though his practice might be ill construed, yet notwithstanding he had done nothing otherwise then according to the Word of the Lord: see above chap.9. ver.7,8.] for the LORD hath done that which he spake by the ministery [Hebr.hand. See Levit.8.on verse 36.] of his servant Elia. [see 1 Kings 21.v.19,21,29.]
\p
\v 11 . Besides Jehu smote all that remained in the house of Achab at Jizreel, and all his Great (men), [Doubtless those that by Achabs means were become great and mighty in state, riches, and name] and his acquaintance, [or, kinsfolks: as Ruth 2.1.] and his Priests: until he left him none remaining.
\p
\v 12 . And he gat him up, and departed, and went to Samaria; and being at Beth-Heked of the shepherds, [i.e. the house of the binding of the shepherds. Some conceive that this was a Village by Samaria lying or by the way, having its name from binding, because the shepherds bound their sheep there, when they were to be shorn] on the way.
\p
\v 13 . Jehu found the brethren of Ahazia, king of Juda, [Understand the sons of his brethren, 2 Chron.22.8. See Gen.13.on ver.8. where the word brethren is so taken] and he said; Who are ye? and they said; We are the brethren of Ahazia, and are come down, to salute the sons of the King, and the sons of the Queen. [namely Jorams, and his wifes children. It seemeth that they knew not that Ahazia was slain by Jehu. Hebr. to the peace of the sons of the King, and of the sons of the Queen. i.e. to with them peace and prosperity, which we call saluting, greeting.]
\p
\v 14 . Then he said; Take them by the Well of Beth-Heked, two and fourty men, neither left he one of them.
\p
\v 15 . And being departed thence, he found Jonadab, the son of Rechab, [A noted man of the Family of the Rechabites, and descending from Jethro, Moses Father in Law, 1 Chron.2.55. Jer.35.6.] (coming) to meet him, who saluted [Heb. blessed. See Gen.31.on v.55.] him; [namely Jehu] and he said unto him; Is thy heart right, according as my heart is with thy heart? [i.e. art thou heartily affected toward me, as I am with all my heart affected toward me, as I am with all my heart affected toward thee] and Jonadab said; It is, yea it is, give (me) thine hand: [this may be taken as the words of Jonadab; or, (as others conceive) as the words of Jehu] and he gave (him) his hand, and he made him come up to him into charet.
\p
\v 16 . And he said: Go with me, and see my zeal [What zeal properly is, see 1 Kings 19.on v.19.] for the LORD: so they [To wit, his Servants, Footmen, or Lackeys] made him ride on his charet.
\p
\v 17 . And when he came to Samaria, until he had destroyed him: [i.e. His Household and Family] according to the Word of the LORD, which he had spoken to Elias. [see 1 Kings 21.21.]
\p
\v 18 . And Jehu assembled all the people, and said unto them; Achab served Baal [See 1 Kings 16.on v.31.] a little: Jehu shall serve him much. [see the annotate.on the following verse.]
\p
\v 19 . Now therefore call unto me all the Prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his Priests, let none be missing, for I have a great sacrifice (to do) to Baal; [He speaketh lyingly and equivocally, (which means are not to be commended) intending to slay, or kill unto Baal, all his Priests, Prophets, and Ministers, and so to perform his great sacrifice] whosoever is wanting, he shall not live: but Jehu did that in subtilty, that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.
\p
\v 20 . Moreover, Jehu said; Hallow a Prohibition-(day) [i.e. A great feast day or festival, on which all servile works were forbidden: see Lev.23.on v.36.] for Baal, and they proclaimed it.
\p
\v 21 . Jehu also sent into all Israel; and all the worshippers of Baal came; (so) that (there) was not a man left that came not: and they came into the house of Baal, [i.e. the Temple of Baal] (so) that the house of Baal was filled, from the one end, to the other end. [Heb. mouth to mouth: so below chap.21.]
\p
\v 22 . Then he said to him, that was over the Vestry; [Or, Wardrobe. Understand a chamber, wherein the garments were lock up and kept, which Baals Priests used in the worship of their Idol. Oth. the garment chest, or, the garments] Bring forth the garments for the worshippers of Baal: [because God had prescribed in the Old Testament a certain kind of garment to be worn by his Priests, (which in the New Testament ceased with the Priesthood) therefore the Devil would imitate the same in his Priests] and he brought forth the apparel for them.
\p
\v 23 . And Jehu came with Jonadab the son of Rechab into the house of Baal: and he said unto the worshippers of Baal; Search, and look, that peradventure there be here none of the servants of the LORD, [These he would not have to be present at this work, under this pretence, that they might not prophane it by their presence, being of another Religion: but in deed and in deed and in truth, that they might not ignorantly be destroyed among the worshippers of Baal onely.
\p
\v 24 . Now when they came in to perform slay-offerings, and burnt-offerings, Jebu appointed him fourscore men without, and said; If any of the men, that I have brought into your hands, escape, his soul [That is, the soul of him, that letteth one escape, and doth not escape, and doth not kill him. The word soul is here taken for life. See Gen.19.on ver.17.] shall be for the soul of him. [i.e. of him that escapeth. The meaning is, that if any one of the men appointed by Jehu should let any one escape, he himself should die for it.]
\p
\v 25 . And it came to pass when he [To wit, the chief Priest of the Baalites: or, when they,
\p &c.] had made an end of doing burnt-offering, that Jehu said unto the Guard, [that is, to those fourscore men, of which is spoken in the former verses] and to the Captains; Go in, smite them, let none come forth; and they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the Footmen, and the Captains cast them away: [meaning the dead bodies of those that were slain, which were thrown away out of the city] then they went to the city, into the house of Baal [this may be understood of the same city, or every city where there was an house of Baal: so in the following verse: see v.28.]
\p
\v 26 . And they brought forth the reared images out the house of Baal, and burnt them.
\p
\v 27 . They brake down also the reared image of Baal: moreover, they brake down the house of Baal, and made that private rooms, [i.e. Privies, Draught-houses, Jakes, houses of office, where men do ease nature: which they did in scorn and contempt of the Idol, and Idolatry, that was performed therein. Compare Isa.36.6. In the same sense Idols are called in Scripture Dung-gods: see Levit.26.30. and the annotate. thereon] unto this day.
\p
\v 28 . Thus Jehu destroy Baal out of Israel.
\p
\v 29 . But Jehu departed not from following the sins of Jerobeam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin: to wit, from the golden Calves, which were at Bethel, and at Dan. [To wit, in each place one: see 1 Kings 12.28.]
\p
\v 30 . Then the LORD said unto Jehu; [To wit, by some one of the Prophets; as he also had received the charge by one them, to execute this divine vengeance, above chap.9.7.] because thou hast done well, doing that which is right in mine eyes, (and) hast done to the house of Achab, according to all that was in mine heart, thy sons shall sit unto the fourth generation upon the throne of Israel. [Heb. sons of the fourth shall sit, &c. The fulfilling hereof, see first in Joahaz, below ver.35. Secondly, in Joas chap.13.10. Thirdly, in Jerobeam, chap.14.23.Fourthly, in Zacharia, chap.15.8.]
\p
\v 31 . But Jehu took not heed to walk in the law of the LORD, the God of Israel, with all his heart: he departed not from the sins of Jerobeam [These sins are expressed above from the sins of Jerobeam [These sins are expressed above v.29.]
\p
\v 32 . In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: [Or, to cut Israel off: that is, to straiten, and to diminish his border: see the following verse. And this happened, according to the Prophecy of Elisa, above chap.8.12.] for Hazael (King of Syria) smote them in all borders of Israel.
\p
\v 33 . From the Jordan, toward the Sun-rising, [Understand, in regard of the situation of the land of Canaan] all the land of Gilead, [see Gen.31.on ver.21.] of the Gadites, and of the Rubenites, and of the Manassites: from Aroer, [a city lying beyond the Jordan in the tribe of God: of which see Numb.32.34. Jos.12.2.] which is by the book of Arnon, [see Numb.21.14. Deut.3.12,13,14,&c. and the annotate. thereon.]
\p
\v 34 . Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might; are not they written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? [see 1 Kings 14.on v.19.]
\p
\v 35 . And Jehu fell a sleep with his Fathers, and they buried him at Samaria, and Joahaz his son became King in his stead.
\p
\v 36 . And the days that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria, are eight and twenty days.
\c 11
\s Athalia slayeth all the Royal Family, ver.1,&c. Excepting Joas, 2. Who being seven years old, by Jojada’s direction, is made King of Juda, 4. Athalia, that usurped the government, is slain, 13. The covenant is renewed between God, the King, and the People, 15. The worship of Baal destroy, 18. And the King set in his Kingly Throne, 19.
\p
\v 1 Now when Athalia [Which was Achabs daughter, the wife of Joram, and mother of Ahazia, (as the following words declare) whom Jehu had slain, above chap.8.18. and 9.27.] the mother of Ahazia [see above chap.9 27.] saw, that her son was dead; then she gat her up, and destroyed all the royal seed. [Heb. all the seed of the Kingdom: that is, all the Princes of the blood, unto whom the succession of the Crown might come. Understand this of Athalia’s intent and purpose, not of the full and perfect act: for one escaped, as the following verse sheweth.]
\p
\v 2 . But Joseba [Heb. Jehoschebah. Oth. Jehoschabbath, 2 Chron.22.11. where its also mentioned that she was the wife of Jojada the High Priest: but its conceived that she was born of another wife of Joram, then of the Idolatrous Athalia] the daughter of King Joram, the sister of Ahazia, took Joas [Hebr. Joas ch. Oth. Jehim out of the midst of the Kings sons, that were slain, (putting) [this word is here inserted out of 2 Chron.22.11.] him, and his nurse in a bed-chamber: [Heb. a chamber of beds: that is, in one ofthe chambers, that were built near the Temple, wherein were beds of the priests, on which they lay, when in their turns they were to wait upon the service of God. See Jer.35.2.] and they [to wit, Jojada, and Joseba] hid him from Athalia [Heb. before the face of Athalia] (so) that he was not slain.
\p
\v 3 . And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years: and Athalia reigned over the land.
\p
\v 4 . Now in the seventh year Jojada [Heb. Jehojadah, the son of Azarias, the son of Achimaaz, the son of Zadok the High Priest, and distinguished from Jojada the Father of Benaja, who lived in Davids time, 2 Sam.8.18.] sent, and took the Rulers of hundreds, [these were five in number, and are named 2 Chron.23.1. They seem to have been Priests, as may be gathered from ver.5,7,9.] with the Captains, and with the Guard, and he brought them to him, into the house of the LORD, and be made a Covenant with them, [to wit, to slay Athalia, to place Joas in the Kingdom, to root out Idolatry, and to restore the pure worship of God] and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and he shewed them the Kings son.
\p
\v 5 . And he commanded them, saying; This is the thing, which ye shall do: a third part of you [Meaning Priests, and Levites, 2 Chron.23.4.] that enter in [to wit, into the Temple. The Priests and the Levites were divided into 24. Orders, 1 Chron.24. according to which division they entered every week by turns into the Temple, to heed the worship of God, according to the appointed order, which is called entring in, to wit, into the Temple, to keep the Watch] on the Sabbath, [oth. in the week] shall keep the watch of the Kings house. [i.e. at the Chamber in the Temple, where the young King was hid.]
\p
\v 6 . And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; [This was the gate towards the East, and was the greatest gate of the Temple, therefore it is also called the high gate, below chap.15.35. also the Foundation gate, 2 Chron.23.5. also the new gate, Jer.26.10. because it was renewed by King Jotham, 2 Chron.27.3.] and a third part at the gate behind the guard: [this gate was in the South, toward the Court of the Priests; which (as some conceive) was otherwise called Sippim, that is, the threshold-gate, 2 Chron.23.4.] so ye shall keep the watch of this house, against breaking in. [or, against pulling, or, taking away; that is, ye shall so keep the Temple, that nothing of it be broken, and that the King be not taken from thence by force, and carried away.]
\p
\v 7 . And the two parts [Heb. hands] of you, all that go forth on the Sabbath, [understand those that went forth out of the Temple homeward, having for that week performed their office in their turn: for on every Sabbath new ones were to succeed in their room] they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD near the King.
\p
\v 8 . And ye shall compass the King round about, every man with his weapons in his hand, and he that entereth in between the ranks, [Or between the files, that are placed in rank and order: that is, cometh into your guard, when ye shall advance, or be about the King to safeguard him] shall be slain: and be ye with the King, when he goeth out; and when he cometh in.
\p
\v 9 . The Rulers of hundreds then did according to all that Jojada the Priest had commanded, and took every man his men, that came in on the Sabbath, with those that went out on the Sabbath: and they came to Jojada the Priest.
\p
\v 10 . And the Priest gave to the commanders of hundreds the spears and the shields, which had been King Davids: [i.e. which David had taken from his Enemies, and perhaps had dedicated them to the Lord in the Tabernacle for a memorial; as he had done the sword of Goliath, 1 Sam.21.2. and the shields of the Syrians, 2 Sam.8.7. which afterward seem to have been brought into the Temple by Salomon, 1 Kings 7.51.] which were in the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 11 . And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the right side [i.e. the south-side] of the house, to the left side [i.e. the north-side] of the house, toward the altar, [to wit, of burnt-offerings; which was by the East-gate of the Temple] and toward the house, [i.e. the Temple, which stood west-ward from the altar] round about the King.
\p
\v 12 . Then he [Namely, Jojada] brought forth the Kings son, and put the crown upon him; and (gave him) the testimony, [which he gave him in his hand, and it was the book of the law, wherein God testifieth how he ought to demean himself in his government. See Deut.17.18.] and they made him King, and anointed him: [those that succeeded their Fathers in the Kingdom according to the usual manner, they (as some conceive) were not anointed, but only those that after some change in the government, or above the ordinary law, or through fear of future trouble were crowned King, as Saul, 1 Sam.10.1. David, 1 Sam.16.13. Salomon, 1 Kings 1.34. Jehu 2 Kings 9.6. Joahaz 2 Kings 23.30. and Joas here, who succeeded his father, after that Athalia had violently and tyrannically usurped the Kingdom] besides, they clap their hands [for a token and manifestation of joy. Thus is the clapping of the hands taken, Psa.98.8. Ezek.25.6. Elsewhere for a token of sorrow, Ezek.6.11.] and said; let the King live.
\p
\v 13 . When Athalia heard the voice of the Guard, (and) of the people, then she came to the people into the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 14 . And she looked, and behold the King stood by the pillar, [Or, scaffold; that is, upon the royal scaffold, which Salomon had made of copper and stood in the peoples court against a pillar. See below chap.23.3. and 2 Chron.6.13.] according to the manner [i.e. according to the manner of proceedings: or as the King was wont to stand by that pillar, to serve God, or to speak unto the people. Compare below chap.23.3.] and the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets; then Athalia rent her cloathes, [in token of spites, grief, and great trouble of spirit. See Gen.37.on v.29.] and she cryed; treason, treason.
\p
\v 15 . but Jojada the Priest commanded the Captains of hundreds, that were set over the host, and said unto them; Bring her forth without the ranks, [See above on v.8.] and him that followeth her, slay him with the sword; for the Priest had said, let her not be slain in the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 16 . And they laid hands on her, [Oth. they appointed a side-guard over her: or they gave, or made room for her, to wit, to go out of the Temple. Hebr. they set hands, or sides, or spaces, or places for her] and she went (by) the way of the entering in of the horses to the kings house; [to wit, by the way of Davids city-gate, which was so called, and stood north ward; from whence they went to Ephraims gate. See below chap.14.v.13. Some think that time gate had the name of the entering in of the horses, because they could conveniently ride on horseback through that way to the Kings house] and she was slain there.
\p
\v 17 . And Jojada made a covenant between the LORD, etc between the King, and between the people, [To wit, First, a spiritual covenant between God and the King with the people, comcerning the erecting and maintaining of the pure and true worship of God. Secondly, as a political or civil covenant, concerning the Kings office toward his people in his government, and the peoples duty toward the King, in civil obedience] that they should be a people unto the LORD: [i.e. that they should know the Lord to be the only true God, and serve him according to his word, renouncing ail idolatry and false worship: Which declaration is satisfied and confirmed by and with their succeeding performance, v.18.] likewise between the King, and between the people.
\p
\v 18 . After that all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and brake that down, his altars and his images they brake in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the Priest before the Altars: Now the Priest appointed [Or, restored] the offices in the house of the LORD. [because the purity of worship was much decayed by the perverseness of the time. See further and more particularly hereof, 2 Chron.23.v.18,19.]
\p
\v 19 . And he took the Rulers of hundreds, and the Captains, and the Guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the King from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the Guard [Called otherwise the high gate, 2 Chron.23.20. See the annotate. there] to the Kings house, and he sat on the throne of the Kings. [see 1 Kings 1.on verse 46.]
\p
\v 20 . And all the people of the Land rejoiced, and the city was quite, after they had slain Athalia with the sword (by) [Oth. in] the King house.
\p
\v 21 . Joas was seven years old when be become King. [Hence may be gathered that Joas was but a year old, when Athalia sought to kill him, and he was hid with his nurse in the Temple, for there he was kept six years, above v.3.]
\c 12
\s Joas reigneth well as long as Jojada liveth, vers.1. &c. He giveth order for repairing of the Temple, 4. He turneth away Hazael from Jerusalem, giving him the treasures of the temple, 17. He is slain by his servants, and Amazia his son reigneth in his stead, 20.
\p
\v 1 In the seventh year of Jehu [King of Israel; of whom see above chap.9 and 10.] Joas [Heb. Jehoasah] became King, and reigned fourty years at Jerusalem: And his mothers name was Zibia [Heb. Tsibia] of Berseba [see of this city gen.21.on v.31.]
\p
\v 2 . And Joas did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, all his days; wherein Jojada the Priest instructed him. [But after the death of Jojada the high Priest, whose good doctrine he forgot, fell to false worship, and was also punished for it. See 2 Chron.24. ver.17,18.]
\p
\v 3 . Only the high places were not taken away: The people still offered, and burnt incense on the high places.
\p
\v 4 . And Joas unto Priests, all the money of the dedicated things, [Heb. holinesses: that is, that are hallowed unto the LORD, and dedicated to his service, and no were to be employed about the building and repairing of the Temple. Of these certain kinds are here mentioned, as the following words do shew] that shall be brought into the house of the LORD, (to wit) the money of him that passeth over (to them that are numbered); [These words are here inserted out of Exod.30.13. Heb. of the passer by, or goer over: to wit, among, or to those that are numbered: that is, who was counted among those that were to be taxed. These now are all those that were twenty years old and upward, who when the numbering was made, were to give every man half a shekel for his head, or person, Exod.30.13. This was the first sort or kind of consecrated things] the money of every one of the persons [Heb. souls. This word is here taken for persons, or men. See Gen. 12.on v.5.] (according to) of his taxing; that is, the money wherewith the Priest taxed a man that had made a vow unto the LORD, that he might redeem and free himself. See the law concerning this, Lev.27.2. This was the second kind of consecrated things] (and) all the money that cometh [Heb. cometh up, or ascendeth] into the house of the LORD; [the third sort or kind of consecrated things was, which any man offered most freely and willingly unto the LORD, without being compelled thereunto by any law, but indeed stirred up by exhortation, 2 Chron.24.v.5,6. Compare Exod.35,5.]
\p
\v 5 . Shall the Priests take to themselves every man of his acquaintance: and they shall repair [Heb. strengthen, fortify: and so in the sequel] the breaches of the house, according to all that shall there (to be a) breach. [understand whatsoever was rent, split, wasted away, or decayed through antiquity of building, or demolished and destroyed by wicked Athalia. See 2 Chron.24.7.]
\p
\v 6 . But it came to pass in the three and twentieth year of King Joas; that the Priests had not repair the breaches of the house.
\p
\v 7 . Then King Joas called Jojada the Priest, and the (other) Priests, and said unto them; why repair ye not the breaches of the house? Now then take no money of your acquaintance, [As ye did before, see v.4.5.] that ye should give it for the breaches of the house. [as ye indeed promised, but did not perform.]
\p
\v 8 . And the Priests consented to take no money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house.
\p
\v 9 . But the Priest Jojada took a chest, [With the consent and at the command of the King, 2 Chron.24.8.] and bored a hole in the lid [Heb. door] of it, and set it by the altar on the right hand when any man came into the house of the LORD; [understand at the post, to beside the door, where they entered into the Court of the Priests, where the altar of burnt offering stood, at the end of the great Court: for so far might all Israel come, as the Levites there kept the watch at the threshold of this door, Num.18.4. Such an offering-chest was also yet in the Temple in Christ time. See Mark 11.41. Luke 21.1.] and the Priests that kept the threshold, [to wit, of the gate of the Priests court, and that according to the Lords prescript, Numb.18.4.] put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 10 . Now it came to pass, when they saw that (there) was much money in the chest, that the Kings Scribe, [i.e. Notary, or Secretary. So below cha.19.9. and 22.3. also 2 Sam.8.17.] came up with the high Priest, and bound oit together, [to wit, in bundles or bags] and told the money that was found in the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 11 . And they delivered the money well weighed into the hands of those that took care of that work, [Heb. Doers of that work. So below chap.22.5. That is, that were appointed as Overseers over this work of the Temple] who were appointed over the house of the LORD: and they laid it out to the Carpenters, [Heb. Artificers, or Workmen of the wood] and to the Builders that repaired the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 12 . And to the Bricklayers, [The Hebrew word signifieth generally those that make stone walls, wooden walls and fences. So below chap.22.6. Isa.58.12. Ezek.22.30. Hence it is taken for Bricklayers] and to the Masons, and to buy wood and hewed stones, [Heb. stones of hewing out, or cutting. That is, that are hewed out of the ground, and after that must be squared and fashioned by hewing, or cutting for certain use] to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD: and for all that was given out for the house, to repair (that). [Heb. that went, etc. i.e. that was disbursed or otherewise laid out, toward the repairing of the Temple.]
\p
\v 13 . Howbeit, (there) were not made for the house of the LORD silver bowels, flesh-books, spink-basons, trumpets, [See of these vessels 1 Kings 7.50.] (nor) any golden vessel, or silver vessel, of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD. [that is, they furthered the building of the Temple so much, that they made not the vessels belonging to the worship of God, until the whole building or fabric was finished: but after that they made also all manner of vessels of the residue or remainder of the money. See 2 Chron.24.14.]
\p
\v 14 . But they gave that to those that did the work: and they repaired therewith the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 15 . Besides, they demanded no account of the men, [Or caused not the men to make any account, or reckoned not with them] into whose hands they delivered that money, to give (it) to those that did the work: for they dealt faithfully. [Heb. in truth, or faithfulness, that is, in good faith. The meaning is; as the money was trusted to their honesty, so did they likewise faithfully bestow it and lay it out.]
\p
\v 16 . The money of trespass-offering, and the money of sin-offerings was not brought into the house of the LORD: it was for the Priests.
\p
\v 17 . Than Hazael King of Syria marched up, [Namely, after that Jojada was dead, and Joas had corrupted his ways, 2 Chron.24. v.22,23.] and warred against Gath, [see 1 Kings 2.on vers.39.] and took it; after that Hazael set his face, [to set ones face towards any thing, is to attempt, or undertake a thing earnestly. See 2 Chron.20.3. Jerem.42.15. Ezek.21.2. Dan.9.3. Luke 9.51.] to marched up against Jerusalem.
\p
\v 18 . But Joas the King of Juda took all the hallowed things, which Josaphat and Ioram, and Ahazia his Fathers, the Kings of Juda had hallowed, and his (own) hallowed things, [Heb. holinesses; as above v.4. See Lev.5.on v.15.] and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and of the Kings house, and sent it to Hazael King of Syria: then he marched away from Jerusalem.
\p
\v 19 . Now the rest of the acts of Joas, and all that he did, is that not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Juda.
\p
\v 20 . And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and smote Joas in the house of Millo, [Oth. Beth-millo. See Judg.9.on v.6.] which goeth down to Silla. [the name of a place. By the propriety of the word some conjecture, that this was a certain raised way which Salomon made, for to go from the city of David into the temple, 2 Chron.9.11. Others conceive that Silla was the name of a city, lying not far from the house of Millo]
\p
\v 21 . For Jozacar [Otherwise called Zabad, 2 Chron.14.6.] the son of Simeath, [the name of an Ammonitish woman, 2 Chron.24.26.] and Jozabad [Heb. Jehozabad] the son of Somer, [oth. called Simrith. This was 2 Moabitish woman, 2 Chron.24.26.] his servants smote him, that he died; and they him with his Fathers in the city of David: [buy not in the Sepulchre of the Kings of Juda, 2 Chron.24.25.] and Amazia his son became King in his stead.
\c 13
\s Joahaz the King of Israel followeth the sin of Jerobeam, vers.1, &c. Is oppressed by Hazael, 3. Helped by his prayer, 4. Dieth, and Joab his son reigneth, who is like unto his Father in Idolatry, 9. He dieth; Elisa is sick, prophecieth against the Syrians, dieth, 14. The Moabites fall into the land, 20. A dead man being cast into the Sepulchre of Elisa, is restored to life, Joas recovereth the cities, which the Syrians had taken from his father, 22.
\p
\v 1 In the three and twentieth year of Joas the son of Ahazia the King of Juda, Joahaz [Heb. Jehoachaz] the son of Jehu, became King over Israel at Samaria, (and reigned) [These words are here inserted, as also below v.10. out of 2 Kings 3.1. and 8.17,26. and 12.1. See also 1 King.15.on v.33.] seventeen years. [Whereof the two last were common to him with his son: see below v.10. and 22.]
\p
\v 2 . And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD: for he walked after the sins of Jerobeam ths son of Nebat, [Understand chiefly the Idolatry instituted by him, which the Israelites by his command and example committed with the golden calves: see 1 Kings 12.26.
\p
\v 3 .Therefore the anger of the LORD kindled against Israel: and he gave them [To wit, the Israelites] into the hand of Hazael King of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, [God so delivered up the Israelites into the power of the Syrians, that they were smitten, and oppressed by them, with the loss of part of their land] all those days. [to wit, of Joahaz King of Israel; namely, as long as he reigned alone: so also below v.22.]
\p
\v 4 . But Joanaz besought earnestly the face of the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto the him; for he saw that oppression of Israel, [This is spoken of God after the manner of men, and signifieth his fatherly care and pity towards those that are oppressed, and with true repentance of heart seek unto him: see Gen.31.on v.42.] that the King of Syria oppressed them.
\p
\v 5 . (So the LORD gave Israel a Deliverer, [Namely Joas the son of Joahaz: see below v.25.] that they came out from under the hand [i.e. command: see Gen.16.on v.6. and Numb.31.on v.49.] of the Syrians; and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, [i.e. in their houses and dwellings. The holy Scripture keepeth this phrase, looking at the practice of the Patriarchs, and of the Israelites in the wilderness, where they dwelt in tents: see Deut.16.on v.7.] as before time. [Heb. as yesterday, and ere yesterday.]
\p
\v 6 . Neverthe less, they departed not from the sins of the house of Jerobeam, that made Israel to sin; (but) he [Namely Joahaz] walked therein: [or, in every one of them: to wit, sins. Compare above v.2.] and (there) remained the grove [understand the idolatrous grove, which Achab had caused to planted, 1 Kings 16.33. Of the idolatrous groves, see Deut.7. on v.5.] also at Samaria.)
\p
\v 7 . For he had left no people to Joaz but fifty horsemen, and ten charets, and ten thousand footmen: For the King of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like dust (by) threshing. [i.e. Had oppressed them by many overthrows, and as it were trodden them under foot, as Ocean in those Countrys by threshing did down the ears of corn with their feet.]
\p
\v 8 . Now the rest of the acts of Joahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
\p
\v 9 . And Joahaz fell a sleep with his fathers, and they buried him at Samaria: and Joaz his son reingned in his stead.
\p
\v 10 . In the seven and thirtieth year of Joas King of Juda, [Which was about the fifteenth year of the reign of Joahaz. Compare above the annotate. on v.1.] Joas the son of Joahaz became King over Israel at Samaria, (and reigned) sixteen years.
\p
\v 11 . And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD: he departed not from all the sins of Jerobeam the son of Nebat, [see above on ver.2.] who made Israel to sin, (but) he walked therein. [or, in every one of them.]
\p
\v 12 . Now the rest of the acts of Joas, and all that he did, and his might, wherewith he fought against Amazia, King of Juda, are not they written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
\p
\v 13 . And Joas fell a sleep with his Fathers, and Jerobeam sat on his Throne: [i.e. Became King: see 1 Kings 1. on v.13.] and Joas was buried at Samaria by the Kings of Israel.
\p
\v 14 . Now Elisa was fallen sick of his sickness, whereof he died: and Joas King of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said; My Father, my father, [Thus he calleth him out of love and reverence] the charet of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. [see above chap.2. the annotate. on v.12.]
\p
\v 15 . And Elisa said unto him; Take a bow and arrows: and he took unto him a bow and arrows.
\p
\v 16 . And he said unto the King of Israel; Lay thine hand on the bow: [Hebr. make thine hand to ride upon the bow. This was a token to King Joas, that he was to undertake war] and he laid his hand (on it): AND Elisa laid his hands upon the Kings hand. [to wit, to signify to the King that God would sight with him; and that to the King that God would sight with him; and that our action must proceed from God, if it should be good; and must be blessed by him, if it should prosper.]
\p
\v 17 . And he said, Open the window toward the East: [Which was toward Samaria] and he opened it: Then said of the LORDS deliverance, and an arrow of deliverance against the Syrians; [i.e. Let this arrows be a token to assure thee, that God will give thee Victory over thine Enemies, and deliver thy people from their power] for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek [see of this city 1 Sam.4.1. and 29.1. and 1 Kings 20.20. Others take this word not for a proper name, but translate it strongly, powerfully, mightyily] until they be consumed.
\p
\v 18 . After that he said; Take the arrows: and he took them: Then he said unto the King of Israel; smite against still: [God did hereby signify unto Joas that he stood still: [God did hereby signify unto Joas that he should not be wanting in performing his duty therein. Now in that he smote the ground but three times, it did intimate some neglect and default, which he should commit in executing this punishment upon the Syrians; so that he also smote them but three times: see below v.25.]
\p
\v 19 . Then the man of God was very angry with him: and said; Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then shouldest thou have smitten the Syrians until thou hadst consumed (them): but now thou shalt smite the Syrians thrice.
\p
\v 20 . After that Elisa died, and they buried him: Now the hands [That is, certain troops, or companies of robbing, and plundering souldiers: see above chap.5. on verse 2.] of the Moabites came into the Land at the coming in of the year.
\p
\v 21 And it came to pass, as they buried a man, that, behold, they spread a hand (of men); so they cast the man into the Sepulchre of Elisa; and when the man came into it, and touched the bones of Elisa, he revived, and stood upon his feet.
\p
\v 22 . Now Hazael King of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Joahaz. [i.e. As long as he reigned; to wit, alone and before he admitted Joas his son to reign with him: for from that very time did God begin to deliver his people by Joas.]
\p
\v 23 . But the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and turned towards them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: [Wherein God had promised, that he would be not onely their God, but also the God of their seed, gen.17.7.] and he would not destroy them, neither did he cast them away from his face hitherto.
\p
\v 24 . And Hazael King of Syria died; and Benhadad his son became King in his stead.
\p
\v 25 . Now Joas the son of Joahaz took again [Heb. returned, and took: see Numb.11.on v.4.] out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Joahaz his Father by war: Joas smote him three times, and the cities of Issrael. [To wit, to the Kingdom of Israel: the full phrase is below chap.14.v.22,28.]
\c 14
\s Amazia is good in the beginning of his reign, v.1,&c. He punisheth the murderers of his Father, 5. Vanquisheth the Edomites, 7. Offereth to make war against the King of Israel, 8. Is smitten by him, 12. Is pursued, and slain by his own people, and buried, 19. Azaria his son reigneth,21. Jerobeam is King over Israel, 23. His acts, 25. He dieth, and Zacharia his son reigneth after him, 29.
\p
\v 1 In the second year of Joas the son Of Joahaz the King of Israel, Amazia [Heb. Amatsiaha] the son of Joas King of Juda became King.
\p
\v 2 . He was five and twenty years old, [Heb. A son of twenty and five years] when he became King, and reigned nine and twenty years at Jerusalem: [In this number are comprehended the twelve years, wherein he lived a banished man at Lachis, being expelled by his own subjects, below v.19.] and his mothers name was Joaddan, [Heb. Jehohaddan] of Jerusalem.
\p
\v 3 . And he did that which was right in they eyes of the LORD, yet not like David his father: [That is, not with an upright heart, 2 Chron.25.2.] he did according to all that Joas his Father had done. [For as Joas in the first year of his reign, as long as Jojada the Priest lived, behaved himself well, setting up, and maintaining the pure worship of God that was decayed; but afterward by the counsel of his Princes turned aside to Idolatry, above chap.12.3. 2 Chron.24.17,18. So did Amasia also behave himself well at first, but afterward fell to Idolatry, 2 Chron.25.7,&c. and v.14,&c.]
\p
\v 4 . Onely the high places were not taken away: [Compare 1 Kings 3.2. Item, above chap.12.3.] the people still offered, and burnt incense in the high places.
\p
\v 5 . Now it came to pass, when the Kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he smote [That is, punished with death: see Gen.8.on v.21.] his servants, that had smitten the King hid Father. [see above chap.12. vers.20, 21.]
\p
\v 6 . But the children of the murderers, he slew not; as is written in the book of the Law of Moseh, where the LORD commanded, saying; The Father shall not be put to death for the Fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin. [See Deut.24.v.16. and the annotate. thereon; also Ezek.18.20.]
\p
\v 7 . He smote (of) the Edomites in the valley of salt [Which was in Idumea: see further hereof, 2 Sam.8.13. and Psal.60.2.] ten thousand, and took Sela [i.e. Rock. The Metropolis, or chief city of Arabia Petrea, or, the stony Arabia: which lying upon a rock, took from thence and from the country its denomination. Compare 2 Chron.25.12.] by war, and called the name thereof Jokteel, [This name may be translated the obedience of God; that is, the obedience performed to God. Amazia seemeth to have called this city thus, because he held the subduing of this city to be a reward of this disobedience, which he shewed to God, when at the Prophets command he dishanded the Israelites, which he had hired for an hundred talents, &c. See 2 Chron.25.8,9.] unto this day. [i.e. this name continued still to this very time, wherein this book was written.]
\p
\v 8 .Then Amazia sent messengers to Joas the son of Joahaz the son of Jehu the King of Israel, saying; Come let us see one anothers face. [That is, let us fight with one another: so below v.11. Item, chap.23.v.29. and 2 Chron.25.v.17, and 21. It seemeth that he would revenge the death of his friends by this war undertaken, or begun by him, whereof see above chap.9.27. and 10 14. or at least the mischief and robbery done in this land by the disbanded Israelites: of which see 2 Chron. chap.25.v.13.]
\p
\v 9 . But Joas King of Israel sent to Amazia King of Juda, saying; The thistle, that is in Libanon, [See 1 Kings 4.on v.33.] sent to the Cedar, that is in Libanon, saying; Give thy daughter to my son to wife; but the beast of the field, that is on Libanon, passeth by, and trod down the thistle. [The King of Israel doth here compare the King of Juda to a thistle, or thorn-bush, and himself to a Cedar-tree, his souldiers to the wild beast of Libanon, and the harm that the King of Israel was to expect to the treading down of the thistle. it is as much as if he had said: If thou (who for strength of people, and royal honour art no more to be compared to me then a poor despised thistle to a tall Cedar) hadst sued to me for peace and friendship, thou shouldest hardly have obtained it; how much less shall this hostile presumption of thine be successful unto thee? therefore, if thou art wise, desist, and keep out of harms way.]
\p
\v 10 . Thou hast smitten the Edomites valiantly, [Heb. Smitting smitten: see above v.7.] therefore thine heart hath lifted thee up: take the honour, and tarry at home; for why shouldest thou mingled thy self in the evil, [viz. of war. Or, why shouldest thou mingled, or, thrust thy self (into the battle) to (thy) hurt?] that thou shouldest fall, thou, and Juda with thee? [because he would not tarry till Amazia assaults him own land, but would rather encounter with him in his.]
\p
\v 11 . But Amazia hearkened not: Therefore Joas King of Israel marched up, so that he, and Amazia King of Juda looked one another in the face [That is, fought with one another. See above on v.8.] at Beth-Sanes, which is in Juda. [this Beth-Sanes here mentioned, is a city lying in the border of the tribe of Juda. Jos.15.1. allotted to the Levites, Jos.21.16. taken by the Philistines in the this beth-Sames here mentioned is a city lying in the border of the tribe of Juda, Jos.15.1. allotted to the Levites, Jos.21.16. Taken by the Philistines in the reign of Achaz, 2 Chron.28.18. Is to be distinguished from another Beth-Semes, lying in the tribe of Napthali, Judg.1.33.]
\p
\v 12 . And Juda was smitten before the face of Israel; and they fled every man into his tents. [i.e. to their dwellings. See above chap.13.on v.5.]
\p
\v 13 . And Joas the King Israel took Amazia the King of Juda, the son of Joas the son of Ahazia at Beth-Semes, and came to Jerusalem, from the gate of Ephraim, [so called, because they passed thorough it to the land of Ephraim] unto the corner-gate, [Heb. the gate of the corner: Otherwise called the gate of the corners, zach.14.10. Item, the gate looking out: that is, a gate striking out as it were with a corner. See 2 Chron.25.23. and the anootat. It was so called, because it stood at the corner of a city] four hundred ells. [see Genes.6.on v.15.]
\p
\v 14 . And he took all the gold, and the silver, and all the vessels, that were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the Kings house, as also the hostages: [Heb. sons of suretiships, or, pledges. Understand persons of special descent and quality, which King Joas took with him out of Juda, for the securing of future peace] and he returning to Samaria.
\p
\v 15 . Now the rest of the acts of Joas, what he did, and his might, and how he fought against Amazia the King of Juda; are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
\p
\v 16 . And Joas fell asleep with his Fathers, and was buried at Samaria by the Kings of Israel: And Jerobeam his son became King in his stead.
\p
\v 17 . New Amazia the son of Joas King of Juda lived after the death of Joas the son of Joahaz, the King of Israel, fifteen years.
\p
\v 18 . Now the rest of the acts Amazia; are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Juda?
\p
\v 19 . And the made a conspiracy against him at Jerusalem, [To wit, in the fourth year after the death of Joas, or of the reign of Jerobeam his son] (so) that he fled to Lachis: but they sent after him to Lachis, [a city lying in the west-border of the tribe of Juda. See hereof Jos.10.31. and 15.39.] and put him to death there.
\p
\v 20 . And they brought him on horses; [That is, on a charet, Compare above chap.9.28.] and he was buried at Jerusalem, by his Fathers, in the City of David.
\p
\v 21 . And all the people of Juda took Azaria, [Otherwise called Uzzia, below chap.15.v.13.30. 2 Chron.26. Under this King did Isaia begim to prophesy, Isa. chap.1.1.] (who was now sixteen years old,) and made him King in the room of his Fathers Amazia. [to wit, when Amazia fled to Lachis. And hence it appeareth, that eleven following years of the reign, are not only ascribed to Amazia, but also to Azaria his son.]
\p
\v 22 . He built Elath, [See likewise of this city, Deut.2.8. Now Azari is said to have built this city, not in respect of laying the first foundation thereof, but of repairing the same, because it was decayed] and brought it again to Juda, after that the King [namely, Amazia his father] was fallen asleep with his fathers.
\p
\v 23 . In the fifteenth year of Amazia the son of Joas King of Juda, Jerobeam the son of Joas became King over Israel at Samaria, (and reigned) [see of these inserted words, above chap.13.on v.1.] one and fourty years.
\p
\v 24 . And did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD: He departed not from all the sins of Jerobeam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
\p
\v 25 . He brought also against [To wit, under the power and dominion of the Kings of Israel. See above chap.13.on v.25.] the border of Israel from the entering of hamath, [see hereof, Numb.13.21. and 34.8.] unto the sea of the plain field, [see likewise of this sea, Deut.3.7.] according to the word of the LORD the God of Israel, which he had spoken by the ministery [Heb.hand] of his servant Jona the son of Amithei the Prophet, [this is the same prophet Jona that was sent by the LORD of Ninive, and whose prophesy we have in the bible with the other Prophets] that was of Gath-Hepher. [a city lying in the tribe of Zebulon, Jos.19.v.13.]
\p
\v 26 . For the LORD saw that the misery of Israel was very bitter, [Or rebellious; that is, very hard, and grievious; which rebellion some also apply to Israel, as who were very rebellious, and were therefore punished] and that there were none shut up, nor left, [see of this phrase Deut.32.on v. 36. Item, 1 Kings.14.10. and 21.21.] and that Israel had no helper.
\p
\v 27 . And the LORD had not spoken that he would destroy the name of Israel from under heaven; [The LORD indeed soon after caused the ruine of the house of Israel, and the final rejection of this people to be foretold by the Prophet Hosea, as appeareth, Hos.1.v5,6,9. and likewise actually executed the same, 2 Kings 17.18. But he would not as yet do it at this time, but in his infinite mercy spared Israel as yet, because of his covenant which he had made with their Fathers. See also chap.13.23.] but he delivered them by the hand of Jerobeam the son of Joas.
\p
\v 28 . Now the rest of the acts of Jerobeam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he brought Damascus, and Hamath (belonging) to Juda, again to Israel; [These two cities were subudued by David and Salomon, 2 Sam.8.6. and 2 Chron.8.3. And therefore belonged to the Kings of Juda, when they were yet Kings over all Israel. But when afterward they were loft, and taken away by them from the Syrians, 1 King.11.24. this Jerobeam in his time recovered them again, not for the Kings of Juda, but for the Kings of Israel] are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
\p
\v 29 . And Jerobeam fell asleep with his Fathers, with the Kings of Israel: and his Zacharia became King in his Stead.
\c 15
\s Azaria cleaveth to the Lord, vers.1. &c. Is punished with leprosy, and dieth, 5. Zacharia becometh King over Israel, 8. is slain by Sallum, 10. He reigneth, and is slain by Manehen, 13. Manehens reign, 16. He is confirmed in his knowledge by Pul, 19. dieth, and Pekahia becometh King in his stead, 23. Is slainby Pekah, who succedeth in his room, 25. In whose time a part of the Israelites is carried away captive to Assyria by Tiglath Pileser, 29. Hosea slayeth Pekah, and succedeth in his room, 30. Jotham reigneth over Juda, 32. After him reigneth Achaz, 38.
\p
\v 1 In the seven and twentieth year of Jerobeam [Namely, the second of that name, the son of Joas, above chap. 14.23.] King of Israel, Azaria [otherwise called Uzzia, below ver.13,30. 2 Chron.26.1.] the son Amazia King of Juda became King. [to wit, to reign alone in full power as King. Otherwise he had been also formerly in some government for some certain years, or at least was esteemed as King: see above chap.14.on vers.21.]
\p
\v 2 . he was sixteen years old when he became King, [see 2 Chron.26 13.] and he reigned two and fifty years at Jerusalem: [see 2 Chron.26.1,3.] and his Mothers name was Jecholia of Jerusalem. [see 2 Chron.26. vers.19,20.21.]
\p
\v 3 . And he did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD; [To wit, as long as the Prophet Zacharias lived, 2 Chron.26.5.] according to all that Amazia his Father had done.
\p
\v 4 . Onely the high places were not taken away: the People offered still, and burnt incense on the high places.
\p
\v 5 . And the LORD plagued the King, (so) that he became a Leper unto the day of his death, [The cause hereof was that in high presumption he usurped upon the office of the Priests, entering into Temple, to burn incense, Chron.26.16.] and he dwelt in a servant house: [Heb. an house of liberty; that is, in a house that was free and separated from other houses, and stood alone by it self, according to the prescript of the law, which God had given concerning the Lepers, Levit.13.46.] but Jotham the Kings son was over the house, [to wit, the Kings house that is, he was the Steward, and had the supream command over all the Kings house and court] judging the people of the land. [i.e. governing the whole Land, and having the oversight over the administration of justice, and the observation of all good laws. Compare 2 Chron.15.5.]
\p
\v 6 . Now the rest of the acts of Azaria, and all that he did; are they not written in the books of the Chronicles of the Kings of Juda?
\p
\v 7 . And Azaria fell asleep with his fathers, and they buried him by his Fathers, [i.e. Indeed in the field, or plat of ground, appointed for the burial of the Kings, but at some distance from their Sepulchre, because of his Leprosy, 2 Chron.26.23.] in the city of David: and Jotham his son became King in his Stead.
\p
\v 8 . In the eight and thirtieth year of Azaria the King of Juda, did Zacharia the son of Jerobeam reign over Israel, at Samaria, six months.
\p
\v 9 . And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according as his Fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jerobeam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
\p
\v 10 . And Sallum [One of the Princes, or Rulers] the son of Jabes made a conspiracy against him, and smote him before the people, [that is, publicly: whence it appeareth, that Sallum act displeased not the people, and that Zacharia was hated by the Commonalty] and put him to death, and he became King in his stead.
\p
\v 11 . Now the rest of the acts of Zacharia; behold, that is written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
\p
\v 12 . This was the word of the LORD, which he had spoken to Jehu, saying; Unto thee shall sons of the fourth generation, sit on the throne of Israel; [See above chap.10.30. and the annotate. thereon] and so it came to pass.
\p
\v 13 . Sallum the son of Jabes became King in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzzia [Matt.1.9. called Ozias. Oth. above chap.14. ver.21,29. and in this chap.vers.1,6,7,8. Azaria] King of Juda: and he reigned a full month [Heb. a month of days, that is, a month of time, a full, and whole month, having all its days. So Gen.29.14, see the annotate.] at Samaria.
\p
\v 14 . For Menahen, the son of Gad, marched up from Tirza, [See 1 Kings 14.on v.17.] and came to Samaria, and smote Sallum, the son Jabes, at Samaria, and slew him, and became King in his stead.
\p
\v 15 . Now the rest of the acts Sallum, and his conspiracy, which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
\p
\v 16 . Then Menahen smote Tiphsa, [See of this city, 1 Kings 4.on ver.24.] with all that were therein, also the border thereof, from Thirza: because they had not opened (for him), [to wit, the gates of the city, when he was on his marched, to fall upon Sallum] therefore he smote (them): he rip up all their woman with child.
\p
\v 17 . In the nine and thirtieth year of Azaria the King of Juda, Menahen the son of Gad, became King over Israel, (and reigned) [Of this insertion, see above chap.13.on v.1. So below v.23, and 27.] ten years at Samaria.
\p
\v 18 . And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD: he departed not all his days from the sins of Jerobeam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
\p
\v 19 . (Then) Pull [Called in Historys (according to the opinion of some) Phalbelochus] King of Assyria, came against the Land; and Menahen gave unto Pull a thousand talents silver, [see of the weight of a talent, Exod.25.on v.39.] that his hand might be with him, to confirm the Kingdom in his land. [i.e. to buy peace of the Assyrians with this sum of money, and to secure himself in his Kingdom.]
\p
\v 20 . Now Menahen raised this money of Israel, of all the mighty (men) of substance, to give to the King of Assyria, for each man fifty shekels of silver: [That is, to pay (as some conceive) so much to every Assyrian souldier: see of the weight of the shekels of silver, Gen.23.on ver.15. Others translate it, of each man, each. Understanding this not of the Assyrians, that received the money, but of the mighty men of the Israelites that were to pay it] so the King of Assyrians turned back, and stayed not in the land.
\p
\v 21 . Now the rest of the acts of Menahen, and all that he did, is that nit written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
\p
\v 22 . After that Menahen fell a sleep with his Fathers: and Pekah his son became King in his stead.]
\p
\v 23 . In the fiftieth year of Azaria King of Judah, Pekahia the son of Menahen became King over Israel, (and reigned) two years at Samaria.
\p
\v 24 . And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of Jerobeam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
\p
\v 25 . And Pekah the son of Remalia his Captain, made a conspiracy against him, and smote him at Samaria in the Palace of the Kings house, with Argob, and with Arje, [Who accompanied him, to help to executed his treachery, whereunto also the Gileadites, here mentioned, served. The Hebrew word rendered here Arje, signify that Lion: as it likewise translated so by some, conceiving that a certain man was so surnamed] and with him fifty men, of the children of the Gileadites: so he slew him, and became King in his stead.
\p
\v 26 . Now the rest of the acts of Pekahia, and all that he did; behold, that is written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
\p
\v 27 . In the two and fifteen year of Azaria King of Juda, Pekah the son of Remalia became King over Israel, (and reigned) twenty years at Samaria.
\p
\v 28 . And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of Jerobeam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
\p
\v 29 . I in the dayes of Pekar King of Israel, came Tiglath-Pilefer [called also Tiglat-Pilnefer, 2 Chr 28.20. in prophane Hiftories, Phulasar the son of Phulbelochus: of whom see above v. 19.] K. of Assyria, and took Ison and Abel-Beth-Maacha [see of these two cities, 1 Kin. 15 on verse 20] and Janoah, [a city laying in the East-border of the tribe of Ephraim by the Jordan: see of this city, Jos. 16.6.] and Kedes, [see of this city, Judges 4. on verse 6] and Hazor, [formerly a royal city, Los. 11.10, afterward allotted to the tribe of Naphthali, Lo. 19.36.] and Gilead, [see Gen. 31 on verse 21] and Galilee, [see 1 Kings 9 on verse 11.] all the land of Naphtali and he carried them away (captive) [namely, the inhabitants of the afore-named Lands and Cities] to Assyrian.
\p
\v 30 . And Hosea the son of Ela made the conspiracy against Pekah the son of Romalia and smote him and put him to death, and became king in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah. [i.e twenty years after the beginning of Jotham’s reign; which was the fourth year of Achaz his reign, for Jotham reigned but fix years, below v. 33. others conceive that Jotham reigned certain years jointly with his father, because of his leprosie, which are here added which are sixteen yeares of his reign.]
\p
\v 31 . Now the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
\p
\v 32 . in the second ear of Pekah, the son of Remalia King of Israel, Jotham the son Uzziah king of Judah, became King.
\p
\v 33 . He was five and twenty years old, [Heb. A son five and twenty years] when he became king, and reigned sixteen years at Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Jerusalem daughter of Zadok.
\p
\v 34 . And he did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.
\p
\v 35 . Onely the high places were not taken away; the people offered still, and burnt incense on the high places [compare 2 Chron. 27 and the annotate.] and the same (King) built the high gate [oth. Called the gate of Sur. And the foundation gate: see above chap. 11.6 and 2 chron. 23.5 and the annotatthereon] at the House of LORD.
\p
\v 36 . Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are not they written in the book of the Chronicles of the King of Juda?
\p
\v 37 . In those dayes [About the end of Jotham’s reign] the Lord began to send into Juda Rezin [Heb. Retsin] the King of Syria and Pekah the Sonne of Remalia.
\p
\v 38 . And Jotham fell asleep with his father; and was buried by his father in the city of David his father; And Achab his son became King in his stead.
\c 16
\s Achab is abominable Idolater, ver 1, &c. Rezin and Pekah making war against him, he hireth tiglath Pilefer against them, 5. He traveth to Damascus, and causeth an alter to be made at Jerusalem, according to the pattern of the altar, which he saw at Damascus,10. on which he offereth, corrupting the true worshipping of God, 12. He dieth and Hizkia reigneth, 20
\p
\v 1 In the Seventy year [Heb. In the year of the seventh year, see Gen. 5.5 and the annotate. Thereon] of Pekah the son of Remalia, Achaz the son of Jotham king of Juda became King.
\p
\v 2 Achaz wa twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years, at Jerusalem ad he did not that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, like David his father.
\p
\v 3 For he walked in the way of the king of Isreal, yeah he also made his son pass thorow the fire, [what this is, see lev 18. on verse 21 and compare 2 chron 28.3 and see the annotate there] according to the abomination of the Heathen, which the Lord had driven out before the children of Israel.
\p
\v 4 He also offered, and burnt incense on the high places, [see Lev. 26 on verse 30] and on the hills: also under all (for every) green tree. [see of this idolatious custome, Duet 12, on v. 2 and compare below chapter 17.10 2 Chron. 28.4. Jer. 2.20. Hos. 4.13.]
\p
\v 5 Then Rezin the King of Syria marched up, with Pekah the son of Remalia the King of Israel, to Jerusalem to battle and they besieged Achaz; but they prevailed not by fighting. [they were hindered by God who not onely long ago had promised to protect Jerusalem, 1 Kings chap. 11.36. 2 chron.7.16 but also at this present time Isa. 7.4,&c.]
\p
\v 6 At that time Rezin king of Syria brought Elath [Azaria the grandfather of Achaz had formerly taken this city and brought it under the subjection of the kingdome of Juda above chap 14.22. see of this city 1 King. 9 on v. 26.] again Syria and cast the Jews out of Elath [i.e out of the dominion of Elath: and Syrians [oth. Edomites] came to Elath, and dwelt there unto this day.
\p
\v 7 Now Achaz sent messengers to Tiglath-Pileser [see above chap. 15 on ver 29] king of Assyria saying: I am thy servant, and thy son: [oth. Let me by thy servant, ad son: that is let me by thy vassal, that I may trust under thy protection on which condition I promise to thee truth as a servant and obedience, as a son] come up and deliver me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me.
\p
\v 8 And Achaz took the silver, and the gold that was found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the King’s house: and he sent thee King of Assyria a present: [see 2 Chron. 28.21]
\p
\v 9 So the King of Assyria hearkened to him; for the King of Assyria marched up against Damascus and took it, and carried it [To wit, Damascus; that is, the Inhabitants of Damascus] away captive to Kir: [ understand here a countrey in Media, whither these Syrians were carried captives as Amos had foretold, chap. 5.1. and distinguishing this Kir from another, called Kir of the Moabites, Isa.15.1.] and he slew Resin.
\p
\v 10 Then Achaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria,[to wit, to give him thanks for the aid he had given him, to congratulate him for the victory he had obtained, and to crave his good will and affection towards him for the future, and mainly his assistance against his Philistines, to recover again that which they had taken away from him: see 2 Chron. 28.18.] and having seen an Altar which was at Damascus, [[on which the Syrians in Damascus offered sacrifices to their idols] King Achaz sent to Uria the priest the likeness of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to the workmanship thereof.
\p
\v 11 And Uria the priest built the altar: according to all that King Achaz had sent from Damascus; so did Uria the Priest against King Achaz came from Damascus.
\p
\v 12 Now when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and king approached to the altar and offered thereo. [he is not contented with his Royal Dignity, but likewise entrencheth upon thepriestly office, being not afraid of the judgement of his grandfather Uzzia for doing so, 2 Chron chap 26. v. 19.]
\p
\v 13 And kindled his burnt-offering and his meat-offering and poured his drink-offering; and sprinkled the blood of his thank-offerings. [Hebr. Of the thanks-offerings that were his, or which he had] upon that altar. [Which he had caused to be made according to the fashion of the Syrian Altar, above verse 10.]
\p
\v 14 But the copper altar [understand the altar of burnt-offering, which Salomon had caused to be made, 2 chron. 4.1] which was made before the face of the LORD, [see Lev. 1 on verse 3.] the same he brought from the fore-part of the house, [that is, from the place of the court, that was before the temple, where this altar was stand, according to the law of the Lord] from between (his) Altar and from between the house of the LORD: and he put it at the side of (his) altar Northward. [i.e. at the right side, as they went into the Temple: thither he removed the altar of the Lord, as being unworthy to keep its former place, that his that was made according to the Syrian fashion, might stand next to the temple.]
\p
\v 15 And K. Achaz commanded Uria the priest saying, upon the great alter, [Understand the new alter, made after the Syrian pattern, which he calleth great, because the form thereof was bigger and larger then the form of the copper altar, or because (in his opinion) it was more value and worth then that] burn the morning-burn-offering, and the evening meat-offering and the King’s-burnt offering, and his meat-offering, and the burnt-offering of all the people of the land, and their meat-offering and their drink –offerings, and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt-offering: but the copper altar shall be for me, to acquire (by). [The words may be likewise being translated: as for the copper alter, it shall be, or stand by me, to visit (the same); that is, I will use it at my pleasure, to offer upon it: or I will acquire, or consider (thereon) at my pleasure.]
\p
\v 16 And Uria the priest did, [as a wicked and Idolatrous hypocrite] according to all that King Achaz had commanded him.
\p
\v 17 And King Achaz cut off the borders of the hases [Heb, shutting’s in, or shutting’s about. Understanding the circumstances of the bases, in which the vessels that stood upon them were fitted in and shut in: see of these 1 Kings 17.28. what these were, see 1 Kings 17 on vers. 27] And took away the laver [see of this 1Kings 7 on vers. 38] from above them and pulled down the sea [see of this 1 Kings 7 on verse 23.] from off the copper oxen [see 1 Kings 7.25.] that were under it, and he set it upon a stone floor.
\p
\v 18 Moreover he turned, [Heb. Turned off the cover of the Sabbath, [this seemeth to have been a hut or lodge, wherein the priests, when they had finished their weekly course, in taking heed of the worship of God, did keep on the Sabbath, until they returned home others hold this covert of the Sabbath to have been retiring place for the guard or watch men, that on the Sabbath and the whole week long were to keep the watch on the temple. Now to remove this, was as much as to shut up the temple; which Achaz did, 2 Chron. 28.24. some understand this of a covert, where with the people’s court was coverd against rain and winde. There be also those that conceive, that is, was a place were the king sat on the high dayes and did his alms] which they had built n the house and the King’s outermost entry [thorow which the king went from the strong hold of Zion to the temple: se 1 Kings 10.5 and the annotations. Item, the annotation on verse 12.] from the house of the LORD, because of the King of Assyria [i.e. partly to please the King of Assyria, shewing thus, that he left his own religion and embraced the Heathenish; partly for fear, that the King of Assyria might at any time by means of this entry take the strong hold of Zion and the King’s house]
\p
\v 19 Now the rest of the Acts what he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of juda?
\p
\v 20 And Achaz fell asleep with his father, and was buried by his fathers in the city of David: [But not in the Sepulchtes of the Kings: see 2 Chron. 28.27. and compare 2 Chron. 24.25.] and Hizkia his son became King in his stead.
\c 17
\s Hosea becomes King of Israel, verse 1. Is subjected to the King of Assyria, after that besieged by him,saken prisoner, and with all the people carried captives to Assyria, 3. all this for their sins, 7. the strange Nations, wherewith their land was planted are troubled with Lions, 24. for which cause an Israelitish priest is sent to them. 27. whence foloweth a mixture of religion, 29.
\p
\v 1 In the twelveth year of Achaz King of Juda, Hosea the son of Ela became king over Israel at Samaria, (and reigned) [of these inserted words, see 1 Kings 15 on verse 33.] nine years. [he had indeed taken possession of the Kingdome of Israel in the fourth year of Achaz, that is, eight years before, above chapter 15 on verse 30 but in regard the land was full of contestings and troubles about the crown, neither he, nor any man else seemeth to have confirmed, or settled King those eight years, or if he had been yet held to be king he was notwithstanding under the tribute of the King of Assyria, yea also (as some conceive) his prisoner; so that the fore mentioned eight years, come not here in the account of his reign: else he had reigned seventeen years. Compare above chapter 15 verse 30 and below chap. 18 verse 9. others conceive that he reigned the first eight years absolutely as sovereign and the other nine as tributary and that the holy scripture here onely maketh mention of these last.
\p
\v 2 And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD: yet not as the King of Israel that had been before him. [that is, not with such great Idolatry: for the former Kigs had for the most part worshipped not onely the golden calves, but also Baal and other abominations of the heathen. Some likewise conceive, that he had let his people go up to Jerusalem, to offer there; which was formerly fobbiden them.]
\p
\v 3 Against him marched Salmaneser. [Otherwise, called also in some Histories, Nabonasser. Although some is of opinion that they were diver’s men] King of Assria: and hosea became his servant. (so) that he gave him a present. [That is, a yearly Tribute, or Tax.
\p
\v 4 . But the King of Assyria perceived a conspiracy in Hosea, [Namely about the fifth, or sixth year of this reign of Hosea. Compare below chap. 18. V. 9.] that he had sent messengers to So, king of Egypt, [otherwise called in Histories Sabachos, who having expelled his Predecessor Zychis, reigned many years over Egypt. This man’s help did Hosea crave against the Assyrians] and brought not up the present from year to year to the king of Assyria, as formerly (he had done) from year to year: so the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him to prison. [Heb. The house of shut ting up, or compulsion. This was done in the ninth year of king Hosea’s reign, mentioned in first verse.]
\p
\v 5 . For the King of Assyria marched up into all the land; yea he marched up into all the land; yea marched up to Samaria, and he besieged it three years.
\p
\v 6 . in the ninth year of Hosea, the King of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Isreal into Assyria, and made them dwell in Hakah, [samoe hold it to be Calacine of Assyria, lying above Abiabene. See hereof also below chapter 18.11. 1 Chron. 5. Vers. 26.] and in habor, [which is conceived to be an hilly land of Assyria, bordering on Media. See below chap. 18.11.] by the river of Gozan, [a river in Mesopotamia, below chapter 18.11. 1 Chron. 15. V 26: oth. Nebar-Gozan, a country (as some conceive) in Media] and in the cities of Medes. [Gen. 10. On ver. 2.]
\p
\v 7 . for it came to pass, that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh the King of Egypt; and had feared other Gods. [see Gen. 35 on v. 2.]
\p
\v 8 . And had walked in the statutes of the Heathen, which the Lord had driven out before the face of the children of Israel, and of the Kings of Isreal, that had made them. [understand the statutes, which the Kings of Israel had made see below v.19. or the Kings of Israel, which they, to wit, the children of Isreal, had set up.]
\p
\v 9 . And the children of Israel had cloaked [Heb. Properly covered] the things that are not right, against the Lord their God: [oth, with the Lord, &c. that is, with the name, or clock of the service of God. The meaning is, they excused their idolatry and sins and cloathed them with the name and shew of Religion, holiness and good meaning, willing to serve God, not according to his word, but according to their own fancie, against the express command of God, Numb. 15.39.] and had built them high places in all places all their cities, from the watch-tower to the fenced cities. [i.e. every where thorow out the whole land, as well in small, and unhibited places, and in the field as in great and populous places and cities. The Watch-Towers were here and there built in the land, to warn the people of the enemies approach, or to secure the cattel, and the fruits of the ground.]
\p
\v 10 . And they had reared them up standing images, [see Lev. 26. On v. 1] and groves, [see Exod. 34.13. and Deu. 7.5. with the annotate. Oth. Grove-gods, grove-images] on all, (or every) high hill and all (or every) green tree. [see Deu. 12 on v. 2.]
\p
\v 11 . And there they had burnt incense on all the high places, as (did) the heathen, whom the LORD had carred away from their faces: and they had done evil things to provoke the LORD to anger.
\p
\v 12 . And they served the Dung-Gods [See Lev. 26. On v. 30] whereof the LORD had said uto them; thou shalt not do this thing. [see Exodus 20.3;4;19. Deut. 4.7, 8.]
\p
\v 13 . Now when the LORD had testified against Israel, and against Juda by the ministry [Heb. Hand] of all the Prophets, (and) of all the seers, [to wit, to whom God had declared his will, in all manner of ways, which he used in those times to instruct men by, as by Oracles, Vision, or dreams: see Numb. 12 on v. 6:] saying; turn ye from your evil ways and keep my commandments, (and) my statutes, according to all the law, which I commended your fathers; and which I sent to you by the hand of my servants the prophets: [see Jerem. 8.11 and 25.5. and 35.15.]
\p
\v 14 They then hearkened not; but they hardened their neck, [that is, they were disobedient, and rebellious to the utmost, refusing to yield the exhortations of God: see Exod. 22 on vers. 9] as the neck of their fathers had been, that had not believed o the Lord their God. [that is, had not believed his threatening.]
\p
\v 15 Moreover, they rejected their statutes, and his covenant, which he had made with their fathers, and his testimonies, which he had testified against them and walked after vanity, [idolatry is called vanity, as well because idols are a thing of nothing, as because of the confidence fixed on them is in vain; yea also because idolaters are deprived of right judgment and understanding] (so) that they became vain, and after the heathen, that were round about them, concerning whom the Lord had charged them, that they should not do like them.
\p
\v 16 Yea they left all the commandments of the Lord their God, and made them molten images, two calves, and made gloves, and bowed themselves before all the host of heaven, [see Deu. 4. On verse 19.] and served Baal. [see Judges 2 on ver 11.]
\p
\v 17 they also caused their son and their daughters to pass through the fire, [see Lev. 18. On v. 21] and used sooth-saying, [Heb sooth-sayings] and gave bead to the noise of fowls, [see Lev. 19 on verse 26] and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, [see the meaning of this phrase, 1 Kings 21 on verse 21 to provoke him to anger.
\p
\v 18 Therefore the Lord was angry against Israel, (so) that he removed them from his face: [i.e. out of the Land of Canaan, which he had hallowed for a habitation to himself, having therein his church in the midst whereof he dwelt, and wherein he shewed the outward tokens of his presence: so below v 20 and 23 and chap. 23 v. 27 and 24.3.] there was nothing left, save the tribe of Juda onely. [being here-under comprised the Levites, that dwelt in the tribe of Juda and Simeonites, that were mingled among them, with a part of Benjamin. [see 1 Kings 1 on v. 32]
\p
\v 19 Even Juda kept not the commandments of the Lord their God: but they walked in the statutes of Israel, which they [to wit, the Israelites] he made. [this aggravate the sinne of the Israelites, that they made by their evil examples those of Juda also to sinne and provoked them to idolatry: see Hos. 4.15:]
\p
\v 20 So the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, [to wit, the ten tribes, who are called Israel, to distinguish them from Juda, as appeareth by the following verse] and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hands of the spoilers: until he had cast them away from his face.
\p
\v 21 For he rent the house from the house of David, [He, namely the LORD, 1 Kings 14.24. or Israel rent itself from the house of David] and they made Jerobeam the son of Nebat King, and Jerobeam drave Israel away from after the Lord and he made them to sin a great sinne. [see 1 Kings 12 on verse 30]
\p
\v 22 So the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jerobean, which he had done: [see above chap. 14 on v. 16.] they departed not from them.
\p
\v 23 Until the LORD removed Israel from his face according as he had spoken by the ministery [Heb. Hand] of all his servants the Prophets: so Israel was carried away out of their (own) land to Assyria, unto his day. [i.e. which transportation maketh them to be Exiles, and to continue in banishment unto this day, when this was written.]
\p
\v 24 Now the king of Assyria brought (people) from Babeland from Cata, [A countery (as is thought) of desert Arabia, inhabited by the Citanians, which border on Syria: or Persia, having the name from the river Cata,] and from Ava, [see Deut. 2 on verse 23, called also Java, below chap. 18.34.] and from Hamath, [see Numb 13 on verse 21.] and Sepharvaim, [the land of the city of Sephora, lying in Mesopotamia by Euphrates] and made them dwell in the cities of Samari, Instead of the chidren of Israel: and they took Samaria hereditarily, and dwelt in the cities thereof.
\p
\v 25 And it came to pass in the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD, [that is, they feared him not according to the lawful manner prescribed by Moseh] so the Lord sent Lions among them, which killed some of them.
\p
\v 26 Therefore they spake unto the King of Assyria, [to wit, the Inhabitants by their Ambassadors, whom they dispatched away to the King, to acquaint him with this grievance of theirs] saying; The Nations which thou hast carried away, and hast caused to dwell in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the Land: therefore he hath sent Lions among them, and behold they kill them, becase they know not the manner of the God of the Land.
\p
\v 27 Then the King of Assyria commanded, saying; bring hither one of the Priests. [which were not the Levitical Priests, but which King of Israel had made of the meanest of the people, 1 Kings 12.31.] whom ye brought away from thence, that they [to wit, the priest with his retinue, servants and household; or with those that conducted him] may go, and dwell there: and that he may teach them the manner of the God of the land.
\p
\v 28 So one of the Priests, whom they had carried away from Samaria, came and dwelt at Bethel: and he taught them how they should fear the LORD. [i.e. Serve him: although doubtless more after the Idolatrous manner of the former kings, then after the Law of God given by Moseh: So below v. 32,33,41.]
\p
\v 29 But every Naion [Heb. Nation, nation: so in the following words of this verse: see Gen. 7.on v. 2.] made their (own) Gods, and they put them in the Houses of the high places, which the Samaritans had made; each nation in their cities, wherein they dwelt.
\p
\v 30 For the men Babel made Succoth Benoth; [this name, with the rest that follow in this verse, and in the Samaritans worshipped. But hereof are divers opinions among the learned] and the men of Chutmade Nergal; and the men of Hamath made Afima;
\p
\v 31 And the Avvites made Nibba, [otherwise, Nibban] and tartak and the Separvites burnt their sons with fire to Adramelech and Anamelech, the Gods of Separvaim. [see Lev. 18 on v. 21.]
\p
\v 32 They also feared the Lord and made unto themselves priestd of the high places, of their meanest (ones) [Heb. Of their ends, or of their uttermost parts: see 1Kings 12 on verse 31.] which did (service) for them in the houses of the high places.
\p
\v 33 they feared the LORD and served (also) their (own) Gods, after the manner of the Nations, from whom [Heb. From whence they had carried them away. [to wit, each their Idol, accrding to the manner of their country from whence each Nation was carried thither by the Assyrias. See Zeph. 1.5.]
\p
\v 34 Until this day they do after the former manners: [understand here the Israelites: of whom see above verse. 23 For here is made an opposition between the stiffneckedness of the Israelites, that are carried away into Assyria, because they would not live their old Idolatry;and the changeableness of The Assyrians to serve the Lord after the aolatrous manner of the Israelites although they had not formerly done it.] they fear not the Lord, neither do they after their statutes, or after their rights, and after the law, and after the commandment which the Lord commanded the children of Jacob to whom he gave the name of Israel. [this is here added, to upbraid the Israelites, that they had forgotten the exceeding great mercies, which God had shewed to their father Jacob and likewise to them; which ought to have moved them to serve the same God alone purely and to cleave unto him faithfully.]
\p
\v 35 Yet the Lord had made a covenant with them, [see Gen 17.7. Exod. 19.5, &c and 24.7&c.] and had changed them saying: ye shall not fear other Gods. Nor how down your selves before them, nor serve them nor do sacrifice to them. [see Judges 6.10]
\p
\v 36 but the LORD who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a stretched out arm, [see Exod.6. on v.5.] him shall ye fear and before him shall ye do sacrifice.
\p
\v 37 And the statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment, [Understand by these four words: first the ceremonial Law. Secondly, the judicial or civil Laws, Thirdly, the true doctrine. Fourthly, the moral law. See Genesis 26 on v. 5] which he wrote for you, you shall observe to do at all dayes: and ye shall not fear other Gods.
\p
\v 38 And the covenant, which I have made with you, ye shall not forget; and ye shall not fear other Gods.
\p
\v 39 but ye shall fear God your LORD your god: and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.
\p
\v 40 Yet they hearkened not, but they did after their former manner. [Which was ordained by Jerobeam, and other Idolatrous Kings.]
\p
\v 41 But these Nations [namely the Heathen, which were come out of Assyria, to dwell in Samaria, and in the land of the Israelites] feared the Lord [to wit, after the idolatrous manner of the Israelites. See above on verse 28.] and spread their carved images: their children also and their children do unto this day, according as their father have done.
\c 18
\s Hizkia becometh king over Juda, verse 1, &c. is very religion is not afraid of the king of Assyria and overcometh the Philistines, 3 Salmanasser taketh Samaria, and Israel is carried away captive to Assyria, 9 Sanherib invadeth the land of Juda and Hazkia payeth him tribute, 13. notwithstanding be summoneth Jerusalem, 27. rabsake stirreth up the people to mutiny, and blasphemeth God, 19. which is told the Kings, 37
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass in the third year of hosea the son of Ela, king of Israel, [to wi, of the nine last years, mentioned above chapter 17.1.] that hazkia [Called Ezekia, Ma.1.9.] the son of Achaz, the king of Juda became King.
\p
\v 2 He was five and twenty years old, when he became Kig, [Heb. A son of five and twenty years] and he reigned nine and twenty years at Jerusalem and his mother’s name was Abi [she is also called Abia, 2 chron 2.1] a daughter of Zacharia. [some hold this man to have been the king of Israel, of whom mention is made above chap. 14.29]
\p
\v 3 And he did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: according to all that David his father had done.
\p
\v 4 He took away the high places, and brake the reared images and destroyed the groves: and he brake in places the copper serpent, [see of this serpent, num. 21.8,9.] which Moses had made: because the children of Israel had burnt incense unto it until those dayes, and he called it Nebustan. [i.e copper-work, or a piece of copper, or something that is of copper. So the king called the copper serpent to show that there was nothing divine init, and consequently no reason to give divine honor unto it by offerings and invocations. Oth. They called it, &c. that is, the people had given it a name, as their idol.]
\p
\v 5 He trusted in the LORD the God of Israel; so that after him (there) was not like him manner among all the kings of Juda, nor (among those) that had been before him. [To wit, in reforming and restoring the pure religion or worship of God. To wit. Forthwith in the beginning of the reign. Otherwise this must be understood with the exception of David and Josia: of David, to whom he is equaled and not held to be more transcendent, ab. V.3. of Josia, to whom this commendation is likewise given, that before and after him there was no king like unto him, below chapter 23. 25.
\p
\v 6 For he clave unto the Lord, he departed not from following him. [Heb. From after him. See 1 Kings 9. on. V. 6.] and he kept his commandments, which the LORD had commanded Moseh.
\p
\v 7 So the Lord was with him; [see Ge. 21 on v. 22 and 26. on v. 25 and Num. 14. on v. 9.] he delt valiantly whithersoever he went forth: besides, he revolted from the King of Assyria, (so) that he served him not. [i.e. paid him no tribute no tax. His revolting fom the king of Assyria is related here in respect of his father Achaz, who had made himself subject to the King of Assyria as his Vassal and tributary. See above chap. 16.7.]
\p
\v 8 He smote the Philistines, [That had taken away many cities from his father and a great part of his land. See 2 chron. 28.18.] unto Gaza and the borders thereof, from the watch-tower, to the fenced cities [i.e. every where in divers places. See above chap. 17. on v. 9.]
\p
\v 9 Now it came to pass n the fourth year that King Hizkia, (which was the seventh year of Hosea and son of Ela, King of Isael) [counting from the beginning of nine years mentioned above cha. 17.1.] that Salmaneser the king of Assyria marched up against Samaria,and besieged it.
\p
\v 10 And they took it at the end of three years, [to wit, of the siege] in the sixth year of Hizkia: it was the ninth year of Hosea King of Israel, when Samaria was taken.
\p
\v 11 and the king of Assyria carried Israel away under Assyria and caused them to put in Halah,and in Habon the river of Gozon and in the cities of the Medes. [see of these lands above chap. 17 on verse 6.]
\p
\v 12 Because they had not been obedient to the voice of the Lord their god, but had transgressed his covenant (and all that Moseh the servant of the LORD had commanded, that they had not heard, [i.e. would not hear] nor done.
\p
\v 13 but in the fourteenth ear of Kingg hizkia, Sanherib King of Assyria marched up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them. [to wit, some of them.]
\p
\v 14 then Hizkia King of Juda sent to the King of Assyria to Lachis. [Which city he then besieged and fought against] saying; I have sinned, turn away from me, what thou shalt lay upon me, I will hear: then the king of Assyria laid upon Hizkkia King of Juda, three hundred talents of silver, [see Exod. 25 on v. 39.] and thirty talents of gold.
\p
\v 15 So hizkia gave (him) all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king’s house.
\p
\v 16 At that time did hizkia cut off all (the gold) from the doors of the temple of the Lord and form the psost which Hizkia the King of Juda had caused to be overlaid, [the meaning is, that he pulled off the golden plated, wherewith he had formerly overlaid the door and posts of the temple, when he opened again the temple, which whichhis father had shut up, 2 chron. 29.3.] and gave that. [Hebr. To wit, the doors and posts; that is, the gold, wherewith they had been overlaid.]
\p
\v 17 Nevertheless, the King of Assyria sent tartan, not keeping his word, when he had received the mony] and Rabsaris, [the word signifieth the chief courtier, or Chamberlain; as it is translated by some] and rabsake from Lachis unto Hizkia with an heavy host to Jerusalem: and they marched up and came to Jerusalem: And when they marched up, and were come they stayed b the conduit [Hereby many do understand a certain watercourse, without Jerusalem, into which water was descended out of a river that was near it, wherein the fuller washed their woolen cloth. Compare Isa. 7.3.] of the upper pool called the lower, Isa.22.9.] which is by the highway [understand a high and rode way, which (as some conceive) was paved with stone] of the fullers field. [where the fullers dress their cloth.]
\p
\v 18 And they called to the king, so there came out of their Eliakm the son of Hilkia the steward, [see of this virtuous and religious steward Isa. 22.20. of such an office see 1 kings 4. on v. 6. Heb who was over the house] and Sebna the scibe, [oth. Notary, or secretary: to wit of the king. See 1 kings 4 on verse 3.] and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, Remembrancer. So also v. 37. item I kings 4.3. see the annotate.]
\p
\v 19 And Rabsake said unto them; say now to Hizkia; that saith the great King, the King of Assyria; whatconfidence is this wherewith thou trustest?
\p
\v 20 Thou sayest, (but it is word of the lips) [That is, vain, idle, fruitless, altogether nothing, of which there will be, or come nothing: or understand a word that is, only in the mouth, and preceedeth not from the heart; which is not meant, nor shall be confirmed by the deed] there is counsel and strength for the war: [oth thou speakest, but there are nothing but words: counsel and strength (are required) for the war. Oth. Thou speakest but a word of the lip, but (there must) be counsel and strength for war. Mocking thus at the prayers and encouragements made which Hizkia used] now on whom dost thou that thou rebellest against me?
\p
\v 21 behold now, thou trustest upon that broken [Or, bruised] staffe of reed, [understand by this comparison an help, or aid, that is weak, unfaithfull and uncostant. So Isa. 36.6 Ezek. 29 v.6,7.] upon Egypt, on which if any man lean, it will go into his hand and pierce it: so is Pharoah King of Egypt, to all those that trust on him.
\p
\v 22 But if ye say unto me; we trust on the LORD our God: is not that he, whose high place and whose altars Hizkia hath taken away and hath said to Juda, and to Jerusalem; you shall bow yourselves before this altar[To wit, this only altar: As it is said, 2 Chro. 32.12. that is before none othe] at Jerusalem.
\p
\v 23 Now then, I pray thee lay a wager which my Lord the King of Assyria’ [or give pledges or sureties to my Lord,] and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou shalt be able for thy (part) to give riders upon them.
\p
\v 24 How wilt thou then turn away [i.e. drive away.] the face of one prince, of the meanest of my lord’s servants? But thou trustest on Egypt, for charets and for horsemen.
\p
\v 25 Am I (now) come up without the Lord against this place to destroy it? The Lord said unto me March up against that land and destroys it. [He speaketh this falsly in a presuming way, to affrighten and astonishes the people of God. Although it otherwise hapned by Gods secret providence, which notwithstanding, was unknown to his. See below chapter 19 verse 15. Isa. 10.5, 6,7.]
\p
\v 26 Then said Eliakim the son of Hizkia, and Sebna and Joah unto Rabsake; speak, we pray unto thy servants in the Syrian, for we understand it (well) [Heb. We are hearing; that is, we do understand, and are skilled in that language. See gen. 11 on v.7.] and talk not with us in the Jewish language before the ears of the people that are on the wall.
\p
\v 27 But Rabsake said unto them, hath my Lord sent me to thy LORD, and to thee, to speak these words? Is it not to he men who sit on the wall, that they may eat their (own) dung, and drink their (own) piss with you? [that is, that they may be warned that by means of strict and close siege most terrible calamities should come upon them, insomuch that they should be forced to eat their own dung and to drink their own water, to satisfie their hunger and thirst, if they would not deliver up themselves.]
\p
\v 28 So Rabsake stood, and cryed with a loud voice [Heb. Great voce] in the jewish Language; and he spake and said, hear the word of the great king the king of Assyria.
\p
\v 29 Thus saith the king; let not Hizkia deceive you; for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand.
\p
\v 30 Moreover, let not Hizkia make you trust on the LORDsaying; the Lord will surely deliver. [Heb. Delivering, deliver] us and this city shall not delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\p
\v 31 hearken not to Hizkia: for thus saith the king of Assyria; deal with me by a present, [The Hebrew word rendered here present, signifieth properly blessing; but it is also taken for a present. See Gen. 33.11 with the annotate. The meaning is, that he offereth the Jews a treaty of peace, that they might not experimentally feel his power and cruel siege, with the consequences thereof.] and come forth to me, and eat (ye) every man (of) his (own) vine and every man (of) his own fig tree and drink (ye) every man the worst of his (own) well;
\p
\v 32 Until I come, and bring you into a land like your (own) land, and land of corn, and of new wine a land of bread, and of vineyards a land of olives of soil and of honey; [understand by these all temporal good things, wherewith the LORD doth bless and prosper a land. See Exod. 3.8. Deut.32.12.13,14. Job 20.17. with the annotate.] so ye shall live and not die; And hearken not to Hizkia; for he stirreth you up [oth. When he seduceth, or encourageth, or perswadeth you] saying; the Lord shall deliver us.
\p
\v 33 Have the Gods of the Nations in any wife delivered [Heb. Delivering, delivered] everyone has his land, out of the hand of the king of Assyria.
\p
\v 34 Where are the Gods of hammth and Arpad? [see of these two cities also joined together, Jerem. 49.23.] where are the Gods Sepharvaim, Hena and Juva? [we have here the names of the cities and lands, which the king of Assyria had taken. See above chap. 17. on v. 24 and Isa. 37.13. as concerning Hena and juva, some hold these to be proper names of the countries: (compare above chap. 17.31.) others translate the word thus: he hath removed and overturned them, Isa. 36.19. these words are left out] Yea have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?
\p
\v 35 Who are they among all the goods of the lands that have delivered their land out of mine hand; that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?
\p
\v 36 But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the kings commandment was saying; ye shall not answer him.
\p
\v 37 Then came Aliakim thee son of Hilkia the steward, [Heb. Who was over the house. See of this man above on v. 18 also below cha. 19.2.] and Schna the scribe, and joah the son Asaph the chancellour, to Hizkia with (their) garments rent: [see Gen. 37. on verse 29. Heb. rent off garments] and they acquainted him with the words of Rabsake.
\c 19
\s Hizkia sendeth to the Prophet Isaia, to acquaint him with the blasphemies of Rabsake, v.1, &c. Isaia promiseth deliverance from the Lord, 6. Sanherith is forced to march against the moors, 8. sendeth again messenger to Hizkia with blasphemous letters, 10. Hizkia prayeth unto the Lord for help, 14. which Isaia promiseth him the second time, 20. the same night is the camp of the Assyrians smitten by the Angel of God,and Sanherib being come to Ninive, is murdered by his own sons, 35.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass when King Hizkia heard (that) then he rent his clothes, [To testify thereby the grief of his heart. So above chap. 18. verse 37.] and covered himself with a sack, [see of this ceremonie, Gen. 37 on verse 34.] and went into the house of the Lord.
\p
\v 2 then he sent Eliakim the steward, [Heb, who was over the house. See above chap. 18. on verse 8.] and Sebna the Scribe, [see above chap. 12 on verse 10.] and the eldest of the priests covered with sacks, to Isaia the prophet, [whose prophetical book is the first among the books of the great prophets] the son of Amoz. [see Isaia 1.1.]
\p
\v 3 And they said unto him, thus saith hizkia; this day is a day of distress and of reviling, and of blasphemy, [To wit, which is come upon us by reason of our enemies, who revile and threaten me and my people, and blespheme the living God] for the children are come to birth, and there is no strength to bring forth. [it is a comparison wherein the King compareth himself to a traveling woman, his people to the fruit of the womb, and the present strait to the pang and peril, wherein a woman is with her fruit, having no strength to bring forth the same into the world, when she is upon the very point and time of her delivery. Compare Hos. 13.13. intimating hereby that they were in the extremest danger, and without any power at all, to save themselves.]
\p
\v 4 It may be the LORD thy God will hear [that is, take into consideration. The word peradventure, or it may be, is not here a word of doubting but of good hope. Compare Num. 23.3 and Jos. 14.12, &c.] all the words of Robsake, whom his Lord the king of Assyria hath sent to reproach the living God, and to revile (him) with words, which the Lord thy God, hath heard. [Oth. And will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard] lift then up a prayer for the remnant that is found. [That is, which is present, and at hand, and in being. And understand by this remnant the tribe of Juda, which had kept the right worship of God and were not yet driven out of their land.]
\p
\v 5 And the servants of King Hizkia came to Isaia.
\p
\v 6 And Isaia said unto them: thus shall ye say unto your Lord, thus saith the LORD; be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, wherewith the servants [Heb. Young men, i.e. servants, or officers in number three, named above 18. v. 17. of the Hebrew word see Gen. 22. on v. 5.] of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
\p
\v 7 Behold, I will give a spirit [i.e. will purpose, zeal, inclination, motion. Thus the word spirit is taken sometimes in a good sence. 2 Chron. 36.22. Ezek. 1.1. Hag. 1.14 and sometimes in a bad, Judges 8.3. job 15.13. Prov. 16.32 and 25.28. Others take the word spirit for blast, wind, sound, noise] into him, (so) that he shall hear a romour [namely of Tithaka King of curse, that should come forth to fight against him. See below v. 9.] and return into his (own) land: and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his (own) land.
\p
\v 8 So Rabsake returned, and sound the King of Assyria fighting against Libna; [A city in the tribe of Juda: of which see jos. 190.20 and 15.42 and 21.23.] for he heard that he had departed from Lachis
\p
\v 9 Now when he [Namely, the king of Assyria] heard say of Turbaka king cursh, [i.e. of the Arabians, or of the Moors. See num. 12. on v. 1.] Behold he is come forth ot fight against thee; he sent messenger again [Heb, he returned and sent; that is he sent again. See num. 11 on v.4.] unto Hizkia, saying;
\p
\v 10 Thus shall speak to Hizkia the king of Juda, saying, let not thy God, on whom thou trustest, deceive thee saying: Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria
\p
\v 11 Behold, thou hast heard what the king of Assyria have done to all lands, banningthem; [see Deut. 2 on verse 34.] and shouldest thou be delivered? [i.e. thou shalt in no wife be delivered. It is a manner of questioning which dnieth very strongly. See gen. 18 on v.17.]
\p
\v 12 Have the Gods of the Nations, which my fathers have destroyed and delivered them? (as) gozan, [ see above chap. 17.6 and the annotate.] and Horam, [a city of Mesopotamia. See Gen. 11 on v. 31.] and reseph, [Hebr. Retseph, lying in Mesopotamia] and the children of Eden [this was a countrey lying in chaldea or Babylonia. See thereof gen. 2 on verse 8. Ezek. 27.23.] which were in Telasser. [the name (as some conceive) of a fort lying in the midst of the Euphrates. Others hold it to be a countrey.]
\p
\v 13 Where is the king of Hamath, ad the king of Arpad and the king of the city of Sepharvam, of Hena and Juva? [see above chap. 18. on v.34.]
\p
\v 14 Now when Hizkia had received the Letters of the hand of the messengers, and read them, he went up into the house of the Lord, [i.e. the temple] and spread them out before the face of the Lord. [i.e. in the court, over against the Atk of the covenant, which was in the holy of Holies, for a token of Gods present habitation there. See Lev. 1 on v. 3 and 9. on v. 24.]]
\p
\v 15 And Hizkia prayed before the face of the lord, and said, o lord god of Israel, which dweltest [or sittest] between the Cherubims, [understand the two Cherubims, which stood at both ends of the explanation-cover of the Ark. Exod. 25.18. this appellation of God is Likewise used, 1 Sam. 4.4. See Num. 7.89. with the annotate.] thou thy felt, thou alone art the God of all the Kingdomes of the Earth, thou hast made heaven and earth.
\p
\v 16 O Lord, incline thine ear and hear open LORD, thine eyes and see and hear the words of Sanherib, which hath sent this (man), [Namely, Rabsake. See above chap. 18.17.] to reproach the living God.
\p
\v 17 of a truth, LORd, the king of Assyria have wasted those heathens, and their land:
\p
\v 18 And have cast [Heb. Given] their Gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hand, wood, and stone, therefore they have destroyed them.
\p
\v 19 Now then, 9O) Lord our God, deliver us I pray out of his hand: so all the Kingdome of the earth shall know, that thou, Lord art God alone.
\p
\v 20 then Isaia the son of Amoz sent to Hizkia, saying; Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: that which thou hast prayed tome against Sanherib king of Assyria, I have heard.
\p
\v 21 This is the word which the Lord hath spoken concerning him; [Understand the thing which the Lord had revealed to the prophet Isaia, touching the King of Assyria] the virgin, [Understand the state, or Kingdome of the Jewish people, or of the city of Jerusalem, which is conceived to be so called, because it had not yet been quite overpowered, and taken by any] the daughter of Zion [as the word daughter: being put after the name of the city, signifieth the villages and small towns resorting under it, numb. 21. v.25. Judges 1.27. so the word daughter of Jerusalem shaketh the head at thee. [to shake the head at a man, is to despise and scorn him, Job 16.4. Psalms 22.8 and 44.15. Isaia 37.22. Jer. 18.16. lam.2.15.]
\p
\v 22 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? And against whom hast thou exalted (thy) voice and lift up thine eyes on high? Against the holy one of Israel. [Oth. Yeah thou hast lift up thine eyes against the holy one of Israel. God is called the holy one of Israel, not only because he is holy, yea holiness itself, but also because he fetteth apart a people for himself, which he halloweth by the blood and spirit of Christ. See of this appellation also Isaia 5.24. jer. 51.5.]
\p
\v 23 By the means [Heb, by the hand] of thy messengers, [namely, Tartan, rabsaris and Rabsake, above chap. 18.17.] thou hast reproached the Lord and said: with the multitude of my charets I am come up to the heights of the mountains, to the sides of libanon; [see of this mountain, 1 Kings 4 on v. 33.] and I will cut down the tall Cedar-trees thereof, and the choice fir-trees thereof, [Heb. The height of the cedar-trees thereof, and the choice of the Fir-trees thereof. Some understand hereby the fair and strong cities of Juda, which the king of Assyria had taken. Above chap. 18.13.] And will enter into his uttermost inne, [Heb. The inne of his end, of his end, or extremely, utmost part. Understand all the places of Juda, in what utmost ends or corners soever they lie. The meaning is, that the king of Assyra had an intent to leave no place free and unmolested, but to over-run, take, waste and destroy the whole land]into the forest of his fair field. [oth. Of his carmel. The name of a pleasant and fruitful mountain, lying in the tribe of Issafchar, of which see 1 Kings 18 on verse 19. The word seemeth to be taken here, for a fair pleasant and fruitful place. So Isaia. 10.18. Jer. 2.7 and 4.26.]
\p
\v 24 I have digged and have drunk strange waters; [i.e. new waters, never before found, or known. The meaning is, although dry and waterless countreys and that they have sought by all means possible to stop all passages of water from me, that so I might be constrained to remove out of this land, 2 chron.32.3,4. yet by my wisdome and power I have gotten water enough, even in places, where there was none before] and with the soles of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places. [Heb. Rivers or brooks of siege. Intimating that he could not only furnish his host with water, but also deprive his enemies, whom he besieged, of it and that by reason of the great multitude of souldiers that followed him.]
\p
\v 25 Hast thou not heard that I have done that long ago? And have formed that of ancient daies? [Heb. Of daies of antiquity] now I have made that come to pass; that thou shouldest be to disturb fenced cities into waste heaps, [hither to be rehearsed the words of the king of Assyria: Now here follow again the words of God, which he speaketh to the King. As if he should say, thou hast no cause to boast of thy victories, for they are my work, to punish the nations by laying their cities and countries wast.]
\p
\v 26 Therefore their inhabitants were handless, [heb. Short of hand, or short-handed; that is, of small strength, of weak power. So Isaia. 37.27.] they were dismayed, and confounded: [the meaning is, a victory cometh from God, So doth fear, dismayedness and weakness, whereby men are overcome, proceed from him also] they were (as) this grass of the field and (as) the green grass-plants, [Heb. The greenness of the little grass or little herb. Oth. The pot herb of the small herb: that is, the small pot herb] (as) the hay of the house-tops and (as) blasted corn, before it standeth upright.
\p
\v 27 But I know thy sitting, and thy going out and thy coming in: [that is, all thy purpose, counsel, devices, attempts and practice. Compare herewith Deut. 31. the annotate. On verse 2.] and thy rage against me.
\p
\v 28 because of thy rage against me, and for that thy tumult to come up before mine cars therefore I will put my book into thy nose. [This is a similitude taken from those that have to do with fierce and cruel beasts: thereby to express the power of god, which he useth to restrain the malice of cruel and raging tyrants] and my bridle into thy lips, [i.e. into thy lips, [i.e. into thy mouth. Another comparison taken from those that have a wild horse to rule] and I will cause thee to turn back by that way, by which thou camest.
\p
\v 29 And let that be a token unto thee,[this is spoken to king Hizkia, to assure him and his people that thy should be delivered from the violence and the fury of the King of Assyria] that they shall eat this year that which grew of itself; [the Hebrew word signifieth the which grew of itself (after the harvest is ended) out of the feeds that are fallen out without the labor or help of man] and in the second year, that which again sprouteth forth from the same; [the token was, that they should not only in the first years, when the land was over-run by the Assyrians, but also in the next after that find sufficient store of victual sprung up of itself in the field. See further, Isaia 37. On verse 30] but in the third year sow, and reap and plant vineyards and eat the fruits thereof.
\p
\v 30 For the escaped [Heb. The escaping. That is, those that shall have escaped. So in the following verse] that is left remaining in the house of Juda, shall again take root [Heb. Shall adde root] downward and shall bear fruit [Heb. Make fruit. The Hebrew word Peri signifieth not only the fruits, but also the branches that hear the fruits, so Lev. 23.40. see the annotate.] Upward. [A multitude taken from plants: whereby is signified, that those of Juda should have very great success and prosperity.]
\p
\v 31 For out of Jerusalem shall the remnant go forth. [The remnant, to wit which shall escape the hands of enemies , having been kept and secured in the city of the Assyrians] and they escaped out of Mount Zion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this. [that is, the servant love of God towards his people and his fierce wrath towards his enemies shall produce this deliverance. Compare Isaia 9.7]
\p
\v 32 Therefore saith the Lord concerning the King of Assyria, he shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow into it? Neither shall he come before t (with) a shield, nor shall cast up a bank against it.
\p
\v 33 By the way that he came by the same shall he return; but he shall not come ino this city, saith the LORD.
\p
\v 34 For I will protect the city, to save it, for mine own sake, [That is, that my name will be acknowledge, praised, honoured and feared. Compare prov. 16.4 Isaia. 48.9, 11. Ezek. 36.21,22,23.] and for my servant David’s sake. [see 1 kings 11. on verse 12.]
\p
\v 35 It came to pass then in that same night, that the Angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of Assyria [understand Sanheribs camp, that lay before Libna, (or according to the opinion of some, was upon the march towards Jerusalem,) above verse 8, where Rabsake returned to him,without besieging Jerusalem as god had promised, ver. 32. compare Isaia 37 on vers. 33.36.] an hundred, four score and five thousand: and when they [to wit, the King of Assyria and his counselours] got them up early in the morning, behold, they were all dead bodied. [to wit, which were smitten by the angel.]
\p
\v 36 So Sanherib King of Assyria departed, and went his way, and returned, and he abode at Ninive. [see Gen. 10 on v. 11,12.]
\p
\v 37 Now it came to pass, as he bowed himself down [to wit, to worship the idol, mentioned in the next words and to honor him with religious worship] in the hose of Nisroch [the name of an idol of the Ninivites] his God, that Adramelech and Sarazer (his sons) smote him with the sword; [as was foretold above v. 7.] but they escaped into the land of Ararat: [see gen. 8. on verse 4.] and Esar Haddon became King in his stead. [this Esar Haddon reigned (as some write) ten years in Nineve. After him the Monarchie was translated from the Assyrians to the Babylonians.]
\c 20
\s Hizkia being sick, is threatned of God by Isaia with death, verse 1, &c but having prayed to the Lord hath fifteen years more added to his alife, 2 of which he is assured by a miracle, 8. Beodach Baladan visiteth hizkia by Ambassadours, who Isaia foretelleth him the Babylonish captivity. 14. He dieth and mansseh becameth King, 20.
\p
\v 1 In those dayes [to wit, after that the host of the Assyrians was smitten and Juda deliverd from them: which is conceived to have been in the fourteenth year of Hizkia’s reign] hizkia was sick unto death: and the prophet Isaia the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him; thus saith the Lord: give command to thine house; [i.e. take order concerning thy last will, for the disposing of thine state, as thou wilt have the same to go after thy decade. That is as much, as make thy last will and testament, so 2 Sam. 17.23. Isaia 38.1.] for thoushalt dye. [Heb. Thou art dead, or dying; that is, thou shalt die straightway. See Genesis 20 on v. 2. understand this threatening with a concealed condition, if he humbled not himself, and prayed unto God for mercy. Compare Jon. 3.4,10.]
\p
\v 2 Then he turned his face about, towards the wall; [to wit, that having turned away his eyes from men he might the better turn his mind to God, to pray earnestly and servently] and he prayed unto the Lord, saying;
\p
\v 3 Oh Lord, remember, I pray that I have walked before thy face in truth, [Or, in faithfulness, faithfully] and with a perfect heart, [see 1 Kings 8 on v. 61.] and have done that which is Gooding thine eyes: And Hizkia wept very sore. [Heb. Wept a great weeping or with a great weeping. He wept not so much through fear of death as because he was troubled to think what would become of God’s people, the pure worship of God, and the state of the kingdome after his death.]
\p
\v 4 Now it came to pass when Isaia was not (yet) gone out of the middle court, [To wit, of the king’s house: which court is called the second court, 1 Kings 7.8 oth. Out of the middle city, that is, out of the middle part of the city, which was between the fort and utmost part of the city. It’s conceived that the city of Jerusalem consisted of thre parts; first the city of David on Mont Zion, where the royal fort was. Secondly, the middle part of the city, thirdly, the remaining and utmost part thereof. Compare below chaper 22.14. 2 chron. 34.22. Zeph.1.10.] that the word of the Lord came to him, saying;
\p
\v 5 Turn again,and tell Hizka the leader of my people, thus saith the Lord, the God of David thy father; I have heard thy prayer, I have see thy tears; behold I will heal thee; on the third day thou shalt go up into the house of the Lord.
\p
\v 6 And I will adde fifteen years unto thy dayes, [understand this in respect to the nature of the sickness which was mingled with death and not in respect of God’s purpose who had determined by the almighty fifteen years longer] and will deliver thee out of the hand of the King of Assyria; [to wit, by hindering the Assyrians from re-assuring the war] together with this city and I will defend this city for mine own sake, [ see above chap. 19 on v. 34.] and for my servant David’s sake. [see 1 Kings 11 on v. 12.]
\p
\v 7 Then said Isaia; take a lump of figs; and they took it and they laid it on the sore, and he was healed. [Heb. Lived so above chapter 8 on v. 8 that is, he recovered, not so much by the natural virtue of the figs (which indeed are a conducible means thereunto) as chiefly by the special and super-natural power and blessing of the almighty.]
\p
\v 8 Now hizkia said into Isaia, which is token that the Lord will heal me and that I shall go up into the house of the Lord in the third day? [he spake this not out of unbelief, as the scribes and Pharises defied a token, Math. 12.38. but of an upright inclination or affection to strengthen his faith, because this promise of life did directly to oppose and contradict the former threatening of death. Compare Judges 6.17.]
\p
\v 9 And Isaia said, this shall be a token unto thee from the Lord, that the Lord will do the thing that he hath spoken; shall the shadow [which is made by the shinning of the sun on the dyal, which is on the out-side of the clock] go forward [i.e. speedily and as it were in a moment, in an extraordinary manner, toward the west] ten degrees? [Heb. Ascensions, steps. Understand the marks or stroaks, or lines in the clock by which the hours were distinguished and pourtraied on the daill. This was a wonderful work of God. Concerning the degrees or lines, whether they signify half or whole hours and the like circumstance more, thereof are divers opinions.] or return backward [i.e. toward the east] ten degrees? [or the shadow is gone forward ten degrees, shall it go back ten degrees.]
\p
\v 10 Then saith Jezhizkia; it is a light thing [as more agreeing with the ordinary course of the fun, although also miraculous] for the shadow to go down ten degrees: Nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.
\p
\v 11 And Isaia the prophet called on the Lord; and he caused the shadow to return backward ten degrees, in the degrees, which it had gone downward, in the degrees (of the-fun dial) of Achaz. [I.e. in the fun-dial, which Achaz his father had caused to be made.]
\p
\v 12 And that time berdach Baladan [The King of Babylon, called also Merodach, Isaia 39.1 and in prophane histories] the son of baladan, the king of Babel, sent letters and a present to Hizkia: [viz to congratulate Hizkia in regard of his recovery and to inquire of the miracle that happened in the fun, Isaia 38.8 and was also taken notice of in Chaldea, 2 chron. 32.31.]] for he had heard that Hizkia had been sick,
\p
\v 13 And Hizkia hearkened [To wit, with joy. See Isaia 39.2] unto them, [understand the messgengers or Lords that had brought the fore-mentioned letters and present. To these did hizkia carefully listen, concerning that which was presented to him, or inquired of him] and he shew them all his treasury, [or spice-house. Understand an house, wherein all manner of pleasant drugs and spices, and costly wares were laid up] the silver and the gold and the spices and the best oil and his armory [Heb. An house of vessels or instruments. Understand weapons, or silver and gold jewels and all manner of precious furniture and Jewels] and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that he shewed him not.
\p
\v 14 then came the prophet Isaia unto King Hizkia and said unto him what said those men and from whence they unto thee? And Hizkia said; they are come from a far countrey from Babel.
\p
\v 15 And he said; what have they seen in thy house? And Hizkia said; they have seen all that is in mine house, there is nothing in my house, there is nothing in my treasures, that I have not shewed them.
\p
\v 16 Then said Isaia to Hizkia; heard the word of the Lord, [To wit, which the Lord in his due time will make good, because thou hast prided thy self in the lofty shewing of thy treasures and riches.]
\p
\v 17 Behold, the dayes come, that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up (in store) unto this day, shall be carried away to Babel; [see the accomplishment hereof below chap. 24.13 and 25.13. Jer.52.17.] there shall be nothing left saith the Lord.
\p
\v 18 Before they shall take thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beger, to be courtiers [i.e court-ministers, or court-servants. See gen. 37 on verse 36.] in the place of the King of Babel. [see the accomplishment hereof below chapters 24 and 25.]
\p
\v 19 but Hizkia said unto Isaia, the word of the Lord, which thou hast spoken, is good: he said also; should it not? [To wit, be good? Or is it not (so)? See the like phrase, 1 Sam 10.1. that is called here good, which is called righteous and gracious, righteous, because he and the land had deserved judgement; gracious, because God was still bountiful to him and his people though unworthy] seeing peace and truth shall be in my daies.
\p
\v 20 Now the rest of the acts of hizkia and all his might and how he made the pool. [see of this pool above chap. 18.17. neh.3.16.] and the conduit and brought water into the city, [to wit, to cut if off from the enemy. See 2 Chron.32.3,4,30.] are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Juda?
\p
\v 21 And Hizkia fell asleep with his father: and Menasseh his son became in his stead.
\c 21
\s Manasseh is an abominable idolater, verse 1. 1 &c. wherefore most grievious judgements are threatened, 10. Manasseh Sheddeh also much innocent blood, and dyeth. 16. Amon his son succeedeth in his room, and folleweth his fathers footsteps, 19. he is slain by his servants, 23. josias his son becometh king, 26.
\p
\v 1 Manasseh was twelve year, old [Heb. A son of twelve years] when he became king, and reigned five and fifty years at Jerusalem, [comprehend herein the time, in which he was prisoner at Bethel, 2 chron. 33.11] and his mothers name was Zephzi-Ba. [Hebr. Chephisi-Ba.]
\p
\v 2 And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord, [see, 2 Kings 11. on verse 6.] after the abominations of the heather, which the Lord had driven out of possession before the face of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 3 For he built up again, [Heb. He returned and built, that is, he built again. [see Numb.11 on verse 4.] the high places [see Lev. 26 on verse 30] which Hizkia his father had destroyed and he reared up altars for Baal; [see Judges 2 on verse 11.] and made a groove, [see of the Idolatious grooves, Deut. Chap.7.on v.5. which God had expressly forbidden to be made. Deut. 16.21.] according as Achab king of Israel had made; [see 1 kings 16. v.31,32,33.] and bowed himself down before all the host of heaven, [understand the fun and moon with the rest of the planets and stars. See Deut.4.v.19. and the annotate.] and served them.
\p
\v 4 And he built altars in the house of the Lord, [see Jer.32.34] of which the Lord had said; at Jerusalem will I put my name. [Understand the name of the Lord only, and not likewise the names of Idols. See the meaning of these words 1 kings 8. on v.29. see also Deut.12.5,11]
\p
\v 5 Moreover, he built altars for all the host of heaven in both the courts of the house of the Lord. [Whereof the first, or inner court was the priest’s court, standing next to the temple; the other the people’s court, without joining to the first. See of both 1 Kings 6 on v.36.]
\p
\v 6 Yea, he made his son pass thorow the fire; [to wit in the valley of the son of Hinnom, 2 chron.22.6 to the honor of the idol Molech. See Lev.18. on verse 21.] and practiced juggling; [see of the signification of the Hebrew word, Lev.19 on verse 26.] and gave heed to the crying of birds; [see of the signification of the Hebrew word, Lev.19. on verse26.] and he appointed sooth-sayers and Necromancers, [Heb. He made, see of the Hebrew word sooth-sayers and the next following, lev19 on v.31. these Manasseh is said to have made, because he publicly ordained and appoint-pointed them, that thy might be ready to wait and attend upon all men with their devilish arts] he did very much evil in the eyes of the Lord, to provoke (him) [this word is here inserted out of 2 Chron.33.6.] to anger.
\p
\v 7 he set also a carved images of the grove, [Or, the carved image, pointing at a certain image of the idolatrous grove] which he had made [see above v3. in the house of which the LORD had said to David and to Solomon his son; I his house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, [i.e. out of all places and cities, that are inhabited by the tribes] will I put my name [see above on verse 4.] for ever [That is, during the time of the law. See Gen.13 on v.15.]
\p
\v 8 Neither will I proceed to remove the foot of Israel out of this land, which I gave their fathers; [or as it is said 2 Chron.33.8. to make them remove or to take them away, that is, to make the Israelites remove, wander and shift up and down out of this land: as befell the ten tribes, above chapter 18.11.] only if they observer what to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law, understand the moral ceremonial and judicial lawes. See 2 chron.33 the annotate on verse 8.] Which my servant Moseh commanded them.
\p
\v 9 But they hearkened not: for Manasseh made them to erre, (so) that they did worse then the heathen, [to wit, because they most treacherously rejected the light of the true knowledge of God, and the prescript or platform of pure religion, which the heathen had not, and exceeded the heathen in the abomination of the idolatry, who served not many strange idols, containing themselves for the most part with their own. Th. Doing worse; which may also be understood of king Manasseh, as below v.11.] which the Lord had destroyed before the face of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 10 then the Lord spake by the ministry [Heb. Hand] of his servants the prophets, saying,
\p
\v 11 Because Manasseh king of Juda hath done these abominations, doing worse then all that the Amorites [under the name of this one nation are often all infidels and heathenish nations of the land of Canaan comprehended. See Gen. 15 on verse 16.] did which were before him, yea hath made Juda also to sin with his dung-Gods: [see Lev.26 on verse 30.]
\p
\v 12 Therefore, thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: behold, I bring an evil upon Jerusalem and Juda, that every one that beareth it, both his cars shall tingle. [understand such an evil that shall cause so great astonishment, fear and terror in all men’s hearts, that their senses shall be amazed and distracted as a man’s hearing is wont to be deafened by an excessive loud sound and a vehement noise made just before or against his ear. See the same comparison, 1 Sam. 8.11. Jer.19.3.]
\p
\v 13 And I will draw the measuring-line of Samaria over Jerusalem, [By the measuring –line, here is meant the measure, or rule; that is the quality and likeness of the judgment. The meaning is, such a judgment as I brought upon the ten tribes, and their chief city Samaria, will bring upon Juda and Jerusalem, that the land shall be laid wast, the city taken, and the inhabitants carried away captive. ‘tis a comparison taken from carpenters and Masons or bricklayers who both rear and raise their work by line and measure. Compare Isaia. 34.11. Amos 7v7,8. Zach.1.16.] and the plummet of the house of Achah, [the former similitude is still retained, to shew that the like judgment should befall Jerusalem, as befell Achab’s house] and I will wipe Jerusalem, as they wipe a dish; they wipe it, and turn it upside down upon it’s hallowness. [Or, rands,brims. Heb. Upon its face. The meaning is, as dishes are employed for a clean use, are washed and scoured from all filth, and after that turned upside down that no unclean thing may fall into them: so shall Jerusalem by transportation be purged from wicked inhabitants, and the government thereof turned upside down, that the uppermost part shall lie under.]
\p
\v 14 And I will forsake the remnant of the inheritance, [understand the tribe of Juda, or the Jews, who alone, which those that sided with them, were left of the Israelites, bearing the name of the people of god. God calleth this tribe his inheritance, because they were as dear unto him, as an inheritance is to a man] and will deliver them into the hand of their enemies: and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies:
\p
\v 15 because they did that which was evil in mine eyes, and provoked me to anger from that day, that their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.
\p
\v 16 Besides, Manasseh shed also very much innocent blood, [to wit, of those that would not follow his abominations] till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; [Heb. Mouth to mouth. See above chap.10 on v.21] beside his sin, [understand idolatry, which by the way of special eminency is called sin, because it directly opposeth and crosseth the Majesty of God, is in the highest degree hated and forbidden, and left unpunished by him, se e 1 kings 11 on v.6 and 12 on v.30.] which he made Juda to sin doing that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord.
\p
\v 17 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did and his sin, [understand especially his idolatry against God, and his tyranny against men] which he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? [Understand herewith his captivity, repentance and conversion, and actions that followed thereon, of which see also, 2 chron. 33.11, 12]
\p
\v 18 And Manasseh fell asleep which his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his (own) house, in the garden of Uzza: And Amon his son became King in his stead.
\p
\v 19 Amon was two and twenty years old, [Heb. A son of two and twenty years] when he became King, and he reigned two years at Jerusalem: And his mothers name was Messullement, a daughter of Haruz of Jotha, [some are of opinion that this was Jotbath, where the Israelites had a camping place, when they journeyed from Egypt thorow the wilderness towards the land of Canaan, Num. 33.33. Deut.30.7.]
\p
\v 20 And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord; Acording as Manasseh his father had done.
\p
\v 21 for he walked in all the way [to wit, the evil way of Idolatry, unbelief and manifold wicked practices. See 1 kings 15 on v. 26.] which his father had walked and he served the dung-Gods, which his father had served and he bowed himself down before them.
\p
\v 22 So he forsook the Lord god of his father; and he walked not in the way of the LORD. [see 1 King 11on verse 33.]
\p
\v 23 And the servants of Amon made a conspiracy against him: and they slew the king in his own house.
\p
\v 24 But the people of the land smote all that had made the conspiracy against king Amon: and the people of the land Josia his son king in his stead.
\p
\v 25 Now the rest of the acts of Amon, which he did; are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Juda.
\p
\v 26 And they buried him in his Sepulchre, in the garden of Uzza; And Josia his son became king in his stead.
\c 22
\s Josia his pius government, v1. he tooketh care for the repairing of the Temple, 3. the book of the law is found by Hilkia in the templ, and delivered into the king’s hand by Saphan, 8. the king having understood, what God therein threateneth to back-sliders, asketh counsel of the Lord by Hulda the prophetess, 11. the prophetess returneth an answer, 15.
\p
\v 1 Josia was eight years old, when he became king and reigned one and thirty years at Jerusalem: his mother’s name was jedida, a daughter of Adaia, of Bozkath. [the name of a city lying in the tribe of Juda, Jos.15.39.]
\p
\v 2 And he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, [see 1 Kings 11 on v.33] and he walked in all the way of David his father, [see 1 Kings 15 on verse 32.] and turned not to the right hand, nor to the left [see Deut. 5 on v. 32.]
\p
\v 3 Now it came to pass in the eighteeneth year of his reign, nor of his age, 2 chronicles 34.8. as for his age he was now 26 years old: Now what being King did in the former years of his life see. Chron. 34.3,4] that the king sent Saphan the son of Azalia, the son of Messullam the scribe [i.e. the king’s secretary or Clerk. See above chap. 12 n v. 10.] into the house of the LORD saying;
\p
\v 4 group to Hilkia the priest, [Heb. The great priest so also below v. 8.] that he may sum the mony which is brought intothe house of the LORD: [Heb. That he may sinith the the money. Oth. May take up the sum of the money, or the gathering of the money, or lay it out to the full. The meaning is, that he should take up the full sum of the money gathered by the collector’s and lay it out towards the repairing and building of the Temple again. Compare above chap. 12v.5,9,10,11.] watch the keepers [these were Levites. See above chap.12.v.9.10. 2 Chron.8.14 and 34.9.] of the threshold [to wit, of the house of the Lord, or the Lord, or of the Temple. Oth. Of the vessels] have gathered of the people.
\p
\v 5 And let them deliver it unto the hand of the overseers the work, [These were the Levites as appeareth, 2 Chron.34.12.] who are the appointed over the house of the Lord; that they may give it to those that do the work, [indeed in the Hebrew there is the same word, which immediately before in this verse was translated overseers; and had the oversight of the whole work of reparation; but here it signifieth those that did the work itself, or labored in it, as appeareth by the following verse, where these workmen or laborers are distinctly expressed] which is in which is in the house of the Lord] to repair the breaches of the house.
\p
\v 6 To the carpenters and the builders and to the masons; [see above chap.12.on v.12.] and to buy wood, and hewed stones, [i.e. which were hewed and squared by the masons and stone-cutters, for the work of building. Compare 2 Chron.34.11.] to repair the house.
\p
\v 7 how heit there was no account kept of the mony that was delivered into their hands, [to wit, of the bestowing and laying out of the mony] for they dealt faithfully. [heb. In truth or faithfulness. So above chap.12.15. see the annotate.]
\p
\v 8 Then Hilkia the high Priest said unto Saphan the Scribe; I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD; meaning the original book of the law, which Moseh himself had written,a nd was laid on the side of the Ark of the covenant. See Deut. 31.24, 26] and hilkia gave the book to Saphan, who read it.
\p
\v 9 Then came Saphan the scribe unto the king and brought the king word again and he said, thy servants [namely, Hilkia and I] have gathered [Heb. Cast] the money that was found in the house, [namely, of the Lord, that is, in the temple] and have delivered it in to the hand of the overseers of the work, who were appointed over the house of the Lord.
\p
\v 10 Also Saphan the scribe told the king saying; hilkia the priest hath given me a book: [viz, the book of the law: whereof mention is made above v.8 and below v.11.] an Saphan read that before the face of the king.
\p
\v 11 Now it came to pass when the king heard the word of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes [as an evidence and witness, both of his grief and sorrow for the sins of the whole land, committed against the law of god and of the fear of the judgments, that were threatened in the book of the law. See of the renting garments in sad and sorrowful cases, Gen.37 in the annotate. On v.29.]
\p
\v 12 And the king commanded Hilkia the priest and Ahikam the son of Saphan and Achbor [otherwise called Abdon, 2 Chron.34.v.20.] the son of Michala, and Saphan the scribe, and Asala the king’s servant, [who above and before all others waited upon him and was ever read at hand in all weighty matters and such aw were of special concernment. So Matth.8.9.] saying;
\p
\v 13 go, enquire of the Lord for me and for the people and for all Juda concerning the words of this book, that is found; for the wrath of the Lord is great, which is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened to the words of this book, to do according to all that is written for us. [i.e for our instruction and abomination.]
\p
\v 14 Then went Hilkia the priest and Ahikam and Achbor and Saphan and Asaia unto hulda the prophetess, the wife of Sallum, the son of Tikva, the son harhus [otherwise, thokath, the son of Hasra, 2 Chron.34.22] keeper of the wardrobe; [understand the keeper of the holy garments, which were used in the service of god] (now she dwelt at Jerusalem in the second part) [to wit, of the city. See above chap. 20 on v.4.some understand this place of a college, or house of teaching, in which the prophets and their disciples or scholars did meet, to discourse of god’s word] and thy spake unto her.
\p
\v 15 And she said unto them; thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Tell the man that sent you to me.
\p
\v 16 Thus saith the Lord, behold, I will bring evil [to wit, evil of punishment. See Gen.19oon v.19.] over this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof; (namely,) all the words of the book, which the king of Juda hath read.
\p
\v 17 Because they have forsaken me, and burnt incense to other Gods, [see gen.35on v.2.] to provoke me to anger, with all the work of their hands, [meaning the idols and images, that are so called by way of contempt, Deut.31.29. Psal.115.4 and 135.15. Isa.28. Jerem.1.16. mich5.13.] therefore shall my wrath be kindled against this place, and not be quenched.
\p
\v 18 but to the king of Juda, that hath sent to enquire of the Lord, thus shall ye say unto him: thus saith the Lord the God of Israel; as toucjing the words which thou hast heard: [to wit, which he had heard read out of the book of the law by Saphan the scribe, above v.10. containing most grievous threatening, which God therein had denounced against the transgressors of the law, and breakers of his convenant.]
\p
\v 19 Because thine heart waxed weak,a nd thou didst hamble thy self before the face of the Lord, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and the inhabitants thereof: that they shall become a desolation, and (a) curse, and thou hast rent thy clothes and wept before my face; therefore I have also heard thee; saith the Lord.
\p
\v 20 Therefore behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, [see gen.25on v.8.] and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave [Heb. Graves. So 2 Chron.16.14 and 35.24. that is, in one of thy graves. So it is left uncertain, which of his graves this grave was. Compare Judges 12.6.] in peace, [understand this in respect of the general calamities, that should come upon the whole kingdome by the Chaldeans, which Josia lived not to see] and thine eyes shall all the evil which I will bring upon this place; and they [to wit, the men sent out by Josia, and named above verse 14.] brought the king answer again.
\c 23
\s Josia causeth the book of the law to be read,a nd reneweth the covenant with the Lord. V.1. Purgeth the temple and destroyeth all idolatry, 4. breaketh down the altar at Bethel and burneth therein the bones of men,15. he keepeth the Passover, 21. A relation of certain other evidences of this piety, 24, although God’s wrath against Pharoah Necho, is wounded and dieth, 29 Joahaz his son becometh king, 31 Whom Pharoa Necho deposeth and maketh Eliakim king in his room, whom he callet Jojoakim, 33 his government, 35.
\p
\v 1 Ten the king sent [to wit, messengers, to whom he gave charge to summon the eldest together] and to him were gathered all the eldest of Juda and Jerusalem. [Understand those who in government both of church and common-wealth were seated above others. See Exod.3. on v.16 and Lev.4 on v.15.]
\p
\v 2 And the king went up into the house of the Lord, and with all the men’s of Juda, [Understand the chiefest] and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the priests, and the prophets, [some understand by these, Jeremy. Zephania and Uria, who lived at this time. Others, the disciples or scholars of the prophets or the scribes, and such as well skilled and in the law of God] and all the people, from the least, to the greatest; and he read before their ears all the words of the book of the covenant, which was found in the house of the Lord. [see above chap. 22.8.]
\p
\v 3 Now the king stood by the pillar, [see above chapter 11 on v.14.] and made a covenant before the face of the Lord, [i.e. in the people’s court, which was before the court of the priests, in the fore-part of the temple of the Lord, wherein the ark of the covenant was, upon which the Lord manifested himself, see Lev.1. on v.3.] to walk after the Lord, [that is, to walk in th wayes of the Lord. What this is, see 1 kings 11 on v.33. and the words here following] and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes with all (their0 hear, and with all their soul, [see Deut.6. on v.5.] confirming the words of this covenant, which are writte in this boo: [see Deut. 27. on v.26.] and all the people stood in this covenant. [i.e. stood close to it, and were contented with it. So we are forbidden to stand in an evil thing, Eccles.8.3. That is, to stick close to it, and to yield unto it.]
\p
\v 4 And the king commanded Hilkia the high priest, and the priests of the second order, [these priests were the chiefest under the high priest] and the keepers of the threshold, [to wit, of the temple of the Lord. So above chap. 22.4. see the annotate.] to bring forth out of the temple all the furniture that were made for Baal, and for the (image) the grove and for all the host of heaven; and he burnt them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kiron, [see 1 Kings 2 on v.37.] and caused the dust thereof to be carries to bethel. [one of the cities where Jerobeam had raised up a golden calf, 1 kings. 12 v.29 and consequently a sink of idolatry; for which cause t is called Bethaven, that is an house of wickedness, hos.4.15 and 18.5 and is most shamefully disgraced by Josia in casting out the ashes of the burnt idolatrous vessels there.]
\p
\v 5 Besides, be put down the Chemarims, [A kind of idolatrous priests of Baal; of whom see also Hos. 10.5. and Zeph.1.4. The name Chemarims is derived from a word signifying to be warn, to burn, also to grow black, also pulled together, rumpled and rolled together, which is caused by burning, whence there is also with the Chaldeans the signification of shutting in. Hence there he divers opinions of the learned concerning this appellation. Many conceive that these priests of baal were so called, because their order was to wear black apparel; some think they were so called, because they were of a blackish or swarty and smoaky countenance being always busied in burning of incense ad offering of sacrifices.] whom the kings of Juda had ordained to burn incense on the high places, in the cities of Juda and round about Jerusalem, together with those that burnt incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon and to (the rest of) the places and to all the host of heaven.
\p
\v 6 He also brought away the (image of the) grove out of the house of the LORD, [which image was set up in the temple by king Manasseh, above chap.21.7] without Jerusalem unto the brook Kidron, [oth. Unto the valley of kidron, v.12. so below in the same verse] and burnt it all at the brook Kidron, and stampt it small to powder and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people. [i.e. of the inhabitants of the land that had idolaters. Compare 2 Chron. 2 Chron.34.4 or of the common people. This he did in detestation of all deceased idolaters, and for an example and admonition to those idolaters that were alive.]
\p
\v 7 moreover, he brake down the houses of the buggers, [see Deut. 23. on v.17.] which were by the house of the Lord; [to wit, in the people’s court, where the idol-ministers (as is conceived) had their abode] were the women wove shrines for the (image of the) grove. [Understand by these shrines, little Chappels, or Cabbimets, and cases made of woven or needle and embroidered work, in which the images of the idols stood. Others understand such kind of tents, wherein idolaters did jointly and with one accord commit their filthy abomination to the honor of their Idols
\p
\v 8 And he brought all the priests, [Namely the idolatrous’ priests] out of the cities of Juda and defiledthe high places, [to wit, by making them unfit and incense from Geba [A city in Benjamin, the North-border of the kingdome of Juda. See 1 kings 15 on verse 22.] to Berseba: [laying in Juda and the south-border of the whole land of Canaan. See Gen.21 on verse 31.] and he brake down the high places of the gate, [i.e. which were at the gates] (also) that which was at the door of the gate of Josua the governor of the city, [i.e. he hindred as well as the idolatry of the great and mighty men, as of the poorer and meaner sort of people] which was at a man’s left hand, (entering) into the gate of the city. [Heb the left hand of a man: namely, of him that came into the gate of the city.]
\p
\v 9 Howbeit the priests of the high places offered not upon the altar of the Lord at Jerusalem: but they did eat unleavened bread in the midst of their brethren. [Or came not up to the altar.] The meaning is that these priests, because they had offered unto idols, were with their posterity deposed from the priesthood, as being unworthy of it, Ezek.44.13. although notwithstanding, because they repented, they had livelihood and maintenance allowed them out of the unleavened cakes, of which none might eat, save the priests onely, Lev.2.4,10 being therein equalized with the blemished posterity of Aaron, Lev.21.17,22.]
\p
\v 10 He also defiled Topheth. [By causing Dung excrements, dead putrified bodies and all manner of filthy to be cast forth there. Topheth was a place near unto the city of Jerusalem, lying in a fair and pleasant field so called from the word Toph, signifying a drum where the idolaters offered up their children to the idol Molech, causing them to pass thorow th fire, or also quite be to burnt and consuming, for which end & purpose they were put into the arms of an image that was made red-hot which was hallow within and full of fire. Now because the children feeling the pain and smart of fire made a doleful and lamentable cry, therefore they made a huge noise with drums and tabret to drown the skreckings and roaring of the children that the same might not be heard by the parents and friends thereof. Compare Lev.1821. Jerem.7.31.] which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom; [the name of a man to whose children this place did formerly belong, so that from thence it was called Ge-Bene-Hinnom; Jos.15.8 that is, the valley of the children hinnom; or Gebinnom, that is, the valley of Hinnom, Neh.11.30. from the most terrible pain of fire, which the children of idolaters there suffered, hell (the place for the damned) hath its denomination being called Gebenna, Matth.5.22. which is an unquenchably fire, Mark 9.43.] that no man might make his son, o his daughter to pass thorow the fire to molech. [Below v.13 caused Milcom. See Lev8.on v21.]
\p
\v 11 And he put down the horse, which the king of Juda had appointed [Or, given] to the sun from entering into the house of the lord,unto the chamber [i.e. to the house] of Nathan-Melith the Courtier, which was parvarim: [or in the suburbs, to wit, of the city of David, not far distant from the temple. Some take the Hebrew word parvarim to be the name of a place near to the temple: but what place it was is uncertain. Concerning the horses mentioned in this verse, some understand it of living horses, which were kept and used to the honor of the sun: for certain men (as some conceive) were appointed every morning with these horses to ride to meet the sun rising from the house of the Lord to the house of Nathan Melech, and to salute and worship it and to perform divine honor unto it. Others understand it onely of the images and pictures of these horses & charets] he burnt the charets of the sun with fire. [i.e. those charets which were made to the honor of the sun after the manner and custome of the heathen.]
\p
\v 12 moreover the altars which were on the roof of the upper chamber of Achaz [Being made there to the honor of the host of heaven. See jer.19.13. Zeph.1.5.] Which Manasseh had made in two courts of the house of the Lord [see above chap. 21.5.] did the king break down: and he ground them from dust thence and cast the dust of them into the brook kidron, [which was done partly to manifest publick detesting of these idolatrous reliques and partly to root them out utterly that nothing thereof at all might be left.]
\p
\v 13 Alsothe high places, that was before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of mashith, [Oth. Of the corrupted. Understand the mount of Olives lying near Jerusalem here called the mount of Mashith, that is, of him that corrupteth, or of the corrupter, because the Jews did there corrupt themselves by idolatry. Oth. It was called the mount ofMischab, that is, of anointing because many olives grew on it, of which the anointing oil was made: so that between both the names there is but small difference in regard of the letters but there is a great difference in regard of their significations. See 1 kings 11.7.] which Salomon the king of Israel had builded for Asthoreth, [this name, with the two following, Camos and Milcom, are names of idolatrous images. See of Asthoreth, judges 2.13.] The abomination of the Zidonians and for Camos. [See I kings 11.on v.7.] The abomination of the Moabites and for Milcom [see lev.18 on verse 21.] the abomination of the children of Ammon did the king defile
\p
\v 14 he likewise broke (in pieces) the reared images, and destroyed the groves: he filled their place with the bones of men. [which he caused to be taken out of the graves of idolaters, to defile therewith the idolaterous places and to make them to be abhorred. Compare below v. 16 and 20. Itera Ezra 6.5]
\p
\v 15 moreover also the altar that was at Bathel, and the high place, which Jerobeam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sinne, had made both that altar and that high place he brake down: ye burnt the high place, he stamp it small to powder and burnt the grove.
\p
\v 16 And as Josia turned himself, he spied that were on the mount and sent, and took the bones out of the Sepuchres and burnt them upon the altar, [to wit, which was reared up at Bethel by Jerobeam, verse 15.] and polluted it, according to the word of the Lord, which the man of god had proclaimed who proclaimed [i.e. foretold: to wit, more then three hundred years before: see 1 kings 13.2 and compare therewith, that which is here related and below v.20] these words. [see 1 kings 13.2.]
\p
\v 17 Moreover he said, what monument is that which I see? And the men of the city said unto him; it is the Sepulchreof the man of god that came from Juda and proclaimed those things, which thou hast done against this altar of Bethel.
\p
\v 18 And he said; let him lie (still) let no man meddle with his bones: s they delivered his bones, [Namely that they were not burnt upon the altar at Bethel, with the other bones] with the bones of the prophet, [who had desired to be buried close by the prophet of Juda, 1 King.13.31.] that was come out of Samari. [Understand not the city but land of Samaria, wherein the city of Bethel lay and this prophet dwelt hen he came to the prophet of Juda, 1 Kings 13.11. so the name Samaria is also taken for the countrey of Samaria in the following verse.]
\p
\v 19 Besides, josia took away all the house of the high places which were in the cities of Samaria, [namely, which were brought under the dominion of the kingdome of Juda] which the Kings of Israel had had to provoke (the Lord) to anger and he did to them according to all the acts which he had done at Bethel.
\p
\v 20 And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altar and burnt men’s bones upon them, [oth offered, &c. that is, put them to death upon the altars, to shew that he not onely hated idolatry in the highest degree, but even the very places where it was practiced, polluting the by shedding men’s blood, and burning their bones upon them. [understand this of the priests, who (according to Jerobeams institution) were made of the lowest of the people, and did obstinately first in their idolatry, see 1 kings 12.31.] after that he returned to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 21 And the king commanded all the people, saying; keep the Passover unto the Lord thy God: [see 2 Chron.35.1.] as it is written in this book of the covenant. [namely, the book of the law: of which see above chapter 22.8 &c. see also Exod. 12.3. Deut. 16.2]
\p
\v 22 for like unto this Passover there was none kept [oth. Surely like unto, &c.] Here a reason is given, shewing that the king command was very well observed] from the dayes of the judges, that had judged Israel, [meaning those that are not counted there. For 2 Chron. 35.18. it’s said, from the dayes’ of Samuel who was the last of the judges] nor in all the dayes of the kings of Israel, nor of the Kings of Juda. [the meaning is, that from the beginning of the government of Kings, who did immediately succeed the Judges, no Passover was ever kept with so great preparation, assembly, purity, reverence, attention and devotion, as this was kept.]
\p
\v 23 But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover was kept unto the Lord at Jerusalem.
\p
\v 24 And Josia did put away the soothsayer, and Necromancers, [see of both these, Lev.19. on verse 31.] and the Teraphim, [see Gen. 31. on v.19.] and the dung-Gods, [see Lev. 26. on ver.30] and all the abominations that were set in the land of Juda, and in Jerusalem: that he might confirm the words of the law that were written in the book, which Hilkia the priest had found in the house of the Lord.
\p
\v 25 And before him there was no king like unto him, [understand this properly in respect of the fervency of his zeal in rooting out all abominations, that bare a great sway in his time; and in respect of the innocence and integrity of his life, in diligent heeding the law of the Lord, as the following words of this verse import. Compare above chapter 18 on v5.] that had turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, [see 1 Kings 2 on v.4.] and with all his might, according to the law of Moseh: and after him there arose not (any) like unto him.
\p
\v 26 Notwithstanding, the Lord turned from the fierce of his great wrath, [Not because the king did not please his God, but because the people did not follow their King, neither in the unfeigned acceptation of his pure worship, nor in the right conversion and amendment of life, as it did soon appear after the kings decease] wherewith his anger burned against Juda, because of all the provocations wherewith Manasseh had provoked him. [to wit. Because they did commit the same, after the example of King Manasseh, following him in his abomination but not in his repentance and conversion.]
\p
\v 27 And the Lord said; I will also remove Juda from my face; [See above chap.17 on v. 18] according as I have removed Israel, [to wit, by carrying them away out of their land, although the same should not be forever as the carrying away of the Israelites was. See above chap. 17.v.18,20 and 18.11 and 21.13. with the annotate.] and I will cast off this city Jerusalem, which I have chosen, and the house, of which I said, my anme shall be there. [see 1 kings 8, on.v.29. and 9.3 item, above chap.21.4.]
\p
\v 28 now the rest of the acts of Josia, and all that he did; are they not written in the books of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
\p
\v 29 In the dayes [to wit, when Josia had finished the reparation of the house of the lord. See 2 chron.35.20.] pharaoh Necho [see of him also below v.33.] king of Egypt marched against the king of Assyria to the river Phrath: [to the city of Charchemis, lying by the Euphrates, which the king of Assyria had taken away the Syrians; of which he boasteth, Isa.10.9.] and king Josia marched forth to meet him. [viz. to turn him away, and to hinder him from passing with his camp thorow his land, fearing left damage should befall his own kingdome or desiring thereby to gratifie and pleasure the king of Assyria] and he shew him at Megisso, [that is the archers of King Necho wounded him mortally: so that he being carried to Jerusalem, died by the way or in Jerusalem, having received his deaths wound at Megiddo, 2 chron. Chap.35.23,24. Megiddoa was a city in the land of Manasseh. See 1 Kings 9 on v. 15.] when he had seen him. [i.e. when Josia was come to look him in the face and sought against him. See above chap.14.8 and the annotate.]
\p
\v 30 And his servants carried him in a charet dead, [that is, mortally wounded and accounted as dead. So we say of a man that is dying or must suddenly die, he is a dead man. So the word death is almost taken, Gen.20.3] from Megiddo and brought him to Jerusalem, and hurted him in his (own) Sepulchre, and the people of the land took Joahaz [otherwise called also (as some conceive) Johanan, 1 chron.3.15 ad Sallum, Jer.22.11] the son of Josia and anointed him and made him king in his father’s stead. [thus (according to the opinion of some) openly declaring, that I his general calamity, they required him to be their king with all speed to be protected by him against king necho, and to prefer the land and kingdome.]
\p
\v 31 Joahaz was three and twenty years old when he became king and reigned thre moneth at Jerusalem, and his mother’s name was Hamutal, the daughter of jeramia of Libna. [this Jeremia is to be distinguished from Jeremia the prophets for the prophet was of Anathoth in Benjamin, jerem.1.1 but this man was of Libna in Juda.]
\p
\v 32 And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord, according to all his father’s had done. [Namely his grandfather Amon and his great grandfathers Manasseh, Achaz, 7c.]
\p
\v 33 but Pharao Necho caused to be bound [i.e. put him in prison. This was done while he was busie imployed in war against the city of Carchemis, of which see 2 chron.35.20. jer.46.2] at Ribla [city lying in Syria by some held to be Apamia, by others Antiochia] in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign at Jerusalem: [oth, when he reigned at Jerusalem] and he laid a tax upon the land of an hundred talents of Silver, [see Exod.25 on v.39.] and a talent of gold.
\p
\v 34 Pharao Necho made also Eliakim the son of Lofia king in the room of Josia his father, and changed his name Jojakim, [Heb. Turned about, 7c. he would thereby shew, that he had power and command over him. See the like example below chap.24.17. Dan.1.7.] but he took Joahaz with him, and he came into Egypt and died there. [to wit, as Jeremie had foretold, chap.22.12. where v.11. (According to the opinion of many) he is called Sallum.]
\p
\v 35 And Jojakim gave that silver and that gold to Pharao, but he taxed the land [that is, Jojakim taxed or valued the estates and means of all the inhabitants of the land and made them accordingly to bring in their taxes and tributes] to give that money according to the command [Heb. Mouth] of Pharao; he required of every one of the people of the land, according to his taxation [i.e. according as he was taxed by the king] the silver, and the gold, to give it unto Pharao Necho.
\p
\v 36 Jojakim was five and twenty years old when he became king, [to wit, alone and in full power after the death of Joahaz his brother, who while he was a prisoner was yet held to be king, although he namely Jojakim governed the kingdom. Others think that Jojahim was five and twenty years old, when Joahaz his brother was deposed and carried away captive unto Egypt and consequently that he was the eldest of Josia’s sons expounding the place. 1 Chron.3.15. not of natural procreation, but of kindly reign or government and that Joahaz was therefore anointed at his coronation or his installment that his choice or election might be the better secured against the gain saying of Jojakim his eldest brother as Salomon was anointed for such like cause, 1 kings 1.34,39.] and reigned eleven years at Jerusalem: [to wit, if we count up his reign from the time that he kept his brother’s place: which was presently after that his brother was carried captive into Egypt] and his mother’s name was Zebadda, a daughter of Pedaja, of Ruma.
\p
\v 37 And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord, according to all that his father had done, [see above on v.32.]
\c 24
\s Jojakim becometh king Nebuchadnezar’s servant, but revolteth from him, v.1,&c. his land is overcome b the enemies, 2. He dieth and Joachin his son becometh king in his stead, 6. much land is taken away from the king of Egypt, by the king of babel, 7. jojachins reign, 8. Jerusalem is besieged and spoiled by the Chaldeans, 10 jojachin with many of the Jewes is carried away captive to Babel, 14. Matthania, otherwise called Zedekia, becometh King and revolteth from the king of Babel, 17.
\p
\v 1 In his dayes [to wit, in the fourth year of his reign: which was the first year of Nebuchadnezar king of Babel came up and Jojakim became his servant three years; [that is, his vassal, subjects to his power and command, tributary, bound to pay him tax. So 2 Sam.8.2,6.] then he turned about and rebelled against him.
\p
\v 2 and the Lord sent against him the hands, [i.e. heaps of souldiers. See above chapter 5. on v.2. These were in the service of the King of Babel, making up all together his army] of the Chaldeans, [a people inhabitating the land of Chaldea of which Babel was the metropolis or chief city. Compare Ezek. 23.15.] and the hands of the Syrians, and the hands of the Moabites and the hands of the children of Ammon and sent them against Juda, to destroy that, according to the word of the Lord, which he had spoken by the ministery, [Heb. Hand] of his servants the prophets. [to wit, not onely in general by Moseh, Lev.26.17. Deut.28.25,36,68, &c. but also in special by hulda the prophetess, above chap.22.16 and by Jeremia the prophet, Jerem.25.9,&c.]
\p
\v 3 Surely (this) came to pass according to the command [Heb. Mouth at the Lord against Juda, to remove them from his face [compare above chap.17. on v.18.] for the sins of Manasseh [see of these sins above chap.21. amongst which the chiefest indeed was idolatry, which the people so imitated that they could not be driven from it neither by the repentance and conversion of Manasseh, that he made Juda to sinne, above chap.11.16] according to all that he had done.
\p
\v 4 As also (for) the innocent blood, which he had shed, [see above chap.21.16. and the annotate.] so that he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood: therefore the Lord would not pardon.
\p
\v 5 now the rest of the acts of jojakim, and all that he did; are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of juda?
\p
\v 6 And Jojakim fell asleep with his father: [to wit, in Babel, or by the way, as he was carried bound to Babel, 2 Chron. 36.6. and without receiving burial as was fortold by Jeremie, jer.22.v.18,19.] and Jojakim his son [called also jechonia, 1 Chron.3. ver.16] and by way of contempt Chrona. Jer.22.24.] became king in his stead.
\p
\v 7 now the king of Egypt came thereforth no more out of his hand: [this relation is made to shew, that the king of Juda could expect aid from Egypt against the king of Babel. It’s true indeed, that in Zedekia’s time he attempted to do somewhat but in vain being stopt by the Chaldeans. Jer.37.6,7.] for the king of Babel had taken from the river of Egypt, [called Sichor: see Jos.13.3.] unto the river Phratth, [otherw. Called Euphrates: see gen.2 on ver.14] all that was the king of Egypt.
\p
\v 8 Jojachin was eighteen years old, [Heb. A son of eighteen years] when he became king, [to wit, alone (as some of the learned judge) king in full and absolute power after the death of his father. Oth. When he was about the age of 8years, his father made him king in the midst of so many troubles to settle and confirm the kingdome in his own house and continued so king for ten yeares together, that is until his father died, for which cause it is said, that he was eight years old when he became king, 2 chron. 36.v.9.] and reigned three moneths at Jerusalem; [and ten dayes, 2 Chron.36.9. thus often times an even number is put for an odde. See gen. 15.13 and 1 kings 16.8. with the annotate] and his mother’s name was Nehustha, a daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
\p
\v 9 And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord, according to all that his father had done.
\p
\v 10 At that time [To wit, at the return of the year, 2 chron.36.10. that is, at the coming on or beginning of the summer. See 1 kings 20 on v.22.] the servant of Nebuchadnezar King to Babel marched toward Jerusalem; and the city was besieged. [Heb. Came in siege; that is, came to be besieged or was besieged: so below chap.25.2.]
\p
\v 11 Nebuchadnezar king of Babel came himself against the city when his servants besieged it.
\p
\v 12 Then Jojakim king of Juda went to the king of Babel, he and his mother and his servants and his princess and his courtiers: [it’s conceived that he did this by the prophet Jeremie’s advice, that the temple and the people might not be utterly destroyed] and the king of Babel took him (captive) [to wit, to keep him prisoner. See below chapter 25.27.] In the eighth year of his reign, [to wit, of king Nebuchadnezar’s reign, not of Jojachins. For Jojachin reigned but three moneths and ten dayes, in full and absolute power. See above on verse 7. compare also below chap.25.8]
\p
\v 13 And he [namely, Nebuchadnezar] carried out thence [i.e. from Jerusalem] all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king’s house; and be cut down all [i.e. ornaments, of almost all, a great part; as appeareth below, chap. 25.15] the golden vessel, [the word rendred here cutting down, signifieth properly casting off, or shortening off but is also further taken for taking away. The meaning is, that he took away those vessels and robbed the temple of them. That he left some whole and undefaced, appeareth by Dan.5.v2.3.] which Solomon the king of Israel had made the temple of the Lord according as the Lord had spoken. [see above chap. 20.17 and Jer.20.5.]
\p
\v 14 And he carried away all Jerusalem. [that is, the most part of the inhabitants and the chiefest. Compare Matth.3.5.] together with all the princess and with all the warlike champions. [so Judges.6.12 and above chap.51. the Hebrew words may be also understood of those that are wealthy or of a great and mighty estate, as Ruth 2.1.] ten thousand prisoners, [that is, the whole sum of the prisoners which hereafter vers16 is set down distinctly] and all the carpenter and smiths; [or lock-markers. See further Jer.24 on v.1.] None remained save the poor people of the land. [Heb, the thinness of the people of the land. So below chap.25.12. Jer.40.7 & 52.16 that is, of poorest meanst basesth and most exhausted people of the land.]
\p
\v 15 So he carried away Jojachin to Babel, together with the king’s mother and the king’s wives and his courtiers, beside the mighty of the land he carried captive from Jerusalem to babel.
\p
\v 16 And all the men of valor seven thousand and Carpenters and smiths a thousand, (and) all the champions that were exercised in war: [Heb. That did the war, that is followed the war. See above chap.12. on verse 21.] these that the king of Babel brought captive to Babel.
\p
\v 17 And the king of Babel made Mattania his uncle [to wit, his father’s brother] king in his stead and changed. [Heb. Turned about. So above chap. 23.34. and 2 Chron. 364.] his name into Zedkiah. [Heb.Tsidkiabu]
\p
\v 18 Zedkia was one and twenty years old, when he became king and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem and his mother’s name was Hamatal, [as above chapter 23.31. oth. Hamital. The mother of Joahaz so that Zedekia and joahaz were own brothers. Both by father and mother] a daughter of Jeremia of Libna.
\p
\v 19 And he did that which evil in the eyes of the lord, according to all that Jojakim [this was Zedekia’s half brother, being both of one father, but not of one mother: see chap.23.36.] had done.
\p
\v 20 For it came to pass, because the anger of his Lord against Jerusalem, and against Juda until he had cast them away fom his face; [compare above chap.17. on v.18.] and Zedekia rebelled against the King of babel. [the Lord intending to punish the sins of the people of the Jewes, gave not to Zedekia the spirit of true repentance, but suffered him to fall so far, that through evil cousel and his own willfulness, he became perjured and revolted from King Nebuchadnezar.]
\c 25
\s Jerusalem is besieged, verse1 &c. Zedekia taken prisoner his eyes put and carried to Babel, 5 Nebuchadnezar burneth Jerusalem and the temple, and breaketh down the wall of the city, 8. the carrieth much people away, 11. Also much treasure, 14, carrieth some of the chiefest sort to riblath, where they are put to death, 18. Gedalia is made governour of Juda Jojachin is delivered and advanced by Evilmerodach,27.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in the nineth year of his [Namely, Zedekia’s] reign in the tebth moneth, on the tenth day of the moneth, (that) Nebuchadnezar King of Babel came against Jerusalem he and all his host and camped himself against it and they built forts [the Hebrew word (as many conceive) signifieth a warlike structure on building in the form or fashin of a tower or high scaffold, made of wood, which was reared up without the city over against the walls to shoot from thence arrows and stones against the walls and unto the city. The same word is found, Jer.52.4. and Ezek.4.2 and 17.17 &c.] against it round about.]
\p
\v 2 So the city was besieged, [so above chap.24.10.] unto the eleventh year of King Zedekia.
\p
\v 3 On the ninth (day) of the (fourth)[This word is inserted out of Jerem. 30.2 and 52.6.] moneth, when the famine grew strong in the city, and the people of the land had no bread.
\p
\v 4 Then was the city broken thorow, [to wit, by the Chaldeans, that besieged the city and had already taken the middle gate. Jer.39.3.] and the souldiers (shed) [this word is also here inserted to fill up the sense, out of Jer. 39.4.] by night by the way of the gate, between the two walls, [Understand a private gate, or passage, which was made between two walls of the city. See this secret typified, Ezek.12.6.] which were [or, was: to wit, the gate or way] by the king’s garden, (now the Chaldeans were against the city round about) and (the king) went (by) the way of the plain
\p
\v 5 But the army of the Chaldeans pursed after the king and they overtook him in plains of Jericho. [see 2 Kings 2 on verse 43.] and all his army were scattered from him.
\p
\v 6 then they took hold of the King and brought him up to the king of Babel to Ribla: [see bove chap.23.33. in this city Nebuchadnezar intended to keep his court until he had subdued Jerusalem, especially seeing the siege lasted a long while] and they passed sentence against him. [for they accused him of disloyalty and falsehood, because he had broken his promise and oath, and of thankfulness against king Nebuchadnezar, that had made him king above chap. 24.17,28. Oth. They passed a sentence with him; to wit, with the king of Babel upon the King of Juda.]
\p
\v 7 And they did slay the sons of Zedekia before his eyes, and they blinded Zed’s eyes, [see Jer. 39 on v.5.] and they bowed him with two copper chains, and carried him to Babel.
\p
\v 8 After that in the fifth month, [which answers to part of our July and to part of our August. See Numb. 33v38.] on the seventh (day) of the moneth (this was the nineenth year of Nebuchadnezar king of Babel) came Nebuchadnezar the commander of the guard] see genesis 37 on v.36. Heb. The master of the guard] the servant of the king of Babel unto Jerusalem.
\p
\v 9 And he burnt the house of the Lord and the king’s house; together with all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of great men [oth. Great houses. Understand the houses of rich and mighty men, that had been of great means, or estates; these were chiefly to suffer. Whence it seemeth, that some small cottages of poor and mean people were spared. Great men are taken for rich men, Gen. chap.24.35 and 26.13. 1 Sam.25.2. item, for men of honor and high estate, 2 kings 10.6 Jona 3.7of both may the word be taken here: as also Levit. 19. V15.] burnt he with fire.
\p
\v 10 And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the commander of the guard break down the walls of Jerusalem round about.
\p
\v 11 Now the remainder of the people that were left in the city and the revolters that are fallen away to the king of Babel and the rest of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry captive away.
\p
\v 12 But the commander of the guard left (some) of the poorest (fort) of the land, [Heb. Of the thinness of the land: see above chap. 24 .on v.14] (to be) vine-dressers and husbandmen.
\p
\v 13 Moreover the Chaldeans brake (in pieces) the copper-pillar, [see of these 1 kings 7.15.] that were in the house of the Lord and the bases, [i.e. feet, stools, or props on which the leaves or kettles stood that Salomon had left in the court of the priests: see 1 kings 7. V. 27.] and the copper sea, [see 1 kings 7.23.] which was in the house of the Lord: and they carried the copper of them to Babel.
\p
\v 14 They took also the pots, and the shovels, and the forks, and the incense bowls and all the copper vessels, wherewith they ministred. [of all this furniture of the Temple, ye may also see 1 kings 7.45.]
\p
\v 15 And the commander of the guard took away the incense vessels [or, coal-pans: see Lev.10. on v.1.] and the sprinkling basins, which was all good and that which (was) all silver; [Heb. Gold and silver silver; i.e pure and substantial gold or silver; or all of gold and silver and not barely gift or silvered over. Oth. Which (to wit, the sprinkling basins) were all gold and which were all silver.]
\p
\v 16 The two pillars, one see and bases which Salomon had made for the house of the Lord: the copper of all these was without weight. [That is, there was so great a quantity of copper that they neither could nor would weigh it.]
\p
\v 17 The weight of one pillar was eighteen ells (or cubits) and the chapter upon it was copper, and the height of the chapiter was three ells and the net, and the pomegranates upon the chapiter round about, were all of copper: and the like unto these had the second pillar with the net. [see of all these things 1 kings 7. V. 15, 16,17.]
\p
\v 18 The commander of the Guard took also Seraja [this man was the son of Azaria, who was the son of Hilkia, 1 Chron. 6. V.13,14 who found the book of the law in the temple, above chap.22.8. Seraja’s son was Ezra, whose book we have among the books of the old Testament, Ezra 7.1.] the head-priest, [Hebr. The priest the head, or, that was the head, that is, the first, or the chiefest or highest to wit, of the priests: so 2 Chron. 26.20 and 31.10. Ezra 7.4.] and Zephania [the son of Maaseia, Jer. 21.1. differing from Zephania the prophet, who was the son of Chufi, Zeph.1.1.] the second priest, [see Numb. 3. On v.32 and 1 kings 1 on verse 4.] and the keepers of the threshold.
\p
\v 19 And he took out of the city a courtier that was set over the souldiers and five men [which were the chiefest and of greatest note among the rest, of whom Jeremy speaketh, chap. 52.25.] of those that behold the king’s face, [that is, which were ordinarily in the kings presence and ever at hand, to minister unto him: so Efth. 1.14.] which were found in the city; together with the chiefest scribe of the host, that lifted the people of the land for the war; [or, took them on for the war, or, mustred them, or, exercised them in arms. See of this man also Jer. 52.25.] and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the city.
\p
\v 20 When Bebuzaradan the commander of the Guard had taken these; then he brought them to the king of Babel to Ribla.
\p
\v 21 And the King of Babel smote them, some are of opinion, that these were those that had set themselves against the prophet Jeremy, crying. The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, Jer.7.4. of the word smitting, see Gen.8 on v.21.] and shew them at Ribla, in the Land of Hamath: so Juda was carried away captive out of their own land. [This is the fulfilling of the prophecie, of which see above chap.23.27. Jer .25.9.]
\p
\v 22 But as for the people that remained in the land of Juda, which Nebuchadnezzar the King of babel had left, over the he set Gedalia [a pious and upright man, much affected towrd the prophet Jeremia and following his counsel in all things: see of him also Jer.40v5. he is to be distinguished from another Gedalia that was the grndafather of the prphet Zephania, Zeph.1.1.] the son of Ahitkam [also a friend and favourer of the prophet Jeremy. See Jer.2625.] the son of Saphan. [who was king Josia’s scribe, 2 king 22.3.]
\p
\v 23 Now when all the commanders of the armies they are their men heard, that the king of Babel had made Gedalia governour; they came to Gedalia to Mizza; [see of this city, Judges 11.11.] namely Ismael the son of Nethania and Johana the son of Kareth and Seraja the son of Tanhameth the Netophatite and Jaazania the son of the Maachatte, [see of these men also Jer.40.7.8. some are of opinion that these wee the officerd of the Army, and the captains that with their men were present with king Zedeka, when he was taken prisoner by Jericho, and there were scattered from him, above v.5.] they and their men.
\p
\v 24 And gedalia sware to them and to their men, and said unto them; fear not to be the servants of the Chaldeans, abide in the land and serve the king of Babel, so shall it go well with you.
\p
\v 25 But it came to pass in the seven moneth, [see Jer.41 on verse1.] that Ismael the son of Nethania the son of Elizama of the royal seed [Heb, of the seed of the kingdome; that is, of the Family of David and Solomon. They are otherwise called usually, princess of the blood] came ten men with him and smote Gedalia this he died, [either because they envied gedali’s greatness or because they hated the king of babel; or for both reasons] and likewise the Jewes, and the Chaldeans, that were with him as Mizpa.
\p
\v 26 Then all the people gat them up, from the least, to the greatest and the commander of the armies and came into Egypt for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.
\p
\v 27 After that it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the carrying away of Joiachin, the king of Juda, in the twelfth moneth on the seven ad twentieth (day) of the moneth, that Evilmerodach [the son of Nebuchadnezar who succeeded his father in the mornachie and reigned about eight and twenty years. Some are of opinion that he had some knowledge of the true God ad therefore was called by the Insidels evilmerodach, that is the foolish Merdach] king of Babe, in the year when he became king, did lift up the head of Jojachin king of Juda out of prison. [Heb. Out of the house of compulsion or shutting up. That without doubt was done, partly through compassion of his age and long imprisonment sustained, partly through observation, that he had willingly surrendered himself into the hands of Nebuchadnezar: see above chap.24.12.]
\p
\v 28 And he spake friendly to him; [Heb. He spake good things. See 1 Kings 12 verse 7 and Jer.12.6.] And sat his seat above the seats of the king’s that were with him at Babel.
\p
\v 29 Ad he changed his prison-garments: to wit, which he used to be in prison. Compare herewith, en.41.14 and the annotate. Thereon] and he did eat bread continued before his face all the dayes of his life.
\p
\v 30 And concerning his allowances, [to wit, the allowance and maintenance of Jojachins household: for of Jojachins own personal allowance and diet, is spoken in the former verse] a continual allowance was given him of the king [oth. For his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king] every daily appointed every day. See the like phrase. Exo.5.13. Lev.23.37. 1 kings 8.59.] All the dayes of his life.
