\mt2 THE BOOK OF
\mt NEHEMIA
\s The Argument of this Book
\p Nehemia (being Cup-bearer to the King of Persia Arthahsasta the second, that is mentioned by that came in the word of God) having heard of the sad and miserable condition of his people, as also of the city, walls and gates of Jerusalem, humbleth himself threat in the sight and presence of God, by fasting and prayer. And having gotten fit opportunity, addresseth himself by way of petition unto the King, and obtained of him this favour, as to be sent by him as his Lieutenant or Governor unto Jerusalem, with a charge and commission to reside there for a while, and to repair and redress what o ever was amiss and out of order. Which Nehemia, being moved with a special zeal unto Gods glory, performeth in a very faithful, wise, pious, and constant manner, overcoming many difficulties and impediments, that were cast in his way by Satan, for to stop and hinder him in this holy work, both by enemies abroad, and by false brethren and hypocrites at home, that held correspondency with the enemy. He also freeth the congregation from the heavy oppression of the rich; and settleth the public worship of God by special duties, fasting and prayer; together with a renewing of a firm covenant with God, he furnisheth Jerusalem with a sufficient number of inhanitants, dividing the rest of the people in their several dwelling-place. And after he had twelve years together commendably administered his place of Government he returneth again unto King Arthahsasta, in the three and thirtieth year of his Reign, and is after a while again sent by the King to Jerusalem , where he removeth and reformeth many abuses, that were crept in during of his absence, with great courage and resolution. This Book beareth the name of Nehemia, because therein is contained, what so ever happened in Judea during the time of his Government there, and because it was written by himself, by the inspiration of the Spirit of God, as painly appeareth in divers places of his Book.
\c 1
\s Nehemia (the kings cup-bearer, vers.11.) receiveth tidings at Susan of the sad condition of his people, as likewise of the walls and gates of Jerusalem, vers.1, & c. Mourneth exceedingly, fasteth, prayeth, and beseecheth God for Mercy and Favour, and especially, that he would bless his design, and prosper his request, which he intended to put up to the king.
\p
\v 1 The acts [Or, words] of Nehemia, the son of Hachalja. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, [see Ezra 10 on vers.9. According to the holy or Ecclesiatical year, it was the nineth: But after the account of the Chaldeans, who began the year in September, it was the third month] in the twentieth year, [of king Arthahsasta, as below chap.2.1. See there] when I was in the palace at Sisan: [the metropolis or chief city of Susiane, built (as some do write) by Darius Hystaspis.]
\p
\v 2 . Then Hanani one of my brethren [That is, kinsmen, or countrymen, Jews] came, he and (certain) men of Juda; And I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, [Heb. The escaping] (which were left of the captivity) and concerning Jerusalem.
\p
\v 3 . And they said unto me: the remnant that are left of the captivity there in the country [Or, province; the land of Canaan is so called, because it was now under the subjection of the Persian Monarchy] are in great misery, [Hebr. In great evil: that is, misery and affliction] and in reproach: And the wall of Jerusalem is torn, and gates thereof are burnt with fire.
\p
\v 4 . And it came to pass when I heard these words, then I sat down and wept, and mourned (certain) days: And O fasted and prayed before the face of the God of heaven.
\p
\v 5 . And I said, O LORD God of heaven, thou great and terrible God: [Compare Dan.9.4.] that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him, and keep his commandments. [compare Exod.20.6. and 34.7. Numb.14.18. Deut.5.10. Psal.86.15. and 103.8. and 145.8.]
\p
\v 6 . Let, I beseech, thine ear be attentive: [That is, hear I pray; spoken of God after the manner of men] and thine eyes open, [see 1 Kings 8.on vers.29.] to hearken unto the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thy face this day, [that is, now, at this time] day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants: and I make confession of the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee; also I and my Fathers house, we have sinned.
\p
\v 7 . We have exceedingly corrupted (it) against thee: [Hebr. We have with corruption, or, corrupting corrupted: that is, we have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have made our selves every way guilty by our sins] neither have we kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgements, [see of these three words, Deut.5. on vers.31.] which thou commandest thy servant Moseh.
\p
\v 8 . Remember, I pray, the word, which thou commandedst thy servant Moseh, saying; Ye shall transgress, and I shall scatter you among the nations.
\p
\v 9 . And ye shall return unto me, and keep my commandments and do them; though thy expelled ones were at the end of Heaven, I will gather them from thence, [see Deut.30.2,3,4. With the Annotations] and well bring them unto the place that I have chosen, to cause my Name to dwell there.
\p
\v 10 . Yet they are thy servants, and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.
\p
\v 11 . O LORD I beseech thee, let thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, that delight to fear thy Name, and cause, I beseech thee, thy servant to speed well this day, and grant him mercy before the face of this man: [Namely, king Arthahsasta, as the following words, and the beginning of the next chapter do shew. Hebr. Give him unto mercies, or, compassions: that is, work now in the heart of the King, that he may pity and commiserate me and my people, and gracious yield unto my request. See Jerem.42.on vers.12.] now I was the Kings Cup-bearer.
\c 2
\s Nehemia finding fit opportunity petitioneth king Arthasasta, and obtaineth the favour, with a commission to reform and redress what so ever was amiss there, and with letters to the keepers of the kings wards, and to the Governors, v.1, &c. Nehemia cometh to the Governors, and to Jerusalem: which is an eye-sore to the Enemies of Gods people, 9. He vieweth by night the ruined walls, and burned gates of Jerusalem, 12. He openeth the kings commission before the chiefest of the people, and encourageth them on to build in defiance and spite of the Enemies.
\p
\v 1 Then it came to pass in the month Nisan, [Oth. Called Abib, Exod.13.4.] in the twentieth year of king Arthahsasta, [see Ezra 6 1.on v.14.] (when there) was wine before his face; that I [whose turn it was now again, to fill out for the King the wine that was set before him, hereby is intimated the cause why Nehemia tarried so long] took up the wine, and gave (it) unto the king; now I had never been sad [hebr. Evil; that ishere, of a sad or sorrowful countenance: and so in the sequel. See Gen.40.on vers.7.] before his face. [when I was wont to come before the King, or to be in his presence: But (as if he should say) it was otherwise with me now.]
\p
\v 2 . Then the king said unto me; why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? This is nothing (else) but sorrow of heart: Then I was very sore afraid. [Out of reverence of the Kings Majesty; for none might appear before the Persian Kings in Badges of Mourning and sorrow, Est.4.2. and likewise out of care and trouble about the issue of this matter, which was of great concernment.]
\p
\v 3 . And I said unto King; Let the king live for ever; [That is, let him live long, a manner of wishing prosperity and happiness, used in those countries. See Dan.2,4. And 3.9. and 5.10. and 6.22.] how [Hebr. Why] should not my countenance be sad, when the city the place [Heb. The house, which is sometimes taken for place. See Exod. 25 7. 2 Sam.15.17. Prov.8.2. with the annotate.] of the burials of my Fathers lieth waste, and the gates are consumed with fire? [by city here he meaneth Jerusalem, which he thus describeth, to excuse his own sadness, and to move the king the more.]
\p
\v 4 . And the king said unto me; what doest thou now request? [Heb. for what art thou now requesting] Then I prayed [to wit, within my self, in mine heart] unto the God of heaven.
\p
\v 5 . And I said unto the king; if it seem good unto the king, [Hebr. If it (be) good with the king: so vers.7. See Ezra 5.on vers.17.] and if thy servant be acceptable [Hebr. Good] before thy face; that thou wouldest send me unto Juda, [understand withal, I do request] unto the city of the burials of my Fathers, that I may build it.
\p
\v 6 . Then the king said unto me, when the Queen [oth. Wife, bed fellow] sat by him; [oth. And the Queen that sat by him] how low shall thy journey be, and when shalt thou return? And it pleased the king [Hebr. Was good before the face of the king] when I had set him a certain time. [to wit, the time of twelve years. See below chap.5.14. and 13.6.]
\p
\v 7 . Moreover, I said unto the king; if it seem good unto the king, let letters be given me to the Governors beyond the River: [Euphrates; and so in the sequel] that they may convey me over, till I shall be come into Juda.
\p
\v 8 . Also a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the Garden of pleasure, [That is, the forster or keeper of the Groves. See 1 King.5.6. Garden of pleasure. Heb. Pardesch;that is, Paradiose, whereby some do understand the country from mount Libanus unto Antilibanus, so called by reason of the singular delight and pleasure of that place, so that there was also a little town or city called the Paradise] which the king hath, that he may give me wood to floor the gates of the palace, that is at the house, [meaning the house of God, that is, the Temple, whose court (called here, as some conceive, the palace) lay hitherto open. Compare Ezra 10.on vers.6. 1 Chron.29.1.] and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into: And the king granted them unto me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.
\p
\v 9 . Then I came to the Governors on that side the River, and gave them the king letters: And the king had sent Captains of the army and horsemen with me.
\p
\v 10 . Now when Saneballet the Horonite, [So called from Horonaim, one of the chiefest cities of the Moabites, as appeareth, Isa.15.5. and Jer.48.3,5,34.] and Tobia the Ammonitish servant [that is, the Persian Kingts Vassal, Officer, or Lieutenant. Both these were Enemies to the Israelites. (See 2 Sa. 8.on v.2. and 12.on v.31.) and had at this time their residence or abode at Samaria, as may be gathered from chapt.4.2.] heard (thereof) it displeased them with great displeasure, [Hebr. It was (or seemed) evil unto them (with, or yea) a great evil: that is, it displeased (or grieved) them exceedingly] that there was come a man to seek some good thing for the children of Israel.
\p
\v 11 . And I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days. [Compare Ezra 8.v.32.]
\p
\v 12 . After that I gat me up in the night, I, and (some) few men with me, neither told I any man, what my God had given in mine heart to do to Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.
\p
\v 13 . And I went out by night through the valley-gate, [That is, where this gate had formerly been, and was afterward set up again. See chap.3.13. So of the sequel] and beyond the Dragons Fountain, [or, Serpents Fountain. Some do understand by this, the fountain of the water of Siloa, which run very still and softly, likewise the creeping of the serpent or snake. See Isa.8 6. And below cha.3.16.] and to the dung-gate, [through which they carried forth the soil and filth of the city into the brook Kidron, as some conceive] and I brake off the walls of Jerusalem, which were torn, [to wit, properly to know what they lacked, and what was to be done to them Oth. I viewed the walls, etc. How they were torn, etc. So also, v.15.] and the gates thereof [to wit, of Jerusalem] were consumed with fire.
\p
\v 14 . And I went on to the Fountain-gate, [Through which they went to the Fountain of the water of Siloa, as some do gather from cha.3.15.] and to the kings pool; [see below chap.3.15,16. And 2 Kings 18.17. and 20.20.] but there was no place for the beast (that was) under me to pass. [by reason of the heaps of stones that lay in the way, occasioned by the wall that was fallen down and broken in pieces; so that he was sain to light, and go on foot.]
\p
\v 15 . Then went I up in the night through [Oth. by] the brook, [Kidron. See thereof, 2 Sam.15.on v.23.] or Gihon. As others conceive. See thereof 2 Chron.32.30. and 33.14.] and I brake of the wall: see on vers.13.] and I turned backed, and came in through the valleygate, so I returned.
\p
\v 16 . And the Rulers knew not whither I was gone, and what I did: For hitherto I had made known nothing to the Jews, nor to the Priests, nor to the Nobles, [Heb. to the white ones; that is, that wore fine white garments, as great Lords did in Kings Courts. See Esth.8.15. So below chap.5.7. and 6.17. and 7.5. and 13.17.] nor to the Rulers, nor to the rest, [Hebr. The remnant] that did the work. [that is, the city-carpenters, or builders, or those to whom the oversight was committed, that had the command and authority over the workmen.]
\p
\v 17 . Then said I unto them, ye see the misery that we are in, that Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire: Come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.
\p
\v 18 . And I acquainted them with the hand of my God, which had been good upon me, [Compare above vers.8.] as also with the words of the king, which he had spoken unto me? Then said they; let us arise that we may build; and they strengthened their hands for good. [that is, they took courage to go undauntedly about this good and commendable work.]
\p
\v 19 . Now when Saneballat the Horonite, and Tobia the Ammonitish servant, and Gisem the Arabian heard this, then they mocked us, and despised us; and they said; what is this thing that ye do? Will ye rebel against the king.
\p
\v 20 . Then I gave them an answer, and said unto them; the God of heaven, he will cause us to prosper, and we his servants will arise and build: But ye have o portion, nor right, nor memorial in Jerusalem. [That is, as unbelieves and idolaters of old, ye have no fellowship or communion at all with the church of God, but are strangers from it, yea their Enemies, so that we have no cause at all to stand in awe of you.]
\c 3
\s By what persons, and in what order the walls and gates of Jerusalem were built.
\p
\v 1 And Eliasib [The grand-child of Jesua, below chap.12.10.] the high Priest gat him up, with his brethren [that is, kinsmen of Aarons line] the Priests, and they built the sheep-gate; [or, cattle-gate, against the fore-part of the Temple, so called [according to the opinion of some) because the cattle-market had been kept there, for commodiousness sake, to have beasts for sacrifice ready at hand, as lying hard by the Temple: Here was also (as some conceive) the pool of Bethesda, whereof mention is made, John 5.2. See also below v.32. and chap.12.39.] they hallowed it, [that is, made prayers, offered sacrifices, etc. After that the gate was made ere it was put to common use. Compare Deut.20.5. Or hallowed, that is, ordained and set apart this place for matters that pertained to the service of the Temple, as to buy cattle for sacrifice, and to wash them, in regard of the commodiousness of the pool that lay near it, which perhaps God did also therefore bless with the miracle of healing, John 5.4. Item spices, incense, and changing of money; for the Goldsmiths and Drugsters dwelt here, below vers.32. Oth. hallowed; that is, prepared, made ready. Compare Jer.51.27, etc.] and reared up the doors of it; [see on vers.3.] yea they hallowed it unto the tower Mea, [to hundredth tower, standing between the sheep-gate and the tower of Hananeel: perhaps so called, because this tower was distant an hundred ells from both] unto the tower of Hananeel. [see Jer.31.38. Compare this description of the compass and situation of Jerusalem, with below chap.12.31, etc.]
\p
\v 2 . And at his hand [Or side; that is, next unto him: And so in the sequel] builded the men of Jerucho: Also at his hand builded Zaccur the son of Imri.
\p
\v 3 . Now the Fish-gate did the children of Senaa [Oth.Hassena] build: They floored it, and reared up [or set up] the doors therefore, (with) the locks thereof, and the bars thereof. [when the doors in the city-gates were set up and hung on, see therefore below chap.6.1. and 7.1. though the whole work be related here altogether: Unless it were so, that the doors being well fitted and set up might afterwards by the charge and command of Nehemia, be fully finished and hung on.]
\p
\v 4 .. And at their hand repaired [Or strengthened, redressed, reformed, to wit, the decayed wall: and so in the sequel] Moremoth the son of Uria, the son of Koz, [or, Hakkoz] and at their hand [to wit, at the hand of those that are mentioned in this and the former verse] repaired Mesullam the son of Berechja, the son of Mesesabeel: and at their hand repaired Zadok the son of Baena.
\p
\v 5 . Moreover at their hand repaired the Thekonites: [See 2 Sam.14.on ver.2.] but their excellent (ones) brought not their neck to the service [or to the work] of their Lord. [that is, the great and mighty, or honourable ones of Thekoa would not stoop, or give up themselves, to help likewise to further and advance this work of their God. This unwillingness and pride of theirs is here taxed and reproved by the holy Ghost to their shame and disgrace. Oth. to the work, or service of their Lord: Understanding thereby the commissioners that were appointed to have the oversight of the work, and to order all things aright, as they should see fit.]
\p
\v 6 . And the old-gate repaired Jojada the son of Pasea, and Mesullam the son of Besodja: These floored them, and reared up the doors thereof, with locks thereof, and the bars thereof.
\p
\v 7 . And at their hand repaired Melatja the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Merothite, the men of Gibeon and of Mizpa: [see of Gibeon, Josh.10. and of Mizpa, Judg.10.on vers.17.] unto the chair of the Governor on this side the River. [Euphrates, called in the scripture Phrath. That is, unto the house where the Governor or Kings Lieutenant in Juda kept his court, and which peradventure Nehemia himself was now to enter into Compare above chap.2.8.]
\p
\v 8 . At his hand repaired Uziel the son of Harhoja, (one) of the Goldsmiths, and at his hand repaired Hananja the son of the Apothecaries: [Hebr. A son of the Apothecaries, which some do understand to be as much as an Apothecary] and they left Jerusalem unto the broad wall. [that is, they left the following part of the wall as it was, because it remained yet good and strong enough. Others understand that there was an inner wall, that parted the upper city from the lower city, which they, as not necessary at first, passed by, to further and advance the most necessary work. Oth. they repaired up, &c. Compare Exod.23.on vers.5.]
\p
\v 9 . And at their hand repaired Rephaja the son of Hur, the Ruler of the half part of Jerusalem. [Jerusalem was divided into several parts or quarters: This man was Ruler of the one half of the city. Some conceive that besides the chiefest part of the city, called for its eminency Jerusalems part, or, quarter, that there were also other less parts or quarters, as of Bethcherem, Mizpa, Bethzur and Kegila: although there be some, that hold that these quarters or countries mentioned in the sequel, lay without Jerusalem, as appeareth, Jer.6. concerning Bethcherem, mentioned bel.v.4. Oth. the half of one part.]
\p
\v 10 . Moreover, at his hand repaired Jedaja the son of Harumaph, and over against his house: and at his hand repaired Hartus the son of Hasabneja.
\p
\v 11 . Malchia the son of Harim, and Hazub the son of Pahat-Moab, repaired the other measure: [That is, the following part, lying next to the part of Hattus: Or (as others) even such a part or measure of the wall, as Hattus had repaired] Besides the Tower of the Bakingovens. [see below chap.12.38.]
\p
\v 12 . And at his hand repaired Sallum the son of Lobes, [Or, Hallowes] the Ruler of the (other) half part of Jerusalem; he and his daughters.
\p
\v 13 . The valley-gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah, they built it, and reared up the doors thereof, (with) the locks thereof, and the bars thereof: Besides a thousand ells on the wall, unto the dung-gate. [See above ch.2.on v.13.]
\p
\v 14 . Now the dung-gate repaired Maichia the son of Rechab, the Ruler of the part of Beth-Cherem: [see concerning this and other parts and quarters mentioned in the sequel, the annotate. On v.9. and compare Jer.6.1.] he built it, and reared up the doors thereof, (with) the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.
\p
\v 15 . And the fountain-gate repaired Sallun the son of Col-hose, the Ruler of the part of Mizpa, he built it, and covered it over, and reared up the doors thereof, (with) the locks thereof, and the bars thereof: Moreover the wall of the pool Schelach [This is taken by some for Siloe, where of mention is made, Jos.9.7. Compare above c.2.on v.13. Nehemia beginneth here to relate the repairing of that which pertained to the Palace and the Temple] of the kings garden, and unto the stairs, [see bel.chap.12.39.] that go down from the city of David.
\p
\v 16 . After him repaired Nehemia the son of Azbuk, the Ruler of the half part of Beth-zur, even over against Davids sepulchare, and to the pool that was made, [see 2 Kings 18.17. and 20.20. so called (as some conceive) to distinguish it from the other, mentioned v.15. which was a natural pool or pond] and unto the house of the Champions. [where the valiantest warlike Champions that were about the king, were wont to lodge.]
\p
\v 17 . After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani: At his hand repaired Hasabja the Ruler of the half part of Kegila in his part. [Or, for with his apart; that is, for, or with those inhabitants of his quarter.]
\p
\v 18 . After him repaired their brethren, Bavai the son of Henadad, the Ruler of the (other) half part of Kegila.
\p
\v 19 . At his hand repaired Ezer the son of Jesua, the Ruler of Mizpa, another measure, [See on v.11.] over against the going up to the armory, at the corner. [see 2 Chron.26.on vers.9.]
\p
\v 20 . After him Baruch the son of Rabbai, [Otherwise called Zaccai] most servently repaired another measure, [Hebr. Kindled strengthened; that is, he repaired, or redressed and built up his part with a special zeal and servency of spirit. See Psal.45.on v.5.] from the corner unto the door of the house of Eljasib the high Priests,
\p
\v 21 . After him repaired Meremoth the son of Uria, the son of Koz [Or Hakkoa, as above] another measure; from the door of the house of Eljasib, to the end of the house of Eljasib.
\p
\v 22 . And after him repaired the Priests, dwelling in the plains. [Hebr. Men of the plain; that is, dwelling in the plains, lying between Jerusalem and Jericho. See Sam.2.29, etc.]
\p
\v 23 . After that [Oth. after him, Hebr. Properly, after him, which some understand to be taken here for the plural number; and so v.27,29.] repaired Benjamin, and Hasub, over against their house: After him repaired Azarja, the son of Maaseja, the son of Hananja, by his house.
\p
\v 24 . After him repaired Binnui, the son of Henadad, another measure: from the house of Azarja, unto the corner, and unto the point. [The outermost part of the corner.]
\p
\v 25 . Palal the son of Uzai, over against the corner, [Undestand, repaired the wall over against the corner] and the high Tower that sticketh out [Hebr. Goeth out; and so v.26.] from the kings house, which is by the court of the prison: [see below chap..12 39. And Jerem.32.2.] After him Pedaja the son of Parbos.
\p
\v 26 . Now the Nethinims, [See Ezra 2.on vers.43.] (that) dwelt in Ophel, [or on the high place. See Chr.27.3. and 33.14.] even over against the water-gate toward the East, [here may be understood, repaired] and the tower that sticketh out.
\p
\v 27 . After that the Thekoites [See v.5.] repaired another measure, over against the great Tower that sticketh out, and unto the wall of Ophel.
\p
\v 28 . From above the horse-gate, [Or, from the horse-gate. See 2 Kings 11.16.] repaired the Priests, every one over against his house.
\p
\v 29 . After that repaired Zadok the son of Immer, over against his house: And after him repaired Semaja the son of Sechanja, the keeper of the East-gate. [Compare Jer.19.on v.2.]
\p
\v 30 . After him repaired [Oth. after me, etc. And so in the following verse, meaning that Nehemiah relateth here, who they were that laboured on both sides of him, without mentioning or expressing what he himself did, to go before others by his own example; shewing thereby his humanity. See bel.cha.4.16,23. And 5.16.] Hananja the son of Selemja, and Hanun the son of Zalaph, the sixth, [to wit, son of Zalaph: Or, he himself the sixth] another measure: [see on v.11.] After him repaired Mesullam the son of Berechja, over against his chamber.
\p
\v 31 . After him repaired Malchia, a Goldsmiths son, unto the house of the Nethinims and of the Drugsters, over against the gate of Miphkad, [That is, command, oversight, mustering, or numbling. Some conceive that the great Council here met together, to consider of future grievance, and to give out commissions, and publish them abroad] and to the upper room of the point.
\p
\v 32 . And between the upper room of the point unto the sheep-gate, repairing the Goldsmiths and the Drugster.
\c 4
\s While the enemies flout and scoffe at Gods people, Nehemiah prayeth unto God, and advanceth the work, vers.1, &c. The enemies hearing of the successful progress of the work, combine together to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder the work, ere they should be aware of it, 7, &c. Item vers.11. But Nehemia being advertised hereof, setteth a strong watch against them, encourageth the people, and so frustrateth the design of the Enemies, 12. Returneth to the work, appointeth both his own servants and all the rest of the workmen, to work with the one hand, and to hold the weapon with the other, and giveth divers, military orders and commissions, 16.
\p
\v 1 But it came to pass when Saneballat had heard that we builded the wall, then he kindled [Hebr. To him kindled, to wit, anger; that is, his anger kindled: so v.7.]and grew very [Hebr. Much, greatly] wroth: [see above chap.2. on v.10.] and he mocked the Jews.
\p
\v 2 . And spake in the presence [Hebr. Before the face] of his brethren, and the host of Samaria, [to incense the soldier against the Jews, and to set them on] and said; what do these impotent Jews? Shall we let them alone? [oth. shall they rear it up, or, build it out] shall they offer? Shall they finish it in a day? [or, in this day. As if he had said; do they think to make and end the same day that they have begun or concluded the matter? They will miss of their purpose] shall they revive [that is, reduce and settle in former state and condition] the stones out of the rubbish-heaps, where they are burnt.
\p
\v 3 . And Tobia the Ammonite was by him, and said; Ableit that they build, if there should a fox go up, he would indeed break down the stone-wall. [Hebr. The wall of their stones.]
\p
\v 4 . Hear, O our God, that we are sore despised. [Or, for we are despised. Hebr. Are a contempt, or a dispising] etc turn their reproach [which they offer to us] upon their (own) head: and give them over for a prey in the land of captivity. [Whither thou shalt send them. Nehemia wisheth or desireth this out of an holy zeal for Gods glory, and against the bitter armies of God and his people.]
\p
\v 5 . And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thy face: [So as that thou shouldest not regard to punish it: as Jer.18.23.] for they have incensed 9thee, standing) over againt the builders. [who are a building at thy command, and by thy grace and favour. Hebr. They have incense, or, provoked to anger over against the builders. Oth. they have incensed the builders, (standing) over against (them) to wit, as enemies, that stand and provoke a man to his face, or in his sight.]
\p
\v 6 . But we built the wall, so that all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: [Meaning the half or moiety of the height, the half height] for the heart of the people was bent to work.
\p
\v 7 . And it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobia, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, [See 2 Chron.20.on v.1.] and the Ashdodites heard, that the repairing [Hebr. Health, healing, curing, plaistering. So 2 Chron.14.13. Compare also Jer.8.22.] on the wall of Jerusalem increased, [Hebr. Climbeth up, cometh up, or, goeth, up, as it may be said of health, that it cometh up, climbeth up, or goeth up, when it increaseth and augmenteth, and it maketh a man daily better and better: also of a plaister, that it is put upon, or laid upon, and that there cometh a scurf, or scar, or make upon the wound] that the breaches began to be stopped, then they kindled exceedingly.
\p
\v 8 . And they all made a combination together to come to fight against Jerusalem, and to make a confusion in it. [Or, to him, namely Nehemia.]
\p
\v 9 . But we prayed unto our God, and set a watch against them [Oth. over, or beside them, To wit, over the workmen] day and night, because of them. [To wit because of the enemies.]
\p
\v 10 . Then said Juda; [That is, the jews the people of Juda] The strength of the bearers (of burdens) is decayed, [So that they will not be sit to sight,] and (there) is much rubbish: [That is, there remaineth yet much dirt, rubbish and earth of the broken and decayed wall to be carried away] so that we shall not be able to build at the wall. [In regard we must be in arms against the enemy. See vers.15. Oth. building on the wall, we shall not have the upper hand, being not able to do both as we ought.
\p
\v 11 . Now our enemies had said, they shall not know it nor see, till we come in the midst of them, and slay them: [that is, will carry the matter so close, that they shall not perceive anything, till &c.] So we shall cause the work to cease.
\p
\v 12 . And it came to pass, when the jews that dwelt by them came, that they told us wel-nigh ten times, [That is, often, frequently warned us. See Gen.31.on vers.7.] from all places (by) which ye return to us. [That is, by which they are wont to go to and fro: that is through all ways and passages, by which a man may come from thence hither, and from hence thither.]
\p
\v 13 . Therefore I set in the lowest places behind the wall, [Hebr. From the nethermost or lowermost parts of the place, from behind, etc.] (and) on the high places; [Or, sharp-pointed places butting out, of rocks and stones, which may be so called by reason of their whiteness, or, slipperiness] and I set the people after the families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
\p
\v 14 . And I looked, and gat me up, and said unto the Nobles [Heb. white (ones) See above chap.2.vers.16.] and to the Rulers, and to the rest of the people; Be not afraid of their face: [Compare Num.14.9. Deut.1.21. and 20.3.] remember that great and terrible Lord, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.
\p
\v 15 . After that it came to pass, when our enemies heard, that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought; then we returned all the wall, every one unto his work.
\p
\v 16 . And it came to pass from that day forth, that the half of my youths [That is, servants, courtiers, officers; and so often in the sequel] wrought at the work, and the (other) half of them held both the spears, and the shields, and the bowers, and the targets: and the Rulers were behind all the house of Juda. [Every one by those of his own house or family, to encourage the people by their presence and oversight, and to advance and further the work.]
\p
\v 17 . They which builded on the wall, and they which bare burdens, (and) they that laded, every one [Of the bearers of burdens, and laders] with hios one hand, wrought at the work, and the other held the weapon. [Understand a casting weapon, a javelin, half lance, &c. By this action or practice of theirs, they lovely represented the state and condition of the church militant on earth, who must with the one hand continually build at the work of the LORD, and with the other defend themselves against their spiritual and corporal enemies.]
\p
\v 18 . And the builders, they had every one his sword girded on his loins, and builded; but he that blew with the trumpet, was by me.
\p
\v 19 . And I said unto the nobles, and to the Rulers, and to the rest of the people; The work is great and large; and we are separated upon the wall, the one far from the other, [Hebr. The man from his brother.]
\p
\v 20 . At the place where ye shall hear the sound of the trumpet, thither shall hear the sound of the trumpet, thither shall ye assemble yourselves unto us: our God shall fight for us. [Compare Exod.14.25. Deut.1.30. and 28.7.]
\p
\v 21 . Some wrought at the work; and half of them held the spears, from the rising of the morning until the appearing of the stars. [That is, from betimes in the morning, until late in the evening.]
\p
\v 22 . Likewise at the same time said I unto the people; Let every one with his youth over-night within [Hebr. in the midst of Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and in the day at the work.
\p
\v 23 . Moreover, neither I, nor my brethren, nor my youths, nor the men of the guard that were behind me, [That is, which followed me] we put not off our clothes; every one (had) his weapon, [in regard of the danger,] (and) water [to quench his thirst, because it was very hot in those countries. See 1 Sam.26.11. Oth. every one, (went with) his weapon, (for) water; or every one put off (his clothes) for bathing or washing.
\c 5
\s The people complaineth of oppression by reason of usury, and pawns, vers.1. etc. Nehemia is exceedingly troubled threat, reproveth the great ones, convinceth them, and causeth them to promise and swear, that they will desist and cease from it, 6. Relateth his own example; and how that he, not with standing the great charges he was at in keeping of court, yet never had required the Governor right or allowance, that he might not be burdensome to the Commonalty, 14.
\p
\v 1 But the cry of the people, and of their wives was great; against their brethren the jews. [Understand for the most part, the rich and mighty ones, who by usury and pawns, drained out and oppressed the common sort of people, as followeth.]
\p
\v 2 . For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughetsr, we are many: Therefore we have taken up corn that we might eat and live. [Oth. Let us take up corn, that we may, etc.]
\p
\v 3 . There were also that said, We morgage our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses, that we may take up corn in this famine. [This deareth and distress of the people may partly have risen from thence, that all the while this building lasted, they were constrained to omit and neglect the taking care to lay up in store for their own families, and partly because through fear of the enemy they could not fetch in provision from abroad.]
\p
\v 4 . Likewise there were that said; We have borrowed money for the kings tribute; [That we might pay it. See thereof Ezra 4.13. from this were onely the Priests, Levites, and other ministers of the Temple exempted, Ezra 7.24.] (upon) our fields and our vineyards.
\p
\v 5 . Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, [That is, we are in Gods account as much as they; for we are Abrahams seed, and in covenant with God, as well as they] our children are their children; and lo, we subject our sons and our daughters (to be) bond-men; [Understand withal, and bond-women] yea, there be some of our daughters subject, (so) that they are not in the power of our hands; and others have our fields, and our vineyards. [Oth. and it is not in the power of our hands (to redeem them) for others have, etc.]
\p
\v 6 . Now when I heard their cry, and those words, I was kindled greatly. [Hebr. To me kindled greatly, to wit, anger.]
\p
\v 7 . And my heart consulted in me; then I contended with the Nobles, [Hebr. White ones. See above chap.2.on verse 16.] and with the Rulers, and said unto them; Ye exact [or, impose, wring from, exort] a burden [Understand by this burden, usury, and the morgaging or pawning of goods and men] every one of his brother: [Oth. the land, every one unto his brother (with a) burden; and so in the sequel] moreover, I laid a great assembly, [Hebr. Properly I gave; that is, I appointed a great assembly] against them.
\p
\v 8 . And I said unto them, we, after our ability, [Heb. after the sufficiency (that was) in, or by or under us; that is, as much as lay in our power] have redeemed our brethren the jews, [See Levit.25.47,48,49.] that were sold unto the heathen: [This peradventure, was done by the Babylonians] and would ye also sell your brethren, or should they be sold unto us? Then they held their peace, and found no answer.
\p
\v 9 . I said moreover, the thing is not good which ye do, Ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the heathen, our enemies? [That is, that ye may not give occasion to the heathen, that are both Gods and our enemies, to blaspheme the Name of God, and to upbraid us contumeliously, that we do unto each other, which we hated and discommended in them.]
\p
\v 10 . I, my brethren, and my youths, do we also exact, [See on verse 7.] money and corn of them? [Nehemia doth intimate in these words, that he favoured the communalty all manner of ways, and that they ought to do so too] I pray let us leave off this burden. [As above verse 7.]
\p
\v 11 . Restore, I pray you, to them this day, their fields, their vineyards, their olive-yards, and their houses; and the hundredth (part) of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil which ye have exacted of them. [They had taken these things from their brethren, contrary to the law, Exod.22.25. Levit.25.36. Deut.23.19. Oth. which ye have lent them.]
\p
\v 12 . Then said they, We will restore it, and require nothing of them, we will do so as thou sayest: and I called the priests, [To take the oath of them, or, to be witnesses thereof, and by their presence to oblige their consciences the more in the sight of God. See 1 Kings 8.31,32. Num.5.19.] and made them swear, that they would do according to this word.
\p
\v 13 . Also I shook out my lap, [Oth. mine arm; that is, my sleeve, or I shook out my mantle, putting out mine arm all under one. This was a kind of ceremony that was used in those times in, or with an oath or curse,] and said, So God shake out all (or every) man from his house, and from his labour, [that is, from his estate, and from his labour, [That is, from his estate, and means, which he, (it may be) hath gotten by his labour] that shall not confirm this word, and thus be he shaken out, and empty: and all the congregation said, Amen. [See Numb.5.on verse 22.] and they praised the LORD, and the people did according to this word.
\p
\v 14 . Also from that day that he [To wit, King Arthahsasta, or God by the King,] appointed me to be their Governor in the land of Juda, from the twentieth year of King Arthahsasta, [See Ezra 6.on verse 14.] being twelve years, I with my brethren have not eaten the bread of the Governor. [That is, the maintenance which the king allowed the Governors, and I as well as my predecessors might have enjoyed.]
\p
\v 15 . And the former Governors, that had been before me, were chargeable unto the people, and took of them in bread and wine, after that, moreover besides fourty shekels of silver; [To wit, for every day. Of shekels, see Gen.20.on verse 16.] also their youths bare sway over the people; But so did not I, because of the fear of God.
\p
\v 16 . Moreover; I also repaired [As above chap.4. throughout] at the work of this wall, neither bought we any land, and all my youths were gathered thither unto the work, [The one half to labour in the work, and the other half to watch in arms. See ab.chap.4.16.]
\p
\v 17 . Also (there) were at my table an hundred and fifty men of the jews, and of the Rulers, and those that came unto us from the heathen that are round about us. [To wit, to dwell nigh the worship of God, or bring us needful advertisement, or good intelligence.]
\p
\v 18 . And that which was prepared for one day, was one ox, and six choice sheep; [Goats comprehended under them] also fowls were prepared for me, and within ten days of all [that is, all sorts of] wine very much; [Understand withal, there was provision made: or they filled about on the tenth day, the wine without measure, whereas at other times they gave it ordinarily by measure and in a certain quantity or stint] yet for all this [that is, doing thus, not with standing I was at such charges and expences] required not I the bread of the Governor, [As above verse 14.] because the bondage was heavy upon this people.
\p
\v 19 . Remember me, my God for good, all that I have done unto this people. [Not because I have thereby deserved any thing, but because thou hast promised graciously and most favourably to reward what so ever good is done unto thy people. Compare chapter 13. Verse 22.]
\c 6
\s The enemies hearing that the work was almost finished, seek unto Nehemia for a deceitful conference with him without the city, so to get him into their hands, verse 1. Etc. And he wisely giving them a flat denial, they seek to affrighten him off from the work by feigned lies, and false reports of his rebellion against the king, but all in vain, 5. He is also tempted within by hired and false Prophets, yet remaineth undaunted, 10. The treacherous correspondency of some great ones withy the enemy, 17.
\p
\v 1 Moreover, it came to pass, when it was heard by Saneballat, and Tobia, and by Gesem the Arabian, and by our other Enemies, [Hebr. The remnant of our Enemies] that I had built the wall, and (that) there was no breach left therein; neither at this time had I set up the doors in the gates: [Compare above chapter 3. On vers.3.]
\p
\v 2 . Then Saneballat and Gesem sent unto me, to say; come, and let us gather together in the villages, [That is, in one of the villages. See Judg.12.on vers.7.Others, Cephirim, holding it to be a proper name of a place: as Cephira is, below chap.7.29.] in the valley of Ono, [lying in Benjamin, below chapter 11.35.] but they thought to do me mischief. [That is, to kill, destroy me.]
\p
\v 3 . And I sent messengers unto them to say; I do a great work, so that I shall not be able to come down; why should this work cease, whilest I should leave it, and come down to you?
\p
\v 4 . Now they sent (well) four times unto me after the same manner: [Heb. after this same word; and so presently again and in the next verse] and I answered them after the same manner.
\p
\v 5 . Then sent Sanballat his youth unto me in the same manner the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand.
\p
\v 6 . Wherein was written; it is heard among the nations, and Gasmu [Above verse 1. Called Gesen, the Arabian] saith (that) thou and the jews think to rebel, therefore thou buildest the wall, and thou shalt be their king, according as these things are. [That is, according as these things are carried. Oth. according to these words, or, according as the speech goeth. Hebr. According to these words, or matters, things.]
\p
\v 7 . That thou hast also appointed Prophets to proclame of thee at Jerusalem, saying; he is king in Juda; [Hebr. A King in Juda; that is, we have now a king of our own among us] Now it will be heard by the king, according as these things have passed or happened. Oth. according to these words] come now then, and let us take counsel together. [how to prevent that the king of Persia, coming to hear hereof, may not be enraged against us, and intend great mischief both against thee, and against us all.]
\p
\v 8 . But I sent unto him to say, There is nothing done of such things as sayest; but thou feignest them out of thine (own) heart.
\p
\v 9 . For they all sought to make us timorous [Hebr. They all made us timorous; to wit, as much as in them lay, it was their whole aim in all this, that they endeavoured to make us afraid, to put us in fear. See bel. Verse.14. Compare Psal.56.on verse 2. Jer.2.on verse 3.] saying, Their hands shall cease from the work, that it shall not be done: Now then strengthen mine hands. [this is taken by many as Nehemia prayer against the plots and devices of his enemies. Some take it thus; But now, I will strengthen mine hands, or it is to strengthen mine hands: [That is, I will be the more vigilant and couragious against them.]
\p
\v 10 . Now when I came into the house of Semaja [The former plot was laid by the enemies from without; here Nehemiah relateth was practised against him by his false brethren within] the son of Delaja, [In 1 Chron.24.16. there is mention made of one Delaja, that was the chiefest Priest of the three and twenty orders or courses, of whose posterity, some are of opinion that this Semaja was] the son of Mehethabeel (now he was shut up) [feigning that he kept himself alone in his chamber, at or in the Temple (as may be suspected, because the Priests had their chambers there) because of devotion, or some religious vow, that so he might the better deceive Nehemia, under a shew and pretence of holiness, with his Prophesy (as if it came from God) whereof mention is made in the sequel. Compare 1 Sam.21.7.] then said he, let us come together into the house of God, into the midst of the temple, [That is into the Temple] and let us shut the doors of the Temple, for they will come to kill thee, yea they will come by night to kill thee.
\p
\v 11 . But I said, should a man as I, flee? [that have a good conscience, and am fully assured that my work and calling is of God. Hence Nehemia might also gather, that his Prophecy was not of God] and who is there, being as I, that should go into the Temple, that he might remain alive? [as sometimes malefactors seem to save themselves in the house of God. See Exod.21.14. 1 Kings 1.51. and 2.28. neither were the doors in the gates yet hung on, below chap.7.1. so that there being appearance of danger for Nehemia by night, this Semaja feigneth as if he, out of a good affection toward Nehemia, would hide him in the Temple, but it was meer deceit. Oth. and live, or remain alive; as if he had said, I must surely have cause to fear or expect death, if I should go into the Temple against the command of God] I will not go in.
\p
\v 12 . For I perceived, and lo, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this Prophecy against me, because Tobia and Sanballat had hired him. [That is, he pronounced or uttered this Prophecy, not for my good, as he feigned & dissembled, but by the instigation of mine enemies, to make me afraid, and to bring me to shame, as followeth.]
\p
\v 13 . Therefore was he hired that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin; [Against the law of God, and my calling. See above on verse 11.] that they might have something for an evil name, [that is, to make me have an ill name, or to scatter an ill report abroad of me. Compare Eccl.7.on verse 1.] that they might reproach me.
\p
\v 14 . Remember my God, Tobia and Sanballat, according to these his [Oth. their, Hebr. his: which may be applied to one or either of these, or to Semaja, who suffered himself to be hired by them for these wicked practises] works: and also the Prophetess Noadja, [Who did falsely assume this title unto her self] and the rest of the Prophets [Hebr. the remnant of the prophets] that sought to make me afraid. [as above verse 9. See there.]
\p
\v 15 . Now the wall was finished on the five and twentieth day of Elul, [The sixth month of the Jews, agreeing partly with our August, and partly with our September] in two and fifty days. [after they had begun to build. This circumstance serveth for the magnifying the mercy of God shewed to his people in spite of their foes.]
\p
\v 16 . And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard (this,) then all the heathen that were about us feared, and they decayed greatly in their eyes: [That is, their countenance was fallen by reason of discouragement, or they seemed to themselves that they should have no power more to oppose or attempt ought against the jews. Compare Job 12.3. with the annotate.] for they perceived, that this work was done by our God.
\p
\v 17 . Also in those days the Nobles [Hebr. white ones See above chap.2.on verse 16.] of Juda wrote many letters, [Hebr. multiplied their letters] which went unto Tobia wrote back again] came unto them.
\p
\v 18 . For many in Juda had sworn unto him, [Hebr. (were) lords, or masters of the oath, etc. That is, associated and engaged by oath; These were the fruits of forbidden marriages, that are related here in this verse] because he was the son in law [Oth. brother in law] of Secanja, the son of Arab, and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Mesullam the son of Berechja.
\p
\v 19 . Also they reported [Hebr. they were saying,] his good deeds, [Hebr. goodnesse] before my face, they carried my words forth unto him; Tobia (then) sent letters [Oth. that Tobia had sent letters, etc. Taking it for the words, that Nehemia had spoken unto them] to make me fearful. [as verse 9.]
\c 7
\s Nehemia hangeth on the doors of the city-gates, appoointeth the ministers of the Temple, and setteth a strong watch at the city gates, and throughout the whole city, verse 1. Etc. Considereth by Gods instinct and direction, of a way how to furnish Jerusalem with a sufficient store of inhabitants, and to reduce them into good order, for which purpose he findeth good, first of all to assemble all the people together, and to view the genealogies of these that were come up with Zerubbabel out of the captivity, which he findeth, and repeateth the same here again, 4. The free-will-offerings of the Rulers and of the people, 70.
\p
\v 1 . Moreover it came to pass when all the wall was built, that I reared up the doors [In the city-gates. Compare above chap.6.1. and 3.on vers.3.] and the Porters, and the Singers, and the Levites were appointed; [to wit, upon their officers and charges.]
\p
\v 2 . And I gave charge unto my brother Hanani, and Hanaja the commander of the Fort at Jerusalem, [Oth. over, or, concerning Jerusalem, to wit, he gave him charge] for he was a man of faithfulness, [that is he was in deed and in truth a faithful man. See of the like singnification of this particle as, Gen.27.12. and the annotate. There] and fearing God above many.
\p
\v 3 . And I said unto them; let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened, until the Sun be hot; [ That is, until it be broad or high day] and whilest they stand by, let them shut the doors, [to wit, in the Evening] then do ye handle them: [while they etc. To wit, the porters, or those to whom the opening an shutting of the gates was committed; or thus: when they stand by shall have shut the gates, then do ye feel them, to see whether they be shut fast or no, and that because of the multitude of enemies both without and within the city. Oth. whilest they are yet up: to wit, the people] and let watches be set, inhabitants of Jerusalem, everyone in his watch, and every one over against his house.
\p
\v 4 . Now the city was large in space [Or compass. Heb.hands. See Gen.34.21. Judg.18.10. Isa.22.18. with the annotate.] and great, but the people within it [Hebr. in the midst of it] were few, and the houses were not builded. [that is, they were not every where, nor fully builded.]
\p
\v 5 . So my God gave into mine heart, to gather together the Nobles, [Hebr. the white (ones). See above chap.2.on v.16.] and the Rulers, and the people, [that is, to cause them to come up from all places against the first day of the seventh month, to do that which is recorded in the five following chapters] for to reckon the Families of old pertained to Jerusalem, that so the number of the inhabitants might be increased, and others, if need were, might be added to them] And I found the genealogy [Hebr. the book of the genealogy] of those that were come up at the first, [viz. Those that were come up out of captivity with Prince Zerubbabel in the reign of king Cores, or Cyrus] and found written therein (thus):
\p
\v 6 . These are the children of that country that were went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezer king of Babel had carried away; and (which) returned to Jerusalem, and to Juda, every one unto his city: [See of this Register, Ezra 2.on v.2. and the other annotations there on that whole chapter.
\p
\v 7 . Who came with Zerubbabel, Jesua, Nehemia, Azarja, Raamja, Nehamani, Mordechai, bilsan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, (and) Baena. (This) is the number of the men of the people of Israel:

\p
\v 60 . All the Nethinims, and the children of Salomons servants, were three hundred ninety and two.
\p
\v 61 . Also these went up from Thelmelah, Thelharsa, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not shew their Fathers house, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel.

\p
\v 64 . These sought their writing, desiring to reckon their pedigree, but it was not found: Therefore were they as polluted removed from the Priesthood.
\p
\v 65 . And Hertirsatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things: [Hebr. holiness of holinesses] till there stood up a Priest with Urim and Thummim.
\p
\v 66 . This whole congregation together was fourty and two thousand, three hundred and threescore.

Now followeth what was done under the government of Nehemia towards the advancement of Religion and the worship of God, according to the good example mentioned, Ezra 2.68. etc.] Hattirsatha [that is, Nehemia himself, as below chap.8.9. and 10.2. See further, Ezra 2.on vers.63.] gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, [of drams, see Ezra 2.on vers.69.] fifty sprinkling-basins, five hundred and thirty Priests garments.
\p
\v 71 . And (other) of the heads of the Fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of Gold, and in silver two thousand and two hundred pounds. [of pounds, see Ezr 2.on vers.60.]
\p
\v 72 . And that which the rest of the people gave, was twenty thousand drams of gold, and silver two thousand mina’s, [of mina’s, see Ezra .on v.69.] and threescore and seven Priests garments.
\p
\v 73 . And the Priests, and the Levites, and the Porters, and the Singers, and (some) of the people, [see Ezra 2.on vers.70.] and the Nethinims, and all Israel [that were returned out of the Babylonish captivity] dwelt in their cities.
\c 8
\s A relation of the religious order and manner, kept by Ezra and the Levites in the reading and expounding, and by the people in the bearing of the word of God, vers.1, &c. The people being terrified and troubled by the words of the book of the law, are comforted by Nehemia Ezra, and the Levites, and exhorted to rejoice at Gods former and present mercies, 9. The Rulers of the people do further search and inquire by Ezra, into the meaning of Gods word, and finding the law concerning the feast of Leaf-huts, they and all the people keep the same with great zeal and rejoicing, 13.
\p
\v 1 Now when the seventh month [See Ezra 3.on ver.1.] came, and the children of Israel were in their cities.
\p
\v 2 . Then all the people gathered themselves together [See above chapter 7.5.] as one man [see JUdg.20.on vers.1.] in the street before the water gate: [See above chap.3. 26.] and they spake unto Ezra the Scribe, that he should fetch the book of the law of Moseh, [written by Moseh at Gods appointment, and by him also delivered and laid up, to be read at certain times and seasons before all the people. See Deu.31.9, etc and vers.24, etc.] which the LORD had commanded Israel.
\p
\v 3 . And Ezra the Priest brought the law before the Congregation, both men and women [Hebr. from the man to the woman] and all that were of understanding to hear, on the first day of the seventh month.
\p
\v 4 . And he read therein before the street, which is before the water-gate, from the (morning) light until midday, before the men and the women, and those of understanding: and the ears of all the people were the book of the law. [that is, they attended diligently all that while, without wearisomeness or tediousness]
\p
\v 5 . And Ezra stood upon a high wooden chair, [Hebr, upon a tower of wood; so is that chair called, because that for roundness and height it had some resemblance unto a tower] which they had made for that purpose and next to him stood Mattiihja, and Sema, and Anaja, and Uria, and Hilkia, and Maaseja on his right hand, and on his left hand, Pedaja, and Misael, and Malcha, and Hasum, and Hasbaddana, [Or, Hasbedana] Zacharia, (and) Mesullam.
\p
\v 6 . And Ezra opened the book before the eyes of all the people; for he was above all the people: [that is, he stood higher, so that all of them might see him] And when he opened it, all the people stood (up)
\p
\v 7 . And Ezra praised [Hebr. blessed] the LORD, the great God: And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, [See Numb.5.on vers.22.] with lifting up their hands, and (they) bowed themselves, and worshipped the LORD, [or, bowed themselves before the Lord: as above chap.9.3.] with (their) faces to the ground.
\p
\v 8 . Now Jesua, and Bani, and Serebja, Jamin, Akkub, Sabbethai, Hodia, Maaseja, Kelita, Azaria, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaja, and the Levites [Having also their chairs or scaffolds to instruct the Congregation that were divided into sundry parts or parties, as may be gathered from chap.9.4.] instructed the people in the law: And the people stood in their station. [Heb. (were) on their standing; that is, thy stood all in their places, giving diligent attemtion.]
\p
\v 9 . And they read in the book, in the law of God distinct: And expounding [Hebr. setting, or, applying the understanding thereto: Some understanding it of the teachers, and others of the people] the sense, they caused it to be understood in the reading. [oth. they understood it to be understood in the reading. [oth. they understood that; that is, the reading which was read. Oth. in, or, by the Scripture: Seeing the Hebrew may also signify the holy Scripture, because the same ought to be read. Some translate it; in the congregation; as the Hebrew word is elsewhere used.]
\p
\v 10 . And Nehemiah, (the same is Hattirsatha) [See Ezra 2.on vers.63.] and Ezra the Priests, the Scribe, and the Levites that instructed the people, said unto all the people; this day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn (then) not, nor weep: [for the holy Feasts were appointed by God to an holy joy and rejoicing at Gods mercies. See Numb.10.10. Deut.16.1.] for all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law. [understanding out of the law, how often and frequently they had transgressed the same, and provoked Gods just wrath against themselves.]
\p
\v 11 . Moreover he said unto them; go, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them, for whom nothing is prepared, [To wit, unto the poor, to the widows and fatherless, according to the law, Deut.10.11,14. See also Esth.9.19. Rev.11.10.] for this day is holy unto our LORD: be not then grieved, for the joy of the LORD is your strength. [that is, the occasion, which God giveth you to rejoice at in Gods former and present mercies, should comfort your consciences, and put strength and courage into you.]
\p
\v 12 . And the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for this day is holy, therefore be ye not grieved.
\p
\v 13 . Then all the people went their ways, to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, [As verse 11.] and to make great mirth: for they had understood the words which had been made known unto them.
\p
\v 14 . And on the second day were gathered together the heads of the fathers of all the people, the Priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the Scribe, and that for to get understanding in the words of the Law. [Or, that he might instruct, or, inform them, to wit, concerning their duty, towards the law of God.]
\p
\v 15 . And they found written in the law, which the LORD had commanded by the hand [That is, by the ministry] of Moseh, that the children of Israel should dwell in leaf-huts, o the Feast, in the seventh month.
\p
\v 16 . And that they should publish it [Hebr. cause it to be heard] and cause a voice to pass throughout all their cities, and at Jerusalem, [See of this phrase Ezra 1.on verse 1. See likewise concerning the proclaiming or publishing of Feasts, the commandment of God, Levit.23.4.] saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch branches [Heb. leaves, that is boughs, or branches with leaves: and so in the sequel. Compare Levit.23.40.] of olive-trees, and branches of (other) oil-trees, [Oth. Pine trees] and branches of Myrtle trees, and branches of palm-trees, and branches of (other) close trees, [That are full of branches and leaves] to make leaf-huts, as it is written.
\p
\v 17 . So the people went forth, and fetch them, and made themselves leaf-huts, every one upon his roof, [For the tops or roofs of the houses in those Countries, were flat. See Deut.22.on verse 8.] and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, [See 2 Chron.23.on verse 5.] and in the street of the water-gate, and in the street of Ephraims gate.
\p
\v 18 . And all the congregation of those that were come again out of the captivity, made leaf-huts, and dwelt in those leaf-huts, for the children of Israel had not done so [With such zeal, and joy, as is express in the following verse] since the days of Jesua, [This is Jesua, who was the first that brought Israel into the land of Promise. See the book of Jesua] the sun of Nun, unto this day; and there was very great rejoicing.
\p
\v 19 . And they read in the book of the Law of God day by day, from the first day unto the last day: [Keeping thus daily holy assemblies, which otherwise was wont to be done chiefly on the first and last day. This was a token of their special zeal and joy in Gods special grace and favour. See Levit.23.35,36. And compare Deut.31.10,11,12,13.] and they kept the Feast seven days, and on the eighth day the prohibition-day, [See Levit.23.on verse 36.] according to the right.
\c 9
\s The people of God keep a solemn day of humiliation, wherein the Levites spend one fourth part of the day in reading unto the people out of the book of the Law of God, and another fourth part of the day in confessing their sins before the LORD, vers.1. etc. With a very excellent and holy prayer, wherein they praise God, declare his mercies shewed to Abraham and his seed until their time, and confess the manifold unthankfulness of the people, and in an humble manner represent unto God their present sad and distressed condition: whereby they bind and engage themselves a new, making withal and singing a covenant to obedience unto God, that they may turn away all deserved punishments for the future, etc.
\p
\v 1 Moreover, on the four and twentieth day of this month, [To wit, of the seventh month, as ab.chap.8.1. when the joyful Feast of leaf-huts was ended with the two and twentieth day to the said month] the children of Israel assembled themselves with fasting, and with sacks, [See Gen.37.on verse 34.] and earth was upon them. [In token of their nothingness and upon them. [In token of their nothingness and unworthiness, as also of their humiliation before the LORD, and repentance for their sins. Compare 2 Sam.1.on verse 2.]
\p
\v 2 . And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers: [That is, foreign heathens, which pertained not to the holy fellowship and communion of Israel. Hebr. children of the stranger. Compare below chap.13.3.] and they stood and made confession of their sins, and of the iniquities of their fathers.
\p
\v 3 . For when they stood up in their station, then they [To wit, the Levites. Compare chap.8.7,8.] read in the book of the Law of the LORD their God, one fourth part of the day, [That is three hours; for the day was divided into twelve hours, John 11.9. It is to be imagined that they met together three hours in the fore –noon and three hours in the after-noon. Oth. fourtimes a day, and so in the sequel.] and (another) fourth part they made confession, and worshipped the LORD their God.
\p
\v 4 . Now Jesua, and Bani, and Kadmiel, Sebanja, Bunni, Serebja, Bani, (and) Chenani stood upon an high scaffold of the Levites, and cried [Hebr. high-place, exalted place, high-chair, or pulpit, etc. Not that they all stood close together upon one pulpit or scaffold, and cried all at together, (which would have been a very absurd and confused business) but every one of them stood upon his own pulpit before a particular part of the congregation, that they might not hinder or interrupt one another, but might conveniently administer unto all parts or parties of the people. Compare above chap.3.on vers.8.] with a loud [Hebr. great] voice unto the LORD their God.
\p
\v 5 . And the Levites, Jesua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hasabneja, Serebja, Hodia, Sebanja, Petha chja, said; Stand up, praise [Hebr. Bless] the LORD your God from everlasting to everlasting; and let men praise [Hebr. let them bless] the Name of thy glory, [That is, thy glorious Name. Compare Acts 7.2. 1 Cor.2.8.] which is exalted above all land [Hebr. blessing,] and praise. [That is, which is so high and glorious, that we cannot sufficiently land and praise the same.]
\p
\v 6 . Thou art that LORD alone, thou hast made the heaven, the heaven of heavens, [The third and highest heaven. See 1 Kings 8.27. 2 Cor.12.2.] and all their host, [See Gen.2.verse 1.] the earth and all that is therein, the seas and all that is therein, [See Gen.1.1, &c. Psal.146.6. Acts 14.14. and 17.24. Revel.14.7.] and thou makest them all alive, [That is, thou maintainest and preservest them in their being, which thou hast given them] and the host of the heavens [See Gen.2.1. verse 1.] worshippeth thee. [That is, honoureth, obeyeth, and serveth thee, every one in his kind, and according unto thy holy will.]
\p
\v 7 . Thou art that LORD, the God, who didest chuse Abraham, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldeans, [See Gen.11.31,32. And 12.1.] and thou put tedst his name Abraham. [See Gen.17.5.]
\p
\v 8 . And thou hast found his faithful before thy face, [See Gen.15.6.] and hast made a covenant with him, to give the land of the Canaanites, the Nethites, the Amorites, the Pherezites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgasites, to give it unto his seed; [See Gen.12.7. and 13.15. and 15.18. and 17.8. and 26.4.] and thou hast confirmed thy words, because thou art righteous. [Keeping thy promises unto thy people, and justly punishing the wicked.]
\p
\v 9 . And thou hast regarded the affliction of our fathers in Egypt; [See Exod.3.7.] and thou hast heard their cry at the Reed-sea, [See Exod.14.10.]
\p
\v 10 . And thou hast done [Hebr. given, made, appointed,] tokens and wonders upon Pharao, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land; [See Exod.chapters 7,8,10,11,12,14.] for thou knowest that they dealt proudly against them, and thou hast made thee a name as it is this day.
\p
\v 11 . And thou hast cloven the sea before their face (so) that they went through the midst of the sea, on the dry (land); and their persecutors hast thou thrown into the deeps, as stone into mighty waters. [See Exod.14.22. &c.]
\p
\v 12 . And thou hast led them in the day by a cloudy pillar, and in the night by fiery pillar to light them in the way wherein they should walk. [See Exod.13.21. and 14.19 and 40.38. Psal.105.39.]
\p
\v 13 . And thou camest down upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven: [That is, out of the sky. See Exod.19.20. and 20.1, &c.] and gavest them righteous judgments, and faithful laws, [Hebr. laws of faithfulness, or truth] good statutes and commandments.
\p
\v 14 . And thou hast made known unto them thine holy Sabbath: and thou hast commanded them precepts, and statutes, and a law by the hand [That is, ministry] of thy servant Moses.
\p
\v 15 . And thou hast given them bread from heaven [That is, from the Air] for their hunger [See Exod.16.14.] and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst: [See Exod.17.6. Num.20.9.] And thou hast said unto them, that they should go in to inherit the land, concerning which thou didst lift up thine hand, that thou wouldest give it unto them. [That is, which thou swarest to give them. See Gen.14.on verse 22.]
\p
\v 16 . But they, and our fathers have dealt proudly: and they have hardened their neck, [See Exod.32.on verse 9.] and not hearkened to thy Commandments.
\p
\v 17 . And they refused to hear, and remembered not thy wonders which thou didst among them, and hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed and head to return to their bondage: [See Numb.14.4.] But thou (being) a God of forgiving, [That is, who pardonest many and great sins] gracious, and merciful, long-suffering, and great of kindness, [or goodness, favourableness. So verse 32. See Exod.34 7. Numb.14.18. Psal.86.5.] not withstanding didst not forsake them.
\p
\v 18 . Even, when they had made them a molten calf, and said; This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt; [See Exod.32.1, etc.] and had committed great vices.
\p
\v 19 . Yet thou through thy great [Or, many. So verse 27.31.] mercies didst not forsake them in the wilderness, The pillar of cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way, nor the pillar of fire by night, to light them, and that in the way, wherein they should walk. See Exod.13.22. and 40.38.]
\p
\v 20 . And thou hast given thy good Spirit to instruct them: [See Num.11.17.] and thou hast not removed thy Manna from their mouth, [See Jos.5.12.] and thou hast given them water for their thirst.
\p
\v 21 . So thou hast sustained them fourty years in the wilderness, they had no want; they clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not. [See Deut.2.7. and 8.4. and 29.5.]
\p
\v 22 . Moreover, thou hast given them kingdoms and nations, and hast divided them into corners: [Or, countries. Some understand this of the children of Israel, unto whom the Lord divided the lands and countries which they had taken, unto every one his inheritace. Others understand it of the conquered enemies, whom God thrust here and there into corners, so that his people freely took and hereditarily possessed the land, and continued in the hereditary possession thereof] So they possessed hereditarily the land of Sihon, [See Numb.21.21.] to wit, the land of the king of Hesbon, [Meaning the land which the King of the Moabites had formerly possessed, and which was taken away from him by king Sihon. See Numb.21.26,27.] and the land of Og king of Basan.
\p
\v 23 . Thou hast also multiplied their children as the stars of heaven: [See Gen.2.17.] And thou hast brought them into the land concerning which thou hadst said unto their fathers, that they should go in to possess it hereditarily.
\p
\v 24 . So the children came in, and took possession of that land hereditarily, and thou hast subdued before their face the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and hast given into their hand, together with their kings, and the nations of the land, to do with them according to their good pleasure. [See Jos.chapters 1,2,3 etc.]
\p
\v 25 . And they took fenced cities, and a fat land, and possessed hereditarily, houses full of all [That is, all manner of] good, wells hewen out, vineyards, olive-yards, and trees of meat, [That is, trees bearing estable fruits] in abundance: and they did eat, and were satisfied, and became fat, and lived in pleasure, through thy great goodness. [Or delighted themselves in thy great good; that is, in the great and many good things, which thou gavest them.]
\p
\v 26 . But they grew refractory, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their back, [Compare Psal.50.on verse 17. Ezech.23.35, &c.] and slew the Prophets [See 1 Kings 18 4. And 19.4. 2 Chron.24.20.] which testified against them, [Or among them: so verse 29,30,34.] to cause them to return unto thee: So they committed great vices.
\p
\v 27 . Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their distressors who distressed them: [See Judg.2.14, &c.] But when in the time of their distress they cried unto thee, thou heardest from heaven, and according to thy great mercies gavest them deliverers, who delivered them out of the hand of their distressors.
\p
\v 28 . But when they had rest, they returned again to do evil before thy face; so thou leftist them in the hand of their enemies, (so) that they bare sway over them: when they then returned, and cried unto thee, then thou didst hear from heaven, and didst many times rescue them according to thy mercies.
\p
\v 29 . And thou hast testified against them, to cause them to return unto thy Law, but they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, and they sinned against thy rights, against the same, by which a man that doth them shall live: [See Levit.18 5. Ezech.20.11. Rom.10.5. Gal.3.12.] and they have drawn back their shoulder [Heb. given a back-sliding shouldier. A similitude borrowed from beasts that will not bear the yoke or burden] and hardened their neck, [See Exod.32.on verse 9.] and hearkened not.
\p
\v 30 . Yet many years [As long as the Kingdoms of Juda and Israel continued] didst thou forbear over them, [Thou hadst patience with them, and sparedst them, delaying the punishment] and testifiedst against them by thy Spirit, by the ministry [Hebr. hand] of thy Prophets, but they enclined not the ear; [See 2 Kings 17.13, 14. 2 Chron.36.15, 16.] therefore thou gavest them into the hand of the nations of the countries.
\p
\v 31 . But through thy great mercies, didst not utterly consume them [Hebr. thou didst make them no finishing nor destruction. Compare Jer.4.27. with the annotate.] nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God.
\p
\v 32 . Now then, O our God, thou great, thou mighty ad thou terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy; let not all the foil [that is, all the punishments and miseries that have come upon us] be mean before thy face, that hath befallen [Heb. found] us, our kings, our Princes, and our Priests, and our Prophets, and our Fathers, and all thy people; from the days of the kings of Assur, [That is, Assyria] unto this day.
\p
\v 33 . Yet thou art righteous in all that is come upon us, [Compare Deut.32.4. Dan.9.24.] for thou hast dealt faithfully, [Hebr. done truth, or faithfulness] but we have dealt wickedly.
\p
\v 34 . And our Kings, our Princes, our Priests, and our Fathers, have not done thy Law; and they have not listened unto thy commandments, and unto thy testimonies which thou didst testify against them.
\p
\v 35 . For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy manifold goodness that thou gavest them, and in that large and that fat land which thou hadst given before their face; [That is, hadst set open and delivered unto them, that they might take it, and possess it. SO elsewhere often] neither have they turned themselves from their wicked ways.
\p
\v 36 . Behold, we are servants this day; yea, the land which thou gavest unto our fathers, to eat the fruit thereof, and the good thereof, behold we are servants in it.
\p
\v 37 . And it [To wit, the land] multiplieth its increase, [Oth. its increase, or profit is great, or manifold] for the kings thou hast set over us [as if they should say, though the land yield much increase, yet we are never the better for it, it’s not for us, but for strange kings that rule over us] because of our sins; and they have dominion over our bodies, and over our beasts, according to their pleasure; Thus are we in great distress.
\p
\v 38 . And in all this [Or because of all this; to wit, all this evil that is come upon us, and presseth us still at present; or from all this; that is to testify, that we mean all this truly and sincerely, and engage our selves unto true repentance, to turn away thy just wrath, and to be made partakers of thy blessing. See below chap.10.29.] we make a sure (covenant) [See Gen.15.on verse 17, 18. Hebr. a sureness, or firmness] and write it: and our Princes, our Levites, (and) our Priests shall seal it. [Hebr. (are, or shall be) for, or, at the sealing, or the thing sealed, to wit, in the name of us all. Oth. for, or over the sealing (were) &c. Meaning that confession ended with the former verse, and that now in this last verse is further related, what they did after the confession, to make it effectual and prevailing: Therefore they annex this verse to the following chapter, and render it thus: Now of all this we made a sure covenant, and wrote it, etc.]

Now for the sealings [Hebr. for the thing sealed, or, sealings; Meaning, those that ratified and confirmed the covenant (whereof was spoken in the end of the former chapter) with their seals, in the name, and in the behalf of all the Congregation] were, Nehemia Hattirsatha, [See Ezra 2.on verse 63.] son of Hathalja, and Zidkia.

\p
\v 29 . They clave to their brethren, their excellent (ones) [Or, honourable, great (ones) who were appointed to seal this covenant in the name of the whole Congregation. See Psal.8.on verse 2.] and entered into the curse, and into the oath, [That is, they likewise entered into this covenant, which was confirmed with an oath, and cursing of their persons, if they should chance to transgress this covenant. See Deut.29.12,14,19. And compare Jos.24.25. 2 Kings 23.3. 2 Chron.15.12.] to walk in the law of God which was given by the hand of Moseh the servant of God; and to observe and do all the commandments of the LORD our Lord, and his judgements, and his statutes:
\p
\v 30 . And that we would not give our daughters unto the nations of the land, [To wit, give them in marriage unto the heathen] nor take their daughters for our sons.
\p
\v 31 . Also when the nations of the land bring wares, and all corn [That is, all manner of corn, as Rie, Wheat, Barley. See Gen.24.on verse 1.] on the Sabbath day, to sell, that we would not take it of them on the Sabbath, or on (another) holy day; [See Exod.20.10. and 34.21. Levit.23.2, &c. Deut.5.12,13,17, &c.] And that we would release the seventh year [the same being a year of release, wherein God had commanded to omit the tilling of the ground, and the exacting of debts. See Exod.23.10,11. Levit.25.4. Deut.15.1,2, etc.] together with all manner of grievances [Hebr. the burden, or grievance of all (or every) hand: that is, all manner of debt, which we otherwise had power to demand, require, or exact; or the requiring, demanding of all (or every) debt. See Deut.15.on verse 2. And ab. Ch.5,7,10.]
\p
\v 32 . Moreover, we set up commandments [Or ordinances, which are related in the following words] for our selves, imposing upon our selves a third part of a shekel [understand here the shekel of the sanctuary, being as much again as the common or civil shekel, to, to wit, about a half Rycks Doller] yearly, for the service of the house of our God; [this was a voluntary contribution towards the maintaining the worship of God, set up for the present necessity. Compare 2 Chr.26.26,27. & 2 Chr.31.3. Of the ordinary tax that was enjoined, see Ex.30.12.]
\p
\v 33 . For the bread of disposition [That is, shew-bread. See Levit.24.6, &c. 2 Chron.2.4. and 29.18.] and the continual meat-offering, [See Exod.29 40. Num.28.5.] and for the continual burnt-offering, of the Sabbaths, of the new-moons, [See Numb.28 and 29.] for the set feasts, and for the holy things, [which were to be consecrated for thank-offerings for the people] and for the sin offerings, to make an atonement for Israel; and for all the work of the house of our God.
\p
\v 34 . Also we cast the lots among the Priests, the Levites, and the People, concerning the wood-offering, to bring it unto the house of our God, after the house of our fathers, [That is, according to the families and households, to know how much wood every one was to bring in toward the burning of the sacrifices] at times appointed, year by year, to burn upon the altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the Law.
\p
\v 35 . Also that we should bring in the first-fruits of our land, [That is, the fruits of the ground, as Rie, Wheat, Barley, &c.] and the first-fruits of all fruit of all [That is, all manner of] trees, year by year, unto the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 36 . And the first-born of our sons, and of our beasts, [Meaning a certain price or sum money wherewith they were to redeem the first-born sons, and the unclean cattle, as horses, asses, camels, &c. See Exod.13.13. Lev.27. verse 11,12,13,26,27.] as it is written in the Law; [See Exod.13.2. Num.3.13. and 8.17.] and that we should bring the first-born of our bullocks, and of our sheep, [That is, of great and small cattle] unto the house of our God, unto the Priests that minister in the house of our God.
\p
\v 37 . And that we should bring the first-fruits of our dough, and our heave-offerings, [Or, heavings. See Lev.23.17. Num.15.19.] and the fruit of all trees, new wine and oil, [See Num.18.12. Deut.18.4.] unto the Priests into the chambers of the house of our God, and the tenths of our land unto the Levites? [See Num.18.24,25.] and that the same Levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage, [Oth. that the same Levites might give the tithes, etc. To wit unto the high Priests, whereof in the following verse Heb. the tithing. See Gen.28.22. Deut.14.22. and 26.12.]
\p
\v 38 . and that there shall be a Priest a son of Aaron,with the Levites, when the Levites receive [Or, give,: as in the former verse] tithes; and that the Levites should bring up the tithes unto the house of our God, into the chambers of the treasure-house. [See Numb.18.26.]
\p
\v 39 . For the children of Israel, and the children of Levi ought to bring the heave-offering of corn, new wine, and oil into those chambers, because the vessels of the Sanctuary are there, and the Priests that minister, [Or, where also the vessels, etc.] and the Porters, and the Singers; that so we might not forsake the House of our God.
\c 11
\s A Register of those that took their habitations in Jerusalem by certain order, verse 1.etc. The rest of the people is divided into the other cities, towns and villages of Juda and Benjamin, 25.
\p
\v 1 Moreover, the Rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem [See above chap.7.4,5.] but the rest of the people cast lots, to bring out one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem, the holy city, [Hebr. city of holiness; so below verse 18.] and nine parts [Hebr. hands] in the (other) cities.
\p
\v 2 . And the people blessed all the men, that wittingly offered (themselves) to dwell at Jerusalem. [That is, they highly commended them, and wished the blessing of the Lord to light upon them, because of their own accord, without tarrying for the lot, they offered themselves to dwell at Jerusalem; for as much as this city was (as it were) the mother and preservation of them all, and without valiant and courageous inhabitants could not be kept and preserved against the policy & power of the enemies, and the same being kept and preserved, the other places which the enemies look not at, had no need to fear.]
\p
\v 3 . And these are the heads of the country, [Or Province, meaning Judea, the same being at that time as a Province under the Persian Empire and Dominion] that dwelt at Jerusalem; But in the cities of Juda dwelt every one in his possession in their cities, Israel [by Israel in this place, some understand those of Juda, as 2 Chron.21.on verse 2. Others understand thereby some of the ten tribes, that for Religions sake had joined themselves unto Juda. See 1 Chron.9.3.] the Priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinims [See Ezra 2.on v.43.] and the children of Salomons servants [See Ezra 2.on v.55.]
\p
\v 4 . At Jerusalem there dwelt (some) of the children of Juda, and of the children of Benjamin; of the children of Juda, Athaja the son of Uzzia, the son of Zacharja, the son of Amarja, the son of Shepharja, the son of Mahalaleel, of the children of Perez.
\p
\v 5 . And Maaseja the son of Baruch, the son of Col-hose, the son of Hazeja, the son of Adaja, the son of Jojarib, the son of Zacharja, the son of Siloni.
\p
\v 6 . All the children of Perez, that dwelt at Jerusalem men. [Or, able, rich men. Hebr. men of valour; or ability.]
\p
\v 7 . And these are the children of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Mesullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaija, the son of Kelaja, the son of Maaseja, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jesaja.
\p
\v 8 . And after him, Gabbai, Sallai; nine hundred twenty and eight.
\p
\v 9 . And Joel, the son of Zichri, was overseer over them; and Juda, the son of Senua, was the second over the city.
\p
\v 10 . Of the Priests; Jedaja the son of Jojarib, Jachin,
\p
\v 11 . Seraja the son of Hilkia, the son of Mesullam, the son of Zadok, the son of merajoth, the son of Ahitub, was leader, [Or, Duke. See 1 Chron.9. on verse 11.] of the house of God.
\p
\v 12 . And their brethren, that did the work in the house, [To wit in the house of God, that is the Temple, managing all businesses that pertained to the service of God] were eight hundred twenty and two; and Adaja, the son of Jeroham, the son of Palalja, the son of Amzi, the son of Zecharja, the son of Pashur, the son of Malchia.
\p
\v 13 And his brethren, heads of the fathers, were two hunderd forty and two. And Amassai the son of Azareel, the son of Achzai, the son of Mesillemoth, the son of Immer.
\p
\v 14 . And their brethren valiant champions, were an hundred twenty and eight; and the overseer over them was Zabdict the son of Gedolim. [Hebr. Haggedolim. Oth. of (one) of the great ones.]
\p
\v 15 . And of the Levites; Semaja the son of Hassub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hasabja, the son of Bani.
\p
\v 16 . And Sabbethai, and Jozabad, of the heads of the Levites were over the outwork of the house of God. [Meaning to order and manage affairs out of the Temple that were requisite to the service of God, and to gather in the money which the congregation had freely undertaken to contribute to that end, as was related above chap.10.32,33. Compare 1 Chron.26.on verse 29.]
\p
\v 17 . And Mathanja the son of Micha, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph was the head, who begun the thanksgiving in prayer, [As being the chief singer, the tuner of the Psalms and Hymns or songs of Praise, that first began the Psalm or song] and Bakkbukia was the second of his brethren; and Abda the son of Summua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.
\p
\v 18 . All the Levites, in the holy city [Namely Jerusalem] were two hundred fourscore and four.
\p
\v 19 . And the Porters, Akkub, Talmon, with their brethren that kept watch [Or, the watchmen] at the gates, were an hundred seventy and two.
\p
\v 20 . Now the rest of Israel [See on verse 3.] of the Priests, (and) the Levites, were all in the cities of Juda, every one in his inheritance. [See below on verse 36.]
\p
\v 21 . And the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel; [As above chap.3.26.] and Ziha and Gispa were over the Nethinims.
\p
\v 22 . And the overseer of the Levites at Jerusalem, was Uzzi, the son of Bani, the son of Hasabja, the son of Mattanja, the son of Micha; of the children of Asaph were the Singers over against the work of the House of God. [That is, these were to be at hand, and to be present in the Temple, to mind and heed the daily necessaries of the service of God, as others heeded or minded the outward business of Gods worship ab.verse 16. See bel. Chap.12.9.]
\p
\v 23 . For there was a commandment of the king concerning them; to wit, a certain maintenance for the Singers every days (allowance) in its day. [Heb. sureness, faithfulness, certainty; (as above chap.9.38.) that is here, a sure rent, revenue, or income, or a certain stipend, allowance or maintenance to be allowed out of the kings treasure. Oth.a sure rent for the Singers; which they understand thus, that they were intrusted by the king to receive money of his Commissary, and to lay it out for daily necessaries for the service of God. See Ezra 6.8,9. And 7.20,21,22.]
\p
\v 24 . And Petahja the son of Mesezabeel, of the children of Zerah, the son of Juda, was at the kings hand, [That is, the kings Commissioner. Compare 1 Chron.18.17.] in all matters unto the people. [Or in all (or every) word unto the people, or of the people; that is in that which was to be presented unto the people from the king, or in the kings name, or in that which the people had to do with the king; item to get in and demand the kings revenues, and to see them laid out and disburses according to the kings order and commission. See Ezra 6.8.]
\p
\v 25 . Now in the villages in their fields (some) of the children of Juda dwelt in Kiriath-Arba [Of this and all the following places, see Jos.15.13, 21, &c. And 18.22. and 19.2, &c.] and her dependant places, [Hebr. daughters; so in the following words, and elsewhere often] and in Dibon, and her dependant places, and in Jakabzeel and her villages.
\p
\v 26 . And at Jesua, and at Molada, and at Beth-Pelet,
\p
\v 27 . And at Hazar-Sual, and in Beerseba, and her dependant places,
\p
\v 28 . And at Ziglag, and in Mechona, and her dependant places,
\p
\v 29 . And at En.Rimmon, and at Zora, and at Jarmuth.
\p
\v 30 . Zamoth, Adullam and their villages, Lachis, and her fields, Azeka and her dependant places; and they camped themselves from Beerseba unto the valley of Hinnom. [That is, they inhabited all that country, making shift to dwell there as well as they could, repairing the decayed places by little and little, &c.]
\p
\v 31 . Now the children of Benjamin, from Geba (dwelt) in, Michmas, and Aija, and Bethel, and their dependant places,

\p
\v 36 . Now of the Levites, (some dwelt in) the divisions of Juda, (and) Benjamin. [The places that by Gods appointment were allotted unto the Levites from those two tribes.]
\c 12
\s A Register of the Priests and Levites that were come out of the captivity with Zerubbabel, verse 1, etc. The succession of the high Priests from Jesua unto Jaddua, 10. A Register of the chief Priests that succeeded in the room of those before mentioned, 12. A description of the chief of the Levites, 22. A relation of the dedication of the walls of Jerusalem, 27. The appointing of Treasurers over the goods or estates of Priests and Levites, 44.
\p
\v 1 Now these are the Priests and the Levites, [Meaning the chief and the rulers of the Priests and Levites, as may be gathered from verse 7.2,23,24.] that went up with Zerubbabel [See Ezra 2.on verse 2.] the son of Seathiel, and Jesua; [Who was the high Priests] Seraja, Jeremia, Ezra.
\p
\v 2 . Amarja, Maluch, [This man, and some others are named otherways, below from verse 14.to 21. After the manner of the Hebrews] Hattus,
\p
\v 3 . Sechanja, Rehun, Merimoth,
\p
\v 4 . Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abja,
\p
\v 5 . Mijamim, Maadja, Bilga,
\p
\v 6 . Semaja, Amok, Hilkja, Jedaja; those were the heads of the Priests, and their brethren in the days of Jesua.
\p
\v 7 . Sallu, Amok, Hilkja, JEDAJA; those were the heads of the Priests, and their brethren in thedays of Jesua.
\p
\v 8 . And the Levites were; Jesua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Serebja, Juda, Matthanja; he [Namely Matthanja. See above chap.11.17.] and his brethren were over the thanksgivings. [That is, they were the chief singing-masters in the singing of Psalms of praise and thanksgiving; as ab.chap.11.17.]
\p
\v 9 . And Bakbukja, and Unni, their brethren were over against them in the watches. [That is, were present with or about the singers, to wait upon their office or ministry. See ab.chap.11.on verse 22. And concerning the courses of the singers, see the ordinance of David, 1 Chron.25 9,&c. But at this time they were fewer in number. See Ezra 2.verse.39.]
\p
\v 10 . Now Jesua begat Jojakim, and Jojakim begat Eljasib, and Elijasib begat Jojada.
\p
\v 11 . And Jojada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua, [This Jadua is conceived to have been the high Priest Jaddus of whom Josephus writteth, that Alexander the Great coming in an hostile manner against Jerusalem, he in his high Priests attire went out of the city to meet him, and appeased him. Whence some conjecture, that Nehemia lived to the end of the Persian Empire, and in that regard was able to write this Register of the succession of high Priests till that time, there being as yet not full threescore years expired, from the time of Artaxerxes Mnemon (whose servant some hold Nehemia to have been) unto the end of the Persian, and the beginning of the Grecian Monarchy. Others conceive that Nehemia (who, according to their opinion, dead, this Register was here inserted by another man of God by inspiration of the holy Ghost to preserve the sucession of high Priests in the Church of God.]
\p
\v 12 . And in the days of Jojakim, [Who was high Priest after his father Jesua, verse 10.] were Priests the heads of the fathers; [That is, the chiefst among the Priests, as was shewed on verse 1.] of Seraja, was Meraja; [That was, of Seraja was born or descended Meraja succeeding in his room, therefore others render this thus, for Seraja, that is in his stead or room, and so in the sequel] of Jeremja, Hananja;
\p
\v 13 . Of Ezra, Mesullam, of Amarja, Johanan,
\p
\v 14 .Of Melichu, Jonathan; of Sebanja Joseph:
\p
\v 15 . Of Hurim, Adna; of Merajoth, Helki:
\p
\v 16 . Of Iddo, Zacharia: Of Ginnethon, Mesullam:
\p
\v 17 . Of Abja, Zichri: of Minjamin, and Moadja, Piltai:
\p
\v 18 . Of Bilga, Sammua; of Semaja, Jonathan:
\p
\v 19 . And of Jorib, Matthenai; of Jedaja, Uzzi:
\p
\v 20 . Of Sullai, Kallai; Of Amok, Hobe:
\p
\v 21 . Of Hilkia, Hasubja; of Jedaja, Nethaneel:
\p
\v 22 . Of the Levites in the days of Eljasib, Jojada, and Johanan, and Jaddua the heads of the fathers were recorded: together with the Priests until the reign of Darius the Persian. [To wit, the last king of Persia called Codamanus, whom Alexander the great conquered: with whom the Persian Monarchy ended, about the year of the creation of the world 36 42. Before Christs incarnation, 3 29. According to the computation of some Chronologies.]
\p
\v 23 . The children of Levi, the heads of the fathers, were recorded in the book of the Chronicles [See 1 Chron.9.10, &c.] until the days of Johanan [above vers.13.called Jonathan, the father of Jaddua] the son [That is, is, Grand-son, or Grand-child, the sons son] of Eljasib.
\p
\v 24 . The heads then of the Levites were Hasabja, Serebja, and Jesua the son of Kadmiel, and their brethren over against them, to praise (and) to give thanks according to the commandment of David the man of God, [See Judg.13.on verse 6.] ward against ward. [That is, they executed their office or ministry by turns, or courses one for another, according to the ordinance of David. See 1 Chron.25.so ab.verse 8.]
\p
\v 25 . Matthanja, and Bakbukja, Obabja, Mesullam, Talmon, (and) Akub were Porters, keeping the watch, by the Treasuries [See below verse 43. And chap.13.5. item 1 Chron.26.on verse 17. Hebr. Asuppim] of the gates.
\p
\v 26 . These were in the days of Jojakim the son of Jesua the son of Jozadak; and in the days of Nehemia the governor, and of Ezra the Priest the Scribe.
\p
\v 27 . Now at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem [Which was performed with prayers, thanksgivings, offering, and outward tokens of spiritual Joy before the Lord, as followeth. Compare Exod.40. Numb.7. Deut. 20. On verse 5. And 1 Kings 8 63. Ezra 6 17 &c. Job.10 22.] they sought the Levites out of all their places, [whither they with others were returned to the great congregation, whereof ab.chap.9. and 10.] to bring them to Jerusalem: to perform the dedication with joy, and with thanksgivings, and with singing, cymbals, Lutes, and with harps.
\p
\v 28 . So the children of the Singers were gathered together, both out of the plain field round about Jerusalem, and from the villages [Or farms, so verse 29.] of Netophau; [Or of the Netophathites.]
\p
\v 29 . And from the house of Gilgal, [Or place of Gilgal, Hebr. Beth-Gilgal, see Deut.11.30. Jos.5.9.] and out of the fields of Gebas, [See Jos.21.17.] and Azmaveth; [ab. Chap.7.28. is mentioned Beth-Azmaveth] for the Singers had built them villages round about Jerusalem, [because all was exceedingly wasted and destroyed by the Babylonian wars, and because they may be near hand for to exercise their function and the worship of God. See ab.chap.11.on v.20. and 30.]
\p
\v 30 . And the Priests and the Levites purified themselves: [Compare Gen.35.on verse 2. Exod.19.10,15. Numb.19. 2 Chron.29 5,15.16, etc. And Ezra 6.20,21.] after that they purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.
\p
\v 31 . Then I caused the Princes of Juda to go up upon the wall: and I appointed two great thanksgiving-quires and circuits, (the one) on the right hand upon the wall, [Of the other company of those that gave thanks, see v.38.] toward the dung-gate. [Compare this description of the wall, with ab.chap.2.13,14.15. and chap.3. and see the annotate. There.]
\p
\v 32 . And after them went Hosaja, and half of the Princes of Juda.
\p
\v 33 . And Azarja, Ezra, and Mesullam,
\p
\v 34 . Juda, and Benjamin, and Semaja, and Jeremja,
\p
\v 35 . And (certain) of the Priests children with trumpets: Zacharja the son Jonathan, the son of Semaja, the son of Matthanja, the son of Michaja, the son of Zacchur, the son of Asaph:
\p
\v 36 . And his brethren, Semaja, and Azareel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Juda, Hanani, with musical Instruments of David, [That is, which were invented, or ordained and delivered by David] the man of God: [That is, the Prophet, as above verse 24.] and Ezra the Scribe (went) before their face.
\p
\v 37 . Moreover toward the Fountain-gate, and over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, unto the water-gate, eastward.
\p
\v 38 . Now the second thanksgiving-quire they went over against (them) [To wit, on the otherside of the city, that both companies might meet one another at last and go together to the Temple. See verse 40.] and after them, with the half of the people upon the all, from above the tower of the Baking-ovens, unto the broad wall.
\p
\v 39 . And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above, [Oth. toward; and so in the sequel] the Old-gate, and above the Fish-gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Mea unto the Sheeps-gate. And they stood still in the Prison-gate. [Hebr. stood in, or by the gate of Custody; that is, the Prison, as Jer.32.2.]
\p
\v 40 .Then stood both the thanksgiving quires in the house of God; and I, and the half of the Rulers with me.
\p
\v 41 . And the Priests, Eljakim, Maaseja, Minjamin,Michaja, Elioenai, Zacharja, Hananja, with trumpets.
\p
\v 42 . Moreover, Maaseja, and Semaja, and Eliazar, and Uzzi, and Johanan, and Malchia, and Elam, and Ezer, also the Singers caused themselves to be heard, with Jzrahia the overseer.
\p
\v 43 . And they offered the same day great slay-offerings, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy, the wives also and the children rejoice: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard afar off.
\p
\v 44 . Also the same day were men appointed over the chambers, for the treasures, [Compare below cha.13.5,12,13. And ab.ch.10.37.38.] for the heave-offerings, for the first fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, out of the fields of the cities, [That is, which lay round about the cities] the portions of the Law, for the Priests and for the Leviets; [That is, which were ordained in the law, for the Priests, &c. To the bringing up of which portions they had bound themselves anew, ab.c.10.35, &c.] for Juda rejoiced for the Priests, and for the Levites, [Hebr. (there was) joy, or gladness of Juda; or the joy of Juda (was) for the etc.] that stood there, [that is, that waited diligently and faithfully on their ministry, and therein intended to proceed, whereas they were formerly scattered up and down the country for want of maintenance, which now was willingly brought in with joy and rejoicing. Compare below ch.13.10.]
\p
\v 45 . And also the singers and the porters kept the watch of their God, [Taking care that the worship of God might be well performed in all its circumstances thereto belonging. See Lev.18.on ver.35.] and the watch of the purification: [as above vers.30.] according to the commandment of David, (and) of Salomon his son. [See 1 Chron.25. Meaning that they kept their courses diligently. Oth. and the Singers and the Porters watched, &c.]
\p
\v 46 . For in the days of David and Asaph, [Under whom are also Heman and Jeduthun comprehended, 1 Chron.2.5.1, etc.] there were heads of the Singers, and of the song of praise, and of thanksgivings unto God. [That is, chief singers, and tuners of Psalms and songs, and overseers of the chiefest, who took care that the ministry and all the courses of the Singers were rightly observed, etc. See above vers.42. and chap.11.17. and 1 Chron.25.2,3,6.]
\p
\v 47 . Therefore all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the Singers, and of the porters, [as above vers.44.] every days (portion) on its day: [Hebr. the word, or, the thing of a day on its day] And they [to wit, the people, or all Israel] hallowed for the Levites, [that is, they set apart, and gave the tithes unto the Levites, etc. Which were consecrated for that purpose, and whereby all the rest that they kept, was hallowed for their own particular use. See Num.18.21,26.] and the Levites hallowed for the children of Aaron. [that is, they set apart, and gave tithes of the tithes, which they had received, unto the high Priests, according to the law of God, Numb.18.26, etc. See also there v.8.]
\c 13
\s At the reading of the law of God before the people, all mixture with strange nations is separated from Israel, vers.1. &c. Whilest Nehemia was gone back to the king, divers gross abuses were crept into church of God, of which he purgeth the same at his return, purifying the chambers in the house of God, which Eljasib had polluted, 4. Restoring the Priests and Levites to their office and maintenance, over which he appointeth Treasurers, 10,30. Putting down all profanation of the Sabbath, 15. As also all marriages, made with heathenish nations, 23.
\p
\v 1 . On that day there was read in the book of Moseh, before the ears of the people: [Some conceive this to have been done, after that Nehemia was come back the second time from king Artaxerxes to Jerusalem. See verse 4. And 6.] And therein was found written, that the Ammonites, and the Moabites, [Hebr. Ammonite, and Moabite] should not come into the congregation of God forever: [see Deu.23.on v.1.]
\p
\v 2 . Because they had not met the children of Israel with bread, and with water; [That is, with meat and drink] yea had hired Bileam against him, [meaning Israel; that is, the people of Israel] to curse him: Howbeit, our God turned the curse into a blessing.
\p
\v 3 . SO it came to pass, when they heard this law, that they separated from Israel all mixture. [That is, all those that were of strange Idolatrous heathenish nations, and not of Israel. Compare above chap.9.2.]
\p
\v 4 . Now Eljasib the Priest, who was set over the chamber, [That is, chambers. See below v.9. and Ezra 8.29.] of the house of our God, was heretofore nigh of kin to Tobia: [that is, was allied unto him, or had joined affinity with him, although he was bitter Enemy to the people of God. See above chap.6.verse 1,14,17,19. And compare below v.28.]
\p
\v 5 . And he had made for him [To wit, for Tobia] a great chamber, [breaking down the walls of certain chambers, he had made of them a great large chamberfor Tobia, to put his household stuff in. See verse 8.] where a foretime they laid the meat-offering, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of corn, of new wine, and of oil, which were commanded for the Levites, and the Singers, and the Porters; [Hebr. the command, or, commandment of the Levites, etc. That is, concerning which God had commanded that they should be given to the Levites, etc. Or, the commanded, or, ordained (portion) of the Levites, etc. See Numb.18.24.] together with the heave-offerings of the Priests. [that is, that which they were to give unto the Priests, to wit, the tithes of the tithes of the Levites, etc. See Numb.18.8,26.]
\p
\v 6 . But in all this (time) was not I at Jerusalem: [Intimating that in a short space of time, while he was absent, all fell to decay again] for in the two and thirtieth year [when I had been twelve years at Jerusalem with the Kings leave or consent] of Arthasasta [see Ezra 6.on verse 14] king of Babel, [which was now under the Persian Monarchy] came I unto the king; but at the end of (certain) days [that is, after a while, or (as others) after full year was expired, which is sometimes understood by days] obtained I leave (again) of the king. [or, leave was obtained for me. The Hebrew word doth properly signify: I was required, summoned, or, set for. It may be that Nehemiah fearing himself to ask leave again, caused the same to be asked or craved by others, and that thereupon the King sent for him, and gave him leave. Yea without doubt some godly Jews did certify Nehemia of the decayed state and condition of Gods people, and earnestly required his coming unto them, etc.]
\p
\v 7 . And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eljasib had done for Tobia, making a chamber for him in the Courts of the house of God. [as above chap.8.16.]
\p
\v 8 . And it displeased me sore: [Hebr. it was very evil unto me; that is, (as the scripture elsewhere speaketh) it was very evil in mine eyes; that is, it vexed, or grieved me sore] So I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobia out of the chamber. [Hebr. all the vessels, or, all the furniture of the house of Tobia.]
\p
\v 9 . Moreover, I gave command, [Hebr. I said. See 2 Chron.29.24,27. Job 9.7. Esth.9.25. and compare Genes.1.3. Jona 2.11. with the annotate.] and they cleansed the chambers: [or, I said that they should cleanse the chambers. So below verse 19.] And I brought in thither again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat-offering and the frankincense.
\p
\v 10 . Also I perceived that the portion of the Levites had not been given (them): [That is, the maintenance, which they were bound to give and allow them according to the law of God: And whereunto the people had engaged themselves by solemn oath, above chap.10.37.] So that the Levites and the Singers that did the work, [to wit, of the Lord; that is, the usual service of God] were fled every one to his field.
\p
\v 11 . And I contended with the Rulers, [That is, I reproved them, chid them sharply. So vers.17.25.] and said; why is the house of God forsake? Howbeit, I gathered them together, [to wit, from the places whither they were fled and scattered] and restored them to their station. [to observe again, or wait upon the worship of God, as they had done formerly.]
\p
\v 12 . Then all Juda brought the tithes of corn, and of new wine, and of oil, into the Treasures. [That is, Treasures, Store-houses. See above on verse 5.]
\p
\v 13 . And I appointed Treasurers over the Treasures, [As above chap.12.44. and 1 Chron.26.20. etc. 2 Chron.31.12, etc.] Selemja the Priest, and Zadok the Scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaja: And at their hand [that is, for their service or help] Hanan the son of Zacchur, the son of Matthanja: For they were counted faithful, [compare above chap.7.2.] and it was imposed upon them [Hebr. (it was) upon them: That is, it was their duty their office, their charge] to distribute unto their brethren.
\p
\v 14 . Remember me, [compare Genes.8.on vers 1. Heb.6.10. and below verse 22.31. and see above chapter 5. On vers.19.] my God, in this: [or, concerning this] And blot not out my good deeds, [as 2 Chron.32.on vers.32. and 35.on vers.26.] that I have done for the house of my God, and for the watches thereof. [taking care that the service of God in the Temple might be well observed and performed by every one, according to his office and place. See Num.13.on verse 7.]
\p
\v 15 . In those days saw I in the Juda, those that trod presses [To wit, wine-presses and oil-presses] on the Sabbath, and those that brought in sheaves, which they laded on asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all (or every) burden, [That is, all manner of burdens] which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day: And I testified against them [as below verse 21.] in the day wherein they sold victuals. [professing before the Lord, that I would suffer it no longer.]
\p
\v 16 . There dwelt also Tyrians [That were born in the famous city of Tyre. See Jodh.19.on vers.29.] therein [to wit, in Jerusalem] who brought in fish, and all [that is, all manner of] provision and merchandise, which they sold on the Sabbath unto the children of Juda and at Jerusalem.
\p
\v 17 . Then I contended with the Nobles [Hebr. whiteones. See above cha.2.on verse 16.] of Juda, and said utno them; what evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the Sabbath-day?
\p
\v 18 . Did not your Fathers thus, and our God brought all this evil [All these plagues and punishments] upon us, and upon this city? And ye make the fierce wrath [to wit, of the Lord] yet more [Hebr. add fierce wrath] upon Israel, profaning the Sabbath.
\p
\v 19 . Now it came to pas, when the gates of Jerusalem gave shadow, [Or, were over shadowed: That is, towards evening, when the sun began to set] before the Sabbath, that I gave command, [Hebr. said, as above verse 9.] and the doors were shut; and I charged that they should not open them till after the Sabbath: And I set (some) of my youths at the gates, (That there) should no burden come in on the Sabbath day.
\p
\v 20 . Then the Merchants, and sellers of all [That is, all kind of] saleware, overnighted without Jerusalem once or twice.
\p
\v 21 . So I testified against them, and said unto them, why overnight ye over against the wall? If ye do so again, I will lay hand on you: From that time forth came they no (more) on the Sabbath.
\p
\v 22 . Moreover, I said unto the Levites, that they should cleanse themselves, and come and keep the gates, [Meaning of the Temple, observing all that was requisite for the sanctifying of the Sabbath, without doing any thing else on the Sabbath, and in particular, looking and taking care that no unclean persons might come into the Temple. See Numb.3.7. and 2 Chron.23.19.] to sanctify the Sabbath day: Remember me also (in) this, my God, and spare me, according to the multitude [or greatness] of thy goodness. [or, loving kindness.]
\p
\v 23 . I saw also in those days Jews, that had caused Asdoditish, Ammonitish, and Moabitish wives [That is, heathenish wives of all kind of strange nations. Asdod was a city and country of the Philistines. See 1 Sam.5.1,2, etc.] to dwell (with them). [that is, had married those strange wives, (See Ezra 10.on vers.2.) not with standing the reformation lately made by Ezra, Ezra chapters 9. And 10. And their own vow and promise sealed and confirmed with an oath, above chap.10.30. So verse 27.]
\p
\v 24 . And their children psake half in the Asdoditish speech, [Oth. half of their children, or, a part, etc.] and they could not speak in the Jews language: [Hebr. they discerned not, or, distinguished not, etc.] but according to the Language of each people. [Hebr. of people and people; that is, of the one and the other people, every one as he had learnt of his mother, having thus a bastardly mungrell language, with a bastardly mungrell Religion.]
\p
\v 25 . Then I contended with them, and cursed them, [Out of zeal unto justice, declaring, that as perjured covenant-breakers, they had brought a curse upon themselves, and had deserved to be banned, or cut off from the people of God] and smote (some) men of them, and plucked off (their) hair: [for an open punishment and disgrace. Compare Deu.25.2. and 2 Sam.10.14.] and Imade them swear by God; if ye shall give your daughters unto their sons, and if ye shall take of their daughters for your sons, or your selves! [an abrupt kind of speech, which was frequently used in oaths or swearing, wherein must be understood, then thou shalt be cursed, or, then let God punish thee. See Gen.14.on vers.23. This oath which he pronounceth before them, they were to take the same upon themselves, that being by this means stirred up, they might not hereafter fall into the same abomination again.]
\p
\v 26 . Did not Salomon king of Israel sin therein? [See 1 Kings 11.4.] Howbeit, among many heathens there was no king like him, [See 1 Kings 3.13. 2 Chr.1.12.] and he was beloved of his God, and God had made him king over all Israel: also him did strange women cause to sin.
\p
\v 27 . Should we then hearken unto you, that ye should do all this great evil, transgressing against God, causing strange wives to dwell (with you)? [See on verse 23. That is, should we then suffer you to commit the like who are much more subject to be seduced, then that great and wise king Solomon was, who was beloved of God?]
\p
\v 28 . Also (one) of the children of Jojada the son of Eliasib, the high Priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: [Of Saneballat see above chap.2.on verse 10. And 4.1. and 6.1. &c. Josephus written, that this Jew that was Sanballats son in law, was Manasses, the brother of the high Priest Jaddua, or Jaddus, of whom see above chap.12. on verse 11.] Therefore I chased him away from me.
\p
\v 29 . Remember them, my God, [As above chap.6.14.] because they have defiled the priesthood, [committing such vile abominations as are mentioned above] yea the covenant of the Priesthood, and of the Levites. [Meaning the special and stricters covenant which God had made with Aaron, and his seed, together with the Levites concerning their holy functions.]
\p
\v 30 . Thus cleansed I them from all strangers: [Hebr. all (or every) stranger: in the singular number. [Understand the heathenish wives, children, with the adhering pollution of heathenism] and I appointed the wards of the Priests and of the Levites, [See ab.verse 14.] every one in his businesses.
\p
\v 31 . Also for the wood-offering [See ab.chap.10.34.] at times appointed, and for the first-fruits: Remember me, my God for good. [Compare ab.chap.5.on vers.19. and in this chapter verse 14. And 22.]
