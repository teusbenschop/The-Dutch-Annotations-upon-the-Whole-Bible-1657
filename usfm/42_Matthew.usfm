\s THE ARGUMENT OF THE New Testament
\p The word Testament is a Latine word, whereby the Greek word Diatheke is rendred, which the Greek Translatior use to expresse the Hebrew word Berith, that is, covenant. And thereby is properly understood the covenant it se;f, which God hhath made with mankinde upon a certain condition to give them everlasting life: The Old is that which God made with the first man befoe the fall, wherein eternal life was promised upon condition of a throughly perfect obidience, and keeping upon the Law, and is therefore called the Legall Covenant, which God again propound to the Israelites, that from thence they might learn to understand (seeing this condition is transgressed by all men, and now be fulfilled by no man) that they must seek their salvation in anothher Covenant, which is called the New [Covenant] and consisteth in this: That God hat appointed his Son for Mediator, and promiseth eternal life upon condition that we believe in him; is called the Covenant of Grace. And this also regard of the several administrations thereof unto mankind is called Old and New. Thhe old is the administration of this Covanant before the coming of the Mediator, which was promised to Abraham and his posterity [to come] of his seed, and prefigured by maniford Ceremonies laid down by Moses. The New is the administration of the same Covenant, since the Son of God, the Mediator of this Covenant came in the flesh, and hath accomplished mans reconciliation with God. These two Covenant are one of one kinde as concerning their substance, forasmuch as in both forgivenss of sins, salvation and eternal life are promised upon condition of faith in the Mediator: but are different in respect of their several administraions, which in the New is much clearer, without figures, and extends it self unto all Nations. And the Old may fitly be tearmed the Testament of promise, and the New, the Testament of performance. Moreover, by te Old and New Testament, are also commonly understood te Books, wherein the makin and administration of te Covenant are discribed; in which signification the word: The New Testament are taken here in the Title; and are opposed to thhe Books of the Hholy Prophet, in which the Mediator of this Covenant is promised, and described,of what lineage, and when he should become mn, what should doe and suffer to reconcile man unto God , and to procure and bring everlasting salvation unto them. As therefore in the Writings of the Old Testament, is foretold and typified that the Messia or Mediator which should reconcile man unto God, should be the only begotten Son of God, eternal and true God which the Father and the Holy Ghost , Psalms 45.8 and 110.1. Isa. 9.5. and 33.2. Michah 5.1. Malachi 3.1. And that in the fulness of time hhe should take upon him the true humane nature, of a woman, and she a Virgin , Gen. 3.15. Isa. 7.14. of thhe stock of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, and David, Gen.21,12. and 22.18. and 49.9,10. 2 Sam.7.12. Isa. 11.1. Jer. 23.5. That he should be born in the City of Bethlehem, Michah 5.1. at thhat time whhen the Scepter should be taken away from Judah, Gen.49.10. Isa 11.1. Dan. 9.24. That being born he should flee unto Egypt, Ose 11.1. be brought up at Nazareth. Isa 11.1. and that he should have Elias fro his fore – runner, who should preach in the wilderness and prepare the way for him, Isa. 40.3. Malach 3.1. and 4.5. That he should begin to preach the Gospel in Galilee, Isa 8.23. and 9.1. That he should confirm his Doctrine by many miracles, Isa. 35.5. That he should make his entrance into Jerusalem, riding upon a she – asse, Psalm 118.25. Zach 9.9. That he should be betrayed by one of his Disciples, Psalm 41.10. and 55.14. That he should be sold for thirty pieces of Silver, Zach 11.12. That he should be scourged, mocked, and spit upon, Isa 50.6. That he should be dealt withal as a Melefactor, Isa 53.12. That hhe should suffer for our sins, Isa.53.3,4. That he should sufferthe extreamest agonies in his soul, Psalm 22.2. Isa 53.11. That he should be crucified, Deut 21.23. Psalm 22.17 Thhat he should be mocked upon the cross; and made to drink Vineger and Gall Psalm.22.8. and Psalm.69.22. That lots should be cast upon his garments, Psal.22.19. That his borns shoukd not be broken , Exod 12.46. Psalm 34.21. That he should die a violent death, Isa 53.8. Dan.9.26. That he should be burried by a richh man, Isa 53.9. That he should see no corruption in the grave, Psalm 16.10. but the third day arise from the dead, Isa 53.10. Jonah 1.17. and 2.10. That he should ascend into Heaven, and there sit at the right hand of God, Psalm 68.19. and 110.1. And that from thence he should send hois holy Spirit , Joel 2.28. Even so it is laid down by the holy Evangelists and Apostles in the Writings of the New Testament, that all this was fulfilled in our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Therefore described the Person and Office of our Saviour Jesus Christ. Concerning his Person, that he is very God, and a true righteous man in unity of person. His divine nature is witnessed everywhhere, when there are ascribe to him, the names of God, such as are Jehovah, Only – begotten Son of God, the Prince of life, Lord over all, Judge of quick and dead, King of Kings, and Lords of Lords. Likewise divine properties, such as are Insiniteness, Eternity, Omniscience, Omnipotence. Divine works such as are the Creation,and Preservation of all Creatures, Electing to everlasting life, Institution of the publique worship, and the Sacraments, giving og the Holy Ghost, regeneration, deliverance from the power of the Devil, raising from the dead, the Judgment of the whole world, and sitting at the right hand of God; to which serves likewise the description of the manifold miracles which he wroughht by his power. And finally divine honour and worship also; namely, that we must believe in him, pray unto him, and be baptised in his Name. His humane nature is described, when it is declared that hhe was concieved by the Holy Ghost, came of the stock of David, that he was born of the Virgin Mary, that he hath an humane soul, and a true humane body, with all the natural prperties of them both; namely, that he did hunger and thirst, eat, sleep; that he was weary, wept, was troubled, felt pain, was angry, and grieved. His office, for which he was by the Father sent into the world, according to his surname Christ, that is, Annointed, is diecribed to the threefold, namely, his Prophetical, Priestly, and Kingly office. His Prophetical Office he executed aswel by himself as by his Disciples, especially twelve which he chose to be Apostles. He preachhed the Gospel himself, teaching that hhhe was th promised Messiah, and Saviour, and that those who will obtain, must believe in him, and turn unto God. For which end also expound the Law, and purged it from the interpretations of the Scribes and Pharisees. Hhis Apostles after his Ascension he sent into all the world; who preached unot all people, the Gospel, and conversion to God; both by the wod of mouth and a lovely voice, and by their Writings and Epistles; which make great part of his writings of the New Testament. His Priestly Office he executed, when here upon earth, he suffered for us both in body and Soul, the punishment that we had deserved our sins, and being slain, and put to death upon the Cross, offered up himself to God his Father, a sacrifies of reconciliation for us: and now that he is entered into the the Holy of Holies, that is, into Heaven, and being set down the right hand of the Father, there makes intercession for us. His Kingly Office he executed partly here on earth, when he delivered us from the power of our Enemies by his death, and continually defends and peserves us against the same; and when he gave an experiment thereof, by the casting uot of unclean spirits, by driving the buyer and seller out of the Temple, and by his royal entrance into Jerusalem; partly, he executes it now above in Heaven, governing his Church by his Word and Spirit, and defending them against the force and violence of their Enemies, and punishing his and their Enemies, and making them become the footstoll of his feet. Ans shall executre the same to the full, when coming to Judgment he shall perfectly glorifie his Church, and cast his Enemies and ungogly ones into everlasting death. This is the summe of that which is set down and contained in the Writtings of the New Testament. And these Wrottings of the New Testament may fitly deleivered into two sorts of Books. For in some of them are set down certain Acts and Histories, and others are handled certain Articles of Christian Religion; although in the Historiacal Books also, some points of doctrine are here and there explained; and in the othere likewise some Histories are related; yet notwithstanding they are so distinguished, in resect of that which is principally handled in them. The prophetical Books of the New Testament treat either of things that are already done; or of things yet to be done. The things already done are discrided to the two sorts: nemely, such as were done either concerning the Lord Jesus Christ himself, laid down in the four Gospel by four Evangelists, Mathew, Mark, Luke, John; or such as were done by the holy Apostles, described by Luke, in the Acts of Apostles. The things that were yet to be done or come to pass are set down by John in his Revelation; in which is foretold and described the state of the Church of Christ after his Ascension unto the end of the world. Thhe Books which handle point of Doctrine, are the Epistles of the holy Apostles, aswel of the Apostle Paul as some others. The Apostle Paul hath upon divers occasions written fourteen Epistles; Some unto some special Churches; namely, to the Roamnes one, to the Corinthians two, to the Galatians one, to the Ephesians one, to the Philippians one, to the Colossians one, to the Thessalonians two. Some to particular persons, yet so as that the contents concern the whol, Church: viz. to Timothy two, to Titus one, and to Philemon one. To which is to be added the Epistle to the Hebrews, which is doubted of by some, though without reason, whether it were written by Apostle Paul. Certain other Apostles, have likewise written some Epistles to the Church, as James one, Peter two, John three, and Jude one. These are the Writtings of the New Testament, all which are written to this end, that, as the Evangelist John declares, John 20.31. We should belives that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing we should have life in his Name.
\mt2 THE HOLY GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE DESCRIPTION OF
\mt MATTHEW
\p The holy Gospel, Belg. Evangel. [The word Evangelion is a Greek word, and signifies a good or joyful Message, Luke 2.10. by which name in the holy Scriptures, especially of the New Testament, the Doctrine is tearmed, which the Prophets and Apostles hhave published, concerning the Redemption of mankind, and evalasting salvation brought to passs by the Messiah: which seeing it was by the Prophet set forth in promises that the Messias should come into the world, and accomplish the same; and by the Apostles that in the fulness of time he did come into the world, and hath accomplishhed the works of our Redemption ; therefore by this word is also especially understood the Doctrine of Christ and thhe Apostles, concerning the fulfilling of the promises by Jesus Christ now being come in the flesh , Rom. 16.25. And yet more especially the History of the coming of the Messiah in the flesh, of his birth, doctrine, miracles, suffering, edath, rescurection and ascension. And this signification is the word taken here in the Title, as also, Mark 1.1. And the Writers of this Histiry are also from thence tearmed Evangelists; although that word be also sometimes taken more largely, viz, for one that sent here and there to preachh the Gospel. See Acts 21.8. ePH.4.11. 2 Tim. 4.5.] according to [the description of] [Thus he stes the Title, and not the Gospel of Matthew; to give to undrestand that he is not the principla Authuor of this writing; which is the Spirit of God, 2 Tim 3.16. but that he is only a Minister whom God made use of, to write this. The same is to be observed also in the Titles of the other Gospels. ]Matthew. [Matthew was the son of Alpheus, called also Levi, Mark 2.14. Luke 5.27. Of his calling to the Apostleship he writes himself among Apostles also. Matth 10.3. This was the first that wrote Evangelical History, about the ninth year after Christ ascension, as many ancient Writers testifie, who say also that he preached the Gospel in Ethiopia, or Mauritania. Some think that he wrote the Gospel in Hebrew tongue, but that is not credible; seeing the same was never seen any where; and inasmuchh as Matthew translets into Ggreek not only Hebrew words, as Emmanuel, Matth.1.23. but also whole sentence, as Elt, Eli, Lama Sabacthani, Matth.27.46. wichh would not hhave done if so be he had written in Hebrew; like as he akso for the most part relates the places of the Old Testament, as they are set down in the old Greek Translation.]
\s The Argument of This Book
\p The Evangelist Matthew in this book, describes principally two things, Firts, the person of the Messiah, and Mediator Jesus Christ, and after wards his Office; and how he entred upon, administred and discharged the same. Concerning his Person, that he is the Emmanuel, very God, and true man in one person; and as concerning his human nature, he set down his parenatge, conception by the Holy Ghost, and birth of the Vigin Mary; together with is name, chap 1. That certain Wise men from the East, being informed of his birth by star, came to worship him; that Herod being afraid thereof, caused all the young children in Bethleem from two years old, and under to be murdered, but that Christ parents, being warned of God fled into Egypt with the child, and with the same afterwards went and dwelt at Nazareth, chap 2. Concerning his Office, e declares how he was prepared thereunto; how he discharged the same, That John theh Baptist prepered the way fro him by his preaching, and baptized him, and that God the Father and the Holy Ghost, from Heaven installed him into this office, chapter 3. That he was further preparedfir it by fourty dayes fasting, and a mighty conflict against the temptations of the Devil. That afterwards he executed and administrated his office aswel in the state of hhumiliation, as in the state of exa;tation. That in the state of humiliation, he first administred his Prophetical Office, and for that end from Nazareth went and dwelt at Capernaum, teaching in the synagogues of Galilee, and confirmingg his Doctrine by miracles, chapter 4. And set down an excellent Sermon which he made upon the Mount; in which he shews the blessednesse of his Disciples, purgeth the Law from the false interpretations of the Pharisees, chap .5. Teacheth how must give alms, and pray; and what we must not be too much troubled about our temporal sustanance, chap.6. Must not judge out neighbour, must beware of false prophets, and not onely hhear thhe Word of God, but also keep it, chhap.7. That he cleaned the Leper, healed the sick, stilled te Temple , and cast out Devils, chap.8. That he helaed one struct with the palse, called Matthew from thhe receipt of custome to be an Apostle, released a woman from her bloody – issue, raised up a Damonsel from death, cast out a dumb from death, cast out a dumb devil, chap.9. That he sent forth the twelve Apostles to preach, with to cast out unclean spirits, and gave them order how carry themselves therein, cahp.10. That he gave an excellent testimony of John the Baptist when he had sent two of his Disciples unto him, threatned very heavy punishments unto those Cities that embraced not the Gospel, and invited all heavy – laden sinners unto him, chap.11. That he defends his disciples, who plucked ears of corn the sabbath day, ascaped the snare of the Phharisees, sact out a blind and deaf devil, charged the Pharisees with the sin against the Holy Ghost, denouncing everlasting punishment unto them, and taught who is his right Mother, Brother, and Sisterchhap.12. Thhat hhe described the condition of his Church here in this world by divers similitudes, viz. of a sower, of mustard – seed, of an hidden treasure, of a Merchant – man, and of a fishing net; that hhe came into his own Country, where hhe was not esteemed, chhap 13. Relates the imprisonment and death of John the Baptist, and how Christ fed five thousand men with five loaves and two fishes, walked on the water, stilled the Tempest, and healed many sick persons in the Land of Gennesareth, chap.14. Defended his Disciples for eating with unwashed hands, teaching what is that truly defiles the man: Thhat he freed the daughter od a Canaanitish woman from an unclean spirit; and satisfied four thousand men with seven leaoves and few fishes, chap 15. Thhat rebuked the Pharisees for seeking a sign, and Disciples of their leaven; thhat made an excellent confession of him, to whom he promised the keys of the Kingdome of Heaven: That Christ foretold his suffering and death, as likewise his resurrection and coming in his glory upon the Mount before three of his Disciples, and taught that John Baptist was that Elias which was for to come; healed one that was Lunatick, again foretold death and resurection, and paid tribute, chap.17 That he exhorts his Disciples to himility, that they should avoid offences, withstand sinful lusts, not disciple his little ones by the simulitude of a lost; how we must admonish an offending brother, and forgive him his trespasse, by the similitude of a King, whho acquitted his servant of ten thousand talents, chap.18. That a man leave his wife except it be for adultery; teacheth for whom marriage is neddful; blessed the little children: Instructeth the young man what he must do, if so be he will obtain eternal life by his own works; how hardly rich men can be saved; and what reward they shall have that leave all for his sake, chap 19. That by a similitude of labourers hired into the Vineyard, he taught that the rewards is given by God of meer grace; foretold his suffering, reproved the mother of Zebedees sons for her ambitious request, and admonished his Apostles that they should not seek after greatnesse: restore two blinde men their sight, chap 20. That he made his royal entrance into Jerusalem; cursed a fruitlesse figtree, disputed in the Temple with the Priests concerningg his authority and person, chap.21. By similitude of those that were invited to the wedding, taught that there are always hypocrites in the visible Church; and that thet true member must be indued with faith, as with a wedding garment. That we must pay tribute unto Casar; that after the resurrection there shall be no marrying; That the Law of God summarily consist in the love of God and our neighbour: that he is not only the Son but the Lord of David, chap 22. Warns his Disciples concerning the Pharisees, that they must receive that which they teach them out of Moses and the Phophets, but not imitate their pride and hypocrisie, nor adhere to their false doctrine, and denounce an eternal woe unto them, as well for their hpocrisie as for their blood – thirstinesse. chap.23 foretells the desolation of the Temple, and the City of Jerusalem, with the signes which shall precede both thst and his second coming, and exhorts to watch and pray, chap.24. By the similitude of ten Virgins who waited for the coming of the Bridegroom, and of the servants to whom their Lord had distributed talents to trade withal; and discribes his last coming to judgment, chap.25. That he again foretells his suffering which was now at hand; That the Ruler held a Council to apprehend him, with whom Judas treats, to deliver him over unto them. That he discovers the Traitor to his Disciples, eat the passover with his Disciples; and institutes the Lords Supper in the room thereof; foretells the flightof his Disciples, and Peters denial. How he enters upon his suffering in the Garden with great anguish, and prayer; how he is betrayed and taken, led away bound unto Caiaphas, examined and condemned to death: How Peter denies hhim three times, cahp. 26. That Judas repents and hangs himself. That Christ is brought to Pilate, who seek to save him, but in vain, and finally delivers him over to be crucified; after that he was mocked and scourged: That he was led out of the City bearing his cross, where his garments were taken off him, and lots cast upon them; and being nailed to the Crosse he riseth again from the dead, and shew himself alive again to certain women, and to his Disciples, whom he commanded to preach the Gospel through the whole world, chap.28.
\mt MATTHEW
\s The pedigree of Christ according to the flesh from the for fathers, from Abraham down ward, 1. His conception by the Holy Ghost , and birth of the Virgin Mary, 18. as was foretold by the Prophet, 22.
\p
\v 1 The book of the generation [i.e Genealogy,or Tree of Christs Ancestours;It is an Hebrew manner of speaking.See Gen 5.1.] of Jesus Christ,the Son of David,the Son of Abraham.These two,David and Abraham,are here set before,and Christ is especially called the Son of these two,because special promises were made to them both,that he should be born of their seed.See Gen.22.18. 2 Sam.7.12. Psalm.89.30. and 132.11.For which cause also,Matthew would bein this Genealogy first from Abraham ; like as he also,verse 6.particularly the names David,the King ; because David was the first King of the Tribe of Judah,and clear Type of the everlasting Kingdom of Christ, Luke 1.verse 32.]
\v 2 Abraham begat Isaac,and Isaac begat Jacob,and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren.
\v 3 And Judah begat Phares and Zara by Tamar,[Gr. out of.This woman,and hereafter Rachab and Ruth verse 5.and Bathsheba,verse 6.are here rehearsed by the Evangelist,because the Scripture speaks something of them,which serves to the state of Christs humiliation ; and likewise some of them were of Heathen Offspring : that thereby might be shewed,that even great sinners,yea and the Heathen themselves should be partakers of the fruits of Christs birth] and Phares begat Efrem,and Efrem begat Aram.
\v 4 And Aram [This Aram called Ram, Ruth 4.19.] begat Aminadab,and Aminadab begat Naasson ,and Naasson begat Salmon.
\v 5 And Salmon begat Booz by Rachab,and Booz begat Obed by Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse.
\v 6 And Jesse begat David the King; and David the King begat Salomon [Luke in stead of Solomon and his posterity,puts Nathan,another son of David,and his posterity.The reason of this diversity,see on Luke 3.31.] by her that [had been the wife] of Urias.[namely,Bethsheba.sSee 2 Sam.11.3,24. and chap 12.24.by whom David begat Solomon,when after the death of her husband Urias,she was married unto him.]
\v 7 And Salomon beat Roboam;and Roboam begat Abia,and Abia begat Asa.
\v 8 And Asa begat Josaphat,and Josaphat begat Joram;and Joram begat Ozias. [Here are three Kings skipt over and passed by; namely Ochosias,Joas,and Amafias,that the number of fourteen may not be exceeded verse 17. of such kind of leaving out,see an example Ezra 7.3. compared with 1Chron.6.8. And this Ozias,is also Azaria, 1 Chron.3.12.]
\p
\v 9 .And Ozias begat Joatham;and Joatham begat Achaz; and achaz begat Ezekias.
\p
\v 10 .And Ezekias begat Manasse,and Manasse begat Amon, and Amon begat Jofias.
\p
\v 11 . And Jefias begate Jechonious, [some join here unto Jakim , and Jakim begat Jechonias: which seems not ill to agree withh the Catalogue of the Kings of Juda, 1 Chronicles 3. 16, &c. and with the number of fourteen here, verse 17. But seeing almost all Copies and Translations,have not this addition of Jakim,therefore is the same here left out,the rather,because by Jechonias in the twelfth verse may be understood the father, who is also called Joakim; whho is also called Joachim; and so the number of fourteen is here also compleated] and his brethren, about the Babylonish Transportation. [Or, in , or at the time, that is towards the time of the Jews carrying away captive into Babylon.]
\p
\v 12 After the Babylonish Transportation, Jechonias begat Salathiel, [may think that this Salathiel was not the natural Son of Jechonias; left no children behind him; but that he was called his Son, because he as being the next unto hhim in blood, suceeded him in the government of the people of Israel; like as, 1 Chhro.3.16. Zedecias is called the Son of Jechonias, because he also succeeded im in the Kingdome, who notwitstand, 2 Kings 24. 17. is called his Uncle. Te rathher, because, Luke 3.27 it is said, that Salatiel descended from the stock of Nathan, who had the government of the people of the Jews, after the Babylonish captivity; which as it seems may be collected out of Zach 12.12. But others think, tat tis Salathiel was the natural Son of Jeconias; and that Salathiel of whom Luke speaks, cap. 3. 27. was anoter Salathiel then this; seeing the same is tere called the son of Neri. See the Annotation there.] and Salathiel begat Zorobabel.
\p
\v 13 And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor.
\p
\v 14 And the Azor begat Sadok;and Sadok begat Achim;and Achim begat Eliud.
\p
\v 15 .And Eliud beat Eleazar;and Eleazar begat Matthan;and Matthan begat Jacob.
\p
\v 16 .And Jacob begat Joseph;[This Genealogy is brought down to Joseph;because it was not usual with the Hebrews,to name women in Genealogies;notwithstanding from thence it may appear appear that Christ came of the stock of David;because it was the custome of the Jews to marry in their own lineage:and Matthew testifies before,verse 1.that he here relates the Genealogy of Jesus Christ .For that Christ descended from Judah,and David,is clearly taught every where in the holy Scripture.See Luke 1.32. Rom 1.3. Heb 7.14.] the husband of Mary,of whom is born Jesus,called Christ.[i.e which is sirnamed.See this name,John 1.42.]
\p
\v 17 .Therefore all the generations from Abraham to Daniel [are] fourteen generations; from David to the Babylonish transportation [are] fourteen generations; [the Evangelist hath likewise express but fourteen Kings& Princes,because from Abraham to David,there were but fourteen generations of forefathers.Therefore hhe skipt over some generations of Kings and Princes.See on verse 8.and Luke 3.verse 24.&c.] and from the Babylonish Transportation unto Christ [are] fourteen generations.
\p
\v 18 .Now the birth of Jesus Christ thus.For when Mary his Mother was bethrothed unto Joseph;before they were come together; i.e. before he had taken unto him,as appears out of verse 20.]she was found with childe [Others translate with fruit;but the word with childe fits better here,seeing Christ was not properly the fruit of the Holy Ghost;but the fruit of Maries womb,Luke 1.42.] of the Holy Ghost;as appears,Luke 1.35.so the Greek particle here used is also taken somewhere;as Rom.11.36.and 1 John 5.1.This was not then known to Joseph ; but was afterward revealed unto him by the Angel,verse 20.]
\p
\v 19 .Now Joseph her husband,being righteous,and not willing openly to put her to shame, [The Greek word signifies as much,as to make any one a publique spectacle,and put him to disgrace,for an example unto others] had a will privily to forsake her. [Gr.to unloose(or release) her.]
\p
\v 20 .And while he had these things in his minde,behold,the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream,saying; Joseph [thou] son of David;be not afraid to take unto thee Mary thy wife;for that which is conceived in her [Gr.is generated,or begotten;for which words,seeing the one is Latine,and the other obscure;it was thought fitter to put the word conceived.Of this generation and conception,see Luke 1.35,42.] that is of the Holy Ghost.
\p
\v 21 .And shhe shall bringgg forth a Son,and thou shalt call his name Jesus.For he shall save his people [that is,those which were given him of the Father,to redeem or save them,Psalm 2.8. Isa 8.18. John 6.37.and 17.24. Acts 18.verse 10. Rom. 11.1,2.] from their Sins.
\p
\v 22 .And all this was done,that that might be fulfilled,wic was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet,saying,
\p
\v 23 .Behold,the Virggin [The Hebrew and also the Greek Texts speak ere with childe, and bring forth son, and thou shalt [Othersread , she shall, or they shall] call his name Emmanuel [He is so called in respect of his Person and Office; because he both true God and Man in one person, and unites us to God.] which is being interpreted, God with us.
\p
\v 24 Then Joseph being raised up from sleep, did as the Angel of the Lord had commanded him, [Gr. had ordained] and took unto him his wife.
\p
\v 25 And knew her not, until [From hence cannot be concluded, that Joseph should hhave known her afterwards: for this manner speaking, doth not always import so much. See 2 Sam 6.23. Matth.28.20.] she hhad brought forth this first – born son, [A first born Son, is he that first opens the womb, Exod 13.2. albeit that there are no sons or cildren brought forth afterwards: for as it is said , Exod.11.5. that the firstborn of Egypt should be slain; so without doubt under them are understood also the only- begotten.] and called his name Jesus.
\c 2
\s Wise men come of the East to Jerusalem, 1. Enquire after the new – born King of the Jews, 2 Whom they, being informed of the place of his birth, found at Bethlehem, and whorshipped him, 4. Return again to their own Land, 12. Joseph sleeth with the young children to Egypt, 13 Herod causeth the young children to be killed, 16 Joseph comes again into Judea, 19 but for fear of Arobelous, he turns aside into Galilee, and dwels at Nazareth, 20.
\p
\v 1 Now when Jesus was born at Bethlehem [lying] in Judea, [This is added, because there was yet another Bethlehem, lying in Tribe of Zabulon, or lower Galilee. See Josh.19.15] in the days of Herod the King. [This was the great, firnamed the Ascalonite, an Idumean, the first King that was a foreiner.] Bhold, [certain] Wise men [Gr. Magi so the Persians and Medes called all those that were Learned in all manner of Sciences, and especially of the couple of the course of the Heavens: who were indeed in the great esteem among them; but that they were Kings is not credible, like as the names given them, and all circumstances do make manifest] from the East [These are said to have come from the East, because those Lands were situate East – wards from Juda] came to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 2 . Saying, where is (new) born King of the Jews? For we have seen his staree in the East, and are come to worship him.
\p
\v 3 . Now Kingg Herod having hheard [this] was troubles, and all Jerusalem with him.
\p
\v 4 And hhaving gathered togethr all the chief Priest [Those were the heads of the Orders of the Priests, of the race of Eleazar and Ithamar, and were twenty four in numbre, 1 Chhron. 24.4. and 2 Chron. 36. 14. of all which the high Priest was the supream] and scribes of the people, [Otherwise Lawyers, as appears by compsring Mat.22. 35. with Mark 12. 28. The office of these was to expound the writings of Moses and the Prophets, to the people. See Ezra 7.6. and Mat 13. 52. Of these and chief Priests together consisted the Supream Ecclesiastical assembly of the Jews] he asked of them [i.e. informed himself ] where the Christ should be born.
\p
\v 5 And they said unto him, At Bethelehem [situate] in Judea. For so it is written by the Prophet;
\p
\v 6 And [thou] Bethlehem, thou Land of Juda, art in no wise the least [The word is no wise is not in Micah 5.1. but is added thereto from the sense, for howsoever Bethelem in respect of begners was amongst the least Cities, notwithstanding it was not the least in worth and esteem because David sprang rom thence, John 7.42. and Christ was to come out it. And therefore some read in the Original Text of Micah, Art thou the least? but concerning this see more at large the Annotation on Mocah 5.1.] among the Princes of Juda, [i.e. Rules over thousands, Micah 5.1.] for out of thee shall come forth the Leader, which shall feed my people Israel. [i.e. The company of the faithfull; which he shall rule with his Word and Spirit, as an Heavenly King. See Rom.9.6. and Gal. 6.16.]
\p
\v 7 Then Herod privity called the wise men, and enquired diligently of them the time when the star had appeared?
\p
\v 8 And sending them to Bethlehhem, said, Go your ways, and search diligently after that young childe, and when ye shall have found it, bring me word thereof, that i may also come, and worship the same.
\p
\v 9 And they having heard the King, went their ways, and behold, the starre which they had seen in the East, went before them, [from hence it appears, that it was no ordinary Starre of the Heaven; but a Light peculiarly created, like as was the fiery pillars, which led the children of Israel through the wilderness] till that it came and stood over [the place] where the young child was.
\p
\v 10 Now when they saw the Starre, they rejoice with very great joy.
\p
\v 11 And being come into the house, they sound the young childe [Otherwise, they saw] with Mary his Mother and falling they worshipped the same. And having opened their treasures, they brought unto him gifts; Gold, and Frankincense, and Myrrhe. [Thse were the most preciuos thing that were found in their Country.
\p
\v 12 And being warned by divine revalation in a dream, thhat they should not return to Herod, they departed again towards their (own) land by another way.
\p
\v 13 Now when they were departed; Behold, the Angel of the Lord appereth unto Joseph in a dream, saying , Arise, and take to thee that young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and thou there , until i shall tell, thee. For Herod will seek the young child, to kill the same.
\p
\v 14 Then he being risen up, took the young and his mother to him in the night, and departed (into) Egypt.
\p
\v 15 And was there until the death of Herod, that that might he fulfilled which was spoken of thhe LORD by the Prophet, saying; Out of Egypt have called my Son [Although this place, Hos 11. 12. is also understood of the deliverance of the people of Israel out of Egypt; yet must the same likewise be fulfilled in Christ as the head of this people.]
\p
\v 16 When Herod saw that he was deceived by the Wise men[Gr. illuded; namely, according to his thinking; for properly the wise men did neither deceive nor illude him] then was he very wroth, and having sent forth [some] he slew all the children [This searful massacre of insants, is also related by Macrobius an Heathen Writer. Saturn. lib.2.cap.4.] which were within Bethlehem, and in all boarders of the same, from two years [old] and under, according to the time which he had accurately enquired of the Wise men.
\p
\v 17 Then was fulfilled that which is spoken by the Prophet Jeremy, [Some Greek Copies have here also these words, of the Lord.] saying;
\p
\v 18 A voice was heard in Rama, [see the exposition hereof, Jer 31. 15] lamentation, weeping, and much groaning : Rachel weeping of her children, [seeing Rachel was buried thereabout] and would not be comforted, because they are not.
\p
\v 19 Now when Herod was dead, Behold, the Angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream in Egypt,
\p
\v 20 Saying, Arise, take the young child and his Mother thee, and go into the land of Israel; for they are dead, who sought the young childs soul. [that is, life See Exod 4.19. that is to say, which lay in wait for his life to take it way. Otherwise this manner of speaking is also taken in a good sense, Prov 29. verse 10.]
\p
\v 21 Then be bring risen up, took unto him the young child and his Mother, and come into the Land of Israel
\p
\v 22 But when he heard tha Archelous was King in Judea, in the room of his Father Herod; he was afraid to go thither. But being warned revelation in a dream; he went into the parts of Galilee.
\p
\v 23 And being come [thither] he made his habitantion in the City of called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet; that he shall be called a Nazarene. [This hath repsect either to the place, Judge 13.5,7. where is said of Sampson as a type of Christ, he shall be Nazarite, that is to say, dedicated to God; Or which is mostly likely, to Isa. 11.1. and chapter 60.21. where Christ is called Natze, which that to say, a branch; from which word the City Nazareth hath name. It was Gods will that by occasion of his dwelling place, Christ should be called a Nazarene, as a branch that grows up before his father out of his place, Isa. 53.2. Jer 23.9 chap 33. 15. Zach 6.12.]

\s John the Baptist preacheth repantance, 1 . His office, raiment, and food, 3. Hath may followers 5. Baptist, 6. Reproves the Pharisees and Sadduces, 7. Shew the dignity of the Person and Baptism of Christ, 11. Bpatizeth Christ, who is witnessed from Heaven to the well - beloved son of God, 13
\p
\v 1 And in those days [Namley, in the fifteenth year of the Emperour Tiberius, when Christ was about thirty years old, Luke 3. 1, 23] came John the Baptist, [concerning John, of his parents, birth and office, see Luke 1 and John 1. hhe is called Baptist; because he was the first that hhe command of God administred Baptist in the New Testament. See Matth 21. verse 25. John 1 verse 33.] preaching in the wilderness of Judea, [Not such a wilderness, where none inhhabited, but aq waste Countrey of Woods and Mountains, where Zacharias the father of John dwelt, Luke 1. 39.] in which are number fic Cities, Josh. 15.61, 62. which therefire had also their Villages, or Hamlets.]
\p
\v 2 And saying, Repent yee; for the Kingdom of the Heavens [That is to say, the setting up, and enlarging of the Churh of God, by the preachingg of the Gospel, at the time of the coming of the Messiah ] is come nigh.
\p
\v 3 For this is he, of whom is spoken by the Prophet Esay, saying. The voice of one crying in the wilderness; Prepare the way of the Lord; [A similitude taken from a Prince or King, against whose coming the ways are prepared, and made plain.] make his paths straight.
\p
\v 4 And the same John had his clothing of Camels hair, [such kind of tough garment the prophets wore before – time in the Old Testament. See Zach 13.4.Heb 11. 37. as is witnessed of Elias in particular, 2 Kings 1.8. in whose spirit and power John the Baptist was come, Malach 4.5. Luke 1. 17] and leathern girdle about lions; and his foos was locusts [The locust in those Countreys are great and many; and are eaten there amongst the mean people; like as they also reckoned amongst the clean meats, Levis 11.22.] and wild honey
\p
\v 5 Then went out ti him Jerusalem and all Judea; and the whole Countrey round about the Jordan.
\p
\v 6 And were baptised of him in the Jordan , consessing their sins. [This consession of sins, was no auricular consession; forasmuch as it was made before Baptism, in general, and in publique.]
\p
\v 7 Then he seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadduces [ The Pharisees and Sadduces wete two Sect among the Jews; like as there was yet a third of the Esseans. See concerning them thhe Historian Josephus, Antiq like 18. cap. 2. de bello lib.2. cap. 7.] come to his Baptism, spake unto them, yee brood of vipers, who hath shewed you to slee from the wrath is coming?
\p
\v 8 Bring forth fruits therefore, worthy of repentance [That is to say, becoming, or agreeable unto true repentance.]
\p
\v 9 And think not to say with your selves, We have Abraham fro father. For i say unto you thhat even od these stones, God can raise up children to Abraham
\p
\v 10 And also already the ax is laid to the root of the Trees, [That is to say, the judgment of God draws near, notwithstanding that boast that ye are descended from Abraham; except ye do the works of Abraham, John 8 verse 39.] therefore every Tree, which brings forth no good fruit, is hebew down, and cast into the fire.
\p
\v 11 I indeed baptize you with water [Gr. in the water] unto repentance; but he that cometh after me [or, behind me See John 1. 15] is stronger then i, whose shoes i am not worthy to carry [after him] : [that is, to do him the least or meanest serbice] He shall baptise you with the Holy Ghost and with fire. [John here distinguisheth hios outward Baptism from the inward Baptism of Christ, whereby the perisieth of our hearts by his spirits, as the fire doth the metal from all drosse and impurity. See the like phrase, John 3.5. and Acts 1.5. and chap 2.4.]
\p
\v 12 Whose fan [Gr, winnowing shovel; wherewith they cast up the corn, to cleanse it from the chaff, which with us is done by the san.] is in his hand, and will thouroughly – purge his threshing – floor, and gather together his wheat [ or corn, as often afterwards] into his garner, [otherwise corn – lost, or place where any thing is laid away to be kept.] and will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.
\p
\v 13 Then come Jesus from Galilee towards the Jordan unto John, to be baptised of him.
\p
\v 14 But John much refused (it) him, [that is, hindred him very much; or set himself very muchh against it aswel by words as otherwise] saying, it is needful for me to be baptised of thee, and comest thou to me?
\p
\v 15 But Jesus answering, said unto to him, surcease now :[Namely, to hinder me in this.] For thus it becometh us, to fulfill all righteousness.[that is to say whatsoever God hath instructed and commanded, to shew him perfect obedience in] Then be let him alone.
\p
\v 16 And Jesus being baptised, ascended straight way out of the water. And behold, the hHeavens were opened unto him; and be saw the spirit of God descend like a dove, [that is to say, in body shape like a dove, Luke 3. 22. in which kinde of shape the Holy Gost who is every where present would here manifest himself upon Christ, to give to understand his innocency, meekness kindeness, and uprightness.] and come upon him.
\p
\v 17 And behold, a voice out of the Heavens, [Here is a clear testimony of the three distinct Perso in one divine Essence: the Father who speaks out of Heaven; the Son whom he speaks; and the Holy Ghost who descends] saying, This is my Son, my beloved, in whom i am well- pleased.
\c 4
\s Christ having fasted fourty days in the wilderness, is tempted of the Devil, 1 Afterwards ministred unto by the Anggel, 11 Leaving Nazareth to preach, 17. Calleth Peter and Andrew, 18. James and John, who leaving all, follow him, 21. Walking through Galilee, he teacheth in the Synagogues, and healeth all manner of discases 23.
\p
\v 1 Then [presently after he was baptised. Mark 1. 12.] was Jesus away of the spirit [or, of that spirit, that is, by tyhe moving of the Holy Ghost, which was descended upon him. See Luke 4.1.] into the wilderness, to be tempted of the Devil. [This wpord comes from the Greek word Diabolos, which is as much to say, a slanderer, and false accuser. sEE rEV 12.9,10. ]
\p
\v 2 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights[ This was a miraculas fast with out eating or drinking like as was also the fast of Moses, Exod 34.28. and of Alias, 1 Kings 19.8. which therefore cannot be imitated by us, no more then the other miracles of Christ.] he was at the last an hungred.
\p
\v 3 And the Tempter [So the Devil is called, because he seeks to bring men to sin and apostate. See Gen 3.] being come unto him, said if thou be the son of God, [namely, as the fore – going voice in thy Baptism testified] say, that these stones become bread.
\p
\v 4 But he answer, said, it is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but the very word [ that is to say, by all things which it pleaseth God to give vertue unto, and to make use of the nourishment and strengthening of men.] that goes forth through the mouth of God
\p
\v 5 Then the Devil took him along towards the holy city,[ That is, Jerusalem; which is so called, because there God hath planetd his worship and sanctuary.] and set him upon the panacle of the Temple. [Gr. Wing so an up – risisng border was named, which like a leaning or rail was made round about the covering of the Temple; to hinfder any one from falling of easily.See Deut 22.8. ]
\p
\v 6 And said unto him, If thou be the son of God cast thy self down – wards; for it ios written, That he shall give his Angels charge concerning thee; and (that) they shall take thee upon their hands, [Here the Tempter leaves out the words, in all thy ways, see Psalms 91.11. and the annotation there.] that thou mayest at my time dash thy foot against a stone.
\p
\v 7 Jesus said unto him, it is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
\p
\v 8 Again the Devill took him with him upon a very high mountain, and shewed him all the Kingdom of the world; and the glory of them. [Namely, either in some apparition, or else pointing at the several quarters of the same, and with words relating the glory thereof.]
\p
\v 9 And said unto him, All these things will give thee, if so be falling down, wilt worship me.
\p
\v 10 Then said Jesus unto him; get thee away, Satan , [that is to say, opposite, Adversary, or Enemy. So the Devil is called, because he is the enemy of mankind. see 1 Pet. 5. 8.] for it is written, The Lord thy God shalt thou worship, and serve him alone.
\p
\v 11 Then the Devil left him, and behold, the Angels [That is to say, Messenger. So the good Spirits are called, because they are sent forth by God to execute hhis commands. See Psalm 103. 20. and Heb. 1.14.] came, and served him.
\p
\v 12 Now when Jesus heard, that John was delivered over, [Namley, into prison. See Matth.14.] hhe returned towards Galilee.
\p
\v 13 And having left Nazareth, came dwell at Capernaum, lying upon the Sea; in the borders of Zabulon snd Nephtalim.
\p
\v 14 That thou might be fulfilled which is spoken by Esaias the Prophet , saying
\p
\v 15 The alnd of Zbulon, and the land of Naphtalim; [on the] way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, [otherwise, about, or by ] Galilee of the Nations. [or, of the Gentiles; for the Greek word signifies both; and is likewise used of the Jewish Nation, Luke 7.5. And this part of Ggalilee is so called, either because it was very populous, Deut 33. 23. or, because it bordered on the Confines of Tyre and Sodn, which were Gentile Cities.]
\p
\v 16 The people that set in darkness hath seen a great light, and those which sate in the land and shadow of death, at them a light is risen up.
\p
\v 17 From thenceforth Jesus began to say, Repent, for the Kingdom of the Heavens is come nigh.
\p
\v 18 And Jesus walking by the sea of Galilee, [This Sea was a great in – landish lake; for the Hebrew call all great gathering togethr of water, Seas. It is otherwise called also the sea of Gennesareth, and the Sea of Tiberias, because these places lay upon this Sea] saw two Brothren; [namely] Simon and Peter, and Andrew his Brother , casting the net [Gr. casting – net] into the sea: (for they were Fishers)
\p
\v 19 And he said unto them, follow after me, [Or Come hither after me, John 1.35. it is said, that they were come to Christ before Johns imprisonment; but that was as Disciples: but here they are called to be Apostoles.] and i will make you Fishers of men.
\p
\v 20 Then they straightway leaving the nets, followes after him.
\p
\v 21 And being one forward from thence, saw other two brethren, [namely] James the [son] of Zebedee, and John hhis brother, in the ship with Zebedee their father, manding their nets, and be called them.
\p
\v 22 Then they straightway leaving their ship, and their father, followed after him.
\p
\v 23 And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, [Thse were places or buildings, in which the Jews hheld their Assemblies in all Cities, and the Law of Moses was read and expounded on very Sabbath – day. See Acts 15.21.] and preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom, and healing every sickness, and evry pain [thhat is to say, all kind of the deseases, or infirmities, weakness,(seebleness) among the people.
\p
\v 24 And his same went out [from thence] into all Syria; and they brought unto him all that were ill – disposed, being taken with divers diseases and torments, [that is to say, suck kind of deseases put men to great pain, and as it were torture them] and possessed with the Devil, and those that were lunatick, [these seem to be those that have the falling sickness, as more plainly appears out of Matth 17. verse. 15] and those that had the palse, [or, lame, stricken] and bee healed the same.
\p
\v 25 And great companies followed after him [That is to say, heaps or multitudes of people] from Galilee,and [from] Decapolis, [it was a Countrey so called in Greek, because there lay ten Cities in it. See Pliny,lib. 5. cap. 18.] and [from] Jerusalem. and [from] Judea, and [from] beyond the Jordan.
\c 5
\s Christ teacheth the mountains what men are blessed, 1. Compare his disciples to salt, light, and City seated upon a hill, 13. Declare that he come to fulfill the Law. Consutes the Exposition of the Ancients of the sixt commandement, 17. Of the seventh Commandement, and of the Bill of Divorce, 27. of Swearing, 33. Of Revenge, 38. Commands forbearance, 40. Liberality and true love even towards our enemies, 42.
\p
\v 1 And [Jesus] seeing multitude, went up into a mountain, and when he was sate down his disciples came to him.
\p
\v 2 And having opened his mouth, [An Hebrew manner of speaking, when any one begins to speak premeditately, with earnestness and freedom, for the instruction of other. See Job 33.2. Act 8.35.] he taught them, saying;
\p
\v 3 Blessed [are] the poor of spirit; [that is , the humble and broken – hearted, who understanding their own nothingness, have lowly conceit of themselves, relying only on the grace of God in Christ Jesus, Psal 51. 19. Isa 57 verse. 15] for theirs is the Kingdom of the Heavens.
\p
\v 4 Blessed [are] they that mourn, [that is to say who sorrowful for sins, of which sorrow is spoken also, 1 Cor. 5.2. and 2 Cor.7.9. to whom are opposed those that live in all jollity and voluptuousness, Luke 16. verse 19, 25.] for they shall be comforted.
\p
\v 5 Blessed [are] the meek, foe they shall inherit the earth. [That is, peaceably possesse it; which promise indeed concerns this present life; but especially here is understood that which shall be fulfilled in the life to come. See Psalm 37.11.]
\p
\v 6 Blessed [are] they which hunger and thirst after righteousness, [That is, who very earnestly long for, and endeavour after the true righteousness in Christ] for they shall be satisfied
\p
\v 7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall be shewed mercy.
\p
\v 8 Blessed are the pure of heart; [That is, who are purified by the spirit of Ggod from the desilements of sin, and from all manner of hypocrifie, Eph 5.26.] for they shall see God. [that is, shall perfectly know him, and behold his glory, 1 Cor. 13.12.]
\p
\v 9 Blessed are the peaceable, [Gr. peace- maker, who not only are peaceable of themselves, but likewise promote peace among others, Heb. 12.14. for they shall be called the children of God.[ that is, they shall be so indeed, and be acknowledged for such.]
\p
\v 10 Blessed are they that are persecuted, for righteousness sake; [that is, for the righteous cause of Christ and doctrine; like as in the following verse: for my sake] for theirs is the Kingdom of the Heavens.
\p
\v 11 Blessed are ye when [men] revile you, and persecute you, and lying speak all [That is to say, all manner of] evil [Gr. evil word] against you [that is to say, which croseth you, or is to your prejudice] for my sake
\p
\v 12 Rejoice and be very chearful, for your reward [Namely, which God promiseth, and shall give you, not of merit, but of grace for Christ sake, Rom 6.23, 3Cor.1.20. and so also Matthh 6. 1. and in other places frequenty] [is] great [Gr. much] in the Heavens: For so have persecuted the Prophet, which [were] before you. [that is, before your times, or in former times.]
\p
\v 13 Ye are salt of the earth : [So teachers are called, because as the slat makes savory, and preserves it from corruption, so they also by their doctrine make the souls of men acceptable to God, and preserve them destruction.] Now if the salt become unsavory, [that is to say, lose its saltnesse or sharpnesse, and vertue] wherewith shall it be salted ? It is good for nothing any more,. but to be cast out, and to be troden under foot of men.
\p
\v 14 Ye are the light of the world: [Because they enlighten others with their doctrine; and must also carry a light before them their lives, 1 Pet 5.3.] A City lying above on a bill, cannot behid.
\p
\v 15 Neither do men light a candle, and set it under a corn – measure, [or, bushel] but on a candlestick and it shhineth to all that [are] in the house.
\p
\v 16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works; and glorifie [or, praise and magnifie] your Father which is the Heavens
\p
\v 17 Think not that i come to dissolve the Law, or the Prophets, [That is to say, to alter, or to disannul the doctrine of the Law, or the Prophets] i am not come to dissolve, but to fulfill [them] . [that is to say, to expound, observe them, and to accomplishh that which was prefigured and foretold,]
\p
\v 18 For verily i say unto you, until hheaven and earth passe away, [That is, perish, or be changed. See Psalm 102. 27. Heb. 1. 11. and the Annotation upon thhe 2 Pet 3.10] there shall not one tota [this is the least letter of the Ggreeks, as Jod of the Hebrews, Whereby Christ would say, that even the least thing which is written in the Law shall not perish] or none tittle [ that is, stroak of a letter, or point] passe away from the Law until that all of it shall be come to passe
\p
\v 19 Therefore whosoever shall have dissolved one of these least commands, and shall be called the least [that is to say, shhall not at all he esteemed there: Or, shall not enter thereinto, as is expounded in the following verse. ] in the Kingdome of Heavens: But whoso shall have done and taught [them] he shall be called great in the Kingdome of the Heavens.
\p
\v 20 For i say unto you, except your righteousness be more abundant then that of the Scribes and Pharisees, that ye shall in no wise enter into the Kingdom of the Heavens.
\p
\v 21 Ye have hhead thhat it was said [by] the Ancients, [Or, to the Ancients. Hreby Christ understands the perverse interpretations of the Scribes and Pharisees, whho had so taught for many years before; and not the doctrine of Moses and the Prophets; which appaers 1. from the former verse. 2. Because hhere are doctrines consuted, which are not found in Moses and the Prophets: see verse 43. 3. Because nothing is added by Christ, but what is found in Moses and the Prophets: as may be seen by these places of the Old Testament, which are here set down, Exod 20. 13. Deut. 5.17. Ex . 20.14. Deut. 5.18. Deut. 24.1. Exod. 20.7. Lev. 9. 12 Deut. 5. 11. Exod. 21.24. Lev 24.20. Deut . 19. 21. Lev. 19.18.] Thou shalt not kill: but whosoever killeth, he shall be punishable [or, liable to be punished] by the Judgement.
\p
\v 22 But i say unto you: whosoevr is angry with his Brother unjustly, [that is, without cause, or lightly.]he shhall be punishable by the Judgement . [or sentence; whereby are understood the Judges, whhich in all Cities punished the murderers, Deut21. 21] And whosoever saith to his Brother, Raka, [It is Syriack word of the reproach, and is much to say, as empty – wit, or silly – head. Other think that it comes from swewing; and other that thereby is exprest a noise which men often make, thereby to give understand their anger, contempt, or reproach against their neighbour; as men commonly use to do by, sie upon thee, or the like.] he shall be punishable by the great Council.[ This was the highest Council in Jerusalem, called the Sanhedrim, which had the Judgemen of the weightiest matter, and therefore also sentenced the guilty to the greatest punishments. See Deut 17. and 2 Chron. 19.] But whoso saith, Thou fool, he shhall be punishable by Hell fire. [Gr. to, or in the gehenna of fire. Gehenna come from the Hhebrew word Gettinnom, that is, the valley of Hinnom, lying near city of Jerusalem, Josh.15.8. oin which Valley before – time the Idolatrous Jews caused their children to be burned alive between the glowing arms of the brazen image of Moloch. See 2 Kings 23. Jer 7.31. which seeing ot was horribel pain of Hell. Bt these punishments of death, whereof one is greater then the other, Christ shews that all these sins deserves eternal damnation; but that the shhall be punishhed more grievously then the other in the Judgement to come.]
\p
\v 23 If therefore thou shall offer thy gift upon the Altar, [This hathj respect to the worship of God under the Old Testament; but it is likewise withal understoos of the worship of the New Testament : although there be no such external altars and offerings in the same, Rom 12.1. and chap 15.16. Phil 4.18. Heb 13. verse 15, 16. or, bring to the Altar.]
\p
\v 24 Leave there thy gift before the Altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thhy Brothher, and ven then come and offer thy gift.
\p
\v 25 Be quickly well – minded [towards] thine adversary, [That is, bear with, or agree with him that for debt or otherwise goes to Law with thee] while thou art yet on the way with him: left perhaps the adversay deleiver thee over the Judge, and the Judge deliver thee over to the offer, and thou be cast into prison.
\p
\v 26 Verily i say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence, until thou shalt have paid the last penny. [Gr. Duadrant, whichh was one of the least coins which was used worth a little more than a farthing, according to and taught reckoning.]
\p
\v 27 Ye have heard that it was said [by] the Ancients, thou shaltnot commit adultery.
\p
\v 28 But i say unto you, that whoso looketh [on] a women, to desire the same, [Namely, for uncleanness] he hhath already commited adultery with her in his heart
\p
\v 29 Therefore if thy right eye [That is to say, what soever temporal thingg most preciuos, acceptable, or needful to thee,] offend thee, [that is, should provoke or cause thee to sin ,] punk it out, [that is, rather put such a thing away from thee: for it is profitable for thee, that one of thy members perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into Hell.
\p
\v 30 And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee; for it is profitable for thee; the one of thhy members perishh, and not thhat thy whole body should be cast into Hell.
\p
\v 31 It is likewise said; Whosoever shall forsake his wise, [That is, whosoever shall divorce himself from hiswife,] let him give her writing of divorcement . [Of this writing of divorcement, see Deut 24. verse1, &c. Malach 2.14. and Mat. 19. verse. 7. out of which places it appears, that God never approved of rath divorces]
\p
\v 32 But i say unto you, that whosoever shall forsake hhis wife, otherwise then for the cause of fornication, he causeth her to commit adultery; and whosoever shall marry her that is forsaken, he commiteth adultery.
\p
\v 33 Aggain ye have heard that it was said [by] the Anetents; Thou shalt not break thine oath, [That is, not swear so, as nit keep thine oath] but thou shalt keep thine oaths unto the Lord. [that is, pay that which thou hast promised by oath to God or men,]
\p
\v 34 But i say unto you, swear not all, [Namely, neither, or unnecessary, nor deceitfully, nor by the creatures. For a right and necessary oathh is not forbidden; as may be seen, Rom 1.9. and chapter 9.1. and 2 Cor.1.23. and chapter 11. 31. and chap 12.19. Gal 1. verse. 20. Phil 1 verse 8. 1 Thess. 5. 27. Heb. 6. vers. 13,16,17. Rev. 10.6.] neither by the heaven, because it is the Throne of God:
\p
\v 35 Nor by the earth, because is the foot – stool of his feet neither by Jerusalem, because it is the City of the great King.
\p
\v 36 Neither shalt thou swear by thine head, because thou canst not make one hair whhite or black.
\p
\v 37 But let your word yea, hhe yea, nay, nay; [That is, in your daily dealings, and ordinary discourse, use simple, true, and upright words. See Jam 5.12.] what is above these [that is, that which is added even to supersluity, by vain and unnecessary swearing, or otherwise.] that is of the evil one.
\p
\v 38 Ye have head, that is was said, An eye for an eye, and tooth for tooth. [This Law which was given to the Magistrates, was by the Scribes and Pharisees mis – interpreted, to private revenge, whichh Christ here in the following words reproves.]
\p
\v 39 But i say unto you , that resist not evil but whosoever smiteth thee on the right check, turn to be the other also. [Namely, rather then that should strevenge thy self. For that this is not simply to be understood, appears form the example of Christ himself, John 18. 23. And so also must the two verses next following be understood.]
\p
\v 40 And if any will go to Law with thee, and take thy coat, let him thy cloak also.
\p
\v 41 And whosoever shall compel thee [In the Greek, a Persian word is used, whhereby is signified a Courtservice, where unto the subject were compelled to carry the burdens of the Posts, (or Messengers) or to lend and drive their Asse, &c for this purpose. The same word is used also, Mat 27. 32.] to go a mile, go with him two [miles]
\p
\v 42 Give to him that ntreats [any thing] of thee, [or, desires, ask] and turn not away from him, that will borrow of thee.
\p
\v 43 To have heard that it was said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour , and hate thine enemy. [This stands no where in Gods law, but the contrery whereof stands Deut32. 35. pROV 25.21]
\p
\v 44 But i say unto you, Love your enemies, blesse them which curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for those that offer violence unto you, [Other wise reproach you, like as the same word is taken, 1 Pet 3. 16.] and persecute you
\p
\v 45 That ye may be [ That is, that it may appear that you be] the children of your Father which is in the Heavens. For he causeth his sun to arise upon the evil and the good and rains upon the just and unjust.
\p
\v 46 For if you love [Namely, only as appears out of the following verse.] these that love what reward hhave ye? Do not the publicans also the same?
\p
\v 47 And if you salute [or, friendly intreat] your brethren only, what do you more then others? Do not also the publicans so?
\p
\v 48 Be ye therefore perfect, like as your Fther which is in Heaven is perfect.
\c 6
\s Christ teachest how men must give alms, 1. Pray, 5. Fast 16 What treasure to lay up, 19. Hhow thhe understanding, must be disposed, 22. That men cannot serve two masters, 24. That we must commit the care of bodily necessaries to God , 25 and seek the Kingdom of God before all things, 33.
\p
\v 1 Take heed that ye do not your alms [The Ggreek word Eleemosyne, from whence Alms comes, signifies in general a work of mercy, and in special liberality to the poor, because that must proceed from compassion 1 Cor 13.3. some Ggreek Copies hhave rightetousness.] before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward with your father which is in the Heavens.
\p
\v 2 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, cause not a Trumpet to be sounded before thee, like as the dissemblers do [Gr. hypocrites: which word signifies the Actors in a stage – play, which shew themselves for other persons then they are indeed] in the Synagoggues, and in the streets, that they may be honour which they seek of men, is their reward.]
\p
\v 3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left [hand] know, what thy right hand doth. [That is, do it in the most secret manner, without seeking glory by]
\p
\v 4 That thy alms may be in secret, and thy Father whhich seeth in secret, he shall reward thee openly. [Namely oftentimes hhere, but especially hereafter in the last judgemnet, see Matth 25.34]
\p
\v 5 And when thou prayest, [Namely, in particular For publique prayer also in the Assembles, are acceptable to God, and have special promises, Matth 18.19.] thou shalt not be like the hypocrites: For they love to pray standing in the synagogues, [namely out of the time publique players] and in the corner of the streets, that they may be seen of men. [or, to make a shew before men.] verily, i say unto you , thay they have – away their reward.
\p
\v 6 But thou when thou prayest, enter into thy inner chamber, [The Greek word signifies a place or chamber, where men lay away or shut up anything] having shhut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret, and they Father whhich seethh in secret, shall recompence thee openly
\p
\v 7 And whhen thou prayeth, use no vain rehearfall of words, [Ggr. Battolaggia, that is , when any words or expressions, are often repeated , without need or earnestness] like as the Heathen for they think that they shall he hhead for their multitude of words
\p
\v 8 Be therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what thy have need of, before ye pray to him.
\p
\v 9 Terefore pray ye thus? [That is to say, order all your prayer according to this form. Not that we are bound only oe always to these words; for in necessities that may fall out, it is also awful further to enlarge some petitions; and also to expresse thhem in orther words. See John 17 and Acts 4.24.] Our Fathher, which [art] in Heavens. [that is, in the third Heaven, 2 Cor 12.2. where he most of all manifest his Majestry and Glory, Psalm 103. 19.] Hallowed be thy Name[that is to say magnified by us in words and deeds.]
\p
\v 10 Thy Kingdome come, [Namely, both of grace in this world, and of glory in Heaven] Thy will be done as in Heaven, [namely by the holy Angels, Psalm 103.20,21 and of the belsed and perfect souls, Hheb. 12. 23.] [to] also upin earth.
\p
\v 11 Ggive us this day, our daily bread [That is, sufficient and necessary for the preservation of our life, for thie day: or our appointed portion, Proverbs 30. v.8.] bread [that is to say, all necessaries for the body, Genesis 3. v. 19.]
\p
\v 12 And for give us our debts, [that is, sins, Luke 11.4. which make us debtors to suffer punishment; seeMat 18, verse. 24.] as we also forgive our debtors.
\p
\v 13 And elad us not [Or, bring us not; thhat is, give us not over] into temptation, namely, of satan of the world, and pof our own flesh; to bring us to sin, or to evil, See Jam 1. 13,14.] but deliver us from evil one. For tine is the Kingdom, and the power and the glory for ever and ever Amen [It is an Hebrew word, and is much to sya, Let it be, or, So be it, Or, it is surely so. Se Deut 27.15. Nehem 8.7.]
\p
\v 14 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your Heavenly Father will also forgive you.
\p
\v 15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will you Father forgive your trespasses, [Gr, slips whereby are understood all manner of sins.]
\p
\v 16 And whhen thou fastest [Namely, in particular; for in public necessities or fasts, it is unlawful to shew a sad contenance, if be done without hypocrisie.] shew not a sad contenance, as the hypocrites do: for they disfigure their faces, [Gr. obscure, or marre] that they may be seen of men when they fast, Verily i say unto you, that they have – away their reward.
\p
\v 17 But thou when thou fastest, anoint thine head, [Chhrist speakes here according to the custome of the Jews; who in times of rejoycing, anointed and washhed themselves, Psalm 23.5. Amos 6.6. Luke 7. 46] and wash thy face.
\p
\v 18 That is may not be seen of men whhen thou fastest, but by Father which is in secret: and thy Father whichh seeth in secret, shall recompance thee in openly.
\p
\v 19 Gather not to your selves treasures upon earth, [Namely, principally, or so as to make your works of it without due considaration of the Heavenly treasure,] where the moth and the rust [Gr. eating; eating – in] corrupt them, and where theeves digge thorow and steal.
\p
\v 20 But gather your selves treasures in Heaven, where neither the moth nor the rust corrupts them, and where theeves do not digge thorow and steal.
\p
\v 21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
\p
\v 22 The candle of the body is the eye, [That is, as the body by the eye, so all that a man doth, or leaves undone, is guided and orderd by the understanding] if therefor thine be single; thy whole body shall be inlightened
\p
\v 23 But if thine eye be evil, [That is, blinded or corrupted ] thy whole body shall be darkness, how great [shall] the darkeness [it self be]
\p
\v 24 No man can serve two Masters, [Namely, which are contrary to one onether.] for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will adhere to the one, [or, keep himself to the one] and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God, and Mammon. [This is a Syriack word, and signifies, gain, or treasures, which men oftentimes honour and serve as a God .]
\p
\v 25 Therefor i say unto you, Be careful [Namely, with an anxious and immoderate care, springing from want faith, and hendering the care of our salvation. Otherwise, we ought also to take care for these things] for your life, [Gr. soul; whereby is meant the life; See Job 2.6. Matth 2. verse. 20] what ye shall eat, and what ye shall drink; neither for your body, wherewith ye shall cloth your selves: Is not the life more then meat, and body then raiment?
\p
\v 26 Behold, the fowls of the Heaven, [That is, of the Air, see Psalm 8.9.] that they sowe not , neither reap, nor gather into Barns; and [yet] your Heavenly Father feeds the same. Do not ye [very] much excel them? [Gr. Do not ye differ very muchh from them.]
\p
\v 27 Whic of you, i pray, by taking thought, can adde one ell [Ggr. one cubit, that is, the length of the arm, from the elbow, to the end of the middle finger. Or, a foot and half] to his lengt?
\p
\v 28 And why are ye careful for raiment? Consider the Lillies of the filed, how they grow, they labour not, neither they spin:
\p
\v 29 And i say unto you, the even Salomon in sll his glory [Read thereof, 1 Kings 4.] was not arrayed like one of these.
\p
\v 30 Now if God so clothhe the grass of the field, which to day is, and tomorrow is cast into the Oven, [That is, which shortly after, being withered, is good for nothing else almost, but to heat Ovens withal.] shall be not much more [clothe] you, O ye of little faith?
\p
\v 31 Therefore be not careful, saying: what shall we eat? or what shall we drink? or wherewith shall we clothe us?
\p
\v 32 For all these things do thhe Gentiles seek: [namely, with enxiety and trouble, as their happinesse lay therein] For your Heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
\p
\v 33 But seek first the Kingdom of God, and his righteousness, [Namely, Gods, as appeas out of the Greek Text: that is, which is acceptable to God, will stand before him, and is revealed to us in the Gospel.] and shall these things shall be cast unto you. [Gr. laid – unto, or, superadded; namely, as over – measure, or somewhat given over and above see Psalm 127.2.]
\p
\v 34 Therefore be not careful against the morrow: For the morrow shall take care of its own things, [each] day care and trouble, which happens every day.]
\c 7
\s Christ teacheth further how we must judge of our neighbour , and reprove him, 1. That we must not propound that which is holy unto scorners, 6. That we must continue to pray , 7. HHOw we must deal with our neighbour, 12. Of the strait and wide gate, 13. Of avoiding false Prophets, 15 That all shall not be saved, that outwardly serve God, 21. That we must not only hear the word of God, but also do it, 24.
\p
\v 1 Judge not [Namely, rashly, or perversely, out of hatred, envy, or groundless suspition. Otherwise an upright judgment, of things whereof a man hath a right knowledge, when it is done to a good end, aswel in judgment as out of it, is not only lawful, but also commanded. See 2 Chron. 9. verse 6. John 7.24. 1 Cor.5. 12.] that ye be not judged.
\p
\v 2 For with what judgement ye judge, ye shall e judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.
\p
\v 3 And what seest thou thhe splinter that is thy brothers eye, [That is to say, small or lesser faults; like as bny the beam great and grosse faults are understood] but observe not the beam which is thine own eye?
\p
\v 4 Or how wilt thou say thy Brother, Let me put out the splinter out of thine eye, and behold, there is a beam in thine eye?
\p
\v 5 Thou hypocrite, first cast the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou discrern how to put out the sprinter out of thy brothhers eye.
\p
\v 6 Give not thy which is Holy [Holy is properly that which is seperated from the common use, and thereby is here understood in the preaching of the gospel ,or admonitions, and consolations out of Gods Word, as also the administration of the holy Sacraments, which by reason of their worth are here also called pearls, and which must not be given to stiffe necked, and obstinate scorners, who are compared to dogs and swine, Prov 9. vers.8. 1 Cor 10.21. Phil 3.2.] unti the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine; lest at any time they trample the same under their feets, and turning again tear you.
\p
\v 7 Ask and it shhall be given you; seek and ye shallfinde, knock and ishhall be opened unto you. [By asking, seeking and knocking, Chhrist exhost us, to persevere continually with earnestness in prayer. See also Rom 12.12. 1 Thess 5.17.]
\p
\v 8 For every one that askethh, [Namely, in faith, and according to Gods will, Lam 1.6. 1 John 5.14.] hhe receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and hhe that knocketh, to him it shall be opened.
\p
\v 9 Or what a man is there among you; id his sonne should ask him for bread, that will give him a stine?
\p
\v 10 And if he should ask him for a fish, that will give him serpent?
\p
\v 11 If ye then who are evil, know to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father which is in Heaven, give good [gifts] to them whhich ask them of him?
\p
\v 12 Therefore all [things] that ye would than men shhould do unto you; do ye likewise even so to them: for that is the Law of prophets. [That is to say, the summe of all that which the Law and thhe Prophets, interpreters of sama, teach concerning the second Table of the Decatogue, concerning the sove of our neighbour, Matth 22.39.]
\p
\v 13 Enter through the strait gate, for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, thhat leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in through the same.
\p
\v 14 For straight is the gate, and narrow is the way,[That is, not only respect of the strict obedience, which God requires of us, but also because it is full of trouble and adversities. See Acts 14.22.] which leadeth into life, and few therebe that finde the same.
\p
\v 15 But take heed to [your selves] of false Prophets, which come to you in shheep clothing, [That is, in a fair outward shew] but inwardly they are griping wovels. [that is to say, seducers, and soul – murderers, John 10.18. Acts 20.29.]
\p
\v 16 Their fruits [By these fruits are understood not so much the life, whichh may deceive fro atime, as the Doctrine, whhich must be tried by Gods Word, 1 Jo 4.1.] ye shall know them. Do men also gather a grape of thorns, or figs of thistles?
\p
\v 17 Even so every good Tree brins forth good fruits; and a evil Tree [Gr. a rotten tree] brings forth evil fruits.
\p
\v 18 A good Tree cannot bring forth evil fruits: nor an evil fruits: nor an evil tree bring forth good fruits.
\p
\v 19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruits, is bewen down, and cast into the fire.
\p
\v 20 Therefore their fruits ye shhall know them.
\p
\v 21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, [Thhat is to say, that boasts muc and vainly of Christ and his doctrine,] shall enter the Kingdom of Heavens: but he that doth the will of my Father, which is in the Heavens. [That is to say, he that truly believes in Christ, John 6. 40. and ordereth his life according to Gods commandements, 1 Thess 4. verse 3
\p
\v 22 Many will say to me at that day [Namely, of the last Judgement, Matth 24. 36.] Lord, Lord, Have we not prophesied in thy Name, [that is to say, by the command and power, as thy Ministers; and for the spreading abroad of thy glory] and in thy Name cast out Devils, and in thy Name done many powerful (works)? [that is to say, wonderful signs, or miracles, 1 Cor 12. 10 because they are done by the power of God.]
\p
\v 23 And i will openly say unto them, [Gr. confess] i have never known you, [namely, for mine. See John 10.14. and 2 Tim 2.19.] Depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
\p
\v 24 Therefore everyone that heareth these my words, and doth the same, i will liken him unto a prudent man, whou built his house upon rock.
\p
\v 25 And they fell down violent rain, [by violent rains, water flouds, and winds are understood all manner of persecution, and temptations, whereby a men might be brought to Apostasie] and the water – flouds came, and wind blew; and fell against the house, and at fell not; for it was founded upon a rock. [This rock signifies Christ, 1 Pet. 2.6.]
\p
\v 26 And everyone that heareth these my words, and doth them not, he shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house upon the sent. [By the sand is understood, what so ever men lay beside Christ for the foundation of their salvation, Acts 4. 12.]
\p
\v 27 And the violent rain fell down, and the water flouds come, and the wind blew, and beat aginst the house, and it fell, and the fall of it was great
\p
\v 28 And it come to pass when Jesus had ended these words, [that] the maltidutes were astonished [or, amazed, were stricken with admiration, and perturbation of their minde,] at his doctrine.
\p
\v 29 For he taught them, as having power, [That is to say, with a divine authority, and with a singular essicacy and freedom. see Luke 4. verse. 22. and John 7. verse 45,46] and not as the Scribes.
\c 8
\s Christ cleanseth a leper, 1. Hhealeth thhe Centurions Servant, 5 Peters mother in law, 14. and many more, 16. Declares his poverty, to a Scribe that would follow him, 18. and commands another to follow him without delay, 21. Still the Templest on the sea , 23. drives out the Devils of two that were possessed, and permits them to enter into Swines, 28.
\p
\v 1 Now when he was come down from the mountain, Namely, on which he went up to preach, Matth.5.1] many multitudes followed him.
\p
\v 2 And behold, a laper [ Leprosie, in those hot Countries, was a very grievous and filthy disease, or scurf, proceeding from corrupt blood in men, and was a pleague insecring not only men, but like garments and house. se Levit chapter 13. and 14.] came and worshiped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
\p
\v 3 And Jesus stretching forth his hand, touched him, [Namely, to heal him. Other wise , they were unclean according to the Law , that touched the Lepers, Levis 14. 46.] saying, i will, Be thou cleansed. And immediately [he] was cleansed [from] his leprosie.
\p
\v 4 And Jesus said unto him; see that thou tell [this] to no man. The reason hereof, see Matth 12.16.] but go thy way, shhew thy self to the Priest [Namely, to be viewed, or looked upon by him, whether he were truly cleansed. See Lev 14. verse 2. from whence auricular confession cannot be proved; seeing Christ sends him not to be cleansed, but to have it declared that he was cleansed] and offer the gift which Moses commanded [or instituted. see Lev 14. 4, etc.] for a testimony unto them. [or, conviction, namely, that they did evil in rejecting Christ, of whose miracles they themselves had given testimony.]
\p
\v 5 Now when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came to him a Centurian intreating him,
\p
\v 6 And saying, Lord, my servants lyeth at home sick of the palsie; and endures grievous terments.
\p
\v 7 And Jesus said unto him, i will come, and head him.
\p
\v 8 And the centurion answering, said, Lord, i am not worthy, that thou shouldest come under my roof; but speak a word only, and my servant shall be healed.
\p
\v 9 For i also am a man under power [of their] [that is to say, if i, who stand under the command of others, have such authority over those that are under me, & are men also as i am; how much more must all things stand under thy command, who art Lord over all?] having soulders under me, and i say unto this (men), Go, and he goeth, and the other, come, and he cometh and to my servant, do that, and he doth it.
\p
\v 10 Now Jesus hearing [this] marvelled, and said unto that followed [him], Verily is say unto you, i have not found great faith, even in Israel it self, [Namely, as in this Heathenish Captain]
\p
\v 11 But i say unto you, that many shall come from the East, and from the West, [Gr. from the rising and setting, [Namely, of the sunne: that is, out of all quarters of the world; whereby is foretold, the calling, conversion, and salvation of the Gentiles, John 11. 52.] and shall sit down with Abraham, and Iscaac, and Jacob, in the Kingdome of the Heavens
\p
\v 12 And the children of the Kingdome [That is, the Jews; with whom God had indeed made external Covenant, but who by their unbelief, had made themselves unworthy of it, Acts 13.46] shall he cast out into the outmost darkeness, [that is, which is without the Kingdome of Heaven; namely, into Hell] ther shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\p
\v 13 And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way, and be it done unto thee like as hasth believed. And his servant was healed in the self same hour.
\p
\v 14 And Jesus being come into the house of Peter, saw his wife mother, [From whence it appears that the Apostle Peter was married, and being made an Apostle, did not forsake his wife. See also 1 Cor. 9. 5.] lie [bedrid] [Gr. cast] having a Fever.
\p
\v 15 And he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she rose, and ministred unto them.[Otherwise him,]
\p
\v 16 And when it was become late [or, evening] they brought unto hhim many possed of the devil, and he cast out the [evil] spirit with a word, [that is, by his command only] and he healed all [namely, that come, or were brought unto him, see Matth. 4.24.] that were ill at ease.
\p
\v 17 That it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the Prophet Esaias. saying; He took our infirmittes [ipon him] and bare [our] sickness. [This Esa. 53.4. is principally understood of our spiritual infirmities and sickness, i.e. of our sins; which Christ took from us upon himself to satisfie for the same , and thereby to redeem us from them; which he likewise gave to understand by the hhealing of bodily sickness.]
\p
\v 18 And Jesus seeing may multitude round about him, gave command to pass over the other side. [namely, of the Sea of Galilee, towards the land of the Gergesenes, over against Capernaum. see verse 5. and ver. 28.]
\p
\v 19 And there came a certain Scribe unto him, and said unto him, Master, [or, Doctor, (or teacher) ] i will follow thee, whithersoever thou goest
\p
\v 20 And Jesus said unto him: The foxes have holes, and the fowls of the Heaven [that is, of the Air, as chapter 6. verse. 25] nest, [or, resting – places; where they go rest as under a Tent, like as the Greek word properly imports] but the son of man hath not where he may lay down his head.
\p
\v 21 And another of his Disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me that i may first go nad bury my Father.
\p
\v 22 But Jesus said unto him, Follow me, and let the dead [those that live in their sins, are called spiritually dead, 1 Tim. 5.6. Rev. 3.1.] bury their dead.
\p
\v 23 And when he was gone into the ship, his Disciples followed him,
\p
\v 24 And behold, thhere arose [Gr. was] a great Tempest [or, commotion] in the sea, so that the ship was covered of the waves: but he slept.
\p
\v 25 And his Disciples coming to [him] rouzed him up, saying, Lord, save us, we perish.
\p
\v 26 And he said unto them, Why are ye timorous, o ye of little faith? The he arose rebuked the winds and the sea, [Commanding them to be still. see Mark. 4 . 39.] and there was a great calm.
\p
\v 27 And the men marvelled, saying, what manner of (man) is this, that even the winds and the sea are obedient unto him?
\p
\v 28 And when he was come over the other side, into the Countrey of the Gergesenes, [Mark 5.1. and Luke 8. 26. say, of the Gadarens, for those Cities Ggadara and Gargessa lay by one another on the sea of Galilee over against Capernaum] there met him two possessed of the Devil, coming out of the Graves, [the graves there, were much in caves, holes, or vaults without the Cities, as to be seen, Matth. 27.60.] which were very fierce, so that no man could pass by that way.
\p
\v 29 And behold, they cryed, saying, Jesus the Son of God, what have we [to do] with thee? Art thou come hither to torment us before the time? [Appointed by God foe their torment, which shall be in the last judgement. See Jude verse6. 2 Pet. 2.4.]
\p
\v 30 And far off from them there was an herd of many swine feeding [These places were much inhabited by Greek or Heaten, for whose use these swine were fed; for the Jews were forbidden to eat swines flesh. See Lev chap 11.]
\p
\v 31 And the Devil besought him, saying, if thou cast us out, suffer us that we may go unto the Herd of swine.
\p
\v 32 And he said unto them, Go your way. And they going forth, went their way into the Herd of Swines: And behold, the whole herd of Swine rushed head – long down from a steep place into the sea, and died in the water.
\p
\v 33 And those that fed them, fled: and when ther were come into the city, they told all [those] things, and what [was befallen] to those that were possessed.
\p
\v 34 And behold, the whole City went out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they desired that he would depart out their coasts.

\s Christ healeth one that had the palse, or was lame; and shews that he hath power to forgive sins, 1. Calleth Matthew, and eaten with the Publicans, 9 Defendeth his Dsciples, that they did not fast, 14. Healed a woman of her bloody – issue, 20. Raiseth a Ruler little daughter that was dead, 23 Restoreth two blind men to their sight, 27. Casteth a dumb Devil, 32 Preacheth, and healeth many sick persons, 35. Exhorts to pray for labourers to be sent into the Hervest, 36.
\p
\v 1 And being entered into the ship, he passed over, and come into hhis (own) City, [Namely, Capernaum, where he had taken his habitation, see Mattw 4.13. Mark 2.1] And behold, they brought unto him one sick of the palsie, [or, one that was lame, ass Matth.4. 24] lying on a bed.
\p
\v 2 And Jesus seeingtheir faith, [Namely, aswell of the sick of the palse, as of those that brought him] said to the sick of the palse, son, be of good cheart, [or, be confident.] thy sins are forgiven thee.
\p
\v 3 And behold, some of the Scribes said within themselves, This (man) blasphemeth [God] [ascribing to himself, that which belongethh to God alone. See Isa.43. verse 25. and chap 44.22. The Greek word properly signifies to wound, desame, or hurt any one good name.]
\p
\v 4 And Jesus seeing their thoughhts, [That is, descerning the reasoning of their mind] said, Wherefore thhink evil in your hhearts?
\p
\v 5 For which is easier to say, thhe sins are forgiven thee; or, to say, Arise and walk? [for both these are alike difficult, and the proper works of God.]
\p
\v 6 But you the ye may know, that thhe Son of man [So Chhrist names himself, because he being the Son of God, is also true man, of man, and under this title was promised, Dan.7.13. as also, because he was in low estate amongst men, Ezech 1.26. Phil. 2.7, 8.] hath power [namely, because he is also true of God, in one person, Acts 20.28.] on the earth to forgive sins. (Then said he to the sick of the palse) Arise, take up thhy bed, and goe thy way to thine house.
\p
\v 7 And he being risen up, went away to his house . [Namely, having taken up his bed, as is to be seen, Mar. 2.21. and Luke 5. verse. 25.]
\p
\v 8 Now the multitudes seeing [that] they marvelled, and glorified God; which had given such power unto men.
\p
\v 9 And Jesus going forth from thence, saw a man sitting in the custome; for he was a Publican, Matth 10.3.] named Matthew, [And was called Levi. see Mark 2.14. and Luke 5.27. and is the same that wrote this Ggospel.] and said unto him, Follow me. And he rising up, followed him.
\p
\v 10 And it come to pass, as he sate at (meat) in the house [of Matthew] [of the manner of sitting down at the Table, see John 13.23.] Behold, many Publicans and sinners [that is to say, companions of the Publicans; which by the Jews were accounted great sinners, or which lived in an open course of sinning] came and sate down together, with Jesus and his Disciples.
\p
\v 11 And the Pharisees seeing [that] said unto hhis Disciples; wherefore eaten your Master with publicans and sinners?
\p
\v 12 But Jesus hearing [this] said unto them, They that are whole [Gr. strong , able] have no need of the Physician, but they that are sick [Gr. they that are ill at ease, or ill – disposed.]
\p
\v 13 But go your way, and learn what that is, i will (have) mercy, and not sacrifice [That is to say, i take more pleasure in the works of mercy, amongst which also the endeavour to convert a man is principally contained, then in sacrifices.] For i am not come to call the righteous, [because there are none such, however the Pharisies had a conceit, that they were such, Luke 18. 9.] but sinners to repentance.
\p
\v 14 Then come the Disciples of John unto him, saying, Wherefore do we and the Pharisees fast much, and thy Disciples fast not?
\p
\v 15 And Jesus said unto them, Can (any) children of the wedding [Gr. the Sons; that is, the children of the marriage – chamber, which we call bride -men.See Judg.14.11. These are also called the friends of the Bridegroom, John 3.29.] mourn, as long as the Bridegroom is with them? But the days shall come, when the Bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast.
\p
\v 16 Likewise no man sets a piece [By these similitudes Chhrist would give us to understand, that his Disciples were yet to tender and weak, Acts 2.4] of undrest cloth [that is not made ready, new, not worn, as Luke 5. 36.] upon an old garment: for the patch there of that was set [Gr. ye filling – up] rends off from the garment [or, rends somewhat off, as Mark 2.21. namely, the new from the old; that is, rends off the patch that was set on] and there is worse rent made.
\p
\v 17 Neither do men put new wine into old (leather) bottle: otherwise thhe (leather) bottles burst, [or rent] and the wine is spilled, and the (leather) bottles spoil: but men put new wine into new (leather) bottles, and both are preserved together.
\p
\v 18 While he spake these things unto them, Behold a certain Ruler [Namely, of the Synagogue, called Jairus. see Mark 5.22 Luke 8.41.] came and worshiped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead, but come and lay thine hhand on her, and she shall live. [that is, be alive again]
\p
\v 19 And Jesus being risen up, followed him, and his Disciples.
\p
\v 20 And behold a woman, which had had an issue of blood twelve years, coming to him, behind [because she durst not make known her desease] touched the hem of his garment.
\p
\v 21 For she said within her self, if i do only touch his garment[ She did not ascribe this vertue of healing to the garment, but to Jesus Christ himself, who was there present, as appeares out of the following verse, and of Mark 5.30. and Luke 8.46. see the like, Mattw 14. 36] i shall be whole [Gr. delivered, or sarved.]
\p
\v 22 And Jesus turning him about, seeing her, said, Be of good chear, daughter, thy faith hath saved thee. (And the women was made whole from that very minute)
\p
\v 23 And when Jesus came into the Rulers house, and saw the pipers, [Who with mournful tones, sought to stir up the people to weeping and lamenting for the dead: which custome the Jews had borrowed of the Heathen] and the confused multitude, (or, tumultuos people.)
\p
\v 24 He said unto them, Depart, for the maid is not dead [Namely, to continue dead, seeing Christ purposed to raise her up. Otherwise, death is said to be no death , but deep a sleep, in respect of the general resurrection, John 11.11.] but sleepeth. And they laughed at him.
\p
\v 25 Now when the company was driven out, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose [Gr. was raised up; namely, from death.]
\p
\v 26 And this same went out through all through all that land.
\p
\v 27 And when Jesus went forth from thence, two binde (ones) following him, crying and saying, (Thou) Son of David [The Messias was acknoledged for a Son of David, because he should proceed from the stock of David, according to the promise made to David. See Matth 1.1.] have mercy on us.
\p
\v 28 And when he was come into the house, the blind came unto him, And Jesus said unto them, Believe ye that i am able to do this? They said unto him, yea, Lord.
\p
\v 29 Then touched he their eyes, saying, Be it done unto you according to your faith.
\p
\v 30 And their eyes were opened. And Jesus very straightly forbid them, [Gr. threatned them with earnest moving of the mind] saying, see that no man know it.
\p
\v 31 But they being gone forth, made him famous through out that whole country.
\p
\v 32 Now as these went out, behold thye brought into the Devil [ Whom the Devil, whereof he was possessed, had had made speechless]
\p
\v 33 And when the Devil was cast out, the dumb spake and the multitudes wondered, saying, There was never the like [Gr. thus] seen in Israel.
\p
\v 34 But the Pharisees said, He casteth out Devils through the Chief of the Devils.[Matth 10.25 and 12. 27. called Beelzebul. For even amonst the unclean spirits, there is one that bears rule over the rest. See Matth 25. vers.41.]
\p
\v 35 And Jesus went about all the Cities and Villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the Gospel of the Kingdome, and healing all sickness, [That is to say, all manner of sickness and all diseases among the people.
\p
\v 36 And he seeing the multitude, was inwardly moved with compassion on them, [Gr. was moved in his bowels] because they were tired, [Gr. loosened, and dissolved] and scattered sheep like sheep which have no shepherd .
\p
\v 37 The said he to his Disciples, the harvest indeed is great [Gr. much] but the labourers are few.
\p
\v 38 Pray ye therefore the Lord of the Harvest, that he trust forth [Gr. cast out; that is, send forth having by the power of his spirit made them willing and fit for it] labourers into his Harvest.
\c 10
\s Christ gives his Apostles power to work miracles, 1 Their names, 2. Sends them to preach amongst the people of Israel, 5 Instrust them how to sit themselves for the Journey, and how to carry themselves towards those that received them, and that recieve them not, 8. What troubles they shall met withal, and what they have to comfort themselves withal in them all,16. Teacheth what reward they have to expect, that confess him constantly, 32. and are bountiful towards his servants, 40.
\p
\v 1 And having called his twelve Disciples unto him he gave them power [Namely, to work miracles in his name, and by the power of God; not by their own power, see Acts 3. 12,16.] over (oragainst) unclean spirits, to cats them out, and to heal every sickness and every disease.
\p
\v 2 Now the names of the twelve Apostles are these: The first, Simon, called Peter , [Peter is here named first, not because he had power and authority over the rest; which Gods Word no where teacheth; seeing that herein the Apostles were equal one to another, John 20. 22, 23. but as it seems, because he was the eldest , and first called the Apostleship by christ , Matth. 4. 18. Otherwise James is also first named, before Peter, Gal. 2.9. Or else because he with his brother Andrew, was the first pair which were sent forth] and Andrew his brother : james the (son) of Zebedee, and John his brother.
\p
\v 3 Philip, and Bartholomew: Thomas and Matthew the publicans, [that is, who had been a publican. see Matth 9. verse 9. is called Levi, Mark 2. verse. 14. Luke 5. 27, 29.] James the (son) of Alpheus, and Lebbeus, sirnamed Thaddai in the Syriack is Judas in the Hebrew, which was first name, See John 14. 22. Though some think that this is yet a third name of this Apostle, and of another Original; he is also sirnamed Lebbeus.]
\p
\v 4 Simon the Cananite [That is, Zealot; Gr. Zelotes; like as the first Simon is sirnamed Peter, so is this second sirnamed Cananite; i.e. Zealot: to distinguish him from the other: see Luke 6. 15 Act 1. 13.] and Judas Iscariot, [Some think that this Judas was called from the City Kirioth, lying in the Tribes of Judah, Josh 15. 25. Other from Decarjuth, which signifies a purse, because he carried the purse, John 12. 6.] who also betrayed him. [Gr. delievered him over
\p
\v 5 these twelve jesus sent forth ; and gave them command, saying, ye shall not go on the way of the Gentiles, neither shhall ye enter into ?(any) City of the Samaritans. [The Samaritans are here joined with the Gentiles, and distinguished from them, because that however they were on Gentiles – off – spring; yet they hhad taken up many Ceremonies of the Jews. See 2 Kings 17.]
\p
\v 6 But go much rather, to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. [That is, the Jews, who were as wandering sheep, without true Teachers. To these the Gospel must first be preached, Matth 15. 24. Acts 13. 46.]
\p
\v 7 And going on, preach, saying, the Kingdome of Heaven is come nigh.
\p
\v 8 Heal the sick, [Gr. infirm] cleanse the Lepers, raise up the dead, cast out Devils. Ye have received it for nothing, give it for nothing.
\p
\v 9 Get ye neither gold, nor silver, nor brass, (mony) [Namely, for provision on your journey] in your girdles [Or, purse; for the Jews had broad thongs, or girdles, to truss up their long garments therewith, in which they likewise carried theor money.]
\p
\v 10 Nor scrip for the way, neither two Coats, [That is, no clothes but those which they had no] neither shoes, nor staff: For the labourer is worthy of his food.
\p
\v 11 And into what City or Town ye shall come in, in Enquire who therein is worthy, [That is to say, who will willingly embrace the Gospel, Acts 2.41. which worthiness no man hath of himself, but he that the Lord by spirit, makes worthy and meet for it, Matth 22.8,9. 2 Cor. 3.5.] and there abide until ye go forth (thence), [that is to say, out of that city or Town]
\p
\v 12 And when ye enter into the house, salute the same:[That is to say, with those that dwell there in peace and happiness, as appears in the following verse. Other adde thereto; saying, peace be to this house: see Luke 10.5.]
\p
\v 13 And if that house be worthy, let your peace come upon he same; but if be not worthy, let your peace return unto you.
\p
\v 14 And if any shall not receive you, nor hear your words; going forth out of that house, or outof that City, shake off the dust of your feet. [To signifie thereby, that from thenceforward they desired to have no communion at all with them. See Acts 13.51 and chap 18. 6 see the like, Nehem.5. 13.]
\p
\v 15 Verily i say unto uou, it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodome and Gomora [or, the land of those of Sodom , and Gomorra] in the day of judgment, then for that City.
\p
\v 16 Behold, i send you as sleep in the middest of wolves: Be ye therefore prudent as the Serpents, and upright as the Doves. [or, simple. The Greek wordis by similitude taken from things that are unmixed, and unsalsified.
\p
\v 17 But take heed of men: For they will delivery you up into Council – Assemblies, [Gr. Synedria see the exposition thereof, Mat 5. 22. an example, Act. 5. 40.] and their syanagogues will they scourge you.
\p
\v 18 And ye shall also be bed before Governours, [Namely, of Provinces, like as were Festus, and Felix, and the like. See Acts 24.10. and 1 Pet 2.14. see likewise Nehem. 5.] and Kings for my sake, for a testimony unto them and the Gentiles.
\p
\v 19 But when they deliver you over; ye shall not be careful how much or what shall speak. [Not that we may not bethink our selves before – hhand; or pray to God for wisdom, but that we must not be too much perplexed or troubled thereabout. See Acts 4.29] For it shall be given you in the same house, what ye shall speak.
\p
\v 20 For it is not ye that speak, but (it is) the spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.
\p
\v 21 And the (one) brother shall deliver over the (other) brother to death, and the Father the childe, and the children shall rise up against the parents, and shall put them to death. [Or, bring them to death]
\p
\v 22 And ye shall be hated of all for my names sake; but hhe that shall abide steadfast to the end, he shall be saved.
\p
\v 23 Therefore when they persecute you in this City, flee into another: for verily i say unto you, ye shall not have finishhed (your journey through) the city of Israel, but the son of man shhall be come. [that is, shall come again unto you, and meet you.]
\p
\v 24 The disciple is not above the Master, nor the servant above his Lord.
\p
\v 25 Let it (be) enough for the Disciple, thhat hhe be as his Master, and the servant as hhis Lord. If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebul [Other read Beelzebub; whhich was the chiefest Idol of the Ekronites, 2 Kings 1.2. By which name the Jews called the Prince of the Devils, because the Idols of the Heathen were Devils. see 1 Cor. 10.20.] how much more those of his household.
\p
\v 26 Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, which shall not be discovered, and hid, whichh shall not be made known.
\p
\v 27 That which i sa to win in darkeness, speak, speak it in thhe light; and that which ye hear in the ear [thhat is, that which ye in particular have heard from me; declare it publiquely or with a loud voice] preach that upon thhe roofs. [that roofs of the Jews house were flat above, with the rail round about from whence men could coveniently speak to people in the streets. See Deut 22. 8.]
\p
\v 28 And be not afraid of those that kill the body; and are not able to kill the soul: But fear him much rather; who can destroy both body and soul in Hell.
\p
\v 29 Are not two sparrow [Otherwise little birds]sold for a penny? [Gr. Assarion, which was a peice of money weighing about four grains or aces of silver, worth about a half s stiver, Polib. lib. 2.] And not one of these shall fall on the earth without your Father.
\p
\v 30 And even the hairs of your head are all numbred.
\p
\v 31 Fear not therefore, ye excel many sparrows.
\p
\v 32 Every one therefore that shall confess me before men, him i also confess [i.e. acknoledge him for my true Discipline. Like as to deny one is not to acknoledge him for his true Disciple. See Matth. 7.23.] before my Father which (is) in the Heavens.
\p
\v 33 But whosoever shall have denied me before men, him will i also deny before my Father which (is) in the Heavens.
\p
\v 34 Think not that i am come to bring peace on the earth: i am not to come to bring peace, but the sword. [That is, division and persecution: which should follow upon Preaching: whereof Christ is not properly the cause; whoch is the Prince of peace, Esa 9.5. nor his Gospel, which is a Gospel of peace, Ephes.6. verse. 15. but the obstinancy of those who reject the same, and hhate the faithful, and persecute them maliciously.]
\p
\v 35 For i am come to set a man at variance against his Father, and the daugther against her mother,and the daughter in law [or she that is new-married,or Bride] against her mother in law.
\p
\v 36 And they (shall be) a mans enemies,whhich (are) of his (own) houshold.
\p
\v 37 He that loveth father or mother above me,is not worthy of me,and he that loveth son or daughter above me,is not worthy of me.
\p
\v 38 And he that taketh not his cross (upon him) and followeth after me,is not worthy of me.
\p
\v 39 He that findeth his soul [That is,he that would preserve his life,by denying my name,he shall lose the true life,that is,salvation.] shall lose (the) same; and he that shall lose his soul for my sake,shall finde the same.
\p
\v 40 He that receiveth you,receiveth me,and he that receiveth me,receiveth him that sent me.
\p
\v 41 He that receiveth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, [that is to say,for that cause,that he is a Prophet or true Teacher of the holy Gospel] shall receive a Prophets reward : and he that receives a righteous (man) shall receive a rigghteous (mans) reward.
\p
\v 42 And whoso giveth to drink to one of these little ones [That is,who are here esteemed little : or that might be reckoned for the very least] a cup of cold (water) only,[that is to say,even the least service or good turn,because he is a true Disciple or Member of Christ] in the name of a Disciple, verily i say unto you,he shall in no wise lose his reward.

\s John the Baptist being in prison, sends two Disciples to Christ, 1 To whom Christ proves by his doctrine and works, that he is the promised Messiah, 4. Gives a glorious testimony to the people concerning Johns person and office, 7. Upbraids the Jews under a certain similitude for thheir impenitency, 16 and therefore threatenes the Cities of Chorazin, and Bethsaida, and Capernaum, which very heavy judgments, 20. Opposeth thereunto the good pleasure of his Father, in instructing the little ones, 25 Invites all wearied sinners unto him, and promiseth them refreshment, 28.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of giving commands [Nameky, which are related in the former Chapter] to his twelve Disciples, in their Cities.[ namely, of Galilee, whence his Disciples were. see Acts. 2.7.]
\p
\v 2 And John having heard in the prison [see of the cause and the end of this imprisonment of John the Baptist, Matth. 14. and Mark 6.] the works of Christ [that is, wonderful signs or miracles] sent two his Disciples.
\p
\v 3 And said unto him [That is, caused it to be said unto him] Art thou be that should come [that is, the Messiah promised by the Prophets. This John causeth to be asked, not that he doubted thereof himself; for he had long time before testified it openly, John 1 verse 29.but from the answer of Christ to take occassion afterwards more largely to instruct his Disciples hereof, who as yet somewhat doubted thereof] or do we look for another?
\p
\v 4 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Go your ways and tell John again that which ye doe heare and see.
\p
\v 5 The blind are made to see, and the cripple walk, the leper are clensed, and the deaf hear; the dead are raised up, and the poor [namely, as wel in states as in Spirit, Matth 5.3. like as it is also taken, Isa 61.1. to which Christ here alludes] is the Gospel preached.
\p
\v 6 And blessed is he that shall not be offended at me, [That is to say, that taketh no scandal by my means, condition, or doctrine, not to believe in me. See Mark 6 verse 3. John 6.41. 52,66]
\p
\v 7 Now as these went (their way) Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to behold? A reed that is moved to and fro by the wind? [That is to say, an unsteddy Teacher , which is driven with all manner of winds of doctrine, Eph. 4.14.]
\p
\v 8 But what ye out to see? A man clothed with soft raiment? [That is, costly and curious] Behold, they that wear soft (clothing) are in the Kings Houses.
\p
\v 9 But what went ye unto see? A Prophet? yea, i say unto you, and much more then a prophet?
\p
\v 10 For this is he of whom it is written: Behold i send mine Angel before thy face, [That is, Ambassadour or Messenger] which shall prepare thy way before thee. [In the Prophhet Malachi, chapter 3.1. it is before me, because Christ himself there speakes: and here Christ brings in the Father, speaking to his son; forasmuch as John was sent aswel by the Father as by the Son, Luke 3.2. John 1.6.]
\p
\v 11 Verily i say unto you, Amongst those that are born of women, there is none risen [Gr. raised up] greater [or, one greater] then John the Baptist: But he that is least in the Kingdome of Heavens, [Gr. the lesser; namely, amongst the Teacher of the Gospel: forasmuch as they do shew Christ yet more clearly, as having now perfectly accomplished whatsoevr was required to our slavation, and publish this not only to the Jews, but also to the Gentiles] is greater than he.
\p
\v 12 And from the days of John the Baptist until now, there is violence offered to the Kingdome of the Heavens, [That is, it is received of great multitudes, and with great zeal] and the violence [that is, those that with great earnistness and zeal seek afterf salvation, like those tha will draw any thing to them by force, Phil 3. verse 8.12.] take it by force.
\p
\v 13 For all the Prophesied until John. [That is, foretold and prefigured the coming of the Messia; which John pointed at now present, and being come.]
\p
\v 14 And if ye will receive it, he is Elias, which should come: [Not Elias the Thisbite in prison, John 1.21. but he tha was to come in the spirit and power of Elias, Luke 1.17]
\p
\v 15 He that hat ears to hear, let him hear. [That is to say, He that hath received the Spirit of understanding of God, let him take notice hereof with attention, 2 Cor. 3.5.]
\p
\v 16 But whereunto shall i liken this generation? [By this similitude Christ teacheth, that he had sought by all means, aswel gentle as harshh, to bring them to repentance] It is like unto little children which sit on the markets, and call their fellows.
\p
\v 17 And say,we have played on the pipe to you; and ye have not dances. We have sung mournful songs unto you, and ye have lamented. [Gr. Not smitten on the breast: that is, shewed no taken of sorrow.]
\p
\v 18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, [namely, after the common manner of other men] and they say he hath the Devil.
\p
\v 19 The son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Lo there, a man (that is) a glatton, and a wine – bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified [That is, Christ, who is called the wisdome of the Father, Prov.8. verse 12, &c. 1 Cor . 1.24. or his doctrine was acknowledged and received for good and right, of its true Disciples] of her children.
\p
\v 20 Then began he to upbraid [To reprove then to their shame, and to eaten woe unto them] the Cities in the which most of his mighty works were done, because they had not repented.
\p
\v 21 Woe to the Chorazin , woe to thee Bethsaida: For if the mighty (works) were come to pass in Tyreand Sidoa [Thse were two Cities of the Gentiles lying the Midland Sea in Phoenia, wich in former times lived in great voluptuousness, pride, and wahtonners. See Isa 23. and Ezek. ch. 26,27.] which are come to pass inyou, they would have repented long ago [namley, while they were yet in their slourishing and proserous estate, before they were taken by force and laid waste by Alexander the great] have repented, in sackcloth and ashes. [By such signs they shewed repentance in former times, see Isa 58.5. Lament 2.10. Dan 9.3. and John 3.6.]
\p
\v 22 But i say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of Judgment, then for you.
\p
\v 23 And thou Capernaum which art exalted unt Heaven, [Aswel in respect of thy prosperity, as by the inhabitanting, doctrine, and miracles of Chhrist] thou shalt be thrust down into Hell. For if those migghhty (works) had happened in thee, it would have remained this very day
\p
\v 24 But i say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for te land of Sodom in te day of Judgment, then for thee.
\p
\v 25 At thhe same time Jesus answered and said, [This seems here respect thhe relation which thhe seventy Disciples hhad made unto him, of the issue of their journey, as may be gathered out of Luke 10.17.] i thank thee, O Father, [Gr. confess, i.e. thank or praise] Lord of Hheaven and Earth; that thou hhast hid these thinggs from the wise and understanding [namely, according to the fleshh, or of this world. See 1 Cor. 1. 20.26.] and hhast revealed the same unto Babes. [thhat is, whichh are children in understanding, or who are little esteemed. see 1 Cor 1. 27. and 14.20]
\p
\v 26 Yea Father, for so it was well – pleasing before thee. [that is, thy good pleasure: of which good pleasure, see; Luke 2.14. and 12.32. Ephh. 1.5.]
\p
\v 27 All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth any man the Father but the Son; and be to whom the Son will reveal it [Namley by his Word and Spirit, 1 Cor. 2. verse 11,12.]
\p
\v 28 Come hither to me all that are wearied [or, labour unto weariness] and burdened, [Namely, with the burden of sins, or else of the Law and humane or ordinances] and i will give you rest.
\p
\v 29 Take my yoak upon you, [That is, my doctrine consisting aswel in commands as promises] and learn of me, that i am meek and lowly of heart; and you shall find rest for your souls.
\p
\v 30 For my yoak is soft, [Thhat is, easire, or well to be born] and my burden is light. [It is so called, because Christ by his merits and the power of his Spirit, amkes the same light. See Rom. 8. verse 26. and 1 John 5. verse 3,4. which is opposed to the importable yoak of the Law, Acts 15.10. and of humane ordinances, Matth. 23.4.]
\c 12
\s The Apostles plucking ears on the Sabbath are defended by Christ,1. Christ healeth a withered hand on the Sabbath, and justifieth the same, 9. Avoids the snares of the Pharises; and healeth all manner of sickness, 14 Forbids to noise this abroad, to fulfill the prophecy of Isay 16. Casteth the Devil out of one that was binde and dumb, and confusets the blasphemies of the Pharisees, 22. Speaks of the sin against the holy Ghost, and of the account which must be given of every idle word,31. Gives the Pharisees no other sign then the sign of Jonas,38. and opposeth against their stiffneckedness, the examples of the Ninivites, and the Queen of the South, 41. By the similitude of an unclean spirit tha was returned again, he teacheth how it shall go with them, 43. and who are his right brother, sister, and another, 46.
\p
\v 1 At thhat time Jesus went on a sabbath day [Gr.sabbath] through the sown (fields) and his Disciples hunred, and began to pluck ears and to eat.
\p
\v 2 And the Phharisees seeing (that) said unto him, Behold, thy Disciples do that not lawful to do on the sabbath. [The Phharisees rebuked Christ Disciples, not because they pluck ears of anotherr man corn, for that was allowed by the Law, Deut 23. ver. 25 but because they did it on the sabbath.]
\p
\v 3 But hhe said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he hungred, and they that (were) with him?
\p
\v 4 How that he went into the house of God [That is, the Tebernacle, which at that time was at Nob. see 1 Sam 21 6.] and did eat the shew – bread, [Gr. bread of setting – before. Heb of the face; namely, of the Lord. What bread this was, and what was done therewith, see Lev.24.5, etc.] whhich it was not lawfull for him to eat, nor for them that (were) with hhim; but the Priest alone.
\p
\v 5 . Or have ye read in the Law, that the Priests profane the sabbath [That is, do such works, which would profane the sabbath, if God had not commanded the same, for his service] in the Temple, on the sabbath – daies, and (yet) are blemeless. [that is, do not amis in it.]
\p
\v 6 And i say unto you, that one greater then the Temple is here. [For Christ was the Lord of the Temple, and the thing it self figured and signified by the Temple, Mal 3.1. John 2.19.]
\p
\v 7 But if ye had known what that is, i will (have) mercy, and not sacrifice, [see before, Mat 9.13.] ye would no have condemned the guiltless.
\p
\v 8 For the son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath day [Thhat is, hath power to take order about the works of the sabbath.]
\p
\v 9 And going forth from thence, hhe came into their synagogue.
\p
\v 10 And behold therewas a man which had a withered hand, and they asked him, saying, Is it also lawful to heal on the sabbath – daies? (that they might accuse him.)
\p
\v 11 And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that hath one sheep, and if the same fall into a pit on a sabbath – day, that will not lay hold on it, and list it out?
\p
\v 12 Now how much is a man above a sheep? [Gr. differs from a sheep] Therefore it is lawful to do well [that is, to execise works of charity] on the sabbath – daies.
\p
\v 13 Then said he to the man, strech out thine hand; and he stretchea it out, and it was restored whole like the other.
\p
\v 14 And the Pharisees being gone out, consulted together against him, how they might kill him. [Gr. destroy or make him away.]
\p
\v 15 But Jesus knowing (that) departed thenec, and many multitudes followed him, and he hhealed them all.
\p
\v 16 And commanded them shharply, thhat they should not make him manifest.
\p
\v 17 Thus that mighht be filled which is spoken by Esaias the Prophet , saying,
\p
\v 18 Behold , my servant, [Christ is called the servant of the Father, because he took on him the form of servant, Phil2. verse 7. and because the Father counsel concerning our redemption was accomplished by him, Isa 53.10, 11. See likewise the Annotation on Esa 42. verse 1.] whom i have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul hath delight. I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall declare judgment [that is, saving doctrine, or the true worship of God, and what belongs thereto] to Gentiles.
\p
\v 19 He shall not strive, nor cry, [Namely, out of ambition, or desire of contention] neither shall there any man hear his voice on the streets.
\p
\v 20 The howed reed [or bruised] shall be not break, and the smoaking wiek [Gr. flax, because the matches or wieks were made thereof] shall be not quench [that is to say, he shall not reject troubled spirit, or weak in faith, but shall meet them with all tenderness] till he shall bring forth [Or, bring in sight. Gr. thrust out, cast out] judgment into victory. [that is to say, shall powerfully press thorow with the truth of his doctrine, until the same gets the upper hand.]
\p
\v 21 And his name shall the Gentiles hope.
\p
\v 22 Then was brought unto him one possessed of the Devil, (who was) bilnd and dumb, [that is, from whom the Devil had taken the use of eyes and tongue] and he healed him, so that the blind both spoke and saw.
\p
\v 23 And all the multitudes were amazed, and said, is not this the Son of David?
\p
\v 24 But the Pharisees having heard (this) said, This (man) casteth not out the Devil, but by Beelzebul [see before, chap 10.25.] the Prince of the Devils.
\p
\v 25 But Jesus knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every Kingdom that is divided against it self, is made waste; and evry City or house that is divided against it self, shhall not stand.
\p
\v 26 And if thhe Satan cast out the Satan, he is divided against it self: how shall then his Kingdom stand?
\p
\v 27 And if i Beelsebul cast out the Devils, by whom then do your sons [Hereby are understood either the Disciples of Christ, who cast out Devils in his name, Luke 10.17. or some other Jews who also sometimes did thus. See Luke 9.49.] cast them out? Therefore shall thhey be your Judges.
\p
\v 28 But if i by the spirit of God cast out the Devils, then is the Kingdome of God come unto you.
\p
\v 29 Or how can any one enter into the house of a strong (man) and breave him of hhis vessels [Thhat is, household – stuff or goods. For the Hhebrew call all manner of furniture, vessels, wherewith the house is provided] except he first have bound the strong (man), and then he will spoil his house.
\p
\v 30 Whoso is not with me, he is against me, and whoso gathereth not with me, he scattereth.
\p
\v 31 Therefore i say unto you, allsin and blasphhemy shall be forgiven unto men, [Namely, if they do repent.] but the blasphhemy against the spirit, [this sin against the hholy Ghost is, when any one, not out of weakness or feare, as Peter, nor of ignorance like Paul, deries or opposeth the truth of the Gospel, but out of meer hatred and obsinacy, against the conviction of the holy Ghost, resists, blasphemes, and persecutes the same] shall not be forgiven unto men. [namely, because they do repent, nor through the righteous judgmentof God, can be brought to repentance. see Heb. 6.4.]
\p
\v 32 And whosoever shall have spoken (any) word agaisnt the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever shall have spoken against the holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neithher in this word, nor in that which is to come. [That is, never, as it is expounded, Mark 3.29. neither here nor hereafter in the last Judgement; which is also called the word to come, Luke 18.30.]
\p
\v 33 Either make [That is, hold and judge] the Tree good, and his fruit good; or make the tree evil, [Gr. corrupt] and his fruit eveil. For by the fruit, is the Tree known.
\p
\v 34 Ye brood of Adders, How can ye speak good things, whereas ye are evil; for out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh.
\p
\v 35 The good man bringeth forth good things, out of the good treasure of the heart; and the evil man bringd forth evil things, out of the evil treasure.
\p
\v 36 But i say unto you, That of every vain word [Gr. idle; that is, which hath no profit for edification, Eph 4.29. how much more then fro blasphemous words?] which men shall have spoken, they shall give accompt of the same in the day of judgment.
\p
\v 37 For out of thy words thou shalt be justified, [That is, be acknoledged and declared for just.] and out of thy words shall be condemned.
\p
\v 38 Then answered some of the Scribes and Pharusees, saying, Master, we would (fain) see a sign from thee.
\p
\v 39 But he answered and said unto them, The evil and adulterous generation [Or, degenerate, and basterd see John 8. verse 39] desireth a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of Jonas the Prophet.
\p
\v 40 For like as Jonas was three daies and three nights in the whales belly; even so shall the Son of man be three daies and three nights[ whole daies and nights are here taken a part of the daies: like as it is usual with the Hebrew. see 1 Sam.30.12. compared with verse 13 and Esth. 4.16 compared with Esth.5.1 And if it be taken after the Romans account, who began and ended the daies at midnight, so it falls yet clearer] in the heart of the earth [that is, within, in the earth; after the Hebrew phrase. So Tyre is said to lie in the heart of the sea, Ezek.27. verse.4.]
\p
\v 41 The man of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn the same, [namely, by their example] for they repented upon the preaching of Jonah.And behold, more then Jonas is here.
\p
\v 42 The Queen of the South [That is, of Saba , 1 Kings 10.1 which situated South- wards from Judea.] shall rise up in the judgement with this generation, and condemn the same: for she came from the ends of the earth [that is, from places lying far off] to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold more than Solomon is here.
\p
\v 43 And when the unclean spirit is gone out of man, he goeth through parched places, [that is, dry or waterless places seeking rest, and findes it not.
\p
\v 44 Then he saith, i will return into mine house, from whence i came out; andd coming he findes it empty, swept with becomes, and adorned, [or, trimmed up]
\p
\v 45 Then he goes he away, and takes with him seven other spirits [That is, many. An Hebrew manner of speaking] more wicked then himself;and being entred in they dwell there; and the last of that same man is worse then the first. Even so shall it be also with this wicked generation [By this similitude Christ teacheth, that when a man by the knowledge of the Gospel i freed from his natural ignorance, and notwithstanding lives not according to it, but keeps it under, lie is much worse then before. See 2 Pet chapter 2 verse 20,21]
\p
\v 46 And while he yet spake to the multitude, behold, his mother and brethren [That is, kinred by bloud; which are also called brethren with the Hebrews. see Gen. 13. verse 8.] stood without, seeking to speak with him.
\p
\v 47 And one said unto him; behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand (there) without, seeking to speak with thee.
\p
\v 48 But he answering, said unto him that told him (that) who is my mother, and who are my brethren? [Christ doth not here speak out of contempt of his mother, but only commendeds their spiritual kinred above the fleshy]
\p
\v 49 And stretching out his hand over his Disciples, he said, Behold, my mother and my brethren:
\p
\v 50 For whosoevr doth the will of my Father which is in Heavens; the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.
\c 13
\s Christ proponunds divers similitudes to his hearers; whereof the first is of a sower, whose seed falls upon divers places, 1. Declares to his Disciples the cause whereof he speaks by similitudes, 10. Interprets that similitude to his Disciples, 18. Joins thereto the similitude of the Tare amongst the Wheat,24. Of the Mustard – seed, 31. Of the Leaven, 33. Expounds the similitude of the Tares, 36. Addes thereto the similitude of the hidden treasure,44. Of the Merchant that sought pearls 45 Of the fishing net, 47 Of an householder, which brings forth out of his treasures (things) new and old, 52. Comes into his own countrey, where he is not much esteemed, 54.
\p
\v 1 And that day Jesus being gone out of the house, sate by the sea. [Namley, yhe Sea of Galilee by Capernuam]
\p
\v 2 And there gathered together unto him many multitudes, so that he went into a ship, and sate down, an all the maultitude stood on the shore.
\p
\v 3 And he spake many things unto them by similitudes, [Gr. Parables; which are suchh similitudes when any things are Historically related, as they were come to pass among men; and somewhat else that is spiritual is understood therby. But are sometimes also taken more largely for all manner of similitudes, doctrines, and excellent saying see verse 35.] saying, Behold, a sower went out to sowe.
\p
\v 4 And as he sawed, one part (of the seed) fell by the way (side) : and the sowls came, and eat up.
\p
\v 5 And another (part) fell on stony (places) where it had not much earth; and it came up straightway [that is, grew or sprung up] because it had no deepness of earth.
\p
\v 6 But when the sun was risen up, it was scorched ; and because it had no root it withered
\p
\v 7 And another (part) fell in the thorns; and the thorns grew up [Gr. ascended] and choaked the same.
\p
\v 8 And another (part) fell into good earth, and yeild fruit; the one an hundred, another sixty and another thrity (fold).
\p
\v 9 He that hath an ears to hear, let him hear. [That is, he that hath received of God the spirit of understanding; let him take notice herof with attention, 2 Cor. chapter 3.5.]
\p
\v 10 And the Disciples coming to him, sai unto him, Wherefore speaketh thou unto them by similitudes?
\p
\v 11 And he answering, said unto them, Because it is given unto you [Namely, by God, of grace, according to his good pleasure, Matth. 16. 17. Gal. 1. 15.] to know the mysteries of the Kindgome of the Heavens, but to them it is not given. [for the Gospel is hid to them that are lost, 2 Cor.4. verse.4.]
\p
\v 12 For whoso hath, [Namely, the beginning of saving faith, and by the power of the holy Ghost takes heed to it] to him shall given, and he shall have abundantly; but whoso hath not, from him shall be taken, even that which he hath, [that is, that which he think eth or seemeth to have, like as Luke expounds it, chapter 8. verse 18. see also Matth 25. verse 29]
\p
\v 13 Therefore speak i unto them by similitudes, because they seeing,see not; and hearing, hear not; nor yer understand.
\p
\v 14 And then the Prophecy of Isaiah id fulfilled: seeing that which Isaiah said before the stiff – necked Jews of his time, was yet once more fulfilled in these stiff – necked Jews] who saith, With the hearing ye shall hear, and by no means understand; and seeing ye shall see, by no menas discern. [That which is heer spoken by way of presiction, is in esay set down by way of command; the better to express the Judgement of God upon this stiffnecked people; likeas here also it might be taken. See the further exposition of all this, Isaiah 6. verse. 9, &c.]
\p
\v 15 For the heart of this people is waxed thick, [namely, with fatness, Acts 28. 27.] and with the ears they have heard heavily; and their eyes have they closed, left at any time they should see with eyes, and hear with the ears, and understand with the hearts, and he concerted, and i should hela them.
\p
\v 16 But your eyes are blessed, [or, happy] because they see, and your ears, because they hear.
\p
\v 17 For verily i say unto you, that many Prophets and righteous (men) have desired to see the things which ye se, [Namely, the Messiah come in the slesh, and executing his office. See John 8. verse 56. Acts 26.6,7.] and have not seen (them), and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard (them).
\p
\v 18 Therefore hear ye the similitude of the sower.
\p
\v 19 Whhen any man heareth that word of the Kingdome, [That is, the doctrine of the Gospel, whereby Christ sets up his Kingdome, Mat.9.35.] and doth not understand, then cometh the wicked one [that is, the Devil] and snatcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he [That is to say, is signified by him,&c.] which was sown [that is to say, received the seed] by the way – (side)
\p
\v 20 But he that is sown in stony (places), this i he which heareth the word, and presently with joy [This joy ariseth from thhe knowledge of the doctrine of the Gospel, and acceptableness of the promise of the same: although their heart still remains stony, that is, that the hardnesse thereof is not yet taken away by the Spirit of God] receiveth the same.
\p
\v 21 But hhe hath no root in himself, [That is, no right and firm confiedence on Christ, whereby we are united unto Christ, as a sure ground of our salvation, Heb.3. 14 and draw the sap of life from hhim, Rom 11.17,20] but is for a time: and wghen tribulation or persecution cometh for the words sake, he is presently offended.
\p
\v 22 And he that is sown in the thorns, this is hhe which heareth the word, and the carefulness of this world; and the seduction odf riches, choaketh the word, [that is, hinders the progress of the vertue of the word] and it becometh unfruitful. [Or, it bringeth no fruit.]
\p
\v 23 Now he that is sown in the good earth, [That is, those that receive it in a good pure heart, Luke 8.15. which a man hath not of himself, but received by the power of the Spirit of God, Act 18.14.] this is he tha heareth the word and understandeth; who also beareth fruit, [namely, true faith and sincere love, Matth.21.43.] and bringeth forth, the one an hundred, the other sixty, and the other thiry (fold)
\p
\v 24 Another similitude hhe put forth unto them, saying; The Kingdome of the Heavens is like a man, that sowed good seed in his field.
\p
\v 25 And while themen slept, his enemy came and sowed weed [Gr. Zizania: which some think to be an Arabian word, signifying principally a certain fort of weed, which are called in Dutch Brand – corn, which cannot well hhe weeded out without hurt of the wheat] in thee midst of the wheat, and went his way.
\p
\v 26 Now when it was shot up (to) herb, and brought forth fruit, then the weed manifested it self also.
\p
\v 27 And the servants of the Master of the house went and said unto him: sir hast thou not sown good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it this weed?
\p
\v 28 And said unto them: An enemy [or, hostile man] hath done that: And the servant said unto him; Wilt thou then that go our way, and gather the same?
\p
\v 29 But he said, NO; left gathering the weed, ye do happily with the same also pluck out the wheat. [Gr. root out.]
\p
\v 30 Let them both grow up together until the Harvest, [Hereby Christ would not take away the office of the Magistrate, in punishing the wicked , Rom 13 verse 13. verse 4. nor of the Church, in the exercise of Discipline, 1 Cor. 5. 7. but gives to understand that men must use prudence therein ; and that the hypocrites and wicked, cannot be wholly removed, forasmuch as sometimes they cannot well be distinguished from true believers, like as the blasted – corn can hardly be distinguished from the good corn when it first comes up] and in the time of the Harvest i will say to the reapers, first gather the weeds, and binde them in bundles, for to burn them, but bring the wheat together into my barn.
\p
\v 31 Another similitude put he forth unto him, [By thse two similitudes Christ sets forth the power of his Word; which although in the beginning it seemed small and despicable, yet afterwards should spread it self far and wide, and press through the whole world , Rom 10. 18.] saying: The Kingdome of Heaven is like the mustard – seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field.
\p
\v 32 Which indeed is the least among all seeds: but when it is grown up, then is the greatest of pot – herbs: and it becomes a Tree, so that the sowls of the Heaven come and nestle in its branchs.
\p
\v 33 Another similitude spake he unto them, (saying) ; The Kingdom of the Heavens is like a Leaven which a woman took and hid, in three measures of meal, [Gr. Sata. see thereof Gen 18.6.] until the whole was sowred.
\p
\v 34 All these things spake Jesus unto the multitudes by similitude; and without a similitude, spake he not unto them, [Namely, at that time, and in his and other Sermons.]
\p
\v 35 That it might be filfilled which is spoken by the Prophets, saying; i will open my mouth by similitudes; i will bring forth things [or, abundantly bring forth: [Gr. bubble out, cast out like as a fountain doth its water] which were hid from the foundation of the world. [that is to say, such doctrines as were alsways my steries in themselves, but notwithsatnding foretold and revealed in Gods Word: as it is likewise so taken, Psalm 78.2.]
\p
\v 36 Now when Jesus had dismissed the multitudes (from him), he went into the house. And his Disciples came unto him; Declare unto us the similitude of the weeds of the field.
\p
\v 37 And he answering, said unto them; He that soweth the good seed, is the Son of man. [Namley, as well by himself as by his Apostles, and faithful Teachers, Ephes. 4.11,12.]
\p
\v 38 And the field is the world: and the good seed are the children of the Kingdome: [That is, who are not only outward members of Christ Kingdome, like as Matth.8.12. but also true and living members] and the weed are the children of the wicked one.
\p
\v 39 And the enemy which sowed the same is the Devil: and the Harvest is the consummation of the world; and the reapers are the Angels.
\p
\v 40 In like manner therefore as the weeds are gathered, and burnt with the fire, so shall it be (also) in the consummation of this world.
\p
\v 41 The son of man shall send forth his Angels, and they shall gather out his Kingdome all the Scandals, [that is, men which have led a scandalous life] and those that do iniquity.
\p
\v 42 And shall cast the same into the fiery furnace, [Gr. furnance of fire; i.e. Hell.It seems that in this phrase there is an allusion to the horrible punishment of fire, which were in use in former times. See Dan 3.] there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\p
\v 43 Then shall righteous shine like Sun in the Kingdome of their Father. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
\p
\v 44 Again, the Kingdome of the Heavens is like a Treasure bid in the field, [By thse two similitudes Christ shews the excellent worth of the doctrine and promises of the Gospel, together with the zeal and diligence which men ought to put forth, to obtain the same, although it were even the dammage and losse of all temporal things] which man having found, hid (it), and for joy thereof, he goeth away and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that same field.
\p
\v 45 Again, the Kingdome of teh Heavens is like a Merchant – man, who seeketh goodly pearly.
\p
\v 46 Who having found one pearl of great worth, went away and sold all that he had, and bought the same.
\p
\v 47 Again, the Kingdome of Heaven is like a net cast into the Sea, and tyhat brings togethr all sorts (of fishes)
\p
\v 48 Which when it is become full, (the fishers) drawupon on the shore, and sitting down, gather out the good into (their) vessel, but the bad they cast away.
\p
\v 49 So shall it be in the consumption of the world; The Angels shall go forth [Namely, being sent forth by Christ, as verse 41] and separate the wicked out of the midst of the rightous.
\p
\v 50 And shall cast the same into the fiery furnace, [Gr. furnace of fire, as verse 42] there shall be weeping an gnashing of teeth.
\p
\v 51 And Jesus said unto them; Have ye understood all this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.
\p
\v 52 And he said unto them: Therefore every scribe instructed in the Kingdome of the Heavens, [Or, into that is an understanding and exercise man in the Scripture, a Teacher, such as Esdras was. See Ezra 7. verse 6,11.] is like a Master of a house, which brings forth out of the treasure [or, furniture] new and old things.
\p
\v 53 And it come to pass when Jesus had ended these similitudes, he departed thence.
\p
\v 54 And being come into his (own) Country, [Namely, Nazareth, where he was brought up, and his friends dwelt. See Luke 4.16.] he taught them their Synagogue, so that they were astonished; and said, whence (cometh) to this (man) this wisdome and thse mighty works?
\p
\v 55 Is not this the Son of the carpenter, [Namely, of Joseph, whom they thought (but amiss) to be his Father. See Luke 3.23. John 6.42] and is not his mother called Mary, and his brethren [that is, kinsmen: For James and Joses were sons of the sister of Christ mother: as may be seen, John 19 verse 24. compare with Matth 27. verse 56. and Mark 15 verse 40] James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
\p
\v 56 And his sisters, are they not all with us? whence (cometh) then to this (man) all this?
\p
\v 57 And they were offened at him. But Jesus said unto them, A Prophet is not disesteemed (undervalued) save in his own Country, and in his (own) house.
\p
\v 58 And he did not many (mighty) works there, by reason of their unbelief.[ Because they by reason of their unbelief, brought not the sick unto him.]
\c 14
\s Herods opinion of Christ, 1. A relation of the imprisonment, and beheading of John Baptist at the requist of Herodias daughter,3. Christ satisfies above five thousand men in the wilderness withh five loaves and two fishes,13. Comes to his Disciples who were in distress on the sea, and wlaketh upon the wear, 22. and at his command Peter also, who being afraid of the wind beginneth to sink, but is saved by Christ, 28. who stilleth the Temple, whereby he is acknowledged to be the Son of God, 32. Christ cometh again into the land of Gennesareth, and healeth many sick persons,34.
\p
\v 1 At the same time Herod [This was a son of Herod the great, and was sirnamed Antipas] the Tetrarch [Gr. Tetrarches; that is, a Governour over the fourth part of Kingdome, For after the death of Herod the great, his Kingdome, was by the Emperour Augustus divided amongst his sons; whereof well near the half, namely Judea, Samaria, and Idumea, Archelaus the eldest son had: one fourth part, namely, Galilee, and the land beyond Jordan, this Herod; and the last past, namely, Iturea, and Trachonitis, Philip the youngest son had See Matth 2.22 Luke 3 verse 1.19. and in Josephh. Antiq. lib 17. cap 15. Thse Tetrarchs are also called Kings, because they ruled as Kings: See here verse.9. Mark 6.14. Acts 25. verse 24.] heard the same of Jesus.
\p
\v 2 And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist: he raised up from the dead, and therefore those mighty (deeds) do work in him.
\p
\v 3 For Herod apprehended John, [This Hisotory is hhere occassionally related, although it came to pass before. Se Matth 4.12.] and bound him, and put himin prision, for Hherodias sake, [This Hherodias was the wife of Philip the brother of Herod, by whom she being seduced, forsook her husband, and his life time was taken to wise by Herod. See Joseph. Antiq.lib.18. cap. 7,9.] the wife of his brother Philip.
\p
\v 4 For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thhee to have her. [namely, to wife]
\p
\v 5 And intending to kill him, he feared the people, because they held him for a Prophet.
\p
\v 6 But when the day of Herods birth was kept, [of such keeping the birth – day we have one example more, Ggen 40. verse 20.] the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst (of them) and she pleased Herod.
\p
\v 7 Wherefore h epromised her with an oat, to give even what she should ask.
\p
\v 8 And being before instructed of her Mother, [or, being stirred up, or, set on, afetr that she asked her mother advice about it, Mark 6.24.] said; Give me here in dish the head of John the Baptist.
\p
\v 9 And the King was sorrowful, [Not so much for Johns sake, as for the displeasure of the people which he feared] but for the oath [namely, which he had unlawfully made to this immodest dancer, verse 7.] and those that sate down (with him) he commanded that it should be given (her)
\p
\v 10 And he sent [Namely, a Serjeant, or Executioner, as may be seen, Mark 6.27.] and behealed John in the prison.
\p
\v 11 And his head was brought in a dish, and given to the damosel, and shhe carried it to her mother.
\p
\v 12 And his disciples come and took away the body, and buried the smae: and went and told it to Jesus.
\p
\v 13 And (when) Jesus heard (this)he departed from thence by ship [Not only to avoid the dnager, seeing his houre was not yet come; but also because his disciples had need of rest, Mark 6. verse 30,31.] towards a depart place alone: [or out of the way on the one side] and the multitudes hearing (that), followed him on foot out of the Cities.] For Christ was not passed unto the other side of the Sea, but over a bay, abiding on the same side, where they could follow him on foot.]
\p
\v 14 And Jesus going forth saw a great multitude, [That is to say, that there was much people] and was inwardly moved with compassion towards them, and healed their sick.
\p
\v 15 And when it was now Evining, his disciples came to him, saying; This place is desert, and the time [Gr. the houre, namely, to take meat or food, or the time of the day; not to hold the people any longer] is now past, let go the multitude from thee, thhey may go away in the Villages, and buy themselves meat.
\p
\v 16 But Jesus said unto them; they have no need to go hence: give you them to eat.
\p
\v 17 But they said unto him; We have nothing here but five leavesn and two fibres.
\p
\v 18 And he said; bring me the same the same hither.
\p
\v 19 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five leaves, and the two fshes, and looking upwards yowards Heaven blessed the same [The Greek word indeed sometimes signifies, to give thanks, but must here be taken for bless, which is joined with thanksgiving, as is to be seen, Luke 9.16. which blessing was done a special prayer, that these loaves might suffice for the satisfying of all, 1 Tim 4.4,5] and when he had broken them, he gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.
\p
\v 20 And thhey did all eat and were satisfied, and they took up [Namely, the disciples of Christ, as appears out of John 6 verse 12.] the remainder of the fragments, twelve full baskets.
\p
\v 21 Now they which had eaten, were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
\p
\v 22 And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples [Namley, with earnest words, because they were loth to part from him] to go into the ship; and to put off before him the other side, while he should dismisse the multitudes from him.
\p
\v 23 And now when he had dismissed the multitudes from him, he ascended into the mountain alone [See the 13. verse before – going] for to pray. And when it was now become Evening, hhe was there alone.
\p
\v 24 And the ship was now in the midst of the Sea, being in distrers by the waves, [Gr. tormented; i.e very much tossed or beaten by the waves] for the wind was against (them).
\p
\v 25 But at the fourth watch of the night [The night was then divided into four watches, each of three hours whereof thhe forth ened with the day. Therefore the same was also called the morning – watch, Exod 14. verse 24. 1 Sam 11.11. See Luke 12. 38.] Jesus came unto them, walking on the sea.
\p
\v 26 And the disciples seeing him walk on the Sea, were troubled, saying; It is an apparition, [Thhat is to say, a spirit appearing in bodily shape] and they shrieked out for fear.
\p
\v 27 But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying; Be of good chear; It is i , [Namley, in truth , and it is no apparition, or ghost] fear not.
\p
\v 28 And Peter answered him, and said ; Lord, if it be thou, command me to come to thee on thee on the water.
\p
\v 29 And he said, come : And Peter descended from the ship, and walked on the water, to come to Jesus.
\p
\v 30 But seeing the strong wind, he was afraid, and he begunto sink down, he cryed, saying; Lord, save me.
\p
\v 31 And Jesus presently, streching out the hand laid hold on him, and said unto him; O thou of little faith wherefore didst thou waver, [or, doubt]
\p
\v 32 And when they were got into the ship, the wind becaome still.
\p
\v 33 Now they that (were) in the ship, came and worshipped him, saying; Truly, thou art the Sonne of God.
\p
\v 34 And being gone over, they came into the land Gennesareth.
\p
\v 35 And whhen the men of that place knew him, they sent into that whole country lying round about, and brought unto him all that were indisposed.
\p
\v 36 And prayed him that they might touchh only the hem of his garment, [For a sign that they would be holpen by him,; not that they ascribed such vertue to the hem. See the like, Matth 9.20,21.] and as many as touchhed (him), [or, it; namely, the hem] became whole.
\c 15
\s The disciple of Christ being accused by the Scribes and Pharisees, because they eat with unwashen hhands, are defendedby Christ, who reproves their hypocrisie, and rejects humane institutions,1. Teacheth that their offencce taken is not to be regarded, and what it is that truly defiles the man,10. Casteth the Devil out of the daughter of a Canaanitish woman, 22 and healeth all kind of deseased persons, 30. Satisfies four thousand men seven loaves and few little fishes,32.
\p
\v 1 Then came to Jesus (certain) Scribes and Pharisees, which (were) of Jerusalem, saying;
\p
\v 2 Wherefore do thy disciples transgress the institution [Gr. tradition, or deleivering over] of thhe Ancients? [or Eldersw, namely, of the Pharisaical Doctors, Matth 5.21.] for they wish not their hands when they are to eat bread.
\p
\v 3 But he answering, said unto them; Wherefore do ye also transgress the Commandment of God, by your instituion? [That is to say, which ye have taken up and follow]
\p
\v 4 For God commanded, saying; Honour thy Father and thy Mother; [Honour signifies not only outward reverence, but alo all manner of help and assistance 1 Tim 5 verse 3,17.] and he that curseth Father or Mother, he shall die the death. [that is, shall without favour be punished with death, Exodus 21. ver. 17. Lev 20.9.]
\p
\v 5 But ye say, Whosoevr shall say to Father or Mother (it is) a gift, [Or, be it a gift; that is, an offering, Mat 5.24. Hr]br. Corbon; see Matth 7.11. Or whatsoever gift is offering, Mat 5.24. Her Corban; see Matth 7.11. Or whatsoever gift is offered by me, shall be profiatble unto thee, he satifies. Or he is discharged from giving any father maintanance to hhis parents. See hereof also in thhe Annotations on Mark 7.11. The sense is that they taught, that under pretext of offering, men might withhold from thheir parents the hhelp due unto them] whatsoever from me mighht he profitable to thee, and shhall in no wise honour his Father and his Mother, (he satisfieth).
\p
\v 6 And (so) ye have made Gods command of no force by your institution.
\p
\v 7 Ye hypocrites, Well hath Esaias propheeyed of you, saying [That us to say, that well agrees to you which Esaias also said heretofore to the Jewes of his time.]
\p
\v 8 This people draws near to me with their mouth, and honour me with lips, but their heart keep it (self) far from me.
\p
\v 9 But in vain do they honour me, teaching doctrines (which are) commandments of men. [Namley, to observe them as part of God worship, Deuter.4.2. and 12.32.]
\p
\v 10 And when he had called the multitude unto him, he said unto the, Hear and understand.
\p
\v 11 That which goes into mouth, defileth not the man, [Gr. makes not common, thhat is, unhalloweth seeActs 10. verse 14 Christ speaks here according to the opinion of the Pjarisees, of that defilement, which should arise from the taking of meat with unwashen hands] but that which goeth out of the mouth [namely, proceeding from empure hearts, as Christ afterwards declares, verse 18,19] thst defileth the man.
\p
\v 12 Thhen came his disciples unto him, and said unto him, Knowest (well) that the Pharisees hearing this speech, were offended.
\p
\v 13 But he answering, said, or Every plant [Or, planting; that is, every doctrine, or worship of God] which my Heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted out [Gr. plucked out by the root.]
\p
\v 14 Let them go, they are blind leaders of th blind. Now if the blind lead the blind, they shall both fall into the ditch.
\p
\v 15 And Peter answering, said unto him, Declare unto us his similitude [The word similitude is sometimes (as it is here) taken for all manner of doctrine, which is sometime (asnit here) taken for all manner of doctrine, whcih is somewhat obscurely propounded.]
\p
\v 16 But Jesus said, Are ye also ignorant or yet? [Or, not understanding, without understanding.]
\p
\v 17 Do ye not yet understand, that all that goeth into the mouth, cometh, cometh into the belly, and is cast out into the privy?
\p
\v 18 But those things which go out of the mouth, come forth of the heart, and they desire the man.
\p
\v 19 For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, [or, communication] murders, adulteries, whoredomes, thefts false witnessings, blasphemies.
\p
\v 20 These things are they which desire the man; but eating with unwashen hands, desireth not the man. [Christ doth not here reprove the civil custome in washing the hands before meat, but the superstition of the Pharisees, which placed holiness and religion therein]
\p
\v 21 And Jesus going from thence, departed towards the parts of Tyre and Sidon.
\p
\v 22 And behold a Cannaanitish woman [See concerning hher the Annotation on Mark 7.26. where she is called a Grecian woman of Syrophenicia; here she is called a Canaanittsh woman, because the inhabitants of Tyre Sidon, from whom the City Sidon hsd its Origanal and name, was the first – born son of Cham, Gen 10.15] coming out of those coast, cryed to him, saying; O Lord, (thuo) son of David, have mercy on me, my daughter is pittifully possessed of the Devil.
\p
\v 23 But he answered her not ward. And his disciples coming to him, prayed him, saying, dismisshher from thee, for she cryeth after us. [Gr. behind us]
\p
\v 24 But he answering, said; i am not sent, but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. [Namely, for thid time: for tha the time of the calling of the Gentiles was not yet come.]
\p
\v 25 And she came and worshipprd him, saying; Lord, help me.
\p
\v 26 But hhe answered, and said; It is not sent seemly [Gr. stood honourable, or good] to take the children bread, and to cast it (before) the little dogs. [The Heathen are compared to dogs, because as then they were yet strangers to Gods Covenant.]
\p
\v 27 And she said; Yea Lord, yet [Gr. for] the whelps eat also of their Master Table.
\p
\v 28 Then answered Jesus, and said unto hher, O woman, great is thy faith: Be it done unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made from that same hour.
\p
\v 29 And Jesus departing from thence, came by the sea of Galilee, and went up on the mountain, and sate down there.
\p
\v 30 And many multitude came, having with them cripples, blind, dumb, lame, [That is, mained, or weakned in their limbs] and many other, and cast thembefore the feet of Jesus, and he healed them.
\p
\v 31 So that the multitude wondred, seeing the dumb speaking, the cripples walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.
\p
\v 32 And Jesus having called his disciples unto him, said; i am inwardly moved with compassion towards the multitude; because they have now continues with me three days, and have nothing for to eat: and i will not let them go from me fasting, left they saint on the way.
\p
\v 33 And his disciples said unto him; From whence (shall) we (get) so many loaves in the wilderness to satisfie so great a multitude?
\p
\v 34 And Jesus said unto them, How many loaves have ye? They said seven, and a few little fishes.
\p
\v 35 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
\p
\v 36 And he took the seven loaves, and the fished, and when he had given thanks, [Namley, for this blessing, which he accounted as already obtaned. For he knew that he had received power from the Father to do it , and that the Fathher heard him always. See John 11.41,42.] he brake them, and gave them to his Disciples, and his Disciples (gave them) to the multitude.
\p
\v 37 And they did all eat, and were satisfied,and they took up the remainder of the broken peices seven baskets full.
\p
\v 38 And they that had eaten were four thousand men, besides women and children.
\p
\v 39 And having dismissed the multitude from him, he went into the ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala. [Mark chapter 8 verse 10. faith of Dalmanutha; which seems to be the name of the land in which Magdala lay.]
\c 16
\s The Pharisees and Sadduces ask a sign, but are rebuked by Christ, and appointed to the sign of Jonas, 1. Christ warneth Disciples of their leaven,5. Divers opinions of the common people concerning Christ, 13. Peters confession of him; whom Christ commendeth,and promiseth him the keys of the Kingdome of Heaven,15.Foretelleth hid death and resurretion; and rejecteth the evil counsel of Peter,21. How men must follow Christ and preserve their souls, 24. Of Christ coming in his glory,27.
\p
\v 1 And the Pharisees and Sadduces being come unto him, and tempting (him), [intending to prove whether he could do this, for to shame him] desired of him, that he would shew them a sign out of the Heaven. [i.e. which should happen out of in or from Heaven, like as at the command of Joshua the Sun and Moon sttod still, Josh 10.12. as fire came out of a Heaven at, an the prayer of Elias, 2 Kings 1.9. and as the Sun went back in the time of Esaias, see Esa 38.8.]
\p
\v 2 But he answered and said unto them; when it is become Evening, ye say, fair weather, for the Heavens is red [Gr. red as fire; that is fair or clear red]
\p
\v 3 And in the Morning; soul weather to day, for the Heavens is of a sad red. Ye hypocrites, ye know well to discern the face of the Heaven, [that is, the state or shew] and can ye not (descern) the signs of the times. [namely, which accroding to the predictions of the Prophets, do shew the coming and presence of the Messiah. see Matth 11. 4,5.and the Annotations on Luke 12.56.]
\p
\v 4 The evil and adulterous generation seeketh for a sign, [see the same before, Matth 12.39] and thre shall no sign he given to (it) [namely, more powerfully to convince them] bu the sign of the Prophet Jonas. And leaving them, he went away, [namely, over the Sea. See Mark 8 verse 13,14
\p
\v 5 And when his Disciples were come or the other side, they had forgotten to the bread (with them).
\p
\v 6 And Jesus said unto them; look to it, and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the Sadduces
\p
\v 7 And they reaoned with themselves,] saying; (it is) because we have taken no bread (with us)
\p
\v 8 And Jesus knowing (that), said unto them; what reason ye with your selves, O ye of little faith , that ye have taken no bread (with you?)
\p
\v 9 Do ye not yet understand? Neither do ye remember the five loaves of the five thousand (men); and how many baskets ye took ip?
\p
\v 10 Nor the seven loaves of the five thousand (men), and how maunds ye took up?
\p
\v 11 How do ye not understand, that i spoke not to you concerning bread, (when i said) that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and Sadduces?
\p
\v 12 Then they understood, that be had not said, then they should beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees, and Sadduces? [Namely, their false doctrine, which is here compared unto leaven, forasmuch as the same mingled the purity of the true doctrine, with false doctrines, and such as were devised by men, and pussed men up with a vain presumption of their own righteousness, and with hypocrise.]
\p
\v 13 Now when Jesus was come into the parts of Caseria Philippi, [This was a City at the foots of the mount Libasnus, about the rise of Jordan, so called, because it was built for the honour of the Emperour Tiberius: and was sirnamed Philippi, because it was builded by Philip the Tetrach; Joseph lib.18. cap. 3. and to distinguish it from another Ceoserea, built by his father Hherod for the hhonour of the Emperour Augustus, on thhe mid – land Sea: Joseph lib. 15. cap.13. Acts 10.1.] hhe asked his Disciples, saying; Who do men say, that i the Son of man am?
\p
\v 14 And thhey said, some John the Baptist, and others Elias, and othhers Jeremias, or one of the Prophets.
\p
\v 15 He said unto them, but ye, whom say ye that i am?
\p
\v 16 And Simon Peter answering, said [Namely, in the name of them all; seeing Chhrist had asked all of them. Therefore also the answer of Christ, although it be made to Peter, belongeth to all] Thou art the Christ, [that is, Messias, or annoited. See John 1.41] the Son of the leaving God.
\p
\v 17 And Jesus answering, said unto him, Blessed art thou Simon – Bar – Jona [Thhat is of Jona: Fir the word Bar in thhe Chaldean tongue signifies a Son] for fleshh and bloud [that is, niether thine own, nor any natural understanding, nor any man. See Gal.1.16]
\p hath not revealed (that) unto thee, but my Father which is in the Heavens.
\p
\v 18 And i say unto thee also, that thiu art Peter, and on this Petra will build my Chirshh, [That is, stone or rock, namely, on this thy confession which thou market of me, or on me, whom thou hast confessed. For Christ alone is the foundation of thus Church, 1 Cor. 3. 11 howsoever Peter also, and the other Apostles likewise; in respect of their doctrine, amy be called foundations of the Church, as is to be seen, Rev 21. 19.] and the gates of hell [that is neither the subtilty, nor the force of the devil and his instruments. For in former times the Senate – houses, and fortresses of Cities, were in the gates, Gen 22.17.] shall not prevail over them.
\p
\v 19 And i willl give unto thee the keys of the kingdome of the Heavens. [that is, a spiritual power on Gods behalf, and penitent persons the forgiveness of their sins, and they holy Sacraments to seal up the same unto them.And on the contrary, to declare to unbelievrs and impenitent persons, that they have no part in the forgiveness of the sins, and the Kingdome of God, and consequently to keep them off from the use of the same Sacraments, and to exclude them out of the communion of the faithful. Which power is also given to the Church, Mat.18.18. and to all the Apostles, John 20. verse.23. See 2 Cor. 10.8.] and whatsoever thou shalt binde on the earth, [namely, according to Christ command and pescript] shall be bound in the Heavens. [that is, God shall hhold for firm and valid that which shall so be done by hios Ministries according to his command] and whatsoever thou shalt unbinde on the earth, shall be unbound in the Heavens
\p
\v 20 Then forhad he his Disciples, to tell any man, that he was Jesus the Christ.
\p
\v 21 From thence forth Jesus began to shew to his Disciples thhat hhe must go to Jerusalem, [Namely, because thus it was decreed by God, Acts 2.23. foretold by the Prophets, Luke 24. verse 26,27. and was neccessary for the expiation of sin, Heb 9.23.] and suffer many things of the Elders [that is, the eldest of the people] and chief Priests, and scribe, and killed, and the third be raised again.
\p
\v 22 And Peter taken him to him, began to rebuke him, saying; Lord (be) merciful self: [or, God be merciful to thee, Lord; that is, God preserve thee from this. That be far from the] this shall by no menas happen to thee.
\p
\v 23 But he turning him about, said unto Petr; Get away behind me, satan, [that is, adversary, which name indeed is principally ascribe to the Devil. See Mat. 4. verse 10. but here given to Peter also, because he out of perverse love sought to hinder Christ in the execution of his office. See 2 Sam 10. verse 22.] thou art an offence unto me: [Gr. mine offence] for thou mindest not the things whish are of God, but those that are of men.
\p
\v 24 Then sai Jesus unto hhis Disciples, if any man will come after me, [That is, will follow me as a disciple] let him deny himself; [to deny himself, is to renounce a mans own understanding, will, and inclinations, and to subject the same to the Word and will of God] and take up his cross, and follow me.
\p
\v 25 For whose will save his life, [Gr. soul. see Matth 10 verse 39.] he shall finde the same; but whoso shhall lose his life for my sake, he shall finde the same.
\p
\v 26 For what doth it profit a man, if hhe gain the whole world, and suffer the loss of his soul? Or, what shall a man give for thhe releasing of his soul? [Gr. exchanging, counter – releasing, trucking; i.e. that against which, or for which one may be released.
\p
\v 27 For the Son of man shall come, in the glory of his Father, with his Angels; and then shall he recompence every one according to his doing. [i.e. according as he shall have done good or evil. See the exposition hereof, Matth 25.36.
\p
\v 28 Verily i say unto you, There are some of those which stand here, [That is, which are hhere present] who shhall not taste of death, until they have seen the Son of man come in his Kingdome. [This may be understood either of his resurrection and ascension into Heaven, or of the sending of the Holy Ghost, and spreading abroad of the Gospel among the Gentiles, or else of his glorification upon the Mount , whereof is spoken in the beginning of the following Chapter.]
\c 17
\s Christ in the presence of Moses and Elias is glorified upon the Mount before his disciples,1. And from Heaven declared to be the Son of God,2. Teacheth that John is that Elias which was to come,10 Healeth a Lunatick possessed person, which the Disciples were not able to care,14 Declares the power of faithh,and of prayer, 20. Foretells hhis death and resurrection,22. Pays Tribute for himself and for Peter, 24.
\p
\v 1 And after six days [Namely, after that Christ had spoken with his disciples of the coming of his glory, Luke chapter 9. verse 28. faith, about eight days, reckoning amongst them the first and and last days that these things came to pass, which Matthew here, and Mark, chap.9.2. skip over] Jesus took with him Peter, and James, and John his brother,and brought them upon an high mountain. [What mountain this was, is not exprest. Many of the ancient Teachhers think thhat it was mount Tabor, because that is situate thhereabout, and is very high] alone [or, aside]
\p
\v 2 And he was transfigured (changed in shape) before them: and his face did shine like the Sun, and his garments become white, like the light.
\p
\v 3 And behold, there was seen of them Moses and Elias [Whether Moses appeared with his own body, or that he assumed another for a time, like as sometimes the Angels have done, is certain. But this certain, that they both appeared there in their own persons] communing with him. [namely, of his issue, or successe which hhe should have at Jerusalem, Luke 9 verse 31]
\p
\v 4 And Peter answering, said unto Jesus; Lord, it is good for us to be here, if thou wilt [That is, if it please thee] let us here make three Terbanacles [or, booths, which likewise were made of boughs, or such like, against the heat of the Sun and the rain] one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
\p
\v 5 While he yet spake, behold. a bright cloud overshadowed them. [Namely, Moses and Elias, as appears, Luke 9 verse 34] And behold, a voice out of the cloud saying; This is my beloved Son, in whom i am well pleased, bear him.
\p
\v 6 And the Disciples hearing (this), fell on their faces, and were sore afraid.
\p
\v 7 And Jesus coming to them, touched them, and said, Arise, and fear not.
\p
\v 8 And lifting up their eyes, they saw no man but Jesus only.
\p
\v 9 And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus commanded thhem, saying; Tell no man this vison [Thhat is, that which they had seen, Mark 9.9. and 2 Pet.1. verse 16.] until the Son of man shall be risen from the dead.
\p
\v 10 And his disciples asked him, saying; Why then do the Scribes say, that Elias must first come?
\p
\v 11 But Jesus anwering, said unto them: Elias indeed shall firts come, [that is, must forts come indeed, according to the prediction of the Prophet Malachi, chap.4. verse 5] and restore all things. [that is, declare tru doctrine concerning the Messiah, which was falsefied and obscured by the Pharisees, and prepare theway for Christ]
\p
\v 12 But i say unto you , that Elias is now come; and they have not known him: [Nmely, for him thhat he was, or for the promised Elias which should restore all things] but they have done to him, all that they would. [that is, prosecuted and killed him] so shall also the Son of man suffer of them.
\p
\v 13 The thhe disciples understood, that he had spoken to them of John the Baptist.
\p
\v 14 When they were come to the multitude, there came to him a man, falling on his knees before him, and saying;
\p
\v 15 Lord, have mercy on my Son, for he is lunatick, [Lunacy is a deases, that increaseth according to the course of the Moon, like as the falling sickness, raging, and such like sickness; with which the devil was wont sometimes to intermix, as here] and is in grievous pain for many times he fallethh unto thhe fire, and many times into the water.
\p
\v 16 And i brought him to thy disciples, and they have not be able to cure him.
\p
\v 17 And Jesus unswering, said; O fatherless and perverse generation, how long shall i yet be with yo? How long shall i yet bear with you? bring him hither to me.
\p
\v 18 And Jesu rebuked him [Namely the devil, Luke 9 verse 41] and the devil went out of him, and the child was cured from that very hour.
\p
\v 19 Then come the Disciples to Jesus alone, [that is, in private, or apart] and said, Wherefore could not we cast him out?
\p
\v 20 And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief; verily i say unto you, if ye had a faith(but as a mustard – seed, [Here is principally understood faith to work miracles, which was a special gift, relying upon special promises, and command of God, of which the disciples here doubted. see 1 Cor. 13.2.] ye should say unto this mountain, Depart hence thither – wards, and it shall depart: and nothing shall be impossible unto you.
\p
\v 21 But this kind [Namely, of devils] goeth not out, but by prayer and fsating. [That is, by a firm faith, strengthned by servant prayer, whereunto men are prepared by fasting]
\p
\v 22 And while they conversed in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shhall be delivered over unto the hand of men.
\p
\v 23 And they shall kill him, and the third day shhll be raised up. And they were very sorry.
\p
\v 24 And whhen they were come into Capernaum, there came unto Peter [Dwelling there, as Christ also did. see Matth 4. verse 13 and chapter 8.14 For, this tribute every one was to pay there where they dwelt] thhey thhat received the Didrachmes, [this was a certain custome or tribute – money, weighing two drams, or a quarter of an ounce of silver, such as every one by the head or poll, was to pay for the service of the Terbanacle, Exod.30.13 and the like also the maintance of the Temple , and the service (thereof), 2 Chron 24.9. Nehem.10 verse 32. which tribute the Romans afterwards took to themselves. See Joseph. de . beilo., Jud . lib. 7. cap. 26.] and said., your Master, doth not he pay the Didrachmes?
\p
\v 25 He said; yes: And whhen hhe was come into the house; Jesus prevented him, saying; What thinketh thou Simon? The Kings of the Earth, [Namley, those that are Soveraign, or are subject to none] of whom doe they take toll or Tribute? or of their sons, or of strangers? [that is, which do not belong to the royal family. Or which are not their Progeny, like Chhrist was of devil, Luke 1.32,33.]
\p
\v 26 Peter said unto him, of strangers; Jesus said unto him, Then are the sons free
\p
\v 27 But that we may give them no offence; go thy way to the Sea, cast (out) the angle, and the first fish that cometh up, take and having open his mouth, thou shall finde a stater: [This was a piece of mony weighing two didrachmes, or half an ounce of silver, being worth about two shillings and three pence, in value as much as a shekel of the Sanctuary] take that, and give it to them for me and thee.
\c 18
\s Christ teacheth by example of a little child, who is the greatest in the Kingdome of Heaven,1. Of what punishment they are worthy who give offence, 6. How narrow men must beware that they give none offence to the little ones, whom the Angels themselves do take care of, 8 and Christ it to come to save them; as he declare by the simitude of lost sheep, 11 How we must deal with a brother that hhath sinned against us, and what the office and power of the church is herein, 15. How powerful the common prayer of the faithful is, 19. That we must be always ready to forgive; which is declared by the similitude of King, take account of his servant, 21.
\p
\v 1 At that same hour, [That is, time] came the Disciples to Jesus, saying; Who (we pray) is greatest [That is, who shall be greatest] in the Kingdom of the Heavens
\p
\v 2 And Jesus having called a little child unto him, did set the same in the midst of them.
\p
\v 3 And said, verily, i say unto you, if ye be not changed [Gr. turned away; namely from this pride and ambition] and become like little children, [namely like Devid testifies of himself, Psal.131] ye shall in no wise enter the Kingdom of the Heavens.
\p
\v 4 Therfore whoso evr shall humble himself as his little child, the same he is the greatest in the Kingdom of the Heavens.
\p
\v 5 And whoso receiveth such a little child [Namely, not only in age, but also those who like children , are lowly of mind; as that which follows sufficiently declares, verse 6] in my name, he receiveth me,
\p
\v 6 But whhoso offendeth [That is, doth, speaketh, or teacheth anything, whereby he draws another to sin or apostacy] one of these little ones which believe in me; it were more profitable for him, that a mill – stone [Gr, an Asses – mill – stone; as if we should say, hhorse – mill – stone] were hanged at his neck, and he were drowned in the depth of the Sea.
\p
\v 7 Wo to the world from the offences ; for it is necessity that offences should come; [Namely, in regard of the melice of the devil, the corruption of men, and Gods righteous permission and judgment. See 1 Cor. 11.19. 2 Thess. 2. verse 11,12.] but wo to that man, by whom the offence cometh.
\p
\v 8 If therefore thy hand or thy foot offend thee, [see hereof the Annotation of Matth.5. verse 29.] cut it off and cast if from thee. It is better for thee to enter into life (being) a cripple, or maimed, then having two hands or two feet, to be cast into the everlasting fire.
\p
\v 9 And if thine eye offended thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: It is better for thee having but one eye, to enter into life, then having two eyes, to be cast into hhell- fire.
\p
\v 10 Lookto it, that ye despise not one of these little ones: For i say unto you, that their Anggels, [That is, which are sent for thheir defence and service, Heb.1. 14] in the Heavens. [that is, hhave alsways access to the Thhrone of God, to receive commands for their protection, and for the punishment of those that should despise or oppress them, A similitude taken fron the Kings of the East, who gave their chiefs Ministers, by whom thhey governed their Kingdom, free access to see their face; as may be seen, Esth.1.14. see Luke 1.verse 19 Rev.8.2.]
\p
\v 11 For the Son of man is come to svae that was lost.
\p
\v 12 What think ye; if any man should an hundred sheep, and one of them were strayed; will be not leave the ninety and nine, and ggoing into the mountains, seek that which is strayed? [By this similitude Chhrist teacheth, that if any of thhe faithful should happen to be seduced, He, their Shepherd, would not cease till he hhad reduced thhe same.]
\p
\v 13 And if hhappen that he find the same, then for the ninety and nine, which were not strayed.
\p
\v 14 Even so, it is not the will of your Fathher [Gr. before your Father] which is in the Heavens, that one of these little ones should perish. [namely, which believe in me, as is exprest,verse 6.]
\p
\v 15 But if thy brother hhath sinned against thee, [That is, give thhee any offence, whetehre he wrong thy self, or trespass otherwise against God or his neighbour, it being known to thy self, and not in plublik: for publique sins, ought to be publiquely reproved , 1 Tim 5.20.] go thy way and reprove him, [that is, admonish and convince him of his trespass] between thee and him alone: if he hear thee, thou hhast gained thhy brother.
\p
\v 16 But if he do not hear (thee) then take one or two more with thee, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses, every word may stand. [That is, every matter or truth may be held Deut 19.15.]
\p
\v 17 And if he give no ear to them, Tell it to the Church: [That is, the Ruler of the Church, who do as it were represent the whole Congregation. See 1 Cor.12. verse 28. and 2 Cor. 2 verse 6] and if he likewise give no ear to the Church, let hhim be to thee as the Heathen and Publican. [that is, as one thhat is a stranger from thhe Church of Christ, Acts 10. verse 28.]
\p
\v 18 Verily i say unto you; Whatsoever you bind on the Earth, [see hereof, chapter 16. verse. 19.] shall be bound in Heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on the earth, shall be loosed in Heaven; and whatsoevr ye shall loose on the earth, shall be loosed in Heaven.
\p
\v 19 Again, i say unto you; if two of you do consent on the earth, corncening any thing, which they might ask, [namely, in faith, according to Gods will, Jam.1 verse 6. and 1 John 5.14] that it shall come to pass to them of my Father which is in the Heavens, [or, be done]
\p
\v 20 Fow whence two or three are gathered together in my name, there am i the midst of them. [Namely, by my spirit and grace, John 14 verse 16,23.]
\p
\v 21 Then came Peter to him, and said; Lord, how many times shall my brother sin against me, and i forgive him, till seven times?
\p
\v 22 Jesus sai unto him, i say not unto thee till seven – times, but until seventy times seven (times) [that is, so many times as he offends thee, a certain number being taken for a great and uncertain number, like as Gen.4.24.]
\p
\v 23 Therefore is the Kingdom of the Heavens likened to a certain King, which would reckon with his servants. [Gr. take up reckoning]
\p
\v 24 Now when he began to reckon, thhere was brought unto him, one that was indebted to him [Gr. a debtor of ten thousand talents] ten thousand talents. [A common talent is valued at fix hundred Crowns of gold]
\p
\v 25 And when he had nothing to pay, His Lord commanded that hhe should be sold, [This was usual in the Old Testament, that thhe children with their parents for their debt might be sold for slaves, see Exo.22. verse 3. and 2 Kings 4, verse 1] and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and that (the dedt) should be paid.
\p
\v 26 The servants therefore falling down, worshhipped hhim, saying: Lord, forbear me, and i will par thee all.
\p
\v 27 And the Lord of this servants, being inwardly moved with compassion, released him the debt.
\p
\v 28 But the same servant going out, found one of his fellow – servants, which owed an hundred pence, [Gr. Denarti. A Denarius was a piece of silver – money, weighing about a drachme or hhalf quarter of an ounce of silver, being worth about a single Ryal, or fix Stivers] an lying hold on hhim, took (him) by the throat, [Gr. chhoaked; that is, took him by the throat, so that he will – nigh choaked him] saying, pay me that thou owest.
\p
\v 29 His fellow – servant therefore falling down at his feet, prayed him, saying; Forbear me, and i will pay the all.
\p
\v 30 Ye he would not: but went away, and cast him into prison, until he should have paid the debt.
\p
\v 31 Now when his fellow – servants saw what was done, they were very much grieved, and coming, they declared unto their Lord all that was done.
\p
\v 32 Then his Lord called him unto hhim, and said unto him; Thou wicked servant, i remitted thee all that debt, seeing thou didst intreat me.
\p
\v 33 Oughest not thou also, to hhave compassion on thy fellow – servant, like as i also had compassion on thee?
\p
\v 34 And hhis Lord being wroth, belivered him over to the tormentor, [The scope of Christ here, is not to teach, that God having once forgiven sins, should yet afterwards punish the same. For that God doth not, Heb.8. 12. but he declares his scope himself, verse 35. and it is acknowledged that parables or similitudes ought not to be stretched further, then the principal scope of the same can bear] until he should have paid all thhat he was indebted to him. [that is, for ever; for the sinner can never satisfie for his sinnes, Matth 16 verse 26. and 25. 46.]
\p
\v 35 So likewise shall my Heavenly Father do to you, if ye do not from the hheart [Gr. from your hearts] forgive every one his trespasses.
\c 19
\s Christ healeth many persons,1. Answers the question concerning the Bill of Divorce, 3. Teacheth that the married may not part fro adultery, 9. and that the gift of continence is not given to all, 11. Commands that the children come to him, and blessed them, 13. Answers a young man to his demand, what he must do to obtain eternal life, 16. How hardly the rich come into the Kingsom of Heaven, 23. What recompence they shall receive, that forskae their own, for Chhrists sake,27.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass when Jesus had ended these words, that he departed from Galilee, and came over Jordan, [otherwise about or neer to Jordan, as Matth. 4.15. For Judea lay on the same side of Jordan where Galileelay] into the coasts of Judea.
\p
\v 2 And many multitudes followed him, and he healed them there.
\p
\v 3 And the Pharisees came to him tempting him, [Namley, to see whether they could find any thing out of his amswer, whereby they might render him suspected of the people] and saying unto him, is it lawful for a man to forsake his wife [that is to be divorced from his wife. as Matth 5. verse 31.] for all manner of causes. [Gr. every]
\p
\v 4 But he answering, said unto them; Have ye not read, he that from the beginning made (man), that he made them male and female. [Or, but one of the male, and one of the female kind]
\p
\v 5 And said, [Thse are Adans words, Gen.2.24. but are here ascribed unto God, because Adam spake thhe same through Gods inspiration of Gen 2.24.] Thferefore shall aman forsake father and mother, and shall adhere to his wife, [or, cleave to. The Greek word is a similitude taken from two several things, which with glue are fastned one to another] and they two shall be one (or into one) flesh. [that is, as one body, or as one man, 1 Cor.6.16. Ephes 5.28.]
\p
\v 6 So that they are no more two, but one flesh. That therefore which God hath joyned together, let no man separate.
\p
\v 7 They said unto hhim, Wherefore then did Moses commanded to give a Writing of Divorcement,and to forsake her [ Moses indeed commanded to give a Writing of Divorcement, for the clearing of the woman, which was so wrongfully forsaken or divorced: but such forsaking he never approved; but only connived at the same, because of their hardness of heart; like as Magistrate must sometimes permit things, to avoid greater mischief, which otherwise they ought to restrain; like as Christ himself also useth the word permit, in his answer, and the Pharisees themselves, Mark 10.4.]
\p
\v 8 He said unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts, permitted you to forsake your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.
\p
\v 9 But i say unto you, that whoso forsaketh his wife, otherwise then for fornication, and marrieth another, (he) commiteth, and he that marries her that is forsaken, (also) commiteth adultery.
\p
\v 10 His Discipkes said unto him, if the case of a man with the wife stands thus, [Namely, that the man is bound to fast to the woman] then is it not expedient to marry.
\p
\v 11 But he said unto them, All (men) do not comprehend this word, [that is, have not the gift of continency, but those to whom it is especially given of God, 1 Cor 7. verse 17] but those to whom it is given.
\p
\v 12 For there are Eunuchs, which are born so out of their mothers womb [That is, which by nature are unsit for marriage] and there areEunuch, which are made Eunuchhs of men: [that is, which have made themselves Eunuchs for the Kingdome of the Heavens [that is, who having the gift of continency, willingly remain unmarried, that they may serve God with less trouble, and further the Kingdom of Heaven both in themselves in others, 1 Cor 7. verse 32,33,34,35.] Otherwise he that hath not gift, it is better for himmake us of it, according as his calling or occasions permit.]
\p
\v 13 Then were little children brought unto him, that be should lay hands upon them, and pray: and the Disciples rebuked the same. [Namely, those that brought them, Mark 10.13.]
\p
\v 14 But Jesus said; Let the little children alone, and hinder them not to come to me, for such is the Kingdom of the Heaven. [Namely, of the children of the Covenant, like as those Jews children were. Otherwise the children of unbelievers are called unclean, 1 Cor. 7. ver 14.]
\p
\v 15 And whhen he had laid hands upon them, [This ceremony was used not only in the installing into the Ministry of the Church, but also in other special blessing, Gen 48. verse 14.] he departed from thence.
\p
\v 16 And behold there came one to him, and said unto him, Good Master, waht good (thing) shall i do that i amy have eternal life.
\p
\v 17 And he said unto him, whhy callest thou me good? None is good but one (namely) God. [Namely, of himself, perfectly and the Original of all good: such an one as thou dost not account me to be] But if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandents. [Christ answereth here according to the question and opinion of this young man, who thought he was able to obtain salvation by his own good works; and thherefore Christ directs him to the Law, thereby to bring him to the acknowledgement of his imperfection, and afterwards to faith in him, Gal.3.22.24.]
\p
\v 18 He said unto him, which? And Jesus said (these); Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not bear false witness
\p
\v 19 Honour thy Father and Mother: and Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self.
\p
\v 20 The young man said unto him, all thse things have i kept from my youth up: what lack i yet? [Gr.wherein do i yet come too short?]
\p
\v 21 Jesus said unto him, if thou wilt be perfect, Go thy way, Sell what thou hast, and give it to the poor, [This Christ faith to convince this young man, who thought that he had all Gods commandements, forasmuch as he had outwardly lived according to the same, that he lacked much yet, yea even concerning the keeping of the commandments of the second Table, seeing he had rather keep his goods, then at the command of Christ, to give the same to the poor,and follow him: which appears also out of the twenty third verse. For he that keepeth the same, shall not hardly, but certainly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, Rom. 10 verse 5.] and thou shalt have a treasure in Heaven; and come hither, follow me.
\p
\v 22 Now when the young man heard thhis word, he went away sorrowful: for he had muchh goods. [Gr. possession.]
\p
\v 23 And Jesus said unto his Disciples, Verily i say unto you, that a rich (man) shall hardly enter into the Kingdome of the Heavens. [That is, which sets his heart and trust on riches, as is expounded, Mark 10.24.]
\p
\v 24 And again i say unto you, it is easier [This was a proverb among the Jews, whereby they gave to understand the impossibility of any thing] that a camel [or, as some think a cable] go thorow the eye of a needle, then tha rich (man) enter into the Kingdom of God.
\p
\v 25 Now his Disciples hearing (this) were sore amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?
\p
\v 26 And Jesus beholding (them) said unto them, with men that is impossible [Forasmuch as God is able to withdraw even the heart of the heart of the rich from trusting in riches,a d endue them with faith in Christ, and wih an humble heart.
\p
\v 27 Then answerd Peter and said unto him, Behold we hhave forsaken all, and followed thee: what therefore shall be done to us? [That is, what shall we get by it.]
\p
\v 28 And Jesus said unto them, Verily i say unto you, that ye which have followed me, in the regenaration, [That is, in the restauration of all things, when the faithful shall be perfectly renewed both in body and soul, Acts 3. verse 21. 1 Cor 15.42,43. Other join the words, in the regeneration, with the foregoing] when the Son of man shall be set on the throne of of his glory, [namely, for to judge the quick and the dead] (that) ye also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve Tribes of Israel [Namely , because the Apostles shall condemn them, not oney by their example, that they have believed in Christ , whereas the other Israelites remained unbelieving, as is said of the Ninivites, Matth 12.41. but likewise by their constent, as is also said of all believers, 1 Cor.6.2,3. howsoever thhe Apostles shall herein be eminent above others, Luke 22. verse 30. Rev 21. verse 14.]
\p
\v 29 And whoso shal have forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father; or mother,or children, or fields, for my names sake, (he) shall receive an hundred fold, [That is, manifold. See Luke 18. 30.] and inherit eternal life.
\p
\v 30 But many first shall be the last, and (many) last the first.
\c 20
\s By the similitude of labourers, hired at several hours, and sent into the Vineyard, and at evening receiving a like reward, Christ teachest hhow he shall hereafter reward those that have served,1. Again, foretels his suffering, death, and ressurection,17. Answereth the number of Zebedes children to her request, 20. and admonisheth his Disciples to take hheed of ambition, and worldy domination, 24. About Jericho, restore, restores two bilnde men to their sighht,29.
\p
\v 1 For the Kingdom of the Heavens [Hereby it appears that this similitude is brought by Christ for confirmation of the saying (laid down) in the last verse of of the former Chapter, like as is to be seen also in the sixteenth verse folling] is like unto a Master of a family, [Gr. a man which is Master of a family] who went forth early in the morning, to hire labourers in his Vineyard.
\p
\v 2 And when he hhhad agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, [Gr. denarius. see thereof, Matth 18. v, 28. Rev 6. ver. 6] he sent them away into his Vineyard.
\p
\v 3 And being gone forth about the third hour, [The Jews divided the day into twelve hours, as is to be seen, John 11.9. so that hour from eleven to twelve was the last of the day, and of labour, and the third agreed with our ninth before noon] hhe saw other standing idle on the market – (place).
\p
\v 4 And he said to them, Go ye also (your ways) into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right i will give to you. And they went.
\p
\v 5 Again, being gone forth about thhe sixth and ninth hour, he hhad in like manner:
\p
\v 6 And being gone forth about the eleventh hour, he found others standing, and said until them, Why stand ye here the whole day idle?
\p
\v 7 Thhey said unto him, Because no ma, hath hired us.He said unti them. Go ye also into thhe Vineyard, and that which is right ye shall receive.
\p
\v 8 Now when it was become eveing, the Lord of vineyard said unto his Steward, [Gr. Epitropos, that is, he that had the administration or care of his goods, or he that had the care of the receiving and laying out of his revenues] call the labourers, and give them the reward, beginning from the last to the first.
\p
\v 9 And when they came which (were hired) at the eleventh, they received every one penny. [Hereby appears that reward hereafter shall not be given according to merit: Otherwise these last must hhave received less then the first.]
\p
\v 10 And the first coming, thought thhat they should receive more, and they themselves received also every one a penny.
\p
\v 11 And being having received (it) they murmured agaisnt the Master of the house. [From hence follows not that at the last days, there shall be any murmuring amongst the faithful, seeing all parts of parables may not be applyed: but that is set here to shew, that then there shall be no cause of murmuring, forasmuch as the reward shall be given of Gods goodness, according to grace, as appears out of verse 15.]
\p
\v 12 Saying, these last labour (but) one hour, [or, spent; namely, in labour] and thou hast made them equal to us, that hhave born the hurthen of the day, and the heat.
\p
\v 13 But he answering, said unto one of them, Friend, [Gr. Companion] i do thee no wrong: Didst thou not agree with me for a penny?
\p
\v 14 Take that is thine, and go thy way. I will also give into this last, like as to thee.
\p
\v 15 Or is it not lawful fro me to do with mine (own) what i will? or is the eye eveil, [That is, gradging, envoius] because i am good?
\p
\v 16 . Even so shall the last be the first, [That is, as the first] and the last. [that is,as the last. Hereby Christ teacheth, that no man hath cause to murmure, because of the reward which shall be given him hereafter, albeit that any one hath laboured more or served God longer; seeing the same shall be given of grace and according to the eternal election; like as Christ restifieth in th efollowing words, whhen he saith, For many called, but few elected. Other think that by the first, are understood those that would be justified and saved by their own works, such as the young man was, spoken of in the former Chapter; and by the last, those that by the power of Gods gracious election, embrace the calling to the salvation by a true faith] for many are called, but few elected.
\p
\v 17 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took to him the twelve Disciples alone [or part] on the way,and said unto them;
\p
\v 18 Behold, we go to Jerusalem and the Son of man shhall be delivered over to the chiefs Priests and Scribes, and they shall condemn him death
\p
\v 19 And they shall deliver him over to the Gentles, for to mock and to scourge, and to crucifie him, nad the third day hhe arise again.
\p
\v 20 Then came the mother of the Sons of Zebeddee unto him, [Namely, Salome, as appears by comparing Matth 27.56. with Mark 15 verse 4o.] with her sons, [namely, John and James, Matth 10.2. and Mark 10.35.] worshipping (him) and desiring somewhat of him.
\p
\v 21 And said unto her, What wilt thou? she said unto him, say that these my two soms may sit the one on thy right, and the other on thy left (hand) in thy Kingdom [That is, that they may be the greatest or cheifest next to thee. A similitude taken from Kinggs which sit upon their thrones, and use to set those that are next to them, on the both sides by them. see 1 Kings 2.19. Psalm 45.10. and 110.1.]
\p
\v 22 But Jesus answered and said, ye know not what ye desire: [For they did not yet understand the condition of Christ Kingdome, and whereunto they were called, not to rule in the world, but to serve and to suffer] Are ye able to drink the cup that i shall drink: and he baptised with the baptism, wherewith i am baptized? [by the Cup, as also by Baptism, Christ undersandeth grievous sufferings; whereby men are as it were drenched with a bitter drink; and as it were overwhelmed with water, Psal. 75.9. Isa 51.17. Matth 26.42. Luke 12.50.] they said unto him, We are able.
\p
\v 23 And he said unto them, My cup ye shall indeed drink, and with the baptism wherewith the baptised shall ye be baptized, but the sitting at my right, and at my left (hand) is not in my power to give [Gr. It is not mine; namely, in this low estate, and for such reasons ye imagine: Otherwise Christ shall also hereafter give unto those that overcome to sit upon his throne, Rev.3. verse. 21. Or, to give but ti those for whom it is prepared. see Mark 10. 40.] but (it shall be given) (to those) for whom it is prepared of my Father. [That is, ordained from evalasting. See Matth 25. verse 34.
\p
\v 24 And when the (other) ten [Namely, Apostles] heard (that) they tool it very ill of the two brethren.
\p
\v 25 And when Jesus had called them unto him, he said, ye know, that the Ruler of the people [otherwise of the Heathen] hear dominion over them, and thhe great ones exercise aouthority upon them.
\p
\v 26 But so shall it not among you, [Namely mine Apostles, and all other, which shall be called to the Ministry of the Church, to whom such a worldly manner of ruling is here forbidden. For otherwise thhere shall and may also be Kings and Princea among Christians, Psal.2.10. Esa49. verse 23.] but whoso will be great among you, let (him) be your Minister
\p
\v 27 And also will be the first among you, let him be your servant.
\p
\v 28 Like as the Son of man is to come to be Ministred unto, but to Minister, and to give his soul [That is, life. Or himself both body and soul] (for) a ransome [or, release – money, thhat which is given for the release of those that are in captivity] for many [that is, instead of many, namely, the elect children of God, thereby to redeem them from eternal death, John 10.15. and 11.52. and chapter 17. verse 9.]
\p
\v 29 And as they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
\p
\v 30 And behold two blind (men) sitting by the way, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cryed, saying, Lord, thou Son of David, have mercy on us.
\p
\v 31 And the multitude rebuked them, that they should hold their peace, but they cryed the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David.
\p
\v 32 And Jesus standing (still), called them, and said What will ye that i do unto you?
\p
\v 33 They said unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
\p
\v 34 And Jesus being inwardly moved compassion, touched their eyes, and straightway their eyes received the sight, and they followed him.
\c 21
\s Christ makes his entrance into Jerusalem, sitting upon an Ass,1. Drives the buyer and seller out of the Temple,12. and there healeth blind and cripple,14. Defends the crying of the children against the grudging of the Chiefs Priests,15. Curseth a fig – tree, which thereupon withreth immediatly, 18 Shews the power of faith, 21. Answereth the question of the chief Priest and Ruler of the people, by what authority he did thus, by another question converning the baptism of John, 23. Convinceth of their disobedience by a similitude of two sons, 28. and threatens their ruine by another similitude of the Lord of a Vineyard, whose servants and son, were abused and slain by the husband – men,33.
\p
\v 1 And when they now drew near to Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage [ Mark chap.11 verse1 and Luke chap 19. 29. adds hereto Bethany, which were two village or place, lying one by another at the mount of Olives, about fifteen furlongs from Jerusalem: as it to be seen, John 11. verse 18.] at the Olives mount. [Gr. mount og Olives, which was situated East – wards from Jerusalem, a sabbath – days – journey; Acts 1. verse.12] then Jesus sent two disciples, saying unto them,
\p
\v 2 Go into the village that (lyeth) over gainst you, and ye shall straight away find a she – ass bound, and a foal with her : loose them and bring them to me. [O – thwrw. lead them]
\p
\v 3 And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, that the Lord hath need of them, and hhe shall straightway send them. [Others, send them back again: So that thse should be the words of Christ, which he bid his Disciples to say to the owner of the she – ass]
\p
\v 4 Now all this was done, that that might be fulfilled which is spoken (of) by the Prophet, saying,
\p
\v 5 Tell the daughter of Sion : [that is, the inhabitants of the City of Jerusalem; which were called, because part of Jerusalem was built on Mout Sion, 2 Kings 19.21. And hereby is also understood theChurch of God; whereof Jerusalem and Sion were types] behold thy Kingdome] cometh (unto) thee, meek, and set upon a she – ass, [Christ properly sate upon the foal, as appears out of Mark 11 verse 7. Luke 19.30. but this she – ass is joined here, to shew that it was a foal that followed his damme, yet so that none had ever sate thereon, like as the other Evangelists testifie] and foal, being a young (one) [Gr. a Son] of a yoak – bearing (she – ass)
\p
\v 6 And the Disciples being gone, and having done as Jesus had commanded them,
\p
\v 7 Bought the she – ass and foal, and laid their cloaths on the same, and set (him) thereon. [Namely, on the cloaths]
\p
\v 8 And the greatest multitude spread their garments on the way, [Namely, in token of joy and hounor which men were wont to shew great Lords and Kings thereby see 2 Kings 9. verse 13. and Maccah. 13.51.] and other cut branches from the treets, and spread them on the away.
\p
\v 9 And the multitudes which went before, and they that followed, cryed saying Hosanna to the Son of David: [The word Hosanna, taken out of Psalm 118. ver.25 is an Hebrew word of two made one, and signifies so much as Save we pray, or give we pray happiness and prosperity] Blessed (is) he [or be he] which cometh in the name of the Lord: [that is, sent by the Lord according to his promises to accomplish his work] Hosanna in the highest Heavens
\p
\v 10 And when he came into Jerusalem, the whole City was moved, saying Who is this?
\p
\v 11 And the multitude said, This is Jesus, the Prophet of Nazareth in Galilee.
\p
\v 12 And Jesus went unto the Temple of God, and drove out [Gr. cast ot] all that bought and sold in the Temple, and overturned the Tables of the Changers, and the seats of them that sold doves. [These changers and sellers, where permitted by the chief Priest in the Temple, without Gods command, under the presence of confurthering the worship of God, but in truth out of convetousness, that the people might always have fit mony, and beasts for the sacrifies whereof they had their share and profit]
\p
\v 13 And he said unto them, It is written, My house shall he called an house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of murderers.[ or robbers, high – way – men, For like as the robbers used to have their dens in the rock, whither they bougt and divided their prey, so likewise did the Priests in the Temple. And these words are taken out of Jer.7. verse 11]
\p
\v 14 And there came (the) blinde and criples to him in the Temple, and he healed them.
\p
\v 15 Now whhen the chief Priest and Scribes saw the wonders which he did, [Gr. wonderful , namely, deeds] and the children crying in the Temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David, they took that very ill.
\p
\v 16 And said unto him, Dost thou hear what these say? [This is they say by way of proof, that he did not cause the children to hold their peace] And Jesus said unto them, yea. Have ye never read, Out of the mouth of young children and suckling, hast thou prepared (thee) praise [or perfected]
\p
\v 17 And leaving them, he went thence, out of the City towards Bethany, [Or Bethany see the Annotation on the first verse] and tarried there all night.[ or ledged there, and took up his Inne there]
\p
\v 18 And early in the morning as he returned to the City, he hungred.
\p
\v 19 And seeing a fig tree by the way, he went unto it, and found nothing on the same, but leaves only; and said unto it: Let thhere be no fruit of thee any more for ever. And immediatly the fig – tree withred.
\p
\v 20 And the Disciples seeing (that) they marvelled, saying, How is the fig – tree (so) presently withered?
\p
\v 21 And Jesus answering , said unto them, Verily i say unto you, if you had faith [of this faith see before, chap 17. verse 20] and doubted not, ye should not only do that which is (hapned) to the fig – tree, but if ye also said to this Mountain, Be thou lifted up, and cast into the sea, it should be done.
\p
\v 22 And what soever ye shall desire in prayer, beliving ye shall receive.
\p
\v 23 And when he was come into the Temple, while he taught, there came unto him the chief Priest, and the Elders of the people, saying, By [Gr. in] what power [or authority] dost thou these things? [namely, which are before set down] and who gave thee this power?
\p
\v 24 And Jesus answering unto them, i will also ask you one word, [that is, thing] which if ye shall tell me, then will i also tell you by what power i do these things.
\p
\v 25 The Baptism of John from whence was (that?) [that is, the doctrine of John, confirmed by his Baptism. By this question Christ answers the question of the chief Priest, seeing that John, whose doctrine was from Heaven, had born witness of him that he was the true Messiahh: as also God the Father himslef, when Christ was baptised by John] out of Heaven [that is, from God, Luke 15 verse 18] or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, [or amaongst one another] and said, if we say, out of Heaven, he will say to us, Why then did ye not believe him?
\p
\v 26 And if we say, of men, then we fear the multitude: for they all hold John for a Prophet.
\p
\v 27 And they answering Jesus, said, We know not. And he said unto them, Then neither do i tell you, by what power i do this.
\p
\v 28 But what think ye? A man had sons, [Gr. children] and going to the first, [By the first son, are understood notorious sinner, who being converted are obedient of the Gospel] said, son, Go work to day in my Vineyard.
\p
\v 29 But he answered and said, i will not: and afterwards repenting he went.
\p
\v 30 And going to the second, [By the second, [By the second son are understood those who make prosession to serve God; and notwithstanding in truth do not so] he said the like. And the same answered and said, i (go) Sir, and he went not.
\p
\v 31 Which of these two did the will of the Father? They said unto him the first; Jesus said unto them, verily i say unto you, thst the publicans and the harlots [Namely, being converted] go before you into the Kingdome og God. [that is, they repent and embrace the Gospel, whereas ye being and abiding impenitent, reject the same: and consequently they shall enter into Heaven, whereas ye shall be excluded. see Matth.25. 12.]
\p
\v 32 For John came unto you in the way of righteosness, [That is, teaching the right way of salvation, and walking in the same] and ye believd him not: but the publicans and harlots believed him; yet ye seeing (this) repented not afterwards for to believe him.
\p
\v 33 Hear another similitude. There was an househholder [Gr. a man that was a Master of a family] which planetd a Vineyard, and set a fence about it, [or mound, hedge] and digged a wine – press – trough therein, [namely, whereinto the wine runneth, and is gathered together under the press] and built a Towre, [namely, from thence to over – took the whole Vineyard, and to watch the same] and let it out to husband – men, [or gave it out] and travelled out of (the land)
\p
\v 34 Now when the time of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, to receive his fruits [In this parable or similitude, God the Father is compared to a father of a family, the Church of the Jews to a Vineyard, the Priests and Scribes to husbandmen, the Prophhets and faithful Teachers, to servants; Christ to the Son, of the father of the family, and faith & obidience to fruits: which seeing they did not bring forth, therefore their ruine by the Romanes is threatned, and the calling of the Gentiles in their room foretold. See the like similitude, Psal.80.9. Isa.6.1. Jer.12.10.]
\p
\v 35 And the husbandmen taking his servants, beat the one, and killed another, stoned a third: [See hereof, Hebr. chapter 11 verse 36,37.]
\p
\v 36 Again he sent other servants, more (in number) then the first, and they did unto them like manner.
\p
\v 37 And the last he sent unto them his son, saying , they will respect my son.
\p
\v 38 But the husbandmen seeing the Son, said amongst themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and keep his inharitance (to our selves)
\p
\v 39 And taking him they cast ?(him) out, without the Vineyard, and killed (him)
\p
\v 40 When therefore the Lord of the Vineyard shall come, what shall he do to those husbandmen?
\p
\v 41 They said unto him,He shall put those wicked (men) to an evil death, and shall let out the Vineyard to other husbandmen, which shall give him the fruits in their seasons.
\p
\v 42 Jesus said unto them, Have ye never read in the Scripture, The stone [This is Christ 1 Pet.2. 4. which the builders, that is, the Scribes and Pharisees rejected] which the builders rejected, [Gr. disapproved] this is become the head (or to a head) of the corner: [that is, the outmost corner – stone, on which two walls stand fast, and are joined one to another, namely, the Church collected of Jews and Gentiles. See Ephes.2.13,20. and 1 Pet 2.7,8.] of the Lord this done, and it is marvelous in our eyes.
\p
\v 43 Therefore i say unto you, that the Kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a people that bring forth the fruits thereof. [Namely, of the Kingdome of Heaven; that is, which become the Kingdome]
\p
\v 44 And he that falleth on this stone, [Namely, by contempt or unbelief, Pet. 2..8.] he shall be broken, and on whom it falleth, [namely, Christ by the weight of his judgement, or of his punishment] hhe shhall break him to pieces. [Gr. winnow; that is, grinde him so small, that might be winnowed or sisted, Psa. 2.9.]
\p
\v 45 And when the chief Preist and Pharisees these his similitudes, they understood that he spake of them.
\p
\v 46 And seeking to take hhim, they feared the multitudes, seeing these him for a Prophet.
\c 22
\s The similitude of a marriage whereunto they that were first invietd to refused to come, 1.and therefore othhers are invited in their stead, 8. amongst whichh one appearing without the wedding – garment is cast out, 11 Christ answers the question of the Pharisees and Herodians, whether men may give tribute to Cesar, 15. To the question of the Sadduces concerning the woman which had seven husband: and against them he proves thhe resurection from the dead,23. Declares which is the greatest Commandment in thhe Law, 35 and that the Messias is not only Davids Son, but also his Lord,41.
\p
\v 1 And Jesus answering spake to them again by similitudes, saying,
\p
\v 2 The Kingdome of Heaven is like [By this similitude is set before our eyes the great ingratitude of the Jews, who being through the preaching of the Gospel called by God to the communion of his Son and to the salvation, despised the same, and therefore should be grieviuosly punished and cast off: and that afterwards the Gentiles should be called in their stead] a certain King [Gr. a man thhat was a King] i.e. God the Father] which prepered a marriage for his Son. [that is, the gracious and spiritual fellowship with Christ, and eternal salvation.]
\p
\v 3 And set forth his servants [Namely the Prophets and faithful Priests] to call [that is, to bring in] those that were invited to the wedding: [namely, the Jews] and they would came not come.
\p
\v 4 Again he sent forth other servants, [Namely, thhe Apostles, Evangelists, and other Teachers of the holy Gospel] saying, say to the invited, Behold, i have prepared my dinner, mine oxen, and thhe fatted (beasts) are killed, and all things are ready, [seeing Christ was now come in the flesh, actually accomplish the work of our salvation] Come to the wedding.
\p
\v 5 But they not regarding (this) went their way, this (man) to his field, that to his merchandise.
\p
\v 6 And the rest laid hold on his servants, abused and killed them.
\p
\v 7 Now when the King heard (that) he waxed wroth, and sending his armies, [Which were the Romans, whom God made use of to bring this judgment upon them; although they intended no such matter, as Esa 10.7.] destroyed those murderers, and set their City on fire.
\p
\v 8 Then said he to his servant, Thhe wedding indeed is ready, but the invites were not worthy of it. [See Acts 13. verse 46]
\p
\v 9 Therefore go on the issues of the ways [or crosse ways, i.e. into all parts of the Countries of the world, Rom.10. verse 18] and as ye shall finde, [of all sorts, without difference] call them to the wedding.
\p
\v 10 And the same servants going forth into the (high) ways; gathered together all that they found, both bad and good, and the wedding was filled with (guests) sitting down.
\p
\v 11 And when the King was gone in, to view the (guests) sitting down, [Namely, at the last judgement day; see verse 13] he saw there a man not (being) clad with a wedding – garment. [This wedding – garment is Christ with his righteousness, received by true faith, which is essectual, and shewed forth by the works of charity, Rom 13.14. Gal 3.26,27. Rev 19 verse 8]
\p
\v 12 And he said unto them, Friend [Gr. fellow, or companion] How art thou came in hither, not having (on) a wedding – garment. And he was dumb. [Namely, as one that is muzled]
\p
\v 13 Then said the King to the Minister, [Namely which served at the Table: whereby are understood the Angels. see Matth 13.41,42.] Binde his hands and feet, take him away, and cast (him) out (into) the outmost darkness; [see hereof, Matth 8.12.] There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\p
\v 14 For many are called, but few are chosen. [This conclusion respects not onely this single man led down here, as an exampe of hypocrites, but likewise the multitude of those, who being before invited, despised the same.]
\p
\v 15 Then the Pharisees went away, and took counsel together, how they should ensnare him in (his) talk [or with their talk . see Mrk 12.13.]
\p
\v 16 And they sent out unto him their Desciples, with the Herodians; [Some ancient Teachers think that these Herodians were a peculiar sect, which embraced and followed a mixture of the Jewish and Heathenish Religion, brought in by Herod th great, which agrees with Mark 8.15. Others think that they were Courtiers or servants of Herod Antipas, which gathered these tributes for the Emperour, and laid hands on those that refuse: which is gathered from the words, Luke 20. verse 20] saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, and carest no man: for thou regardest not the person of men. [Ggr. face; that is, the outward state or condition of men, as power, richhes, kinred, or the like.]
\p
\v 17 Tell us therefore, what thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute [or taxes] tp Cesar, or not?
\p
\v 18 But Jesus knowing their malice, said,
\p
\v 19 What tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? shew me the tribute – money. [This was a peice of money called by the name of the Romanes Denarius, as is exprest at the end of the verse, whereon the Romane Emperours image and the name was stamped: which and no other coin, was to be given for tribute, that dominion of the Romane Empire; like as before also they used to pay the tribute of the Temple, with half a shekel of the Santuary; on which stood, on the one side, the shekel of Israel, and on the other side, the holy Jerusalem. Of the Denarius, see Matth. 18.28.] and they brought him a penny.
\p
\v 20 And he said unto them, Whose is this umage, and the superscription?
\p
\v 21 They said unto him, Cesars. Then said he unto them, Give therefore to Cesar, that which is Cesars, and to God, thhat which is Gods
\p
\v 22 And they hearing this, marvelled, and leaving him they went away.
\p
\v 23 The same day came unto him he Sadduces, [Of the sect of the Sadduces; see more largely, Acts 23.8,] which say that there is no ressurection, and asked him,
\p
\v 24 Saying, Master, Moses said, if any man die, having no children, [that is, sons] his brother [who was to raise up seed unto deceased brothher, which should bear his brothers name, and his heir, Deut 25.5,6.] shall marry his wife, [Gr. by right of assinity take to wife] and raise up seed unot his brother.
\p
\v 25 Now there were with us seven brethren, and the first having married (a wife) died, and seeing he had no seed, he left his wife for his brother.
\p
\v 26 Likewise also the second, and the third, unto the seventh. [Gr. unto the seven.]
\p
\v 27 Last of all the woman died also.
\p
\v 28 Therefore in the resurrection, whose wise shhall she be of those seven? for they all had her.
\p
\v 29 But Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye erre, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.
\p
\v 30 For the resurrection they [viz.men] take not in marriage, neither are they [viz.women.] given out in marriage; but they are Angels of God in Heaven. [Not in respect of effence, but as concerning marriage, and the natural properties of this transitory life. See 1 Cor 15. verse 44. Phil.3.21.]
\p
\v 31 And concerning the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which is spoken to you by God, who saith,
\p
\v 32 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. [To be any ones God, is to give one eternal salvation , both of body and soul; see Psalm 33.12.and Psalm 144. verse 15. whence followeth, that those Patriarchs lived with God, in repect of their souls, (which these Sadduces also denied, Act 23.8.) and should also arise in respect of their bodies, and live eternally; seeing he is called a God, not of one part of them only, but of their whole person] God is not a God of the dead, but of the living.
\p
\v 33 And the multitude hearing (this), were astonished at his doctrine
\p
\v 34 And the Pharisees having heard that he had slopt the mouth of the Sedduecs, were gathered together.
\p
\v 35 And one of them being a lawyer asked, tempting him, and saying,
\p
\v 36 Master, which is the greatest commandment in the Law? [That is, the greatest.]
\p
\v 37 And Jesus said unto him, Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy understanding. [or reasoning; that is, weighing, pondering in the understanding.]
\p
\v 38 This is the first and greatest Commandment.
\p
\v 39 And the second like unto this (is) Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self.
\p
\v 40 On these two Commandments, depend the whole Law and the Prophets. [Thhat is, herein, as in the total summe; are all the Commandments of the Law, and the Exposition of the Prophets upon the same conatined. See Rom. 13.10. 1 Tim 1.5.]
\p
\v 41 Now when the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
\p
\v 42 And said, What think ye of Christ? [That is, of the promised Messias, or Anointed] Whose Son is he?They said unto him, Davids (Son)
\p
\v 43 He said unto them, How then doth David in the Spirit [That is, being moved by the holy Ghost. see 2 Pet. 1.21.] call him his Lord? saying,
\p
\v 44 The Lord said unto my Lord, sit at my right (hand) [of the righht hand, see Matth. 20.21.] until I shall have set thine enemies for a footstool of thy feet.
\p
\v 45 If therefore David call him (his) Lord, [See the interpretation hereof, Luke 20.44.] how is he his Son?
\p
\v 46 And no man could answer him a word: neither durst any man ask him (any thing) more from that day forwards
\c 23
\s Christ exhorts his hearers to follow that which the Scribes and Pharisees teachh them out of Moses, but not their works,1. Describes their hypocrisie and ambition,5. and admonisheth his take heed thereof, and to study hunility,8. Denounceth the Woe eight time upon the Pharisees and Scribes, because of divers their wicked practises, as namely, because they shut Heaven against men, 13. eat up widows houses, 14. made ill proselites 15. taught perversly to swear by the Temple, Altar, and Heaven 16. tithed small matter, and omlited the weightiest things of the Law,23. made clean the outside and not the heart, 25. being like whited sepulchres,27. That they built up the Sepulchres of the old Prophets, and sought to kill the new, 29. He complains to the stiff – neckedness of the City Jerusalem, and foretells her destruction, 37.
\p
\v 1 Then spake Jesus to the multitudes and his Disciples,
\p
\v 2 Saying, the Scribes and the Pharisees are set in Moses chair. [That is, thay are called and ordained for thie end, to read and expound the Law of Moses to the people, Acts 15.15. and chap.15. 21.]
\p
\v 3 Therefore whatsoever they say unto you that ye shall observe, [Namely, out of the Law of Moses and the Prophets: for other wise that which they taught contrary to, or besides that, Christ calleth the leaven of the Pharisees, admonisheth his Disciples to beware of it, Matth. 16.ver. 6.12.] observe (that) and do (it;) but do not after their works: for they say, and do it not:
\p
\v 4 For they binde burdens [A similitude taken from bundles or packs of several things, which men blinde together, to lay upon ones shoulders to bear] which are heartlyand ill to be born, and lay them on mens shoulders, but they will not stir them with their singer.
\p
\v 5 And all their works they do to be seen of men. For they make broad their schedules of remembrance, [Gr. Phylactria, i.e. schedules of keeping, which were little scrowls or schedules of parchment, whereupon the Law of God, or some part of the same, was written, which they bound on their forehheads and arms, that they might seem to have the remembrance of the Law always before their eyes, and conceited that therein they followed that which God commands, Exod. 13. verse 9.16 Deut. 6.8] and make ggreat the hems of their garments. [Thse were fringes, with blue strings on the course of the corner of the uppermost garments, which according to the Law, Numb 5. verse 38. Deut.22.12. they were to wear, thereby to remember thhe Heavenly doctrine of the Law.]
\p
\v 6 And they love the sitting in the foremost place at feasts, and the foremost seats in the synagogues.
\p
\v 7 Also greetings on the Markets, and to be called of men Rabbi, Rabbi. [That is an Hebrew word signifying one that is eminet in learning and dignity, and of more repute then othhers, i.e. Master, Master.]
\p
\v 8 But ye shall not be called Rabbi, [The use of this as also of the following title is not simply forbidden, for the same indeed are sometimes ascribed to the Prophets and Apostles, but the vain – glory and boring it, or mastership over the faith and consciences of other, which they sought therein, verse 11.] for one is your Master, (namely) Christ: [Gr. Fore – goer, Leadres, or Leading Master. For he alone is the onely Law – giver and our chief Prophet, who in things concerning faith, and Gods worship, is only to be heard and followed, Matth 17.5. and who doth not only shew way of salvation, but also himslef by his example perfectly goes before us, Heb.2.10. and 12.2] and ye all are brethren.
\p
\v 9 And ye shall call no man your Father upon earth; for one is your Father, [Forasmuch as from him alone we have origionally our being and preservation, both in body and soul, must expect all good fro him alone, and put out trust in him only] namely, he that is in the Heavens.
\p
\v 10 Neither shall ye be called Masters: for one is your Master, [That is, Leader, see verse 8.] (namely) Christ.
\p
\v 11 But the chiefest of you [Gr. chiefer or greater] shall be your servant.
\p
\v 12 And whoso shall exalt himself, (he) shall be brought low: and whoso shhall humble himself, (he) shall be exalted.
\p
\v 13 But woe to you ye Scribes and Pharisees, ye hypocrites, for ye sht the Kingdome of the Heavens before men; seeing ye enter not (there) in; neither suffer those to enter that should enter. [Or those that are entring; i.e. those that are no the way to embrace thhe doctrine of the Gospel, ye hinder as much as lies in you, that they do not go forward.]
\p
\v 14 Woe unto you ye Scrobes and Pharisees, ye hypocrites: For ye eat up windows houses, and (that) under the pretence (on colour) of praying long. [That is, under pretence of devotion, and praying for them, ye rob them their means. See also 2 Tim.3.6. Or under a pretence, or for cleak ye are long praying] Therefore shall receive the heavier judgemnet: [Gr. more abundant.]
\p
\v 15 Woe unto you ye Scribes and Pharisees, ye hypocrites: For ye travel about Sea and Land [Gr. the dry (land) Gen.1. verse 10.] to make one fellow – few: [Gr. Proselyton, i.e commer – over, namely, who from the Heathenish Religion betakes himself to the Jewish; like as was Nichola a commer – over of Anti och, Acts 6.5. See 1 Chron 2 verse 55. Ezek.14.7. Acts 2.11.] and when hhe become one, ye make him a child of Hell, [Gr. son, i.e worthy of the damnation of Hell, 2 Sam 12.5.] twosold more then ye (are)
\p
\v 16 Woe unto you blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall have sworn by the Temple, that is nothing: [That is, that is of no force, or is not bound to pay that which he hath promised with such an oath] but whosoever shall have sworn by the Temple, he is indebted. [that is, he is bound to perform his promise.]
\p
\v 17 Ye fools and blind: [Christ doth not hereby approve Oaths taken by the creatures, but shew only how preversly they judged thereof, and ill -informed the conscience of men] for which is greater, the gold, or the Temple which sanctifieth the gold?
\p
\v 18 And whosoever shall have sworn by the Altar, that is nothing: but whosoever shall have sworn by the gift [that is, offering. see Matth5.24.] that is thereon, he is indebted.
\p
\v 19 Ye fools and blind: for which is greater, the gift or the altar which sanctifieth the gift.
\p
\v 20 Therefore whoso sweareth by the altar, be sweareth by the same, and by all that is thereon.
\p
\v 21 And whoso sweareth by the Temple, he sweareth by the same, and by him that dwealleth therein. [Gr. who inhabits the same. How God dwelth in the Temple. See 1 Kings verse 27.]
\p
\v 22 And whoso swears by the Heaven, he sweareth by the Throne of God, nd him that sitteth thereon.
\p
\v 23 Woe unto ye Scribes and Pharisees, ye hypocrites: for ye tithe [That is, give ye tenths, or teach that men must give tenths thereof] munt [The Greek word Hedyosmon hath its name from smelling sweet or well] and dill, and cummin, and ye omit the heartiest (things) of the Law, [that is, the weightiest parts] (namely) judgment, [that is, that which is just and equal] and mercy, [that is, the works of charity] and faith, [that is, faithfulness in all dealings with men] These things men ought to do, and leave the other undone.
\p
\v 24 Ye blind guides, which suck out the gnat, and swallow down the camel [Or, squeeze out a gnat, and drink down a camel. This is a common proveb against those which pry narrowly into small matter, but regard not great ones.]
\p
\v 25 Woe unto ye Scribe and Pharisees, ye hypocrites: for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of rapine and excess. [That is, full of meat and drink gotten by justice, and used with excess.]
\p
\v 26 Thou blind Pharisees, cleanse first that (which) is within in the cup and the platter, that the outside of the same may be clean also [i.e. Cease from injustice and excess, whereby your meat and drink was made unclean, so shall your platters and cups be clean also.]
\p
\v 27 Woe unto ye Scribes and Pharisees, ye hypocrites: For ye are like to white – plaistred Sepulchres; which indeed seem beautiful outwardly, but within are full of (dead mens) bones, and of all uncleanness
\p
\v 28 Even so, ye also outwardly indeed seem righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisie and uniquity.
\p
\v 29 Woe unto ye Scribes and Pharisees, ye hypocrites: For ye build up the sepulchres of the Prophets, and adorn the monuments of the rightious. [That is, the building which were erected upon the graves, above the carth; for the remembrance of the deceased, which are called Tombs]
\p
\v 30 And say, if we had been in the times [Gr. in the days] of our fathers, we would have had no fellowship with them in the blond of the Prophets. [That is, in the bloud – shedding, or killing.]
\p
\v 31 Thus wilness (against) your selves, that ye are children, [Gr. sons] of those that killed the Prophets.
\p
\v 32 (Therefore) ye also, fulfill ye the measure of your Fathers, [That is, go on thus freely, follow and finish your Fathers wickedness in killing the Prophets, until the deserved punishment shall come upon you.]
\p
\v 33 Ye serpents, [See Rom.3.13., etc] ye brood of Vipers, how should ye escape the Hellish damnation. [Gr. the judgment of Hell]
\p
\v 34 Therefore behold, i send unto you Prophets, and Wise – men, and Scribes, [This word is here taken for true Teachers, such a Scribes as Ezra was Ezra 7. ver.6 Matth. 13.52.] and of the same (some) ye shall kill and crucifie, and (some) of the same ye shall scourge in your synagogues, and shall persecute them from City to City.
\p
\v 35 That upon you may come all the righteous bloud [That is, the punishment for all the bloid – shedding of the righteous, as Matth 27.25. for the children which follow the evil example of their parents misdeeds, are made partakers of the sin and punishment of the same, Exod.20.5.] that is shed upon the earth, from the bloud of righteous Abel, even unto bloud of Zacharius the Son of Barachieas, [who is also called Jochannan, 1 Chr.6.9. and Jujada, 1 Chron.24.22. and here Barachias And this Zacharias was one of the last Prophets, whose death or murder is related by name in the Old Testament, and whosae bloud, like as also the bloud of Abel, cryed to God fro vengeance] whom ye shew between the Temple and the Altar.
\p
\v 36 Verily, i say unto you, all these things shall come upon this generation.
\p
\v 37 Jerusalem, thou that killest the Prophets, and stonest them that are unto thee: How often would i have gathered by children together, [That is, thine inhabitants] like as the hen gathereth together her chickens under the wings, and ye would not. [that is, ye have always sought to hinder it, see verse 13, and yet Christ gathered all his out of her nilling willing. Isa.1.8 and Rom.9.29.]
\p
\v 38 Behold your house is left unto you waste. [That is, it shall be laid waste, and abide watse, which are about fourty years after was done by the Romans.]
\p
\v 39 For i say unto you, ye shall not see me from henceforth, until ye shall say, [Namely, at the last day, when he shall come in his glory to judgment, where then against their wills must acknowledge, that he is the blessed of the Lord, i.e. the true Messiah, Rev 1.7. see also, Matth 26.64.] Blessed is (or he) he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
\c 24
\s Christ foretells the laying waste of the Temple, and of the City Jerusalem, relating the troubles and signes which should happen before and about the same,1. Shews the Prophecy of Daniel concerning the same desolation, and warned his to prepare themselves fro a sudden flight, to escpe this great misery, 15. Gives warning against the seducing of false Christs and false Prophets, 23. Prophecics further of the end of the world, and of his last coming to Judgement, the glory and certainty whereof he describes: shewing the signs which should come to pass about the same, 29. but that the day and hour thereof is known to none but God alone, 36. Compare the times of this coming to the times of Noe, before the Floud, 37 Thereupon exhprts to watchfulness, as well by the similitude of an householder watching against the coming of the thief, 42. as of faithful and of a wicked servant, 45
\p
\v 1 And Jesus went out and departed from the Temple, and his Disciples came to him to shew the building of the Temple. [seeing Christ had foretold in the former Chapter, verse 38. the desolation of the City and Temple, therefore it seems that the Disciples shewed him there buildings, giving thereby to undestand, that they thought it either impossible or pity, that such a glorious building should be laid waste: the greatness, strength, and magnificence of these bulldings, see the Historian Josephus, Antiqu. lib. 15. cap. 4.]
\p
\v 2 And Jesus said unto them, see ye not all these things Verily i say unto you, Here shall not (one) stone be left upon (another) stone. [Gr. no be left stone upon stone] which shall not be broken down. [Gr. loosened]
\p
\v 3 And as he was set on the Mount of Olives, the Disciples went unto him alone, saying Tell us when shall these things be? [Namely, which thou hast said here, and at the end of the fore – going chapter, as well of the laying waste of the City, and the Temple of Jerusalem, as of thy last coming to judgment] and what (shall be) the sign of thy coming, and of the end of world?
\p
\v 4 And Jesus answering, said unto them, Look to it, that no man seduce you
\p
\v 5 For many shall come under my name [Or in, on my name, i.e. giving themselves out for the promised Messiah, like as about that time and afterwards divers did arise. See Acts 5 verse 36,37. and Joseph. Antiq.lib. 18.cap.12. and lib 20. cap. etc. and de bello Judarco, lib.2. cip.12] saying, i am the Christ, and they shall seduce many.
\p
\v 6 And ye shall hear of wars, and runors of wars, Look to it, be not affrighted: for all (those) things, must come to pass, but the end is not yet. [Namely, of all the miseries, and extreamest judgments which should come upon the Jews.]
\p
\v 7 For (one) people shall rise up against (another) people, [Gr. people against people] and (one) Kingdom against (another) kingdom: [Gr. Kingdom against Kingdom]and there shall be famines and pestilence, and carth – quakes in diver places.
\p
\v 8 But all these things (are but) a beginning of pains. [Gr. pangs, like thse of women in Travel. Of all these and miseries, see Josephus, Antiq.lib.20. and de bello Jud. lib.3. etc]
\p
\v 9 Then shall they deliver you over into affliction, and shall kill you, and ye shall be hated of all people for my names sake.
\p
\v 10 And then shall many be offended, [ That is, for fear of persecution fall away from me] and shall deliver up one another, and hate one another.
\p
\v 11 And many false Prophets shall araise, and shall seduce many.
\p
\v 12 And because the iniquity, [Gr. trangression of the law] shall be multiplyed, the love [namely, as well to the truth of the Gospel, as to their neighbour] of many shall wax cold.
\p
\v 13 But he that shall endure unto the end, he shall be save.
\p
\v 14 And this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in the whole world, [Gr. the inhabited (world) see the fulfilling hereof, Rom 10 verse 18 Col 1 verse 6.] for witness to all people: and then shall the end come [namely, of the City Jerusalem, and of the Jewish Government.]
\p
\v 15 When therefore ye shall see the abomination of desolation, [That is, the abominable destroying Army of the Romanes, as is expounded, Luke 21.20.] whereof is spoken by Daniel the Prophet, standing in the holy place, [that is, in the holy land of the Jews, round about Jerusalem] he that reads (it) lelet him observe.
\p
\v 16 Then let them that are in Judea, flee up into the mounatins. [Namely, there to hide themselves from the judgemnt.]
\p
\v 17 He that is on the house top, [The Jews were much on the top of their houses, because they were flat above. See Matth 10.27.] let him not come down to take away any thing out of his house.
\p
\v 18 18 And he that is the field, let him not return back again, to take away his cloaths. [That is, let him loose no time to flee away]
\p
\v 19 But wo to the (women) that are with child, and that gave suck in those days. [Namely,because they will be unsit to flee away speedly, being laden with their fruit or little children.]
\p
\v 20 But pray ye that your flight happen not in the Winter, nor Sabbath. [Beacuse the Winter is unsit for flight, and the Jews might not travel far on the Sabbath. see Acts 1.12. nor provide themselves of things needful for a journey]
\p
\v 21 For then shall be great tribution, such as was not from the beginning of the world, until now; nor yet ever shall be. [For as Josephus testifieth, de bello Jud lib. 4.5,6. and 17. there perished by the sord, famine, and pestilence, within Jerusalem only, eleven hundred thousand men, and above ninety seven thousand men were sold for slaves. The like desolation is not read in any Histories]
\p
\v 22 And id those days should not be shortned, no flesh should be saved: [Were it not that God had caused the plagues of those times to cease, though the Jews had deserved much heavier, there should not one of the Jewish Nation have remained] but for the elects sake [namely, which God had amongst the Jewsh people, and wound always preserve] those dys shall be shortned
\p
\v 23 Then [Namely, after the desolation of Jerusalem, till the end of the world, of which he begins to speak at the 29. verse] if any man shall say unto you, Lo here is the Christ, oe there, [Gr. here] believe it not.
\p
\v 24 For there shall false Christ, and false Prophets arise, and shall shew great signs and wonders, [As is testified of Antichrist, 2 Thess2.9. Rev 13. verse 11, &c.] so that (if were possible) they should seduce even the elect. [This is said to be impossible, not respect of the will or power of the elect in themselves: but in respect of the immutability od Gods decree concerning them, and his powerful keeping of them against seduction, according to his promises, of which he cannot repent. See John 10.28. Rom 8.29,30. 1 Pet.1.5.]
\p
\v 25 Behold, i have foretold (it) you
\p
\v 26 Therefore if they shall say unto you, Behold he is in the wilderness, go not forth: Behold (he is) in the inner – chambers, believe it not.
\p
\v 27 For like as the Llighting goeth forth from the East, [Gr. from the rising, namely, of the Sun] and shineth unto the West; [Gr. the setting] so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. [namely , with great swiftness and brightness]
\p
\v 28 For where the dead carcass shall be, there the Eagles will be gathered together, [Of this Proverb, usuall with the Hebrews, see Job 39.33. and hereby is taught , that where Christ with his death and passion is rightly preached, there the faithful will gather together; as likewise in the last Judgment they ill be gathered unto Christ, to abide always with him, 1 Thess 4.16,17. John 17.24. Some understand this Proverb of the desolation of the Jewish people, which should be understood by the dead carcass, and the Romanes by the Eagles; as the Chaldeans are, Hhabbak.1 verse 8.]
\p
\v 29 Straightway after the tribulation of those days, [Namely , which the Tyrants and Antichrist shall have brought upon the church of God] the Sun shall be darkned, and the Moon shall not give her shining, and the Stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens [that is, the powerful or strong heavens] shall be moved. [namely, like as the Sea is moved up and down.]
\p
\v 30 And then (there) shall appear in the heaven the sign of the Son of man; [that is, the sign of his glory, wherewith he shall appear in the clouds. see Mark 13 ver. 26. Luke 21.27] and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, [or lament. Gr. fro anguish strike upon the breast] and shall see the Son of man coming on the clouds of the heaven, with great power and glory.
\p
\v 31 And he shall send forth his Angels with a trumpet of great sound, [Gr. voice. Otherwise, with a trumpet and a great sound] and they shall gather together his elect out of the four winds, [that is, bring them together form all the four corneror quarters of the world; whish they shall know by their gloried bodies and otherwise] from (the one) utmost (part) of the heaven to (the other) utmost (part) of the same
\p
\v 32 Andlearn this similitude from the fig – tree; when his branchs is now tender, [or sappy, when the sap or spring comes into it] and the leaves spont forth, then ye know that the Summer id nigh.
\p
\v 33 Even so likewise ye, when ye shall see all thse things, then know that (it) is near, before the door, [or he namely Christ and his coming.]
\p
\v 34 Verily i say unto you, This generation [Namely, of the people of the Jews; or this age] shall in no wise pass, (or perish) until all these things shall be come to pass.
\p
\v 35 The heaven and the earth shall pass away [ or perish. How this shall be done , is declared, 2 Pet 3.10.] but my words hall in no wise pass away.
\p
\v 36 But of that day and hour knoweth no ma, no not the Angels of the heavens, by my Father only.
\p
\v 37 And as the days of Noe (were) so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
\p
\v 38 For as they were in the days before the floud, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, [that is, living securely and caenally without the fear of God, Jude verse 12.] until the day in which Noah went into the Ark.
\p
\v 39 And knew it not until the floudcame, and took them all away: so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
\p
\v 40 Then shall there be two in the field, the one shall be received [Namely, by God, amongst his elect] and the other [Gr. the one] shall be left. [namely, with the reprobates in everlasting damnation,]
\p
\v 41 There shall two (women) grindin in the mill, [Or grind in the mill – house, grinding and baking in those Countries used muct to be done by the women, or she – slaves, which used Querns or hand mills for this purpose] the one shall be received and theother shall be left.
\p
\v 42 Watch therefore, for ye know not in what hour your Lord shall come.
\p
\v 43 But know this, that if the Lord of the house [or father of the house] had known in what night – watch the thief would come, [that is, in what part of the night which was divied into four watchhes, see Matth 14.25.] he would have watched, and would not have let his house be digged thorow.
\p
\v 44 Therefore be ye also ready, for in what hour ye think not, shall the Son of man come.
\p
\v 45 Who is then the faithful and prudent servant, [To this servant the Apostles and Ministers od the Gospel are principally compared, who dispence the spiritual food of the soul] whom his Lord hath set over his house hold, to give them (their) meat in due season.
\p
\v 46 Blessed is that servant, whom his Lord coming shall find so doing.
\p
\v 47 Verily i say unto you, that he shall set him over all goods (or over all that he hath)
\p
\v 48 But if that evil servant should say in his heart, My Lord delayeth to come:
\p
\v 49 And should begin to smite (his) fellow – servants, [that is, to do them wrong] (or oppress them) and to eat and drink with the drunkards
\p
\v 50 The Lord of that servant shall come at the day, in which he doth not expext (him) and the hour which he knoweth not.
\p
\v 51 And shall sever him, [Otherwise, cut him in two: Some think that here is alluded to such grievous punishments, as we read of, 1 Sam 15. verse 33 and Dan 3.19. But by that which follows it seems to be understood of the separation of him from his family, to be punished afterwards] nd appoint his portion with the hypocrites. [that is, these which seem well to acquit themselves before the eyes of their Masters; but in their absence do the contrary] There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\c 25
\s By the similitude of five wise and five foolish Virgins, Christ again exhorts to watchfulness agaisnt his coming, 1 And by the similitude of the servants , which had each of them recieved their talents from the Lord, to gain therewithal, he exhorleth to a faithful emploiment of the gifts which God hhath given to every one 14. Afterwards he describes the last coming tp judgement, how he shalldistinguish his sheep from the goats, and give and execute sentence upon them both,31.
\p
\v 1 Then [Namely, when the Lord Christ shall come to Judgement; of which was spoken in the end of the former chapter] shall the Kingdom of Heaven be like to ten Virgins, which took their lamps, and went out to meet the Bridegroom. [This similitude is taken from that which was usual in the weddings of those times, which were kept by night , in which the Bridegroom with his company, was certain Virgins setched in and conducted to the Bride with burning Lamps or Torches. see likewise, Luke 12. verse 35. of the like custome. And by coming of the bridegroom is understood the coming of Christ to Judgement, verse 13. By Virgins all that bear the name of Christians. By the wise, all upright, true believers. By the foolish, all that are Christians from the teeth outwrd, and hypocrites. By the Lamps, the profession of the Christian faith: By the oil and light, the true faith, which is essectual by love. By midnight, the unexpected time of Christ coming. And by the wedding, the joys of eternal life]
\p
\v 2 And five of them were wise, [Gr. prudent] and five were foolish
\p
\v 3 They that (were) foolish taking their Lamps, took no oil with them.
\p
\v 4 But the wise took oil in their Vessels, with their Lamps,
\p
\v 5 Now while the Bridegroom tarried, they were all slumbring, and fell aslep. [Namely, as well the wise as the foolish. For even true believers do indeed sometimes slumber, but their faith and love is afterwards awake again]
\p
\v 6 And at midnight there happened a cry, Behold, the Bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him.
\p
\v 7 Then all those Virgins arose, and made ready their Lamps. [Gr. adorned]
\p
\v 8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil, for our Lamps go out.
\p
\v 9 But the wise answered, saying, (By no means) lest perhaps there be not enough for us and for you , but go rather to the seller, and buy fro your selves.
\p
\v 10 Now while they went away to buy, the Bridegroom came; and they that (were) ready, went with him into the wedding and the door was shut.
\p
\v 11 Afterwards come also theother Virgins, saying Lord, Lord, Open to us, [which seeing it will then be too late, thereby is only given to understand, that we must provided our selves betimes, John 9.4]
\p
\v 12 And he answering, said, Verily i say unto you, i know you not. [Namely, for mine. see Matthew 7.23.]
\p
\v 13 Watch therefore, for ye know not the day, nor the hourin which the Son of man shall come.
\p
\v 14 Fr (it is) like a man, who travelling out of the Land, called his servants, and delivered his goods to them. [By this similitude, we are admonished to take notice of the gift of God lends us, every one according to the measure of the same, and to bestow them as may be most for the edication of others: with the promise of a gracious reward both here and thereafter, for those that do so. see John 15.2. 1Cor 12.9,6,7.]
\p
\v 15 And to one he gave five talents , and to the other two, and to the third one, to every one according to his ability, [that is, capacity, or fitness, namely for to trade and get gain. From whence cannnot br concludede that a man hath power or fitness to himself to use the gifts of God aright. For in the Scriptures throughout, it is witnessed that all our fitness is of God. See John 15.5. 1 Cor 15 ver 10 2 Cor 3.5] and straightway took his journey.
\p
\v 16 Now hhe that had received the five talent, went and traded with same, and gained [Gr. made] other five talents.
\p
\v 17 Likewise also he that (had received) the two, he also gained other two.
\p
\v 18 But he that had received the one, went away and digged in the earth, and hid his Lords money.
\p
\v 19 And after a long time, [Gr. after much time] came the Lord of the same servants, and reckoned with them.
\p
\v 20 And he that hadd received five talents, came and brought him after five talents, saying, Lord thou givest me five talents, behold i have gained five talents besides the same [or with, by]
\p
\v 21 And his Lord said unto him, Well, [Or it is well, it goeth well, thou hast done well] thou good and faithful servant, thou wast faithful over little, i will set thee over much: Enter into joy of thy Lord. [that is, enter with the thy Lord into the place, where he hath his joy and glory. See Luke 22.30. John 17.24]
\p
\v 22 And he that had received the two talents, came also unto him and said,Lord, thou gavest me two talents, Behold, i have gained two other talents, besides the same.
\p
\v 23 His Lord said unto him, Well, thou good and faithful servant, thou wast faithful over little, i will set thee over much? Enter into the joy of thy Lord.
\p
\v 24 But he that had recieved the one talent, came also and said, Lord, i knew thee, that thou art an hard man, [or severe] reaping where thou hast not sowed, and gathering from thence (where) thou hast not strawed. [This was a Proverb, where is describes a man that most gripingly and narrowly draws all hos own advanatge.
\p
\v 25 And being afraid, i went away, and hid thy talent in the earth, Behold thou hast tha (which) is thine.
\p
\v 26 But his Lord answering, said unto him, Thou evil and slouthful servant. [That is, not the fear of my hardness, but thione own malice and flothfulness, is the cause thereof] thou knewest that i reap where i hve not sowe, and gathert from thence where i have not strawed.
\p
\v 27 Thou shouldst therefore have put [Gr. cast or laid. Namely into the Exchange – bank] my money to Exchanger, and i coming, should have taken mine own again with usury [Gr. Tokos, whereby is signified all manner of fruit or gain by the use of mony, which is taken sometimes in a good, sometimes inall sense, according as the gain is either reasonable or unreasonable. see further, Luke 19.23.]
\p
\v 28 Therefore take talent away from hhim, and give it unto him that hath the ten talents.
\p
\v 29 For every one [Gr. all] that hath [that is, that employs and well bestows the gift which he hath] (to him) shall be given, amd he shall have abundance: but from that hath not [That is, which doth not make use of his gifts, or lets them lie idle, as if he had not had them] from him shall be taken even that he hath.
\p
\v 30 And the unprofitable servant cast out into the outmost darkenss, [see Matth.8.12.] there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\p
\v 31 And when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him, then shall he sit upon thhe throne of hhis glory. [That is, upon his glorious throne , which shall be set up int the clouds. See Matth.24.30. Rev.1.7]
\p
\v 32 And before him all Nations shall be gathered, [Namely, by the Ministry of the Angels. see Matth.13. ver.41.] and he shhall separate them one from another, like as the shepard divides the sheep from the goats.
\p
\v 33 And hhe shall set the sheep on his right (hand) [or right side. so like in the following] but the goats on (hhis) left (hand)
\p
\v 34 Then shall the King [Namely, Christ, who verse 31 is called the Son of man, and now here King. because then he shall be in the full dominion of his Kingdom] say to those that (are) on his right (hand). Come ye blessed [of this b;essing, see Eph 1. verse 3,4,5.] of my Father, inherit that Kingdome which is prepared fro you [namely, of God by according to his eternal election, Eph.1.4] from the foundation of the world.
\p
\v 35 For i was hungry, and ye gave me to eat: I was thirsty, and ye gave mt to drink: I was a stranger, and ye harboured me. [Gr. led, or took me along with yo; namely, to harbour me.]
\p
\v 36 (I was) naked, and ye cloathed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: [Or to care of me] i ws in prison, and ye came unto me. [Under these related works of charity, are all other fruits of faith understood, which are here brought forth, not as meritorious causes of salvation, but as evident testimonies and signs of their faith;which for the merits of Christ, of grace, shall be rewarded, thereby to demonstrate the righteousness of his sentence in this judgement before the whole world. As appears out of the thirty fourth verse, where the first cause of their salvation is made the blessing of the Father, and salvation is called an inheritance, and this is said to be prepared or ordained for them, before the foundation of the world was laid, Ep.1.4]
\p
\v 37 The shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when we saw thee hungry, and fed (thee?) or thirsty, and gave (thee) to drink?
\p
\v 38 And when we saw we theee a stranger, and harboured (thee?) or naked, and cloathed (thee?)
\p
\v 39 And when we saw thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
\p
\v 40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily i say unto you, Forasmuch as ye have done (this) to one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done (it) unto me. [That is, i will esteem it as done to my self, Acts 9.4.]
\p
\v 41 Then shall he say also to those that (are) on the left (hand) Go away from me, ye cursed into everlasting fire, [viz. for those ypur sins, according to Gods righteous judgement being subject to the punishment of the everlasting curse] which is prepared for the Devil [So he calls the head of the wicked spirits, which are here also called his Angels, because the devil useth the same as his Messengers, as Christ doth hid good Angels, Rev.12.7.] and his Angels.
\p
\v 42 For i was hungry, ye gave me not to eat: I was thirsty, and ye gave men not to drink.
\p
\v 43 I was a stranger, and ye has harboured me not: naked, and ye cloathed me not: sick and in prison, and ye visited me not.
\p
\v 44 Then shall these also answer him, saying Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or thirsty, or stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison and did not minister unto thee?
\p
\v 45 Then shall he answer them, and say, Verily i say unto you: Forasmuch as ye have not done (this) to one of these least, [Namely, which stand here on my right hand] neither have ye done it to me.
\p
\v 46 And these shall go into everlasting, torment, [or punishment ot torment: as 1 John 4.18] but the righteous into eternal life.
\c 26
\s Christ again foretells his death,1. About whch the Ruler of the Jews take counsel,3. Is anointed by a women at Bethany, 6. Whose deed he defendeth and commends,10. Judas selleth Christ, 14. Christ cuseth the Passover to be prepared, and eats the same with his Disciples,and foretelleth the treason of Judas, 17. Afterwards institutes his supper,26. Foretells his disciples of their scattering, and Peter of his fall, 31. Enters upon his Passion in a Garden, with great anguish, and earnest prayer admonishing his Disciples, who slept, to watch and pray,36. Is betrayed by Judas with a kiss, and apprehended by the Jews, 47. Reproves Peter for cutting off the ear of the high Priest servant,51. Is brought to Ciaphas before the council,57 accused by false witness, 59. Acknowledgeth that he is the Christ, 63.Is therefore condemed as a blasphemer, and repraochfully mis – handled, 65. Peter denyeth Christ, 69 cometh to acknowledge and lament his fall,75.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these words, [Namely, hitherto related in the former chapter: so that Christ having thus far fulfilled his Prophetical Office, begins now to enter further into his Priestly Office] that he said unto his Disciples
\p
\v 2 Ye know that after two days is the Passover [Pascha is an Hebrew word signifying a passing by or passing over, from which was denominated the first of the three great yearly Feasts of the Jews, kept on the four teenth day of the first Moneth, (agreeing for the most part with our March: instituted) in remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel out of Egypt: and especially for that the destroying Angel, which killed the first born of Egyptians, passed the houses of the Israelites. see hereof Exod 12. At which time Christ would also slain; because the killing of the Paschal Lamb, was type thereof. See 1 Cor 5 ver. 7,8,] and the Son of man shall be delivered over to be crucified.
\p
\v 3 Then (there) gathered together the chief Priest and Scribes, and the Elders of the people, [Of all these at that time, consisted the high or great Council of the Jews, by which the weightiest matter were handled and transacted, whereof the highst Priests was the head and chief] in the Hall of high Priest, [or in the Court, or in the Palace] who was called Caiphas. [of this Caiphas, se also John 11 verse 49. and in Josephus, Antiq. lib. 18. cap. 3.6.]
\p
\v 4 And consulted together, to take Jesus by subtility and kill (him). [Because they durst not do it openly for fear of the people.]
\p
\v 5 But they said: Not on the Feast, [That is, let us not tarry till the Feast, but prevent the same, like as also it happened] that there be not an uproar among the people.
\p
\v 6 Now when Jesus was at Bethany, at the house of Simon the Leper. [Not that he was the a Leper; for such might not dwell in the Cities or Villages neigther might men eat or converse with them, Numbe.5 ver.2 but that either he had been seen such, or had such a sirname from his ancestors]
\p
\v 7 There came to him a woman, having an Alabaster boxe of very precious ointment, [Gr. of am heavy price, which is exprest, Mark 14..]and poured it out upon his head, as he sate at (the Table)
\p
\v 8 And his Disciple seeing (that) took it very ill, saying, Wherefore is this loss?
\p
\v 9 For this ointment might have been sold dear, [Gr.for much] and the money given to the poor.
\p
\v 10 But Jesus understanding (this), said unto the, Why trouble ye this women? For she hath wrought a good work upon me. [That is, that which she hath done unto to me is well done]
\p
\v 11 For the poor have always with you, but me ye have not always [Namely,according to my bodily precence; for according to his Godhead and grace, he always abideth with us, Matth 28.20.]
\p
\v 12 For when she pouredd [Gr. cast] this anointment on my body, she did it for (a preparation to) my bural. [Not that this woman had such intent but that Gods Providence so ordered the same, that this body should be anointed just before his death: like as the dead bodies or person of dignity, are so prepared for their burial Gen.50.2. see likewise Mark 14.8. and the Greek word also imports so much.]
\p
\v 13 Verily i say unto you, Wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached in the whole worls, (there) shall also for memorial of het he spoken of that which she hath done.
\p
\v 14 Then went one of the twelve called Judas Iscarioth to the chief Priests,
\p
\v 15 And sold, What will give ye me, and i will deliver him over unto you, [Namely, privily, without trouble, and without knowledge of thepeople] and they appointed unto him, [or promised, or weighed unto (him) like as this word is also sometimes taken; because in former times mony was used to be weighed out unto (men) Gen 23.16. 1 KiNGS 20.39.] thirty silver [Gr.silvershilings.d hhen it is thus set alone, commonly signifies a shekel, which was either of the sanctuary, in value about half a Ricks dollar, or an ordinary one, worth half so much. And thus was the price wherewith satisfaction was made for a slave which was killed by another Ox. Exod 21. verse 32. And it seems that they valued Christ at no more then a slave used to be valued, as God seems to complain hereof, Zach 11 verse 12,13. and the same is shewed in the following chapter, verse 9]
\p
\v 16 Sand from thenceforth he sought opportunity [or a sit time] that he might deliver him over
\p
\v 17 And on the first (day) of unleavened (bread), [That is, on that day, in which the Jews were begin to eat unleavened bread at eveining; and to kill the Paschal Lamb] came the Disciples to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the Passover?
\p
\v 18 And he said; Go into the City to such a one. [so we speak when we set forth a person by certain tekens, whose name we do not express, Ruth 4.1. The tokens of this man are set forth , Mark 14.13. Luke 22 verse 10.] and say unto him, the Master saith my time is near, i will keep the Passover with thee, with my Disciples.
\p
\v 19 And the Disciples did as Jesus had commanded them, and made ready the Passover. [that is, the Paschal Lamb. An improper manner of speaking, very usual in the holy Scripture, when Sacraments are spoken of.
\p
\v 20 And when it was become Evening, he state down with twelve. [Thefore Christ did eat the Passeover at the due time, on the evening of the fourteenth day, as had commanded, Exod 12. verse 6.18. Lev 23.5. But the Jews at that time, did not eat the same till the next day evening, as appears by the whole story, and especially John 18 ver. 28. Which come to pass through an old custo, wherby when the fourteenth day fell on the day before the Sabbath, they put off the same to the following sabbath, that they might no be necessitated to rest from their work two days one after the another. Therefore Christ is the true Passover, offered up for our sins on the verey day ordained by God]
\p
\v 21 And as they did eat, he said, Verily i say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
\p
\v 22 And they being grown very sad, every one of them began to say unto him, It is i, Lord?
\p
\v 23 And he answering, said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. [That is, one that daily eats with me, which is my co- - habitant, and fellow – border. See Psalm 41. verse 10 Mark 14 verse 20. John 13.18. Not that Christ just then dipped in together with him: for so the Disciples would have been able to know undoubtedly who he was.]
\p
\v 24 The Son of man goeth away indeed, s it is w buhht wo unto that manby whom the Son of man is betrayed: it were good for him, if that man had not been born. [Therfore Gods Providence doth not acquit those men that do evil]
\p
\v 25 And Judas which betrayed him, answered an said, Is it i, Rabbi? He said unto him, Thou hast said it. [This is a manner of speaking, when men will not say a thing downright, but notwithstanding do not deny it. See hereafter verse 64,65. Compare it with Marl 14.62.]
\p
\v 26 And they did eat, [That is, as after the eating of the Paschal Lamb, they sate yet at the Table] Jesus took the bread, and having blessed he brake it, [Lu.cap.22 verse 19. and Paul, 1 Cor 11.24. instead of having blessed, use the word having given thanks: like as some Greek Copies have here also. So that to bless and thank or give thanks, are taken for one and the same thing, and signifie to separate the btread, as also after wards the wine, from the common use, and by thanksgiving to God to sanctifie, or apply it to an holy use:as Gen.2.3. the seventh day is allowed and blessed by God] and gave it to the Disciples, and said, Take, eat, [namely , bread, as the thing it self sheweth , and Paul declareth, 1 Cor.10.16. ] is my body. [that is, a sign of my body, according toamsnner of speaking usual in the Sacraments: like as before the Lamb is called a Passover, verse 19. The bread, the communion of the body of Christ, 1 Cor. 10.16. and the cup thhe New Testament, 1 Cor 11.25. because thay are signs and seals of our spiritual communion with Christ, and of the New Testament, which is confirmed with his bloud]
\p
\v 27 And hhe took the cup, and having given thanks, gave (it) to them, [Namely, the cuo] saying, Drink ye all out of it.
\p
\v 28 For that is my blood, [That is, a sign of my blood as before, verse 26. the bread is called his body] the (blood) of the New Testament, which is shed from many, [that is, shall be shed very shortly: see hereof, Heb.9. 14,15,&c. where their Apostle gives a large exposition of this blood of the New Testament with an opposition of it to the blood of the New Testament] for the forgiveness of sins.
\p
\v 29 And i say unto you, that from henece forth i will not brink of the fruit of the Vine, until that day, when i shall drinkthe same new with you in the kingdom of my Father. [Some understand this of the time of fourty days after ressurection, inwhich he did eat and drink with the Disciples, Acts 10 verse 41. Others of the eternal joy everlasting life, which is every where compared to a feast, Math.8.22. Luke 22.29. Rev19.9]
\p
\v 30 And where they had an hymn. [According to the custom of the Jews, who then used to sing certain Psalms, as some concieve from the 113 unto the 119] they went out of the mount Olive.
\p
\v 31 Then said Jesus unto the, Ye shall all be offended at me this night. [Gr. in me] For there is written, i will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall he scattered
\p
\v 32 But after that i shall be risen, i will go before you towards Galilee.
\p
\v 33 But Peter answering, said unto him,Although even all should be offended at thee, i will never be offended.
\p
\v 34 And Jesus said unto him, Verily is say unto thee that in this very night, before the cork shall have crowed [that is, before the morning cometh, when the cocks commonly begin to crow the last time.] thou shalt deny me thrice.
\p
\v 35 Peter said unto him, Although i should also die with thee, yet i will in no wise deny thee. Likewise also said all the Disciples.
\p
\v 36 Then Jesus wnet with them into a place [or Village; namely, of houses and gardens, John chap 18.verse 1 faith, that is a garden, where Christ used to pray] called Gethsemane, and said to the Disciples , sit down here until i go and shall have prayed there.
\p
\v 37 And taking with him Peter, andthe two sons of Zebedee, [Namely, James and John, Mark 10. verse 35.] he began to be sad , and in great anguish [By these words is given to understand an extream grief and distress; which wrung the boudy sweat from him,Luke 22.44. and arose not so much fear and apprehension of the cruel death at hand, which even many Martyrs have ubdergone without fear; as indeed from the previous sense of the burden of the wrath of God, and the pains of Hell which he sufferd for us upon the croos, Isa 53. verse 4,5,6. Gal 3.13.]
\p
\v 38 Then said be unto them, My soul iswholly sorrowful even unto death: [Or on all sides; that is, as it were compassed about with sorrow] carry ye here and eatch with me.
\p
\v 39 And being past little, he fell upon his face? praying, and saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup [That is, this bitter passion. See Matth 20.22] pass from me, [or pass by, go away] yet not as i will, but as thou (wilt). [i.e not accroding to the inclination which is implanted in human nature to avoid its own destruction, which therefore i submit to thy will in all things. And therefore this inclination of Christ was without sin]
\p
\v 40 And he came to the Disciples and found them sleeping, and said unto Peter, can ye not then [GR.so] watch with me one hour?
\p
\v 41 Watch and pray, that ye come not into temptation; The Spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh ie weak. [That is, your will indeed is good, but is hindred by your natural frailty]
\p
\v 42 Again, the second time going away, he prayed, saying, my Father, if this cup may not pass from me, except i drink it, thy will be done.
\p
\v 43 And coming (to the) he found them asleep again: For eyes were grown heavy. [Namely, with drouziness, through grief and watching.]
\p
\v 44 And leaving them,he went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.
\p
\v 45 Then come the Disciples, and said unto them, sleep on (now), and take your rest: [This he saith by way of reproof, like as men oftentimes seem permit one thing at lenght when it is too late and past remedy, from which they disswaded him in vain] Behold, the hour is come nigh, and the Son of man id delievered over into the hands of sinners.
\p
\v 46 Arise, let us go, behold, he is at hand that betrayeth me.
\p
\v 47 And while he spake, behold, Judas on the twelve came, and with hin a great multitude, [Namely, a whole band of solders, with the servants of the chief Priests and Scribes. See John 18.3. ] with swords and staves,(sent) from the chief Priests, an Elders of the people.
\p
\v 48 And he that betrayed him, had given them a token, saying, He whom i shall kiss, the same is he, lay hold on him.
\p
\v 49 And straightway coming to Jesus, he said, Hail Rabbi, and he kissed him.
\p
\v 50 But Jesus said unto him, Friend, [Gr. companion] Wherefore are thou here? Then came thye near, and laid hands on Jesus, and tool him.
\p
\v 51 And behold, one of those which were with Jesus, [Namely Peter, John 18.10] stretching forth the hand, drew his sword, and striking the servant of thehigh Priest, cut off his ear.[ Gr. took away his ear. [Gr. took away his ear]
\p
\v 52 Then Jesus said unto him, Turn thy sword again into its place: For all that take the sword [ Namely without a lawful call, or order for it] shall perish by the sword.[Namely, by order and command of the Magistrate,to whom the sword is given, for this end, punish murdererd with death, Genesis 9. verse 6. Rom.13.4]
\p
\v 53 Or thinkest thou that cannot now pray my Father, and he shall set by me [or assist me with] more then twelve Legions of Angels. [Alegion with the Romanes was Regiment of souldiers constisting of some thousands, sometimes four, sometimes six, and sometimes more]
\p
\v 54 How then should the scriptures be filfilled, (which say) that it must so come to pass?
\p
\v 55 At the same hour spake Jesus to the companies; Ye are gone out as against a murderer, [or high – way – robber] with swords and staves for take me: i sate daily with you, teaching in the Temple, and ye laid not hold on me.
\p
\v 56 But all is done, that the Scriptures of the Prophet might be fulfulled. Theb all the Disciples fles, forsaking him.
\p
\v 57 Now they had taken Jesus, led (him) away to Caiphas the high Priest, [Namely, after that they had first brought him Annas, which was Caiaphas father in law, John 18.13.] where the Scribes and Elders were assembled
\p
\v 58 And Peter followed him from afar, even unto the high Priest Hall, [or even into the Place] and being gone in , be sate with the servant to see the end.
\p
\v 59 And the chief Priests, and Elders , and all the great Council, sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death; and found none. [Namely, that with any shew could be produced to condemn him thereupon,]
\p
\v 60 And although there came many false witnesses, (yet) found they none.
\p
\v 61 But al last there came two false witnesses, and said, This (fellow) said, i can break down the Temple of God, and build up the same in three days. [This was a perverting of the words of Christ John 2.19 For Christ said unto there, i can break down the Temple, etc. but break ye down the Temple, etc. understandingg it of the Temple of his body]
\p
\v 62 And the Priest arising, said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? What doe these witness against thee?
\p
\v 63 But Jesus held his peice [Thereby to give to understand that this matter was so groundless, that it was not worthy to be answered] And the high Priest answering, said unto him, i adjure thee living God, that thou tell us, whether thou art the Christ the Son of God?
\p
\v 64 Jesus said unto him, Thou hast said it [see before verse 25] But i say unto you, from henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right (hand) of the power (of God), and coming on the clouds of Heaven. [That is, ye shall then fine indeed that i am the Son of God, especially when thou must appear before me to be judged.]
\p
\v 65 Then the high Priest rent his cloaths, [This the Jews used to do when they would shew an extream grief, or displeasure on certain occassions; as hearing of blasphemy, &c. see 2 Kings 19 verse 1.] saying, he hath blasphemed (God), what need have we yet of witness? behold, now ye have hheard his blaspheming (of God)
\p
\v 66 What think ye? And they answering, said, He is gulty of death.
\p
\v 67 Then they spit in his face, and smote him with fists.
\p
\v 68 And others gave him blows on the cheeks, [Otherswise, smote him sticks or rods] saying, Prophesie unro us, O Christ, who it is that smote thee?
\p
\v 69 And Peter sate without in the Hall, [Namely, without the place where the Jewish Council was assembled, before the Christ stood, as appers by verse 71.75.] and a maid – servant come to him, saying, Thou wast also with Jesus the Galileen. [So he is here called, because he was brought in Nazareth, which was a City of Galilee. see verse 71 and Matth 2.23.]
\p
\v 70 But he denyed it before (them) all, saying, i know not what thou sayeth
\p
\v 71 And as he went out into the Parch, [or Pertal, fore – house] another (maid – servant) saw him, and said to those that (were) there, This (fellow) was also with Jesus the Nazarite.
\p
\v 72 And he denyed it again with an oath, (saying) i know not the man.
\p
\v 73 And a little after, they that stood there coming to (him) said unto Peter; Truly, thou art likewise of them; for thy speech also maketh thee manifest. [Namely, thou art a Ggalileean, like as Mark chap 14.70. and Luke chap 22.59. de express.]
\p
\v 74 Then begin to curse (himself) [that is, wishing the curse or vengeance of God upon himself, if he knew him] and to swear, i dot know the man.
\p
\v 75 And presently the cock crew: and Peter remembred the word of Jesus, [Namely, after that Christ had looked him] see Luke 22.61.] who had said unto him, Before the cock shall crowed, thou shalt deny me thrice. And giving forth, he wept bitterly.
\c 27
\s Christ is by the Jews delivered into the hands of Pilate,1. Judas repenting cast the money into the Temple, and strangles himself,3. With which money a potter field is bought, as was foretold,6. Pilate examines Christ about the accusation brought against him, 11, is warned by his wife, 19. declares Christ innocence, and endevours, by exposing of Barabbas, to release him, but in vain,20. washed his hands, and upon the Jews pressing of him, gives him over to the souldiers to be crucified, 24. who reproachfully mis – use him, and lead his away to be cruciefied, 27 Simon of Cyrene is forced to help him bear his cross, 32. Christ is crucified, 35 and with him two murderers, 38 he is reproached and mocked by those that pass by, 39. Darkeness cometh upon the earth, and Christ hath gall given him to drink, cries out in his extreamest distress unto his Father, and give up the ghost, 45 Divers wonders happen about his death, whereby the Captain acknowledgeth that he is the Son of God, 51. he is buried by Joseph of Arimathes, an at the request of the chief Priests, a guard is set upon his grave,57.
\p
\v 1 Now when the morning was come, all the chief Priests, and Eldres of the people, took counsil together against Jesus, that they might put him to death.
\p
\v 2 And having bound him, they led him (away) and gave him over to Pontius Pilate the Governor, [Namely, of the Roman Empourour Tiberius, over to the land of Judah, Luke 3.1. for the jews had no power lest them to punish any man with death, without the foregoing consent of the Roman Governours, as they themselves testifie, John 18.31.]
\p
\v 3 Then Judas which had betrayed him, seeing that he was condemned, repented, [This was no true repentance, such as Peter had, seeing it was not accompanied with amendment of life,nor with faith and confiedence of forgiveness of his sins. Paul calls such a repentance as Judas had, a sorrow of the world which worketh death, 2 Cor 7.10.] and brought again [Gr. turned again; that is, turned out again] the thirty silver (pence) to the chief Priest and Elders
\p
\v 4 Saying i have sinned, betraying the innocent bloud. But they said, What is (that) to us? Thou mayest look to it.
\p
\v 5 And when he had thrown (down) the silver (pence) in the Temple, he departed, and going away strangled (himself). [see hereof more at large, Acts 1. 18]
\p
\v 6 And the chief Priets taking the silver (pence) said, It is not lawful to put the same into the offering – chest , [In the Greek Text the syriack word Corbanan is kept, which signifies a gift or offering, and so they called the treasury or mony – chest, in which money given or consecrated to the service of God was kept. see 2 Kings 12 verse 9. This, Mark 12.41. and Luke 21. 1. is called Gazaphylacium] seeing it is a price of bload [that is, for which Christ was bought but them to put him to death. It seems that these hypocrites have respect to the place, Deut 23. verse 18.]
\p
\v 7 And being taken councel together, they bought therewith the potters field fro burying – place fro straingers [That is, coming out strange Countries,and being strangers to the Jews Religion, with whom it seems that the Jews have communion, no not after their death]
\p
\v 8 Therefore is that field called the field of bloud, even unto this day. [Of this field, see Acts 1.19]
\p
\v 9 Then (there) as fulfilled that which is spoken by the Prophet Jeremy, [This palce is not found in Jeremy, but in Zachary. chap 11 verse 13. and thherefore some ancuent Teachers think that here was no name of the Prophet exprest by Matthew himself, as he is wont also elsewhere to omit it, and as likewise this name is not extant in the Syriack Translation, which is very ancientt, and in some others: and that the name of Jeremy should by some of the Transcribers, although ignorance, (because of the likeness of the letters i and s they are written in short) be inserted out of the margine of the Text. But others think that Zachary was also named Jeremy, as among the Israelites it was very usual to have two names, especially when they signified almost one kind of thing ] Saying , And they took the thirty silver (pence), the value of him that was valued by the children of Israel, whom they did value. [Oth translate it, the value of him that was valued, which some of the children of Israel did value. Zachary chapter 11 verse 13. brings in Christ himself, as speaking in his own person, but Matthew regarding more the sense then the words of the Prophet, speaks of Christ in the the third person, to shew that this prophecy was here fulfilled in him]
\p
\v 10 And gave the same for the potters field, according to that with the Lord commaned me. [These words indeed are not in the Prophet, but the sense of them is]
\p
\v 11 And Jesus stood before the Governour, and the Governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? [Namely, whom the Jews expect for their Messias and Deliverer.] And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest it. [See before, chap 26 verse 25,64. and John 18.37.]
\p
\v 12 And when he was accused of the chief Priest and Eldres, he answered nothing.
\p
\v 13 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many (things) they witness against thee? [These things are exprest, Luke 23.2.]
\p
\v 14 But he answered him not to any one word, [Partly, because the accusation were manifest lies, partly, because he would be condemned for us, being innocent. And so was fulfilled that which was foretold of him, Isa.53.7.] so that the Governour marvelled greatly.
\p
\v 15 And at the Feast [Namely, of the Passover, Job 18.39] the Governour was wont to release to the people, [Gr. to the multitude] one prisoner, whom they would.
\p
\v 16 And they had then well known prisoner, [That is, a famous and eminet (one) whose person and ill feats were notorious. For he was put in prison for murder and sedition, Mark 15.7. Luke 23.19., John 18.40] called Barabbas.
\p
\v 17 Thererfore when they were gathered together, Pilate, said unto them, Whom will ye that i shall release unto you, Barabbus, or Jesus which is called Christ?
\p
\v 18 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him over.
\p
\v 19 And when he sate upone the judgement seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have nothing to do (i pray)with that righteous (man) for i have suffered muct to day in a dream for his sake.
\p
\v 20 But the chief Priest and the Elders perswaded the multitudes, [or moved them thereunto by counseling] that they should desire Barabbas, and put Jesus to death.
\p
\v 21 And the Governour answering, said unto them, Which of these two will ye that i shall release unto you? and they said Barabbas.
\p
\v 22 Pilate said unto them, What shall i do then (with) Jesus, who is called Christ? They all said unto him, Let him be crucified
\p
\v 23 But the Governour said, What evil then hath he done? And they cryed the more, saying, Let him be crucified.
\p
\v 24 Now when Pilate saw that he advanced nothing, but much rather (that there) was an uproar made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, i am innocent of the bloud of this righteous (man): [That is, of his death; whereof notwithstanding he was not wholly innocent, seeing he might not for to please others put an innocent person to death: as the Governor Festus himself, Acts 25.16.] ye may look to it.
\p
\v 25 And all the people answering, said, His bloud (come) upon us, and upon our children. [That is, if this bloud be innocently shed, the judgment or vengeance of God for it come upon us and posterity. Which likewise shortly after was fulfilled by the Romans, and is fulfilling yet, Matth 24.21. The like phrase, see Lev.20.9. 2 Sam.1.16]
\p
\v 26 Then released he Barabbas unto them, but having scourged Jesus [The Romans had indeed the custom, that they caused those which were condemned to death, openly to be scourged first: but it appears out John19.1. that Pilate did this, because he hoped to satisfie the Jews with this lesser punishment, and to move them to compassion, that he might release hhim] gave him over to be crucified.
\p
\v 27 Then the soldiers of the Governour took Jesus with them into the judgement – Hall, and gathered upon him whole band.
\p
\v 28 And when they had unrayed him, [Namely, of his upper garment] they put a a purple colour cloak about him. [ This was a certain sot of costly purple colour, like as the other Evangelists call it; Or of scarler, which was worn only by the Kings and great ones, Dan 5.7. And so these made a nock of the Kingly office of Christ, For which purpose served also the crown of thorns, and the reed instead of a scepter, and the following mockery.]
\p
\v 29 And having platted a crown of thorns, they set (the same) upon his head, and a reed in his right (hand) ; and falling on their knees before him, they mocked him, saying, Hail, thy King of Jews
\p
\v 30 And having spit upon him, thet took the reed and smote upon his head.
\p
\v 31 And when they had mocked him, they took the cloak off from him, and put his (own) garments on him, [Namely, his upper garments which they had stripped off] and led him away to crucifie him.
\p
\v 32 And going out they found a man of Cyrene, by name Simon, [see more largely of this Simon, Mark 15 verse 21] this (man) they forced [see of this word, Matthh 5.41] that he should bear his croos, [Gr. should take up; namely, to carry the same after Christ, Luke 23.26. It was usual that those which should be crucified, must bear their cross themselves to the place of execution. But seeing Christ was very much weakned in his body by the former ill handling, therefore they joyned this man unto him.]
\p
\v 33 And being come to the place called Golgotha, which is to say , skull – place, [Or place of the skull, or of the brain – pain, which place seems to be so called, because justice used to be done there, by reasoan whereof many dead skulls of offendors were found there. Or as some think, because that Hill had the form or shape of a brainpan.]
\p
\v 34 They gave him to drink Vinegar mingled with gall pMark, chap 15. verse 23. faith, wine mingled with myrrhe, which drink was used to be given to those that were condemned, that they might forget their pain, to which the souldiers put Vinegar and gall; herein also to show their maliciousness towards him.] and when he had tasted (it), he would not drink.
\p
\v 35 Now when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots: that that might be fulfilled which is said by the Prophet, they parted my garments among them; and cast lots upon my raiment. [Because his inner coat was without seeam, as may be seen, John 19.23.]
\p
\v 36 And sitting down, they watched him there.
\p
\v 37 And they set over his head his accusation written, [Or his offence; Others his cause; namely whereof he was accused, and for which hhe was condemned] THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF JEWS.
\p
\v 38 Then (there) were two murderers crucified with him, one at the right, and one at the left (side)
\p
\v 39 And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads. [In token of compempt, and that they liked it well, (or wished him no better) see Psalm 22.8. Lament.2.15]
\p
\v 40 And saying, Thou that breakest down the Temple, and buildest (it) up in three days, deliver they self. If thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross.
\p
\v 41 And like manner also the cheif Priest, with the Scribes, and Eldres, and Pharisees, mocking (him) said,
\p
\v 42 He deleivered others, he cannot deleiver himself. [Or, can he not deleiver himself?] If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.
\p
\v 43 He trusted in God, let him now deleiver him,if he willeth him (well), [That is, if he have delight in him] For he said, i am the Son of God.
\p
\v 44 And with the same did the murderers also which were crucified with him upbraid him. [Properly it was done but one of the murderers, as Luke testified, chap 23. verse 39. but this is spoken thus in common to shew that Christ was mocked of all sorts of men, even of the murderers themselves. Except we should say, (as some of the ancient Teachers are of opinoin) that at first both should have received him, and afterwards on of them, seeing the miracles which came to passe, ws converted]
\p
\v 45 And from the sixth hour , [That is, from about noon, till about three a clock in the afternoon, according to our account. see Matth 20.3. John 11.9 see further, Mark 15.25. John 19.14. ] there was darkness [This was no ordinary Eclipse of the Sun, seeing the Passover waskept at the full Moon, when the Moon stands right opposite the Sun on the other side of theHeaven, and for this cause cannot hinder the light of the Sun: but a supernatural work of God, coming to pass by miracles, like as the darkeness in Egypt, Exod 10.22.] over the whole earth, [Some understand hereby the land of the jews only. Others thhe whole Globe of the Earth] until the night hour.
\p
\v 46 And about the night hour Jesus cryed with great voice, saying, Eli ELI LAMA SABACTHANI, [These words are taken out of Psalm 22.2.] thhat is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? [Namely, under the burden of thy terrible wrath against thhe sins of mankind, without suffering me to the enjoy the sense of thy savour and help, Gal 3.13. But these are no words of despair, seeing hhe perfectly trusted in him nor withstanding, as appears by the words, My God. see likewise here, Heb 5.7.]
\p
\v 47 And some of those that stood there, hearing (this), said, This (man) calleth Elias. [This they said, mocking him, because the words Eli and Elias come come pretty near one another.
\p
\v 48 And straightway one of them running (to him) took a spunge, and having filled (it) with Vinegar, stuck it on a reed, [Gr. put it about a reed. This he did, because Christ had said, i thirst , as John chap.19. verse 28 witness] and gave him to drink
\p
\v 49 But the others said, stay, let us see whether Elias will come to deliver him.
\p
\v 50 And Jesus again cryed with a great voice, gave (up) the ghost [Gr. let go (or dimist) the ghost, i.e. his soul, John 10.18.]
\p
\v 51 And behold the vail of the Temple [This was a certain Tapistry, or embroidered cloth, which hun before the Holy of Holies; and the parted the same from the holy place, or foremost part of the Temple. What this signified is declared, Heb.10.20.] rent in twain, from the top to the bottome: and the Earth quarked, and the rocks rent.
\p
\v 52 And the graves were opened, and many bodies of saints, which were faln asleep, were raised up.
\p
\v 53 And being gone forth out of the graves after his resurrection, they come into the holy City, [Namely, Jerusalem. see Matth.4.5.] and appeared unto many.
\p
\v 54 And the Centurion and those that kept Jesus with him, seeing the Earthquake and the things which had happened, were sore afraid, saying Truly, this was the Son of God.
\p
\v 55 There were many women looking on from afar, whhich had followed Jesus from Galilee to minister unto him. [Gr. ministring unto him; namely, in his life, of their goods, Luke 8.3.]
\p
\v 56 Among wich was Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James and Moses, [See of her, Matth 13.55.] the mother of sons of Zebedee. [see also, of her Matth 20.20.]
\p
\v 57 And when it was become evening, [That is, late of the day, before the sun was gone down. For with the going down of the Sun the Sabbath begun] there came a rich man of Arimathea, [namely by birth, this was a city in the land of Judea, Luke 23.51] by name Joseph, who also himself was a desciple of Jesus.
\p
\v 58 This (men) came to Pilate, and desired the body of Jesus . Then Pilate commanded that the body should be given (him)
\p
\v 59 And Joseph taking the body, wrapped the same in clean fine linnen. [Which he had bought new for that purpose, Mark 15.46.]
\p
\v 60 And laid it in his (own0 new grave, [In the which yet no man before was laid, Luke 23. verse 53. which by Gods disposing came to pass, that men might not say or think that any one else was arisen again] which he had hewn out of a rock: and having rolled a great stone (against) the door of the grave, he went away.
\p
\v 61 And there was Mary Magdalen, and the other Mary, [Namely, named and described before verse 56.] sitting over against the grave.
\p
\v 62 Now the next day, which is after the Preparation, [That is, on their own Pascha – day, or, day of the Passover, which then was also the Sabbath – day] the chief Priest and the Pharisees gathered unto Pilate .
\p
\v 63 Saying, sir , We remember that this Seducer being yet alive, [So do these ungodly men slander Christ yet after his death] said, After three days i will arise again. [Gr. i arise]
\p
\v 64 Command therefore that the grave be kept safe (or safe – guarded) until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come night and day, and steal him, and say to the people, he is risen from the dead: and (so) the last errour (or seduction) be worse then the first.
\p
\v 65 And Pilate said unto them, Ye have a Guard, [Which were souldiers, that were set to keep and watch the Temple without; which had their watch- place in the Tower Antonia. see Joseph Antiqu.lib, 18.cap.6. Go your way, Make it sure, as ye know (or understand) it
\p
\v 66 And they going away, secured the grave with the Guard, having sealed the stone, [that no man should be so bold, as to open the grave, without their knowledge, as Dan 6.q7. which like wise came to pass by Gods disposing, to make Christ resurrection so much the more certain and glorious.]
\c 28
\s The women come to Christs grave, 1 and by an Angel, who had rolled away the stone, they are informed of his resurrection,2 And go to tell the same to the Disciples, 7. Christ meets themly the way.9. The Guard bring the same tidings to the Chief Priest, but suffer themselves to be corrupted with money, saying, that he was stoln out of the grave,11. Christ manifests himself to his Disciples in Galilee,16. And gives them in charge to preach and baptise among all Nations, 19. and promiseth them his assistance, 20.
\p
\v 1 And late (after) the Sabbath, [Gr. late of the sabbaths; that is, as is expounded, Mark 16.1. when the Sabbath – day was past; for by the word Sabbath in the plural number, the Sabbath – day or Seventh day also understood, Matth 12.1. Acts 13 ver. 14] as it began to down towards the first (day) [Gr. one, that is, the first, as is declared, Mark 16.9.] of the week, [Gr. ofthe sabbaths, which word is also sometimes taken fro the whole week , Mark 16.9. John 20.1. 1 Cor.16.2.] (there) came Mary Magdalen, and the other Mary, [with which two there yet some others, named, Mark 16.1. Luke 24.10.] to view the grave [Having with them spices, Luke 24.1. to anoint the body of Christ, Mark 16.1]
\p
\v 2 And behold there happened a great Earth – quake: for an Angel of the Lord desceding out of Heaven, [Namely, in the shape of a young stone from the door, not able by his divine power to do this himself, but to shew the truth of his humane nature, even after his resurrection, as is to be seen also, John 11 verse 39 41] and sate upon the same.
\p
\v 3 Ad his shape [that is, face] was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow.
\p
\v 4 And for fear of him the Guard were very much affrighted, [Gr. shaking, trembling]and became as dead (me)
\p
\v 5 But the Angel answering, said unto the women, Fear not ye: for i know that ye seek Jesus which was crucified.
\p
\v 6 He is not here, for he risen, according as he said [As is to be seen, Matth 26.32] Come hither, see the place where the Lord lay. [that s, the Lord dead body, which even after death remained united to the divine nature, as also the soul did in Heaven
\p
\v 7 And go hastily and tell hhis disciples, that he is risen from the dead: and behold he goeth before you towards Galilee, there shall ye see him; Behold i have told you.
\p
\v 8 And going forth hastily from the grave with fear and great joy, [The fear was out of human infirmity, because they saw the glory of the Angel: and the joy from the joyful message of Christ Resurrection] they ran to tell (the same) to his disciples.
\p
\v 9 And as they went to tell his disciples, Behold, Jesus met them, saying, Hail unto you: and they coming to (him) laid hold on his feet, and worshipped him, [That is, fell down at his feet, embracing the same in token of love and reverence, as may be seen, 2 Kings 4.27. Luke 7. 38.]
\p
\v 10 Then said Jesus unto them, Fear not, go your way, tell my brethren, [so he calls his Disciples for their comfort, to shew thhat although they had forsaken him, yet notwithstanding his love to them caused not, nor was diminished. See John 20 17] that they go towards Galilee, and there they shall see me. [There Christ intended chicfly to manifest himself, because that there he had the most disciples, and there it was safest for them]
\p
\v 11 And as they were going, behold, some of the Guard came into the City, and told the chief Priests the things which had happened.[Namely, concerning teh resurrection of Christ.]
\p
\v 12 And they being assembled with the Elders, and having taken counsel together, they gave the souldiers much money, [Gr. money enough; or silverlings enough; i.e. silver pence]
\p
\v 13 And said, say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him while we slept.
\p
\v 14 And if this come to be heard by the Governour, we will pacufic him, [Or bear him in hand thus, perswade him, i.e. by reasoan make him believe it] and make you tyo be without care, (or, rid you of care)
\p
\v 15 And they having taken the money, did as they were taught. And this word [Namely, that the Disciples had taken away Christ body by night] is spread abroad among the Jews, untill this day.
\p
\v 16 And the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, [For the twelfth, namely, Judas, was saln off from them] towards the mountain, where Jesus had appointed them. [Gr. had command, or ordained them, namely, for to come to him there.]
\p
\v 17 And when they saw him, they worshipped him; but some doubted. [See hereof moe at large, Luke 2.38,41]
\p
\v 18 And Jesus coming to them, spake unto them, saying, unto me all power is given in Heaven, and on earth. [That is, all authority, and faculty, or ability, as to the Head of the Church, together, govern, and defend the same throughout the whole world].
\p
\v 19 Go ye therefore, instruct all the Nations, [Or make disciples among all Nations, as this word is also taken, Act 14 verse 21. see also,Mark 16 verse 15] baptising the same, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and the holy Ghost, [i.e. that say so by Gods command, they may be hallowed and consecrated as children of and in covenant with the true God, Father, Son, and holy Ghost, and consequently obliged to his service and obedience. See 1 Cor 1 verse 15] teaching them to observe all things i have commanded you.
\p
\v 20 And behold i am with you [Namely, with you my disciples, and all your successors in my Church: and that according to my Godhead, Majesty, Grace and Spirit. See Matth 26.11.] all the days unto the end of the world. Amen. [what this word signifies, see Mat 6.13. 1 Cor 14.16. 2 Cor 1.20. and it is here added to the end of this Gospel, as also to most all the stability and assurance of that which is contained in the same. See John 21 verse 24
