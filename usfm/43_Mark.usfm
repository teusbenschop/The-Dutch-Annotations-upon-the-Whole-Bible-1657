\mt2 THE HOLY GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE DESCRIPTION OF
\mt MARK
\p This Mark is thought to have been the same of whom we read Acts 12 verse 12, 25 and chapter 15 verse 36, 39. Nephew to Barnabas, Colossians 4 verse 10 .in whole mothers house the apostles assembled, Acts 12.12 a companion of Paul and Barnabas Acts 12.25 for whose sake there arose a sharp contention between Paul and Barnabas Acts 15 verse 37, 39 who yet afterwards came again to Paul as may be collected out of Colossians 4.102Tim 4.11 Philemon verse24and was also a faithful disciple of the Apostle Peter who calls his son 1 Peter 5.13 although some think that these were two several persons and that this gospel was written by him whom Peter calls his son. The ancient teachers witness that afterwards he taught the gospel in the school at Alexandra in Egypt see Euseh Histor Eccles.lib 2 chapter 15 Hieron Prefat in Marc.
\s THE ARGUMENT OF THIS BOOK.
\p The argument of this book or of the gospel is the same with the gospel of Matthew the which he seems to epitomize or abbreviate. He described therefore how the Lord Jesus Christ administered his office here upon earth. First how he administered his prophetical office having therein John the Baptist for a forerunner to prepare the way for him by whom he baptized. And how after that he had overcome the temptations of Satan he began to preach the gospel and how he four disciples cast out an unclean spirit healeth Peters mother in law for a fever and many others of their diseases cleanseth a Leper chapter 1 that he healeth one sick of the palsie calleth Matthew to be an Apostle defends his disciples that they did not fast and had plucked ears of corn on the Sabbath chapter 2. how he cured one that had a withered hand that a great multitude followed him that he called the twelve to be the Apostles defends the truth of his miracles against the blasphemy of his enemies teacheth who are his friends chapter 3. that by the similitude of the seed he teacheth how the word of God is to be heard fruitful, and preached publicly and how it increaseth little and little like a seed that grows up and like a mustard seed ,that he stilleth the tempest chapter 4 cast out a Legion of devils raiseth up Jairos daughter from the dead and cureth a woman of a bloody issue chapter 5.that he teacheth at Nazareth and sends out his Apostle to preach the gospel . What opinion Herod he that beheaded John had of Christ: how he feedeth five thousand men with five loaves and two fishes goeth on the water and cometh to his disciples and healeth many sick chapter 6 how he reproveth the Pharisees that they made the law of God of non effect by their institutions and teacheth what defiles the man : cast the devil out of the daughter of Canaanitish woman healeth one deaf and dumb chapter 7 that he again feeds four thousand with seven loaves and a few fishes refuseth to give the Pharisees a sign admonisheth his disciples to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of Herod restores a blind man to sight foretells his sufferings and exhorts his disciples to patience chapter 8 how he shews his glory upon the mount before three disciples and instruct them concerning the coming of Elias cast out a deaf and dumb spirit again foretells his sufferings and exhorts his disciples to humility in doing good and avoiding of offences chapter 9. disputes with the Pharisees concerning divorce blesseth the little children gives answer to one that fought salvation by his own righteousness shewing what he should do then teacheth what hinderance riches are to salvation promiseth eternal life to those which shall have forsaken the same for his sake once more foretells his suffering rejects the request of the sons of Zebedee exhorts his disciples to humility restore blind Bartimeus of his sight chapter 10 how he makes his royal entrance into Jerusalem curseth a fig-tree purgeth the temple of the buyers and sellers and defendeth his action exhorts his disciples to faith and to forgive one another chapter 11 shews the Jews the ingratitude of husbandmen which beat and killed the servant and also the son of the law of the vineyard teacheth that we must pay tribute to Cesar : and that we shall not marry after the resurrection teacheth which is the greatest commandment that he is not only the son but also the Lord of David exhorts to flee the manner of Pharisees commends the small alms of a poor widow chapter 12 foretells the desolation of the temple and the miseries which should proceed the same and the grievousness of them : foretells also his coming to judgment and that he time is unknown and exhorts all to watch and pray chapter 13 how the rulers of the Jews take counsel of him to apprehend him with whom Judas agrees for to deliver him over .how he is anointed keeps the Passover with the disciples to whom he discovers the traitor keeps the holy supper with them foretells his suffering death and resurrection also the flight of the disciples and Peters denial enters upon his suffering into the garden with very great distress and earnest prayer is betrayed taken lead to the high priest examined charged by false witnesses and condemned to death how Peter denies him three times chapter 14 how he is delivered over the Pilate the governors who examines him and ballanceth with Barabbas for to release him and finally suffers him to be scourged and crucified how he bears his cross and is nailed hereto together with two murderers is mocked on the cross and dieth and is buried by Joseph of Arimathea with the consent of Pilate chapter 15 how on the third day early in the morning he arose from the dead and both by an Angel and by his appearing assured certain godly women and his disciples thereof and having given command to his Apostles to preach the gospel throughout the whole world with promise of the gift to work miracles ascended into heaven and fate at the right hand of God how the Apostles entered upon their office and Christ fulfilled his promise chapter 16.
\c 1
\s The preaching of the gospel beginneth with the ministry of John who preacheth and baptized in the wilderness, being much followed 1.Christ is baptized by him and witnessed from heaven to be the beloved Son of God 9. is tempted in the wilderness 12.preacheth in Galilee 14.and calleth Simon and Andrew 16. As also James and John 19. teacheth his Capernaum 21. casteth out an unclean spirit 23.healeth Peters mother-in-law of fever 29 and all manner of sick and possessed persons 32. Departs into a solitary place to pray 35. goeth from thence to preach in the next cities 38. cleanseth a Leper whom he commands to hold his peace and to shew himself to the priest 40.
\p
\v 1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ the son of God [ Mark begins his gospel where Malachi endeth his prophecy namely for the coming of Jesus Christ forerunner so as it were to conjoin the old and the new testament to one another for all the prophets prophesied until John Matthew 11.13 who was the first preacher of the gospel in the new testament.]
\p
\v 2 . As is written in the prophets [Namely Malachi 3.1 and Esa 40.3 for both these prophets are here joined together.] behold I send mine Angels [or messenger for the Greek word Angelos signified a messenger Luke 7 verse 24 and is commonly ascribed to the Angels of Heaven. But sometimes also to the ministers of the church because they are sent forth from God as messengers to hold forth Gods will and commandment unto man Malachi 2verse 7 Revelations 2.1.8] before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee [here God the father speaks to his son and in Malachi the son himself speak to the church and therefore faith before my face that is before my coming which shall presently follow thereupon.]
\p
\v 3 . The voice of the one crying in the wilderness prepares ye the way of the Lord make his paths straight or plain.]
\p
\v 4 . John was baptized in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins were forgiven them by God for Christ sake Acts 19.4 Romans 4.11.
\p
\v 5 . And all the land of Judea went out to him and those of Jerusalem and were all baptized of him in the river Jordan confessing their sins.
\p
\v 6 . And John was clothed with camels hair [the exposition of his history of John see the annotate on the third chapter of Matthew were it is related almost in the same words] and with leathern girdle about his lions and did his grasshoppers and wild honey .[ That is which is found in he wild woods or fields ]
\p
\v 7 . And he preached saying after me there cometh he that is stronger then I for whom I am not worthy [Gr fit or sufficient] stooping down to unloose the latchet of his shoes.
\p
\v 8 . I indeed have baptized with water but he shall baptize ye with the holy ghost.
\p
\v 9 . And it came to pass those days that Jesus came from Nazareth situate in Galilee [namely where he was brought up and had dwelt until that time see Luke 2.51and 4.16] and was baptized of John in the Jordan.
\p
\v 10 . And straightway as he came up out of the water he [namely John the Baptist ] saw the heavens open [Gr rent or cloven ] and the spirit like a dove descended upon him [namely upon Jesus see John 1.32,3.]
\p
\v 11 . And there happened a voice out of the heavens thou art my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.
\p
\v 12 And immediately the Spirit [namely the Holy Ghost. See Luke 4.7.] drive him out into the wilderness.
\p
\v 13 And he was there in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan [especially after that he had fasted forty days and forty nights see Matthew 4.2] and was with the wild beasts and the Angels saved him.
\p
\v 14 . And after that John was delivered over [namely into prison whereof see more largely Matthew 14.3] Jesus came into Galilee preaching the gospel of God [although he had begun to preach before John 3.4 yet after John s imprisonment he entered solemnly and perfectly upon his office of preaching attended with his apostle .]
\p
\v 15 . And saying the time is fulfilled [namely which was determined by God and foretold by prophets Galatians 4.4] the kingdom of God come nigh repent ye and believe in the gospel.
\p
\v 16 . And walking by the sea of Galilee he saw Simon [whom by Christ was surnamed Peter see Matthew4.18] and Andrew his brother casting their net into the sea for they were fishers.
\p
\v 17 . And Jesus said unto them follow after me and I shall make ye fishers of men [the preaching of gospel is compared to fishing Matthew 13.47 seeing men are thereby drawn out of the world and brought to Christ. ]
\p
\v 18 . And they straightway forsaking their nets followed him.
\p
\v 19 . And being gone a little further from then he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother and the same in the ship mending their nets .
\p
\v 20 . And straightway he called them and they leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with the hirelings followed after him.
\p
\v 21 . And they came into Carpanaum [where he wasto dwell since he departed from Nazareth Matthew 4.13] and straightway on the Sabbath day [Gr Sabbaths] being entered into the synagogue he taught.
\p
\v 22 . And they were astonished for his doctrine for he taught them as having power [see Matthew 7.29] and not as the scribes.
\p
\v 23 . And there was in the synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and he cried out.
\p
\v 24 . Saying forebear [or O! Ah!] what have we to do with thee thou Jesus the Nazarite? art thou come to destroy us? [Namely before the time see Matthew 8.29]I know thee who thou art namely the holy one of God [or thou holy one of God that is the true Messias for the high priest bare this title the boltness of the Lord on his forehead as a type of Christ see Exodus 28.36see also Luke 4.34]
\p
\v 25 . Jesus rebuked saying hold thy peace [Gr. be thou muzzled see this word Matthew 22.12 this Christ faith because he would not have the truth spread abroad or confirmed by the testimony of the devil who is the father of lies as Paul also doth Acts 16.18]and go out of him .
\p
\v 26 . And the unclean spirit tearing him [that is drawing and throwing him thither as if he would tear him in pieces and yet not being able to hurt him see Luke 4.35] and crying with a great voice went forth out of him.
\p
\v 27 . They were all amazed so that they inquired one amongst another saying what is this? what new doctrine is this that with power be likewise commandeth the unclean spirit and they are obedient unto him ?
\p
\v 28 . And his fame [that is the fame of him] went forth present that is into the whole land of Galilee lying round about.
\p
\v 29 . And straightway being gone out of the synagogue they came into the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John.
\p
\v 30 . And Simons wives mother [so then had a wife whom being become an apostle he did not forsake as appears here and 1 Corinthian 9.5] lay sick of the fever and by and by they told him of her.
\p
\v 31 . And going to her he took her by the hand and set her up and straightway the fever left her and she ministered unto them
\p
\v 32 . Now when it was become evening when the sun went down [because it was on the Sabbath as appears out of verse 21 therefore they waited till the going down of the sun with which the Sabbath ended] they brought unto him all that were ill at ease and possessed of the devil.
\p
\v 33 . And the whole city was gathered together about the door.
\p
\v 34 . And he healed many which were ill of divers diseases and cast out of many devils to speak because they knew him [or suffered them not to say that they knew him namely because he would have no testimony from these lying spirits .]
\p
\v 35 . And early in the morning while it was yet deep in the night being xisen he went out and went away into a waste place [or solitary place] and prayed there.
\p
\v 36 . And Simon and they that were with him [namely the other three apostles which are named verse 29 with many more of the people as appears Luke 4.42] followed after him.
\p
\v 37 . And having found him they said unto him they all seek thee.
\p
\v 38 . And he said unto them let us go into the towns adjoining them [Gr. village cities that is open unwalled town of which sort they were many in Galilee whereof Josephus testified that in each of them they were no less than ten thousand persons] that I may preach there also for therefore came I forth.
\p
\v 39 . And he preached in their synagogues throughout Galilee and cast out the devils
\p
\v 40 . And there came leper beseeching him and falling on his knees before and saying unto him if thou wilt thou canst make me clean.
\p
\v 41 . And Jesus being inwardly moved with compassion stretched forth his hand touched him and said unto him I will be thou cleansed.
\p
\v 42 . And when he had said this immediately the leprosy departed from him mand he was cleansed.
\p
\v 43 . And when he had straightly forbidden him [or with threatening sharply forbidden namely to make this known] he made him presently to depart from him [Gr. drove him out that is caused him to go speedily away from him.]
\p
\v 44 . And said unto him see that thou and say nothing to any man [see the cause hereof Matthew 12.16] but go thy way shew thyself to the priest and cleanse thy that which Moses commanded for a testimony unto them.
\p
\v 45 . But he being forth began to publish many things [namely both what was done to him and what he had heard and seen of Christ besides] and to spread abroad that word [that is this thing ] so that he [ namely Jesus see Luke 5 verse 15,16 ]could no more openly come into the city [namely of Capernaum as appears in the beginning of the following chapter namely because of the great concourse of people ]but was without in desert places and they came to him from all quarters.
\c 2
\s Christ preacheth again in Capernaum with great concourse of people 1, there is brought unto him one palse-struck or lame whose sins he forgives and healeth him proving against the scribes that he had also power to forgive sins 3 calleth Matthew from the custom 13 eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners and justifies it 15 gives reasons wherefore his disciples fasted not at that time like as the disciples of John and the Pharisees did 18 the disciples pluck ears of corn on the Sabbath and are defended by Christ 23.
\p
\v 1 And after some days [the particle some is many time omitted by the Hebrews when they cometh any expression of the time bewit Genesis 4.3 and 24.55 and yet is understood] he came again into the Capernaum [namely privately and unlooked for ]and it was heard rumoured that he was in the house [viz. in which he dwelt or was at home see Matthew 4.13 ]
\p
\v 2 . And straightway they were many gathered together in so much that even the places also about the door could no more contain them and he spake the word unto them [namely of the kingdom of the gospel.]
\p
\v 3 . And there came some unto him bringing one sick of the palsie [or lame as Matthew 4.24] who was born up by four [Gr. taken up.]
\p
\v 4 . And not being able to come near him by the reason of the multitude they uncovered the roof [or lost] where he was and having broken that up [Gr. digged up for the roofs were flate above and covered with bricks or tile-stones which here they digged up see Luke 5.19] they let down the bed whereon the sick of the palse lay [Krabbaton which was a light little bed like a mattress whereon men used to rest at noon and on which they used much to lay the sick that they might the more fitly transport them from one place to another.]
\p
\v 5 . And Jesus seeing their faith [namely both of the sick of the palse an those that carried him] said to the sick of the palsie son thy sins are forgiven thee.
\p
\v 6 . And some of the scribes fate there and reasoned in their hearts.
\p
\v 7 . Why doth this man speak blasphemy thus? [see hereof the annotations of Matthew 9.3.] who can forgive sins but God only ?
\p
\v 8 . And Jesus straightway knowing in his spirit [that is in his soul namely by the revelation of his Godhead which is often set off by the word Spirit Romans 1.4Hebrew 9.14 .1 Peter 3.18] that they reasoned thus in themselves and said unto them what reasons ye these things in your hearts?
\p
\v 9 . Which is easier [see hereof and of that which follows the annotation as Matthew 9.5] to say to the sick of the palse thy sins be forgiven thee and to say arise and take up thy bed and walk?
\p
\v 10 . But that ye may know that the son of man hand power to forgive sins on earth he said to the sick of the palse.
\p
\v 11 . I say unto thee arise and take up thy bed and go home.
\p
\v 12 . And straightway he arose having taken up the bed he went forth in the presence of all so that they were all amazed and glorified God saying we never saw such a thing [GR thus ]
\p
\v 13 . And he went forth again toward the sea [namely the lake Galilee or Gennesareth on which Capernaum lay] and the whole multitude came to him and he taught them
\p
\v 14 . And passing by he saw Levi who was also called Matthew see Matthew 9 verse 9] the son of Alpbeus sit in the custome house [or on the custome or at the custome house] and he said unto him follow me and he arising followed him .
\p
\v 15 . And it came to pass as he sate down [namely at meat] in the house of the same man that many publican also of the sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples for they were many and had followed him.
\p
\v 16 . And the scribes and Pharisees seeing him eat with the publicans and sinners [see the annotations Matthew 9.10] said unto his disciples why is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?
\p
\v 17 . And Jesus hearing that said unto them they that are in the health have no need of the physician but they that are sick [Gr they that are ill that is they that are ill at ease or indisposed ] I came not to call righteous ones but sinners to repentance .
\p
\v 18 . And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fasted [namely often as is shewed Matthew 9.14 and Luke 5.33] and they came and said unto him why do the disciples of John and the Pharisees fast and the disciples fast not?[ see likewise of this whole history and similitudes Matthew 9.14]
\p
\v 19 . And Jesus said unto them can the wedding children fast while the bridegroom is with them they cannot fast.
\p
\v 20 . But the days shall come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them then they shall fast in those days.
\p
\v 21 . And no man soweth a patch of undrest cloth on an old garment else the patch of it new set on rends some what off from the old garment and there is a worse rent made.
\p
\v 22 . and no man putteth new wine in old leather bottles sacks else the new wine makes the leather bottle burst or rend and the wine is spilt and the leather bottle waste or perish but new wine must be put into new leather bottles .
\p
\v 23 . And it came to pass that on the Sabbath day [Gr. in the Sabbaths] he went through the sown fields [see the expositions here of in the annotations on Matthew 12.1] and his disciples began as they went to pluck ears [Gr. to go plucking ears]
\p
\v 24 . And the Pharisees said unto him behold why do they on the Sabbath day [Gr. Sabbath] that which is not lawful.
\p
\v 25 . And he said unto them have you never read what David did when he had need and was an hungred and they that were with him?
\p
\v 26 . How he went into the time of God in the time of Abiathar the priest [this Abiathar is called Ahimelech 1 Samuel 21.1 and his son is called Abiathar yet he appears by divers places of scripture that both these names were given to the father and to the son see 2 Sam 8.17 and 15.29,35 1 Kings 2.26,27 and 1 Chronicles 4.6] and did eat the shew bread which is lawful for no man to eat but the priest and gave alos to those that were with him .
\p
\v 27 . And he said unto them the Sabbath is made [Gr. was] for man [namely as well to strengthen his soul as to refresh his body and not for to let it perish] and not man for the Sabbath.
\p
\v 28 . Therefore the son of man is Lord also for the Sabbath.
\c 3
\s Christ cureth a man that had withered hands and proved that the Sabbath was not prophaned thereby 1 the Pharisees and Herodians took counsel together against him whose wiles he escapeth and had a great confluence of people from all parts amongst which he healeth many commanding the devils whom he cast out not to make him manifest 6 chuseth twelve apostles 13 whose names are rehearsed 16 his kinsmen take him to be out of his wits 21 the scribes blasphemy his miracles as if he did them by Beelzebul which blasphemy he confutes by divers similitudes 22, teacheth that the blasphemy against the holy ghost is never forgiven 28 and declared who is his mother brother and sister 31.
\p
\v 1 And he went again into the synagogue [for the Jews assembled every Sabbath in their synagogue to hear the law expounded see Acts 15.21] and there was a man having a withered hand [Luke 6.6 it appears that it was his right hand
\p
\v 2 . And they [namely the scribes and the Pharisees Luke 6 verse7] observed him whether he will heal him on the Sabbath [Gr. Sabbaths] that they might charge him.
\p
\v 3 . And he said to the man which had withered hand stand up in the midst.
\p
\v 4 . And he said unto them is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good or to do evil? to save a man or to kill him ?[Gr. a soul which is taken sometimes for the life sometimes for the whole man ]and they held their peace .
\p
\v 5 . And when he had looked upon them round about with anger [this anger was a zealous passion in the mind against their sin and hardness which passion is good in itself remaining with the due bounds Ephisians 4.26 ]being grieved with all because of the hardness of their heart [the Greek word properly signifies the hardness which growth on their hand or feet called brawny whereby they become hard and past feelings ]he said to the man stretch forth thy hand and he stretched it out and his hand was restored whole as the other .
\p
\v 6 . And the Pharisees being gone straightway held a counsel together with the Herodians [the Herodians see Matthew 12.16 ]against him how they might kill him.
\p
\v 7 . And Jesus departed with his disciples towards the sea, [namely, to escape their lying in wait, Matth. 12.15] and there followed him a great multitude from Galilee, and from Judea,
\p
\v 8 . And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, [where the posterity of Esau, or the Edmites dwelt, Numb. 20.15] and Tyre and Sidon, [of these two cities see Matth. 11.21] a great multitude [or with a great multitude, or making together, or making together a great multitude] having heard how great things he did, came unto him.
\p
\v 9 . And he said [that is, commanded, as Matth. 8.8] unto his Disciples, that a small ship should continually stay about him, because of the multitude, that they should not oppress him.
\p
\v 10 . For he had heald many; in so much that all those that had (any) pains, (maladies) [gr. Scourages, by which nam all manner of sickness and diseases, incident to men are called, because God punisheth or chastiseth men by them, Mark 5.29] prest upon him, that they might touch him.
\p
\v 11 . And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, [namely, in the persn which they had possessed] and cryed saying, thou art the son of God.
\p
\v 12 . And he charged them sharply, that they should not discover him. [See the reason hereof before, chapter 1. verse 25]
\p
\v 13 . And he went up into the mount, [namely, for to pray and afterwards to chuse his Apostles] and called to him whom he would, and they came unto him.
\p
\v 14 . And he appointed twelve, [Gr. Made; [namely to be his Apostles, Luke 6 verse 13] that they should be with him; and he might send them forth to preach.
\p
\v 15 . And to have power to heal sicknesses and to cast out devils.
\p
\v 16 . And to Simon he gave some have it [namely Simon to whom he gave surname Peter that is stone John 1.43whereof the reason is given Matthew 16.18.]
\p
\v 17 . And James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James and gave them surname Boanerges [ this is a broken Hebrew or Syarick word signifying as also is declared here sons of thunder and this name also given by their singular zeal and power manner of preaching as is yet to be seen in the writings of John ]which is sons of thunder .
\p
\v 18 . And Andrew and Philip and Bartholomew and Matthew and Thomas and James the son of Alpheus and Theddeus[otherwise called Libbeus see Matthew 10.3] and Simon the Canaanite [see Matthew 10.4 and also the rest .]
\p
\v 19 . And Judas Iscariot who also betrayed him.
\p
\v 20 . And they came into the house [namely Capernaum where he dwelt Matthew 4.13] from thenceforth to follow him and to be at his service] and there together a multitude again so that they could not so much as bread [that is take their meat or necessary repast in due time.]
\p
\v 21 . And when they that were of kin to him [Gr. those of his or that were of his for even many of his kinsmen did not believe in him John 7.5] heard this they went forth to lay hold of him for they said he is out of his wits [Gr. put out of besides himself ]
\p
\v 22 . And the Scribes which were come down from Jerusalem [see hereof Matthew 10.25] said he had Bethelzebul and by the chief of the devils he casteth out devils.
\p
\v 23 . And having called them unto him he said unto them in similitude how can Satan cast out Satan?
\p
\v 24 . And if a kingdom be divided against it then cannot that kingdom stand.
\p
\v 25 . And if house be divided against it then cannot that house stand.
\p
\v 26 . And if Satan rise up against himself and be divided they cannot he stand but hath an end [that is it is done with him and his kingdom.]
\p
\v 27 . There can no man into a strong mans house and bereave him of his vessels [see the exposition Matthew 12.29] if he donor first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house.
\p
\v 28 . Verily I say unto ye that all sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men [that is unto man a very usual phrase with the Hebrew] and all of blasphemies where with they shall have blasphemy.
\p
\v 29 . But who so shall have blasphemed against the holy ghost [of this blasphemy against the Holy Ghost see Matthew 12.31] he hath no forgiveness forever but he is guilty of eternal judgment [that is damnation which he not only hath deserved but shall certainly undergo.]
\p
\v 30 . For they saith he had an unclean spirit.
\p
\v 31 . Then came his brethren [that is kindred see in the annotations on Matthew 12.46 and 13.55] and his mother and standing without they sent unto him and called unto him.
\p
\v 32 . And the multitude sate round about him and they said unto him behold thy mother and thy brethren there without seek thee.
\p
\v 33 . And he answered them and said who is my mother or my brethren? [Christ doth not hereby despise his mother but shew that in matters of salvation the spiritual kin red must be preferred before the carnal.]
\p
\v 34 . And having surveyed round about those that sate about him he said beholds my mother and my brethren.
\p
\v 35 . For who so doth the will of God [to do the will of God is to believe in Christ and to live holily John 6.40 1 Thessalonians 4.3] he is my brother and my sister and my mother.
\c 4
\s Christ declares the state of the kingdom of God by divers similitudes first of a sower whose seed fell upon several grounds 1 relates the cause why he speak the similitudes 10 and interpret the foregoing similitudes to his disciples in particular14. afterwards of a candle that is set on a candle stick 21 of the measure wherewith men meet out 24. of the seed that grows up to its ripeness but by degrees 26. of the mustard seed 30 passeth over the sea with the disciples sleeping in the ship is awaked and stilleth the tempest 35.
\p
\v 1 And began again to teach about the sea [understanding the lake of the sea and Gennesareth on which Capernaum lay unto which Christ often went because commonly there was much people and therefore a fit place for to teach Matthew 13.1 Mark 2.13] and there gathered a great multitude unto him so that being entered into the ship he sate down on the sea and the whole multitude was on the land by the sea.
\p
\v 2 . And he taught them many things by similitude [Gr parables see Matthew 13.3] and he said unto them in his doctrine [that is in the teaching [or as he taught.]
\p
\v 3 . Hearken behold a sower went out for to sow.
\p
\v 4 . And it happened that in the sowing one part of the seed fell by the way side and the fowls of heaven came and eat it up.
\p
\v 5 . And another fell on stony (ground), where it had not much earth;[For a little is soon warmed by the Sun, and moistened by the sun; But when the heat continues, it is also scorched up ]and it came up presently because it had no depth on earth.
\p
\v 6 . But when was risen up it was and because it had no root [that is no sufficient or firm root] it withered.
\p
\v 7 . And other in the thorns and the thorns grew up and choked the same and it yielded no fruit.
\p
\v 8 . And other [namely grain or part of the seed] fell into good earth and yielded fruits which came up and grew and the other bear thirty and the other [Gr. the one] sixty and the other [Gr. the one] an hundred sold.
\p
\v 9 . And he said unto them he that hath ears to hear let him hear [see the exposition Matthew 13.9]
\p
\v 10 . And now when he was alone they which were about him [viz. those out of whom he took his seventy disciples] with the twelve asked him the similitude.
\p
\v 11 . And he said unto them to you it is given to understand the misery of kingdom of God [namely clearly and plainly ]but to those which are without [namely which are without the number of my sheep or which are no true members of the church John 10.26 Romans 9.6,7,8] all these things happen in parables .
\p
\v 12 . That seeing they might see and observe and hearing hear and not understand left at any time they should be converted and their sins be forgiven them. [By these words taken out of Esa 6.9 is declared the judgment of upon those who are disobedient to the gospel see Matthew 13.14. 2 Thessalonians 2 verse 11, 12.]
\p
\v 13 . And he said unto them know ye not this similitude? and how shall ye understand the similitude ?
\p
\v 14 . The sower is he that soweth the word [that is preacheth the doctrine of the gospel]
\p
\v 15 . And these are they which are sown by the way side [meaning that by which are sowed by the way side are signified they that &c.] wherein the word is sown:[ Gr. where that is in which see further the exposition of the similitude in the annotations on Matthew 13 verse 18&c .] and when they have heard it Satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word which was sown in their hearts .
\p
\v 16 . And these are they likewise which are sowed on the stony places who when they have heard the word presently receive the same with joy.
\p
\v 17 . And have no root in themselves but are for a time afterwards when affliction and persecution come for the words sake they are presently offended [that is they stumble at this that they with the professors of the gospel are subject to persecution and afterwards fall of.]
\p
\v 18 . And these are they which are sown in the thorns namely they that hear the word
\p
\v 19 . And the cares of this worlds [Gr. seculi that is of things pertaining this life] and the seduction of riches and the lusts coming in about the other things.[namely honor pleasure and revenge and the like ]choak the word and it becometh unfruitful.
\p
\v 20 . And these are they that are sown in good earth: which hear the word and receive it and bear fruits the one thirty and the other sixty and the other an hundred (sold).
\p
\v 21 . And he said unto them cometh the candle also [that is a candle lightened and brought?] to be set under the corn measure or under the bed? [Or bed-sted] it is not for to be set on a candle stick?
\p
\v 22 . For there is nothing hid that shall not be revealed [that is Christ taught his disciples nothing to keep secret but what in due time they were to teach all men] neither is there anything done to be hidden but that it should be made manifest.
\p
\v 23 . If any man hath ears for to hear let him hear [that is let him observe it]
\p
\v 24 . And he said unto them look to it what ye hear with measure ye meet it shall be measured unto ye [that is according as ye shall faithful impart your gifts of knowledge so others shall the Lord also increase the same unto ye see Matthew 25.21, 29]
\p
\v 25 . For whoso hath to him shall be given and he that hath not from him shall that also be taken which he hath.
\p
\v 26 . And said thus it is with the kingdom of God [that is with the progress of the preaching of the Gospel see Matthew 21.23] like as if a man should throw the seed into the earth.
\p
\v 27 . And then should sleep and rise night and day [that is afterwards up and down and take no further care as Psalms 3.6 and the seed should sprout forth and grow tall [that is great or shot up high ] himself knows not how .
\p
\v 28 . For the earth brings forth fruits for itself [that is by its concreated power and nature it brings forth fruit of that which is sown in it Genesis 1.11 by this similitude Christ teacheth that the word of God being preached doth get itself and increase in the hearts of man not properly by the labor and care of the teacher but by the secret working of the spirit of God which comes to be observed by degrees by the growing forth of the fruits there 1Corinthians 3.7] first the blade then the ear then the full corn in the ear .
\p
\v 29 . And when the fruits put forth itself it straightway he thrust the sickle therein because the harvest is present [Gr standeth there]
\p
\v 30 . And he said whereunto shall we compare the kingdom of God? Or unto what similitude shall we liken it?
\p
\v 31 . Namely to a mustard seed [what this similitude imports see Matthew 13.13] which when it is sown in the earth is the least [Gr the lesser] of all the seeds that are on the earth.
\p
\v 32 . And when it is sown it riseth up and becometh the greatest [the more or greater] of all potherb and maketh getteth great branches so that the fowls of heaven may nestle under its shadow.
\p
\v 33 . And by many such similitudes he spake the word [namely of the gospel] unto them according as they were able to hear it [namely according as they understood these common earthly things although they apprehended not the spiritual things which were thereby represented.]
\p
\v 34 . And without similitude he spake not unto them but he declared all things to his disciples in private.
\p
\v 35 . And on the same day when it was now become evening he said unto them let us pass over to the other side [namely of the sea of Galilee over against Capernaum towards the land of the Gadarens as appears by the following chapter verse 1]
\p
\v 36 . And they having dismissed the multitude took him along as he was in the ship and there were yet other small ships with him.
\p
\v 37 . And there was a great storm of wind and the waves beat over into the ship so that it was now full.
\p
\v 38 . And he was in the hinder part of the ship sleeping in a pillow and they raised him up and said unto him master [Gr. teacher] doth it not trouble thee [or dith it not concern thee?] that we perish?
\p
\v 39 . And being raised up he rebuked the wind and said to the sea hold thy peace be still and the wind was laid and there was a great calm.
\p
\v 40 . And he said unto them why ye are so fearful? How have ye no faith? [That is no firm assurance confidence for they were not altogether withoutfaith but of little faith Matthew 8 verse 26 Luke 8.25.]
\p
\v 41 . And they feared with great fear and said one to another who is this I pray that even the wind and the sea are obedient to him ?
\c 5
\s Christ drives a legion of devils out of one that was possessed 1 and permits the same to enter into the swine 12 which are all drowned in the sea 13 the swineheards tell this to the Gadarenes 14 who in treat Christ that he would depart out of their borders 17 which he doth and command him that was cured to abide there to make known this benefit 18 Christ goeth with Jairus to heal his little daughter and by the way releaseth a woman of a twelve year bloudy issue 21 raiseth Jarus daughter being now dead 39.
\p
\v 1 And they came over on the other side of the sea into the land of Garadanes [Matthew said of the Gergesens see thereof the annotations on Matthew 8.28]
\p
\v 2 . And when he was gone out of the ship straightway there met him out of the grave a man with an unclean spirit [Gr. in an unclean spirit Matthew chapter 8 verse 28 saith that there were two that were possessed but mark makes mention but of one either because this was most wretched or had most discourse and speech with Christ]
\p
\v 3 . Who had his dwelling in the grave [see hereof Matthew 8.28] and no man could bind him no not with chains.
\p
\v 4 . For he had many times been bound with fetters and chains and the chains were plucked in pieces by him and the fetters shattered and no man was able to tame him .
\p
\v 5 . And he was always night and day in the mountains [Gr in the mountains that is in the cave which were in the mountain] and in the graves crying and striking himself with stones.
\p
\v 6 . Now when he saw Jesus afar off him ran to him and worshiped him.
\p
\v 7 . And crying with a great voice he said what I have to do with thee Jesus thou son of God of the most high? I adjure thee [that is I warn thee in the name of God for to adjure is by invocation or making mention of Gods name to impose something upon another or to desire ought of him see Acts 19.12 and 1 Thessalonians 5.27] that thou torment me not into the abyss there to be tormented Luke 8.31]
\p
\v 8 . For he [viz Jesus] said unto him thou unclean spirit go out of the man.
\p
\v 9 . And asked him what is thy name? and he answered saying my name is Legion [Legion was a regiment of soldiers whereof see Matthew 26.53] for we are many.
\p
\v 10 . And he [namely one of these devils who as he head of the rest was the speaker] besought him much that he would not send away out of that country.
\p
\v 11 . And thereby the mountains there a great herd of swine was feeding.
\p
\v 12 . And all devils besought him saying send us into those swine [this they desire of Christ thereby to make him hateful to the inhabitants there] that we may pass into the same [Gr. enter]
\p
\v 13 . And Jesus straightway permitted them [see the annotation on Matthew 8.30] and the unclean spirit being passed out [Gr. gone out] passed [Gr. went in ] into the swine and the herd rushed down from a steep place into the sea now there about 2000 and were stifled [Gr were choaked ]in the sea [namely in the lake that was about Gadara which is taken for the sea of Galilee itself on which Gadara lay see the annotations on Matthew 8.28 ]
\p
\v 14 . And they that fed the swine fled and told this in the city and in the country and they went out to see what it was that was happening.
\p
\v 15 . And they came to Jesus and saw the possessed sitting and cloathed and well in his understanding namely he that had had the legion and they were afraid.
\p
\v 16 . And they that had seen it told them what [Gr how it] how it had happened to him that was possessed [that is how the same was cured] and also concerning the swine .
\p
\v 17 . And they began to pray him that he would go away from their borders [namely for fear they should suffer more loss thereby shewing that they more esteemed their temporal goods then Christ and his gospel]
\p
\v 18 . And as he went to the ship [namely to pass over again to wards Galilee] he that had been possessed of the devil prayed him that he might be with him.
\p
\v 19 . But Jesus did not permit him that but he said unto him go to thy house unto thine and tell them what great things the Lord hath done unto thee and how he hath compassion on thee.
\p
\v 20 . And he went away and began to publish in the land of Dacapolis [of this land see the annotations on Matthew 4.25.] what great things Jesus had done for him and they all marveled.
\p
\v 21 .And was again passed over in the ship to the other side a great multitude gathered unto him and he was by the sea.
\p
\v 22 . And behold there came one of the rulers of the Synagogue [these were as Ecclesiastical-counsellors set over the Synagogue to keep and govern the same in good order see Acts 13.15] by name Jairus and seeing him he fell down as his feet.
\p
\v 23 . And besought him very much saying my little daughter is at her last gasp [in Matthew 9.18 we find that he said my daughter is dead respecting to that which afterwards words was brought him of verse 35.] I pray thee that thou wouldst com e and lay thy hand on her that she may be saved [namely alive] and she will live [that is remain alive]
\p
\v 24 . And he went with him and a great multitude followed him and they thronged him .
\p
\v 25 . And a certain woman which had had an issue of bloud twelve years.
\p
\v 26 . And had suffered much of many physicians and had spent all that she had thereon and had found no benefit but with whom it was become much worse rather.
\p
\v 27 . This woman hearing of Jesus came amongst the multitude behind and touched his garment .
\p
\v 28 . For she said if I may touch but his cloathes [see hereof the annotations on Matthew 9.verse 21.14.36]I shall be whole [ Gr saved ]
\p
\v 29 .And straightway the fountain of her bloud was dried up and she felt [or knew] in her body that she was healed of that disease [Gr the scourge see chapter3 verse 10.]
\p
\v 30 . and straightway Jesus perceived in himself the virtue that was gone out of him [that is the work which by his divine nature was wrought upon this woman or that this power was gone forth out of him ] turned himself about in the multitude and said who touched my cloathes ?
\p
\v 31 . And hs disciples said unto him thou seest that the multitude throngs thee and sayeth thou who touched me?
\p
\v 32 . And he looked round about to see her that which had done that .
\p
\v 33 . And the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth [namely of what she had both thought and done ]
\p
\v 34 . And he said unto her daughter thy faith have saved thee go in peace and be healed of this thy disease.
\p
\v 35 . While he yet spake there came some from ruler of Synagogue his house saying thy daughter is dead why art thou yet troublesome to the master?[namely to go father .]
\p
\v 36 . And Jesus immediately having heard the word that was spoken said to the rulers of synagogue fear not only believe .
\p
\v 37 .And he suffered no man to follow him but Peter and James and John the brother of James .
\p
\v 38 . And came into the house of rulers of Synagogue [see further of this history the annotations on Matthew 9.23]and saw the tumult [or the none the stir ]and thoser which wept and howled greatly.
\p
\v 39 . And being gone in he said unto them what do ye make a tumult ? and what weep ye? the child is not dead but is sleepeth .
\p
\v 40 . And they laughed at him but he when he had driven them all out [Gr cast them out ]took with him the father and the mother of the child and those that were with him [namely Peter John and James whom he had taken along with him verse 37] and went in where the child lay.
\p
\v 41 . And he took hold of the child’s hand and said unto her Talibakumi [the evangelist retains the Syriak words which Christ used to make us in a manner hear Christ himself speak in his own tongue ]which is being interpreted thou Damosel I say unto thee arise.
\p
\v 42 . And straightway the damosel arose and walked for she was twelve years old and they were astonished with great astonishment.
\p
\v 43 . And he commanded them very much that no man should know that same and said they should give her to eat.
\c 6
\s Christ reacheth in his own country where he is despised 1 sends forth his apostles to preach and to work miracles 7 Divers opinions of Christ as well of the Jews as of Herod who takes him for John the Baptist 14 whose imprisonment beheading and burial is related upon his occasion 17 the apostles came again to Christ who departeth to them into a desert places 30 where a great multitude followeth him of about five thousand men which feedeth with five loaves and two fishes 33 causeth his disciples to pass the sea or lake and in the mean time prayeth on the mountain 45 afterwards he comes to them by night walking on the sea and calmeth the wind 48 and being come ashore healeth all manner of sicknesses.54.
\p
\v 1 And he went away from thence and he came into his own country [namely to Nazareth which is called his country because he was brought up there and had dwelt there a long time with his parents see Matthew 13 verse 54 and Luke 4 verse 16]and his disciples followed him .
\p
\v 2 . And when the Sabbath was come he began to teach in the Synagogue and many who heard him were astonished [Gr. were stricken] saying from whence come those things to his man? and what was one this which is given unto him that even such mighty works [that is miracles or wonderful signs see Matthew 7.22]are done by his hands ?[that is by him an Hebrew phrase]
\p
\v 3 . is not in the carpenter Matthew 13.55 there it is like that Christ did help him in the hand crast until he entered upon his office of teaching which was also a part of humiliation Luke 2.51] the son of Mary and the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? [That is their cousin see the annotate Matthew 13.55] and are not his sister here with us? And they were offended at him.
\p
\v 4 . And Jesus said unto them a prophet is not disesteemed but in his own country and among his kinred and in his own house.
\p
\v 5 . And he could do no powerful work there [how this is to be understood see the annotations on Matthew 13.58] but tat he laid the hands on a few sick and healed them.
\p
\v 6 . And marveled at their unbelief and went about the villages there round about teaching.
\p
\v 7 . And he called unto him the twelve [namely which he had chosen for his apostle Mark 3.13] and began to send them forth two and two and gave them power over unclean spirits [namely to be able to cast them out of the possessed]
\p
\v 8 . And he commanded them that they should take nothing for the way but only a staff [namely to lean and rest upon in going but none to burden them on the way as is to be seen Matthew 10 verse 10] no scrip no bread no money [Gr brass because in former times money used much to be on brass also thereby may here be understood even the very least provision of money] in the girdle.
\p
\v 9 . But that they should tie on shoe soles [Gr. Sandalia which were certain fort of light shoes consisting of soles with shoe tie or latches to fasten them to the feet which were very usual in those hot country Acts 12.8 of these they were to take no more than one pair for to travel for to take more shoes with them on the way was expressly forbidden them Matthew 10.10] and not be cloathed with two coats [that is with more ten ye shall have on without carrying one coat more along with them for change ]
\p
\v 10 . And he said unto them where so ever ye shall enter in the house abides there until ye go forth from thence.
\p
\v 11 . And whosoever shall not receive ye nor hear ye departing from thence shake off the dust that is under your feet [the reason hereof see Matthew 10.14] for a testimony unto them verily I say unto ye it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorra in the day of judgment then for that city.
\p
\v 12 . And being gone forth they preached that they should repent.
\p
\v 13 . And they cast out many devils and anointed many that were sick with oil and made them whole [this anointing is also the laying in of hands touching and the like manner of doings which Christ and the apostles used in healing of disease did not give health but were out ward sign only that is miraculous healing was done by the divine power of Christ and the ministry of the apostles which signs were used as long as the gift of miraculous healing endured see Mark 16.18 James 5.14 and since that gift ceased these signs must cease likewise as serving for no further use .
\p
\v 14 . And King Herod heard of it [see of this Herod and his whole history Matthew 14.1 c] for his name [namely the name of Jesus] was made known and said John that baptized is raised from the dead and therefore those powers do work in him [that is now he cometh with greater power than before for John himself had done no miracle John 10.41]
\p
\v 15 . Others said he is Elias and others said he is a prophet [that is of the old deceased prophet]
\p
\v 16 . But when Herod heard it he said this is John whom I beheaded he is raised from the dead.
\p
\v 17 . For the same Herod having sent forth some had apprehended John and bound him in prison because of Herodias his brother Philip wife he having married her.
\p
\v 18 . For John said unto Herod it is not lawful for thee to have brother’s wife.
\p
\v 19 . And Herodias laid wait for him and would put him to death but could not.
\p
\v 20 . For Herod feared John knowing that he was a righteous and holy man and held him in esteem [or kept him] and when he heard him h did many things and heard him gladly [namely at first for afterwards being stirred up by Herodias he fought to kill him although he forbare it for fear of people until the opportunity happened Matthew 14.5.]
\p
\v 21 . And when a covenant day was come [that is a fit time which Herodias waited for to obtain her purpose] when Herod on his birthday prepared a feast for the great ones rulers over thousand and the chiefest of Galilee.
\p
\v 22 . And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in namely into the hall where the feast was kept for it was not very usual with ancient that the women sate down with man in great feast see Esthar1.11] and danced and pleased Herod and those that sate with him then the king said to the Damosel ask of me even what thou wilt and I will give it thee.
\p
\v 23 . And he swared unto her whatsoever thou shalt ask I will give it thee even to the half of the kingdom.
\p
\v 24 . And she being gone forth said unto her mother what shall I ask? And she said the head of John the Baptist.
\p
\v 25 . And she straightway with speed going in unto the king asked it saying I will that thou now straightway give me in a dish the head of John the Baptist.
\p
\v 26 . And the king being become very sorry nevertheless because of the oaths and those that sate with him he would not refuse her the same [Gr. not put her off that is not refuse the request.]
\p
\v 27 . And the king immediately sent and executioner [or sergeant Halbardea one of the life guard] and commanded to bring his head thither now this fellow went away and beheaded him in the prison.
\p
\v 28 . And brought his head in a dish and gave the same to the Damosel and the Damosel gave the same to her mother.
\p
\v 29 . And when his disciples heard this they went and took away his dead body and lay in a grave.
\p
\v 30 . And the apostles came together again unto Jesus [namely returning from their journey which after their being sent forth two and two they had taken through the land of Judea ]and told him all things both what they had done and what they had taught.
\p
\v 31 . And he said unto them come ye into a desert place [or solitary this was by Bethsaida Matthew 14.13 Luke 9.10] here alone [or apart] and rest a little for they were many which came and went and they no convenient time so much as to eat.
\p
\v 32 . And they departed into a ship unto a desert place alone
\p
\v 33 . And the multitude saw them pass away and many began to know and ran together afoot from all cities thitherward and prevented them and went together unto him.
\p
\v 34 . And Jesus going forth saw a great multitude [see concerning this whole miracle the annotations on Matthew 14.15 &c] and was inwardly moved in compassion towards them for they were as sheep which had no shepherd and he began to teach them many things.
\p
\v 35 . And when it was grown late now by the day [Gr. when the hour was grown much now for the Jews reckoned the hours of rising of the sun and ended the with the evening Matthew 20 verse6] his disciples came unto him and said this place is desert and it is now late by day.
\p
\v 36 . Dismiss them from thee that they may go into the villages [Gr. fields that are country houses or villages] and hamlets lying round about and may buy bread for themselves for they have nothing to eat.
\p
\v 37 . But he answering said unto them give ye them to eat and they said unto him shall we go and buy bread for two hundred pence [Gr. Denarit see the value hereof Matthew 18.28] and give them to eat?
\p
\v 38 . And he said unto them how many loaves have ye? Go and see and when they have noticed of it [Gr. had understood or knew it] they said five and two fishes.
\p
\v 39 . And he commanded them that they should cause them all to fit down by companies [Gr. companies or meals an Hebrew phrase that is in several companies like as at great feast or weddings the people used to be divided by several tables ]on the green grass .
\p
\v 40 . And they sate down [Gr. fell] in parties [Gr. garden beds that is distinguished as the beds of the herbs in gardens are whereby the number might easily be reckoned] by an hundred together and by an fifty together.
\p
\v 41 . And when he had taken the five loaves and two fishes he looked up to heaven blessed [namely with thanksgiving see Matthew 14.19 John 6.11] and brake the loaves and gave them to his disciples that they should set them before them and the two fishes he divided to them all .
\p
\v 42 . And they did all eat and were satisfied.
\p
\v 43 . And they took up twelve baskets full of fragments and of the fishes.
\p
\v 44 . And they that had eaten of the loaves were about five thousand men.
\p
\v 45 . And straightway he constrained his disciple to go into the ship and to pass before to the other side over against Bethsaida [for John 6.17] it is said tat they went towards Capernaum which lay over against Bethsaida ]while he dismissed the multitude.
\p
\v 46 . And when he had dismissed them [or taken his leave of them as Acts 18.21] he went up into the mountain to pray.
\p
\v 47 . And when it was become evening now the ship was in the midst of the sea and he was alone on the land [or shore]
\p
\v 48 . And he saw that they toiled much to advance the ship [or that they were distressed in rowing] for the wind was against them and about the forth watch of the night [which was the last see Matthew 14.25] he came unto them walking upon the sea and would pass them by.
\p
\v 49 . And they seeing seeing him walk upon the sea thought that it was an apparition [or phantasm that is a spirit appearing in the bodily shape] and shrieked greatly.
\p
\v 50 . For they all saw him and were troubled and straightway he spake with them and said unto them be of good cheer it is I fear not.
\p
\v 51 . And he got them into the ship and the wind was still and they were astonished exceedingly themselves [Gr. very abundantly] and wondered.
\p
\v 52 . For they had not taken notice of the miracle of the loaves [Gr not understood of or by the loaves that is they were not become more understanding by that which was done with the five loaves namely to be assured thereby of Christ divine power and care for them see Mark 8verse 17,20,21] for their heart was hardened [Gr become brawny which is not to be understood of such a hardness and stupidity of heart as was before shewed and reproved in the stiff necked Jews chapter 3 verse 5 but of their want of understanding and slowness well to apprehend and believe spiritual things see the like Mark 8.17 and 16.14 Luke 24.15]
\p
\v 53 . And when they were passed over they came into the land Gennesareth and took haven there
\p
\v 54 . And when they were gone forth out of the ship they [namely the people of that land] presently knew him.
\p
\v 55 . And running all the adjacent country over they began to carry on little beds those that were ill at ease to the places where they heard that there was.
\p
\v 56 . And where so ever he came into towns or cities or villages [Gr fields ] there they laid the sick in the markets and prayed him that they might but touch the hem of the garments [see the reason of this touching in the annotations on Matthew 14.36] And as many as touched him were made whole .
\c 7
\s The Pharisees and the Scribes blame the disciples of Christ that they did eat with unwashen hands 1 whom Christ defends and reproves the Pharisees hypocrisy in their external washing 6and rejects their humane institution especially in he exposition of the fifth commandment 9 teacheth what doth properly defile man what not 14 cast out a devil out of the daughter of a woman of syrophanicia 24 healeth one deaf and dumb 31and is much praised for it 37.
\p
\v 1 And there gathered unto him the Pharisees and some of the Scribes which were come from Jerusalem [namely of the ablest and bitterest sent forth from Jerusalem for that purpose to observe his doctrine and works and to carp at them and to make the people suspect the same]
\p
\v 2 . And seeing that some of his disciples did eat bread [that is meat] with unclean that is unwashed hands [Gr common so that which is unclean or unholy is called throughout see Acts 10.14 for the Pharisees were unclean or unholy until they washed again which Christ here reproveth not to tax or find fault with the civil custome of washing the hands before meat but to convince them of their superstition and hypocrisy] they found fault with them [or complained thereof]
\p
\v 3 . For the Pharisees eat not without washing first hands often [or with the fist as they that will wash their hands very clean used to rub the hands with the fist and carefully or up to the elbow as some report the Jews custome was to do] holding the institution [Gr holding fast or laying hold on the tradition] of the ancient [or of the elders.]
\p
\v 4 . And coming from the market [because there they dealt with all sort of men gentiles and others and touched many other things whereby they held themselves defiled ] they eat not except they be first washed [Gr baptized which signifie both to dip into the water and also to wash of and whence the holy baptism hath its denomination ]and many other things there be which they have received to hold namely the washing of drinking cups and pots [the Greek word xestes signifies the sixth part of courteous about a Dutch pinte and half] and brazon vessels and beds [that is bed-sted or the side of the bed where on the ancient lean on at the table for to eat instead of our sitting.]
\p
\v 5 . Afterwards the Scribes and the Pharisees asked him wherefore do not thy disciples walk [that is an Hebrew phrase as Psalms 1.1 and through out] after the institution of the ancient [or of he elders] but eat bread with unwashen hands?
\p
\v 6 . But he answered and said unto them well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites [of this whole answer see the annotations on Matthew 15.7c.] as it is written these people honoureth me with lives but their hearts keeps itself far from me .[or is far from me.]
\p
\v 7 . But in vain [that fruitlessly seeing such service is acceptable to the Lord] do they honor [or worship] me teaching doctrines which are commandments of men.
\p
\v 8 . For neglecting the command of God ye hold the institution of men as namely the washing of pots and cups and many other such like thing ye do.
\p
\v 9 . And he said unto them ye do well sure disannul the commandment of God for to keep or maintain your institution.
\p
\v 10 . For Moses said honor thy father and thy mother and whoso curseth father and mother [that is falls upon them with evil words revealing them or threatening them] he shall die the death.
\p
\v 11 . But ye say if a man say to father or mother it is corban that is to say a gift if by ought from me thou mightiest profit the same satisfieth [or barely corban that is the gift offered by me shall be profitable to thee see hereof the annotations on Matthew 15.5 or let it be corban that which from me might be profitable to thee.
\p
\v 12 . And ye suffer him no more to do any thing of his father and his mother.
\p
\v 13 . Making thus the word of God of no force [Gr rejecting or depriving it of its esteem or force] by your institution which ye have instituted and many such like things ye do.
\p
\v 14 . And having called the whole multitude unto him he said unto them hear me all of ye and understand.
\p
\v 15 . There is nothing from without the men [namely of meat or drink being used moderately and with thanksgiving 1 Timothy 4.4] entering into him which can defile him [Gr make him common] but the things which go out of him they are which defile the man.
\p
\v 16 . If any man have ears to hear let him hear [see Matthew 11.15]
\p
\v 17 . And when he was come into the house from multitude his disciples asked him concerning the similitude [Gr parable which word signifies not only a similitude but also some special doctrine or proverb.
\p
\v 18 . And he said unto them are ye also thus ignorant? Do ye not understand that all from without enters into men cannot defile him?
\p
\v 19 . For it enters into the heart but into the belly and goes out the privy purging of all meats [that is that which is unfit for nourishment is cast out through that as unclean and the remaining food is purged thereby]
\p
\v 20 . And he said that which goeth forth out the man the defiles the man.
\p
\v 21 . For from within out of the heart of man come forth evil thoughts [or reasoning devices or excommunication] adultery fornication murderer.
\p
\v 22 . Theft, covetousness [or desires to always have more and more] wickedness, deceit, immodesty,[ or wantonness lasciviousness] an evekeye [that is envy or ill will see Matthew 20.15] reviling or blasphemy pride want of understanding [or foolishness, indiscretion.]
\p
\v 23 . All these evil things come forth from within [that is have their spring in heart and afterward accomplished outwardly see James 1.15] and defile the men.
\p
\v 24 . And arising from thence he went away from the borders of Tyre and Sidon [that is thereabouts for Christ it seems never preached himself in cities of Gentiles see verse 27,31 Matthew 15.24]and being gone into a house he would not that any knew it and not withstanding he could not be hid.
\p
\v 25 . For a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit having heard of him came and fell down at his feet.
\p
\v 26 . Now this was a Grecian woman [that is gentile and heathenish as the Jew and Greeks are very where opposed one another] by birth [that is by discent] out of syrophenicia [for Tyres and Sidon were situate in phonicia which was a part of Syria lying on the mid-land sea] and she besought him he would cast out the devil out of her daughter.
\p
\v 27 . But Jesus said unto her let the children first be satisfied for it is not seemly [Gr seemly fair or good] that the children’s bread be taken and cast before the little dogs [see Matthew 15.26]
\p
\v 28 . But she answered and said unto him yea Lord yet the dogs also eat under the table of the children’s crams.
\p
\v 29 . And he said unto her for this word sake [namely whereby thou hast testified thy faith and trust in me] go thy way the devil is gone forth out of thy daughter.
\p
\v 30 . And she came into her house she found that the devil was gone forth and the daughter lying [Gr cast] upon the bed.
\p
\v 31 . And he being departed again from the borders of the Tyre and Sidon came to the Sea of Galilee through the midst of the borders Decapolis [see of the country Matthew 4.25]
\p
\v 32 . And they brought unto him one that was deaf who spake heavily and they besought him that he would lay a hand upon him [namely to cure him seeing he was wont to do it with laying on his hands by touching and other outwards gestures ]
\p
\v 33 . And having taken him apart from he multitude he put his fingers into his ears these signs Christ used because there is some resemblance between them and the power of God in the boring thorow of ears and loosing of the tongue ]and having spit he touched his tongue .
\p
\v 34 . And looking up towards heaven [namely to pray to his father as may be seen John 11.41] he sighed [namely out of compassion on humane miseries of which this man was a present spectacle] and said unto him Ephaphatha that is be opened.
\p
\v 35 . And straightway his ears wee opened and the bond of his tongue was loosened and he spake aright.
\p
\v 36 . And he commanded them that they should tell it to no man [the reason hereof see Matthew 12.16] but however he commanded them they published it so much the more [Gr the more abundantly]
\p
\v 37 . And they were astonished exceedingly saying he hath done all things well and he maketh the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak.
\c 8
\s Christ feedeth four thousand men with five loaves and a few fishes 1 refuseth to give the Pharisees a sign from heaven 11 warneth his disciples of the leaven of the Pharisees and of Herod 14restore a blind man to his sight 2 divers opinion of Jews concerning Christ and Peter confession that he was the Christ 27 he foretelleth his passion death and resurrection 31 reproveth Peter who diswarded him from his suffering 32 exhorts his followers to take their cross upon them to deny themselves and to liketh no fear make them ashamed of him and of his doctrine 34.
\p
\v 1 In those days [that is about that time a Hebraism] when there was a very great multitude and they had nothing to eat Jesus called his disciples and said unto them.
\p
\v 2 I am inwardly moved with compassion [or from my heart heartily]towards the multitude for they have now remained with me three days [in those hot eastern countries one can no longer indure hunger then in those colder climates ]and have nothing to eat.
\p
\v 3 . And if I let them go home fasting they will faint by the way for some of them comes from far.
\p
\v 4 . And his disciples answered him [concerning this whole miracle see likewise Matthew 15.32] whence shall one be able to satisfy these with bread here in the wilderness?
\p
\v 5 . And he asked them how many loaves have ye and they said seven.
\p
\v 6 . And he commanded the multitude to sit down [Gr fall down] on the ground and he took the seven loaves and having given thanks he break them and gave them to his disciples that they should set them before the multitude.
\p
\v 7 . And they had a few small fishes and when he had blessed [or given thanks see hereof Matthew 15.36] he said that they should also set the same before them.
\p
\v 8 . And they did eat and were satisfied and they took up the remainder of the fragments seven baskets.
\p
\v 9 . Now they that had eaten about four thousand and he let them go.
\p
\v 10 . And straightway being gone into the ship with his disciples he came into parts of Dalmanutha [see hereof Matthew 15.39.]
\p
\v 11 . And the Pharisees went forth and they began to contend with him [that is enter into dispute and difference] desiring of them a sign of heaven tempting him.
\p
\v 12 . And he sighing heavily in his spirit [namely for their perverseness and obstinacy] said what doth this generation desire a sign? verily I say unto you if there shall be a sign to this generation [this is an abrupt manner of speaking usual with the Hebrews when they will confirm or avouch as by oath that such a thing shall not be done as may be seen Genesis 14.22 Psalms 95.11 Hebrews 3.11 others they shall no sign be given to his generation namely such an one as they desire from heaven]
\p
\v 13 . And he left them and being gone into the ship again he pass away to the other side [namely of the sea of Gennesareth towards Bethsaida as is to be seen verse 22.]
\p
\v 14 . And his disciples had forgotten to take bread with them and had but one loaf with them in the ship.
\p
\v 15 . And he commandeth them and saying look at it beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees [see hereof Matthew 16 verse12] and of the leaven of Herod [from whom the Herodians were denominated see concerning them Matthew 22 verse 16.]
\p
\v 16 . And they reasoned among themselves and said it is because we have no bread.
\p
\v 17 . And Jesus knowing that saying unto them what reason ye that ye have no bread? Do ye not yet observe? Neither do ye understand? Have your hardened [Gr brawny cornice see the annotation on Mark 6 verse 52] heart yet?
\p
\v 18 . Having eyes see ye not? And having ears hear ye not?
\p
\v 19 . And do ye not remember when I brake the five loaves amongst the five thousand men how many baskets full of fragments ye took up? They say unto him twelve.
\p
\v 20 . And when I brake the seven amongst the four thousand men how many mounds full of fragments ye took up? [Gr how many mounds fullness of fragments?] And they said seven.
\p
\v 21 . And he said unto them how do ye not understand? [Namely that which was so lately and publicly done.]
\p
\v 22 . And he came to Bethsaida [a small city or town lying on the sea of Galilee where Peter Andrew and Philip were born John 1.45 where Christ also did many miracles Matthew 11.21] and they brought unto him one tat was blind and prayed him that he would touch him.
\p
\v 23 . And having taken the blind man by the hand he led him forth without the town and spit in his eyes [Christ useth this sign to shew that this cure came from him and it hath some resemblance and medicinal water of the eyes whereby the weak ones were strengthened] and laid the hand upon him and asked him if he saw anything.
\p
\v 24 . And he looking up [namely the blind man] said I see men for I see them walk like trees [otherwise I see like trees walking]
\p
\v 25 . Afterwards he laid his hands again upon his eyes and made him look up [Christ could indeed at once cured this blind man like as he did the other times but it seems that here he would do it in degrees to represent that our spiritual enlightening advanceth likewise by degrees more and more] And he was restored and he saw them all afar of and clearly.
\p
\v 26 . And he sent him to his house saying go not into the town neither tell it to any in town [see the reason of this prohibition Matthew 12.16c.]
\p
\v 27 . And Jesus went forth and his disciples to the towns of Cesarea Philippi [see of this city Matthew 16.13] and on the way he asked his disciples saying unto them whom do men say I am?
\p
\v 28 . And they answered John the Baptist and others Elias and others son of the prophets.
\p
\v 29 . And he said unto them but ye whom say ye that I am? And Peter answering said unto him thou art the Christ [that is the promised Messiah or anointed John 1.42]
\p
\v 30 . And he commanded them sharply that they should tell no man concerning him.
\p
\v 31 . And he began to teach them that the son of man was to suffer much and to be rejected of the Elders and chief priest and Scribes and he put to dead and after three days to rise again [that is within the three days as the chief priest themselves using that phrase shew and declare they understood it so Matthew 27, 63, 64]
\p
\v 32 . And this word he uttered freely and Peter having taken him up began to rebuke him.
\p
\v 33 . But he turning himself about and looking on his disciples rebuked Peter saying get thee behind me Satan [see concerning this word Matthew 16.23]for thou mindest not the things that are of God but those that are of man .
\p
\v 34 . And having called into him the multitude with his disciples he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
\p
\v 35 . For whosoever will save his life [Gr soul see Matthew 16.25] he shall lose the same but who so shall lose his life for my sake and for the gospel sake he shall save the same.
\p
\v 36 . For what would it profit a man he should win the whole world and suffered the loss of his soul?
\p
\v 37 . Or what shall a man give for the release of his soul?
\p
\v 38 . For whosoever shall have been ashamed of me and my words in the adulterous and sinful generation of him shall also the son of man be ashamed when he shall come in the glory of his father with the holy Angels.

\s Christ is glorified upon the mount in the presence of Moses and Elias and is witnessed to be the son of God 1 he teacheth that John the Baptist is the Elias which was to come 11 casteth out a dumb and deaf devil 14 which his disciples had not been able to do 18 the cause whereof is declared 28 he again foretells his death and resurrection 31 exhorths his disciples to humility by example of little child 33will not have those kindred that cast out devil in his name 38 promiseth a recompense to him that doth the least good to any of his 41and threatens heavy punishments to those that give offence 42 sheweth that we must refrain ourselves from whatsoever is offensive or an hindrance to salvation 45 speaks of having salt in ourselves and peace with others 49.
\p
\v 1 And he said unto them verily I say unto ye [see hereof the annotation on Matthew 16.28] that there are some of them that stand here [that is are present] which shall not taste of death until they shall have seen that the kingdom of God is come with power [Gr in power that is powerfully so that none shall be able to withstand the same.]
\p
\v 2 . And after six days [see hereof as also the whole transfiguration of Christ the annotation on Matthew 17 verse 1&c.] Jesus took with him Peter James and John and brought them upon a high mountain apart alone and he was transfigured or altered in shape before them.
\p
\v 3 . And his garments became shining very white as snow such as no fuller on earth can make so white.
\p
\v 4 . And there was seen of them Elias with Moses and they spake with Jesus [what they spake of see Luke 9.31]
\p
\v 5 . And Peter answering said unto Jesus Rabbi it is good for to be here and let us make three tabernacles or rooths one for thee one for Moses and one for Elias.
\p
\v 6 . For he knew not what he said [or what he should say] for they were so afraid [the Greek word signifieth as it were besides one self for fear or to be exceedingly afraid.]
\p
\v 7 . And there came a cloud which cover shadowed them and the voice came out of the cloud saying this is my beloved son hear him.
\p
\v 8 . And suddenly looking around about them saw no man more but Jesus only with them.
\p
\v 9 . And as they came down from the mount he commanded them that they should relate to no man what they had seen until the son of man should be risen from dead.
\p
\v 10 . And they kept this word [that is this thing a Hebrew phrase] to themselves asking one another how it was to rise from dead? [this was asked by them not that they doubted the resurrection from the dead for that was well known of the Jews John 11.24 Acts 23.8but because they understood not how the Messiah should die and rise again before he should set up his kingdom ]
\p
\v 11 . And they asked him saying why the Scribes that Elias must first come say?
\p
\v 12 . And he answering said unto them Elias shall indeed first come and restore all things and it shall come to pass as it is written of the son of man thathe shall suffer much and be despised [Gr set at naught or esteemed as nothing that is vilified to the utmost]
\p
\v 13 . But I say unto you that Elias is come and they have done to him whatsoever they would accord it is written of him.
\p
\v 14 . And when he was come to the disciples [namely the other nine who had not been with Christ on the mount] he saw a great multitude round about them and certain Scribes contending with them [that is disputing]
\p
\v 15 . And straightway the whole multitude seeing him was amazed [it seems hereby that there remained some splendour yet in Christ face such as was in that of Moses Exodus 34 verse 29,30 whereat they were amazed ] and running to him they saluted him.
\p
\v 16 . And he asked the Scribe what contend ye with? [Otherwise one with another]
\p
\v 17 . And one of those multitude answering said master I have brought my son unto thee who had a dumb spirit [Gr speechless that is one which had a taken from him or hundred his speech]
\p
\v 18 . And where so ever he taketh him [or when so ever] he teareth him and he foameth and gnasheth with his teeth and withereth away [that is pineth and consumeth away through this torment] and I spake to thy disciples that is requested of them that they would cast him out and they were not able.
\p
\v 19 . And he answered him and said O unbelieving generation how long shall I be with ye yet? How long shall I support you yet? Bring him unto me.
\p
\v 20 . And they brought the same unto him and when he saw him the spirit straightway tore him [of this word see Mark 1.26 the devil here shew his cruelty the more because he knew he must be packing see Revelation 12.12] and he falling on the ground wallowed foaming.
\p
\v 21 . And he asked his father how long time since this befell him? And he said unto him even from his childhood.
\p
\v 22 . And often times he hath cast him even into the fire and into the water for to destroy him [that is to make away with him] but if thou canst do any thing is thou inwardly moved with compassion towards us and help us.
\p
\v 23 . And Jesus said unto him if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth.
\p
\v 24 . And straightway the father of the child crying with tears said I believe Lord Help mine unbelief.
\p
\v 25 . And Jesus seeing that all the multitude came running on he rebuked the unclean spirit saying unto him thou dumb and deaf spirit I command thee go forth out of him and come no more into him .
\p
\v 26 . And he crying [namely the unclean spirit] and tearing him sore went out and the child was as dead insomuch that many said it was dead.
\p
\v 27 And Jesus taking him by the hand lifted him up NAD he arose.
\p
\v 28 . And when he [namely Jesus] was gone into the house his disciples asked him apart why were not we able to cast him out?
\p
\v 29 . And he said unto them this kind [namely of devils] can go forth by nothing but by praying and fasting [or by prayer and fasting see Matthew 17.21]
\p
\v 30 . And departing thence they traveled through Galilee and he would not that any man knew it.
\p
\v 31 . For he taught his disciples and said unto hem the son of man shall be delivered over [or is delivered over] into the hands of man and they shall kill him and being killed the third day he shall rise again.
\p
\v 32 . But thy did not understand that word [that is thing for the words thy understood were enough for some sort but they apprehended not nor laid to heart the thing itself seeing they always fancied to themselves a wordly kingdom under Christ Matthew 17.23] and they were afraid to ask him .
\p
\v 33 . And he came to Capernaum and being come into the house [namely were he was wont to make his abode see Matthew 4.13] he asked them whereof did ye discourse one with another by the way?
\p
\v 34 . But they held their peace for they had discoursed one with another by the way who should be the greatest?
\p
\v 35 . And being sat don he called the twelve and said unto them if any man would be the first he shall be the last of all and servant of all [or let him be c. that is he ought so to behave himself as if he were the last of all and servant of all Matthew 20.26]
\p
\v 36 . And taking a little child he set it in the didst amongst them and embraced it with his arms and said unto them
\p
\v 37 . Whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name he receiveth me and whosoever shall receiveth me he receiveth not me [that is not so much me or not me only] but him that sent me.
\p
\v 38 . And John answered saying master we saw one that cast out devils in thy name that doth not follow us and we forbad him because he doth not follow us.
\p
\v 39 . But Jesus said forbid him not for there is no man that shall do a power [that is powerful work or miracle in my name and shall be able to hastily to speak evil of me [that is reproach or curse me seeing he doth acknowledge by that deed of his that this power comes from me.]
\p
\v 40 . For he that is not against us [that is he that not only doth not set himself against us but likewise doth that whereby the honor of my name is advanced although he do not follow our company so that here he speaks not of those which keep themselves Neuters in the cause of Christ whom we see elsewhere reproved Matthew 12 verse 30] he is for us [others read against you and for you.]
\p
\v 41 For whoso shall give ye a cup of water to drink in my name for being Christ disciples [Here Christ again prosecutes the discourse which he had broken off verse 37 as appears by Matthew 10.4] verily I say unto ye he shall in the wise lose his reward.
\p
\v 42 . And whosoever offends one of these little ones [viz which are not only little in respect of age but likewise the little or lowly minded or who esteem but little of themselves] which believe in me it were better for him that a mill stone were put about his neck [Gr laid] and that he were cast into the sea [namely then that he should give offence.]
\p
\v 43 And if thy hand offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter into life maimed [that is having but one hand as the following words do also hold forth ] then having two hands to go into hell [see hereof the exposition on Matthew 5.22] into that unquenchable fire.
\p
\v 44 . where their worm [that is their racking conscience which like a worm shall always lie gnawing them Romans 2.5,9]dieth not and the fire is not quenched [the fire that is the punishment of Gods wrath which is called an unquenchable fire the pain of fire being most insufferable and this punishment never ceasing Jeremiah 7.20 Revelations 20.10].
\p
\v 45 And if thy foot offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter into the life a cripple then having two feet two feet be cast into hell into unquenchable fire.
\p
\v 46 . Where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched.
\p
\v 47 . And if thine eyes offend thee cast it out it is better for thee having but one eye to enter into the kingdom of God then having two eyes to be cast into hell fire [Or Gehenna of fire see Matthew 5.22]
\p
\v 48 . Where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched.
\p
\v 49 . For everyone [Gr all] shall be salted with fire [unto fire is compared the word of God Jeremiah 23.29 the powerful working of the holy ghost Matthew 3.11 cross and persecution 1 Peter 1 verse 7 by which three things everyone is to be prepared tried and purified that shall escape hell fire and thus h becomes a spiritual sacrifice which is acceptable to God like as the outward sacrifice were to be prepared with salt and offered by fire Leviticus 2.13] and every [Gr all ] sacrifice shall be salted with salt.
\p
\v 50 . Salt is good but if the salt has become salt less where with will ye make it savoury ?[see the exposition hereof Matthew 5.13] have salt in yourselves [salt that is wisdom and prudence out of and according to the word of God Colossians 4.6] and be at peace one with another .

\s Christ answereth the question of the Pharisees whether it be lawful for a man to forsake his wife ?1 will have little children suffered to come unto him and blesseth them 13 answereth a rich young man asking what he should do to inherit eternal life 17and teacheth how hardly the rich come into the kingdom of Heaven 23 promiseth who leave all they have for his sake both temporal and eternal recompense 28 foretells again his suffering death and resurrection 32 answereth the children of Zebedee to their request of sitting at his right and left hand and exhorts them to sufferance and humility 35 restores blind Bartimeus to his sight 46 .
\p
\v 1 And being risen up from thence [namely from Capernaum out of the house where before he made an exhortation to his disciples] he went towards the borders of Judea by the further side of Jordan [namely in respect of wilderness or by the Jordan see Matthew 19.1c.] and the multitude came together again unto him [namely which had followed him from Galilee Matthew 19.2] and he taught them again according to his custom.
\p
\v 2 . And the Pharisees coming unto him asked him whether it was lawful for a man to forsake his wife tempting him?
\p
\v 3 . But he answering said unto them what hath Moses commanded ye?
\p
\v 4 . And they said Moses permitted to write a bill of divorcement and to forsake her [of the bill of divorcement and this whole answer of Christ see Matthew 19.3 c.]
\p
\v 5 . And Jesus answering said unto them that precept he wrote unto ye by reason of the hardness of your hearts.
\p
\v 6 . But from the beginning of creation God made them male and female.
\p
\v 7 . Therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall adhere to his wife [or cleave to c. see Matthew 19.5]
\p
\v 8 . And they shall two be one flesh [that is one body or one man] so that they be no more two but one flesh.
\p
\v 9 . That therefore which God hath joined together [G rut together as into one yoak ] let not man separate [namely contrary to or without Gods ordinance or otherwise then for fornication as is exprest Matthew 5.32 Matthew 19.9.]
\p
\v 10 . And in the house of his disciples asked him again of the same matter.
\p
\v 11 . And he said unto them whosoever forsake his wife and marries another he committed adultery against her [namely whom he forsakes because he doth not keep the faith which he hath promised her Malachi 2.14.]
\p
\v 12 . And if a wife shall forsake her husband and marry with another she committed adultery.
\p
\v 13 . And they brought [or carried] little children unto him that he might touch them [that is by lying on his hands bless them Matthew 19.13 like as he did verse 16] and the disciples rebuked those that brought them unto him.
\p
\v 14 . But Jesus seeing that took it very ill and said unto them suffer the little children come unto me and hinder them not from their that are such is the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 15 . Verily I say unto ye whosoever receiveth not the kingdom of God as a little child [namely in simplicity uprightness and humility] he shall no wise enter into the same.
\p
\v 16 . And he embraced them with his arms and having laid the hands upon them he blessed them.
\p
\v 17 . And he went forth on his way there came one running to him and falling on his knees before him asked him God masters what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
\p
\v 18 . And Jesus said unto him what callest [Gr sayst] thou me good? There is none but one namely God [see hereof the annotations on Matthew 19.17.]
\p
\v 19 . Thou knowest the commandment thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear no false witnesses thou shalt not abuse no man [namely neither by deceit nor otherwise instead of which Christ faith Matthew 19.19 thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self so that this is a short summary of the fore going commandment] honour thy father and thy mother.
\p
\v 20 . But he answering said unto him master all these things I have observed from my youth.
\p
\v 21 . And Jesus looking on him loved him [that is shewed him some signs of an inclination towards him as this word sometimes also signifieth for Christ love those also in some sort which outwardly carry themselves according to Gods commandments see further the annotation on Matthew 19.17c.] and said to him one thing that lackest [namely that thou lovest not God and his word above all which not withstanding is the principal thing in the law ]go thy way sell all that thou hast [this was an extraordinary command which Christ gives this young man to try him and to make his imperfection appear] and give it to the poor and thou shalt have a treasure in heaven and come hither take up the cross and follow me .
\p
\v 22 . But he being made sad [or sullen perplexed] at that word went away grieved for he had much chattels [Gr possession]
\p
\v 23 . And Jesus looking round about said to his disciples how hardly shall they that have goods enter into the kingdom of God?
\p
\v 24 . And the disciples were astonished at these his words but Jesus again answering said unto them children how hard is it for those who put their trust in good to enter into the kingdom of God ?
\p
\v 25 . It is easier for a camel to go thorow the eye of a needle [see hereof the annotation on Matthew 19.24] then for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 26 . And they were yet more astonished saying one to another whom then can be saved?
\p
\v 27 . But Jesus looking upon them he said with man it is impossible but not with God [see hereof likewise Matthew 19.26] for all thing are possible with God.
\p
\v 28 . And Peter began to say unto him behold we have lest all and have followed thee.
\p
\v 29 . And Jesus answering said verily I say unto thee there is no man that have left house or brethren or sisters or fathers or mothers or wife or children or friends for my sake and the gospels sake .
\p
\v 30 . But he receiveth an hundred fold and much more worthier then that which he leaves for the least blessings of God with a quiet conscience is more worth then all the goods of the world 1 Timothy .6.6] now in this time the time houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and fields together with persecution[that is in the midst of all tribulations and in the world to come eternal life .
\p
\v 31 . But many first [that is which in outward zeal and worship seem to be the first] shall be the last and many that are the last shall be the first.
\p
\v 32 . And they were on the way going up towards Jerusalem and Jesus went before them [namely to shew his willingness to suffer] and they were astonished and following him they were afraid [because Christ had told them before like as afterwards he relateth again what he was to suffer at Jerusalem John 11.8 and they knew that the Jews had concluded in their counsel to put him to death John 11.53,57] And taking the twelve unto him again he began to tell them the things which should happen unto him .
\p
\v 33 . Saying behold we go up to Jerusalem and the son of man shall be delivered over the chief priest and to the Scribes and they shall condemn him to death and deliver him over to the gentiles.
\p
\v 34 . And they shall mock him and scourge him and spit upon him and kill him and on the third day he shall arise again.
\p
\v 35 . And there came unto James and John the son of Zebedee saying [namely by their mother as appears by Matthew 0.20] master we will thou wouldst do that for us which we shall request.
\p
\v 36 . And he said unto them what will ye that I should do for ye?
\p
\v 37 . And they said unto him give or grant us that we may sit the one at thy right hand and the other at thy left hand in thy glory [see hereof Matthew 20 verse 21]
\p
\v 38 . But Jesus said unto them ye know that what you request are ye able to drink the cup which I drink? And be baptized with the baptism wherewith I baptized? [See the exposition hereof on Matthew 20.22]
\p
\v 39 . And they said unto him we are able but Jesus said unto them the cup which I drink ye shall indeed drink of and be baptized with the baptism wherewith I am baptized.
\p
\v 40 . But the sitting at my right and at my left hand is not in my power to give but it shall be given to those it is prepared for [Gr is not mine or is not in my power to give but to them for whom it is prepared see Matthew 20.23]
\p
\v 41 . And when the other ten heard this they began to take it very ill of James and John [because they thought that this request was prejudicial to them.]
\p
\v 42 . But Jesus having called them unto him said unto them ye know that they which are accounted [or which would be thought] to be rulers of the people [otherwise of the gentiles] bear sway over them and their great ones exercise authority over them [see hereof likewise Matthew 20.25.]
\p
\v 43 . Yet it shall not be so among ye but whosoever will be great among ye the same shall be your servant.
\p
\v 44 . And whosoever of ye will be the first the same shall be the servant of all
\p
\v 45 . For even the son of man came not to be served but to save and to give his soul [or life] for a ransom [or release money which is given for the release of captive] for many.
\p
\v 46 . And they came to Jericho [this city was situate near Gilgal about Jordan of which see Joshua 4. 19] and as he and his disciples and a great multitude went out of Jericho there sate the son of Timeus blind Bartimeus [the evangelist Matthew speak of the two blind men but Mark makes mention only of him that was most known and cried most of the two] by the way begging.
\p
\v 47 . And hearing that it was Jesus the Nazarite he began to cry and to say Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me
\p
\v 48 . And many rebuked him that he should hold his peace but he cried so much the more thou son of David have mercy on me
\p
\v 49 . And Jesus standing still said they should call him and they called the blind man saying unto him be of good chear arise he calleth thee
\p
\v 50 . And he having cast off his cloak [Gr his garment that is his upper garment] arose and came to Jesus.
\p
\v 51 . And Jesus answering said unto him what wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And the blind man said unto him Rabboni [this signifieth the same with the word Rabbi which is interpreted master John 20.16] that I may receive my sight
\p
\v 52 . And Jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith hath saved thee [that is made thee whole or seeing not that this was done by the power of faith but because the same resting upon Christ and his power was a means thereof] and straightway he received sight and followed Jesus on the way.

\p
\v 1 And when he drew nigh to Jerusalem unto Bethphage and Bethany [Gr in that as is about as is exprest Luke 19.29 of the condition of these two places see Matthew 21.1]at the mount of Olives he sent forth his two disciples.
\p
\v 2 . And he said unto them go your way into the village that is over against ye and straightway when ye come into the same ye shall find a colt tied [Matthew 21.2 it is said that there was likewise a she-ass tied with her colt but mark makes mention of the colt only because Christ rode on thereon see Luke 19.35] on which no man [Gr none of man that is no man] hath sate loose it and bring it
\p
\v 3 . And if any men say unto ye why do ye that? Say ye that the Lord need of the same and he will straightway send it hither.
\p
\v 4 . And they went their way and found the colt tied by the door without at the parting of the ways [or cross-way two ways bivium] and they loosed the same
\p
\v 5 . And some of them that stood there said unto them what do ye that ye loose the colt?
\p
\v 6 . But they said unto them as Jesus has commanded and they let them go.
\p
\v 7 . And they brought the colt to Jesus [see of this the entrance of Christ into Jerusalem and annotations on Matthew 21.1] and cast their garment upon it and he sate on the same
\p
\v 8 . And many spread their garments on the way and others cut branches [the Greek word signifies little tender green branches which are fit to sit and walk upon see also John 12.13] from the trees and spread them on the way
\p
\v 9 . And they that went before and they that followed cried saying Hosanna [what this word signifies see Matthew 21.9] blessed is he [or praised be he] which cometh in name of the Lord
\p
\v 10 Blessed (be) the Kingdom of our Father David, which cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest (Heavens) [that isk thou which art in the highest Heavens.]
\p
\v 11 . And Jesus came into Jerusalem and into temple and when he had beheld all things round about and it was now Even-tide [Gr evening hour] he went out towards Bethany with the twelve.
\p
\v 12 . And the next day as they went out of Bethany he was hungry.
\p
\v 13 . And seeing a fig tree afar off which had leaves he went to see it perhaps he might find anything upon the same and being come to it he found nothing but leaves for it was not the time of figs [that is the right for ordinary fig-tree to have their full and ripe fruit although in those hot countries the fig tree-tree I even out of the season bear also some untimely fruits which used to be eaten by the common people and such it seems Christ thought to have found thereon ]
\p
\v 14 . And Jesus answering said unto the seme [The word answer according to the Hebrew phrase signifies often to begin to speak as here clearly appears] let no man eat any fruit of thee forever and his disciples heard it.
\p
\v 15 . And they came to Jerusalem and Jesus being gone into the temple he began to drive out them that sold and bought in the temple and overturned the table of the changers and the chairs of them that sold doves.
\p
\v 16 . And suffered not that any man should carry any vessel [namely not belonging to the service of God] through the temple.
\p
\v 17 . And he taught saying unto them is it not written my house shall be called [that is be and be accounted] an house of prayer to all nations? But ye have made it a den of murderers.
\p
\v 18 . And the Scribes and the chief priests heard that and sought how they might put him to death [Gr destroy and ruine him] for they feared him because the whole multitude was astonished at his doctrine [or was striken namely through admiration and therefore they feared that all people would adhere to his doctrine and fall away from them]
\p
\v 19 . And when it was now grown late he went forth without the city.
\p
\v 20 . And early in the morning passing by they saw that fig-tree has withered from the very roots.
\p
\v 21 . And Peter calli9ng this to mind [namely that which was said before by Christ verse 14] aid unto him Rabbi behold the fig-tree they which thou curseth is withered.
\p
\v 22 . And Jesus answering said unto them have faith in God [Gr have the faith of God that is which firmly relies and trusts on God and his promises]
\p
\v 23 . For verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say to this mountain be lifted up and cast into the sea and shall not doubt inhis heart but shall believe that which h saith shall come to pass it shall happen to him according to what he saith.
\p
\v 24 . Therefore I say unto you all things which ye desire praying [namely according to the will of God see 1 John 5.14] believe that ye shall receive them [Gr do receive] and they shall happen unto ye.
\p
\v 25 . And when ye stand [that is appear before God and present yourself there to pray for howsoever the ews sometimes prayed standing Job 30.20 Jeremiah 15.1 Luke 18.13 yet for the most part they prayed n their knees 2 Chronicles 6.13 Daniel 6.10 Acts 9.40 and 20.36] for to pray [Gr praying] forgive if ye have ought against any man that your father also which is in heaven may forgive ye your trespasses.
\p
\v 26 . But if ye forgive not neither shall your father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses.
\p
\v 27 . And they came again to Jerusalem and as they walked in the temple there came to him the chief priests the Scribes and the elders [that is the rulers of the eldest of the people who together the chief priest and the scribes made up a great council of the Jews at that time]
\p
\v 28 . And said unto him by what authority [Gr in what authority] doth thou these things? And who gave thee the authority that thou shouldst do those things?
\p
\v 29 . But Jesus answering said unto them I will also ask ye one word [that is one thing Hebrew] and answer me and I will tell ye by what authority I do those things.
\p
\v 30 . The baptism of John [that is the doctrine of John confirmed by baptism as appears by the following verse] was that out of heaven or of men? Answer me.
\p
\v 31 . And they reasoned among themselves saying if we say out of heaven then he will say why then did ye not believe him?
\p
\v 32 . But if we say of men then we fear the people [Gr they feared it is an imperfect manner of speaking whereby their disturbance and reasoning are briefly exprest] for they held concerning John that he was a prophet indeed.
\p
\v 33 . And answering they said unto Jesus we know it is not And Jesus answering said unto them neither do I tell ye by what authority I do these things.
\c 12
\s By the similitude of a vine yard let out to husbandmen who misused and killed their Lords servants and son Christ declares to the Jews their rejection and destruction 1 Answers the question whether it be lawful to give tribute to Cesar 13 as also the question of the seduces concerning a woman which had had seven husbands and proves against them the resurrection from the dead 18 declares which is the greatest commandment 28 teacheth that the Messiah is both the Lord and the son of David 35 warns his bearers of the ambition and of the hypocrisy of the Scribe s38 commends the small alms for poor widow 41.
\p
\v 1 And he began to say unto them by similitude [Gr parables see the exposition thereof Matthew 13.3 ] a man planted a vineyard [see the exposition of the similitude Matthew 21.33 ] and set a fence about it [or mound hedge ] and digged a wine-press trough [namely into the wine runs and is gathered together under the press ]and built a tower and hired it out [Gr gave it out] to husbandmen [or tillers of the land whereby here are chiefly understood laborers in the vineyards ] and traveled out of the land.
\p
\v 2 . And when the time was [that is at the fit or due time when the fruits being rip were gathered in] he sent a servant to the husbandmen and he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.
\p
\v 3 . But they took him and beat him and sent him away empty.
\p
\v 4 . And again he sent another servant unto them and at him they cast stones and wounded him in the head and sent hi away shamefully misused [Gr dishonored]
\p
\v 5 . And again he sent another and him they killed and many other whereof they beat some and kill some.
\p
\v 6 . Having then one son yet whom he loved he sent hi also at last unto them [Gr the last] saying surely they will respect my son
\p
\v 7 . But those husbandmen said to one another those are the heir come let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours.
\p
\v 8 . And they took and killed him and cast him out without the vineyard.
\p
\v 9 . What shall therefore the Lord of the vineyard do? He shall come and destroy the husbandmen and give the vineyard to others this the Pharisees themselves answer to the demand of Christ in Matthew 21 verse 41 and is here ascribe to Christ because the repeated the same answer and approved of it ]
\p
\v 10 . Have ye not also had the Scripture? The stone which the builders rejected the same is become on head of the corner [see the exposition hereof Matthew 21 verse 42]
\p
\v 11 . Of the Lord this is done [otherwise hac namely res thing or hoc namely caput head of the cornet is come to pass by the Lord] and it is marvelous in our eyes.
\p
\v 12 . And they sought to take but they feared the multitude for they understood that he spake that similitude of them and they left him and went their way.
\p
\v 13 . And they sent unto him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians [of the Herodian see the exposition Matthew 22.16] that they might catch him [the Greek word is a similitude taken from the hunters and fishers who catch wild beasts or fishes with snares nets and traps] in his speech [or by their word that is by their question]
\p
\v 14 . Now these came and said unto him master we know that thou art true and carest for no man for thou respectest not the person of men [Gr the face see hereof Matthew 22.16] but thou taechest the way of God [that is the doctrine which God prescribes to come to salvation] in truth is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar or not? Shall we give or not give?
\p
\v 15 . And he knowing their hypocrisy said unto them what tempt ye me? Bring me a penny [Gr denarius’s whereof Matthew 18.28] that I may see it.
\p
\v 16 . And they brought one and he said unto them whose is this image and the superscription? And they said unto him Cesar’s.
\p
\v 17 . And Jesus answering said unto them give therefore unto Cesar that which is Cesar’s and to God that which is Gods and they marveled at him.
\p
\v 18 . And the seduces [of the sect of the seduces see Acts 23.8] came unto him which say that there is no resurrection and asked him saying.
\p
\v 19 . Master Moses wrote unto us [this law pertained to the civil laws of the Jews and likewise something ceremonial and therefore ceased with the Jewish polity] if any mans brother die and leave a wife behind him and leave no children but his brother shall take the wife of the same and raise up seed unto his brother [that is a son which bare the name of the deceased and was his heir.]
\p
\v 20 . Now there were seven brethren and the first took a wife and dying left no seed behind.
\p
\v 21 . The second took her also and died and this likewise left no seed behind and the third likewise.
\p
\v 22 . And all the seven took the same and left no seed behind last of the entire wife died also.
\p
\v 23 . In the resurrection thereof they shall be risen whose wife shall she be of these? For those seven had her to wife.
\p
\v 24 . And Jesus answering said unto them do ye not err therefore because ye know not the scripture neither the power of God?
\p
\v 25 . For when they shall be risen from dead they do not marry neither are given in marriage but they are as angels which are in the heaven.
\p
\v 26 . But concerning the dead that they shall be raised up have ye not read in the book of Moses how God spake to him in the thorn-bush [or bramble-bush or bramble as Luke 6 verse 44] saying I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob?
\p
\v 27 . God is not a God of the dead but a God of the living [of the sense and force of this argument see Matthew 22.32] ye therefore do err greatly [Gr much]
\p
\v 28 . and one of the scribes hearing that they heard words together [that is disputed together by mutual questioning and answers ]and knowing that he had answered them well came unto him and asked him which is the first commandment of all ?[that is the chiefest and greatest of the whole law of God ]
\p
\v 29 . And Jesus answered him the first of all commandments is hear o Israel the Lord our God is an only Lord [the Hebrew word Jehova here rendered Lord signifies the divine essence which subfist in and of itself from all eternity and gives all things their being .]
\p
\v 30 . And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thane understanding [or cogitation that is weighing pondering in the understanding] and with all thy strength this is first commandment.
\p
\v 31 . And the second like to this is this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy self there is no other commandment greater than these [namely these two principal commandment]
\p
\v 32 . And the scribes said unto him master thou hast said well in truth that there is no only God and there is none other but he.
\p
\v 33 . And to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the soul and with all the strength and to love his neighbor as himself is more then all burnt-offerings and sacrifices [burnt-offerings were offerings which were laid upon the altar and there were wholly burnt sacrifices of which but a part was only burnt on the altar and the other parts were eaten as well by the priest and Levites as by those that offered although sometimes this word is also taken more largely see Leviticus chapter 1 and 2 &c.]
\p
\v 34 . And Jesus seeing that he had answered understandingly said unto him thou art not far from the kingdom of God [for as much as this his confession seemed to proceed from a teachable disposition verse32 and thus far agreed with the doctrine of Christ and the knowledge of law might be a means to bring him further to knowledge of himself and so forward unto Christ Galatians 3.19] and no man durst ask him any more.
\p
\v 35 . And Jesus answered and said teaching in the temple how the scribes that the Christ is a son of David said?
\p
\v 36 . For David himself said by the Holy Ghost the lord said unto my Lord sit at my right hand [see further hereof Matthew 22.44] until I shall have put thine enemies for a footstool of thy feet.
\p
\v 37 . David therefore himself calleth he his Lord and how is he his son? [Gr whence] and the multitude of the people heard him gladly
\p
\v 38 . And he said unto them in his doctrine beware of the Scribes [Gr look before ye viz that ye be not deceived by their outward shews not by their example be brought to the like hypocrisy]which love to walk in long garments [Gr stoilais which signifies long coats and gowns down to the feet thereby to be the most esteemed and regarded by man so that the Christ doth not here reject the garments but the ambition which was hidden under them ] and he saluted [Gr salutation namely to have them ] in the markets .
\p
\v 39 . And have the foremost feats in the synagogue and upper places at meats [Gr supper]
\p
\v 40 . Who cat up the window houses and that under the shews of praying long these shall receive heavier [Gr more abundant] judgment [that is heavier punishment in the judgment]
\p
\v 41 . And Jesus being set over against the treasure-chest [of the treasure-chest see 2 Kings 12.9 and Matthew 27.6] say how the multitude cast money [Gr brass] into the treasure-chest and many rich ones cast much into it.
\p
\v 42 . And there came a poor widow which cast two small pieces of money intoit which is a farthing [Gr Kedrantes from the Latin Quadrans that is the forth part of an obolus which was the sixth part of drachin of silver which sixth part according to our rekoning is about a stiver so that a quadrans after our account is about the fourth part of a silver]
\p
\v 43 . And Jesus having called his disciples unto him said unto them verily I say unto thee that this poor widow hath cast in more then all those that hath cast into the treasure-chest
\p
\v 44 . For they all of their abundance there into but she of her want [or of that whereof she had need herself] hath cast all that she had there into her whole livelihood [Gr life that is what she had left and needed for a live upon.]

\s Christ foretells the desolation of the temple and o the city Jerusalem 1 joining therewith the troubles and signs which should happen before and about the same 5 and between both comforts his with the happy progress of the gospel and with the assistance of the Holy Ghost exhorting them to steadfastness 10 he directs them to the Prophecy of Daniel and counsel them to flee betimes to escape that great misery 14 warns them against the seduction and miracles of false Christ and false prophets 21 describes further the signs of the end of the world and his coming to judgment the day whereof is known to the father only 24 and therefore exhorts to continual watching and prayer.33.
\p
\v 1 And as he went out of the temple [namely go to Bethany as appears by the third verse and chapter 14 .3] one of the disciple said unto him master see what manner of stones and what manner of building [that is how exceeding great fair stones these are whereof the temple is built for they were twenty five cubits long and eight high and twelve broad see Joseph Antiq lib 15 chapter 14 this they say admitting]
\p
\v 2 . And Jesus answering said unto him seest thou these great buildings? They shall not one stone be left on the other stone [Gr thee shall not be left stone upon stone] which shall not be broken down [Gr loosened]
\p
\v 3 . And as he sate upon the Mount of Olives over against the temple Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him alone [or aside in private]
\p
\v 4 . Tell us when shall these things be [namely the desolation of the city and temple of Jerusalem and likewise the consummation of the world see Matthew 24.3] and which is the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?
\p
\v 5 . And Jesus answering them began to say look to it that no man seduce ye.
\p
\v 6 . For many shall come under my name see hereof and of Christ whole answer the annotations on Matthew 24.5] saying I am the Christ and shall seduce many.
\p
\v 7 . And hen ye shall hear of the wars the rumours of the wars be not affrighted for this must happen but yet it is not the end.
\p
\v 8 . For the one nation shall rise against the other and one kingdom against the other kingdom and there shall be earth quake in divers places [Gr from place to place] and there shall be famines and trouble these things are but beginning of pains.
\p
\v 9 . But look ye to yourselves [or take ye heed to yourselves] from they shall deliver ye over into the council [Gr synedria see thereof Matthew 5.22 and 10.17] and into the synagogues ye shall be beaten and ye shall be put before governors and kings for my sake for a testimony unto them.
\p
\v 10 . And the gospel must first be preached amongst all nations
\p
\v 11 . But when they shall lead ye to deliver ye over be not careful before hand [see hereof the annotations on Matthew 10.19] what ye shall speak neither take ye thought of it but whatsoever shall be given ye in that hour that speak ye fro it is not ye that speak but the Holy Ghost [namely which speaketh in and by you Matthew 10.10]
\p
\v 12 . And the one brother shall deliver over the other to death and the father to child and the children shall rise up against the parents and shall put them to death [or bring them to death cause them to be put to death]
\p
\v 13 . And ye shall be hated of all [that is of all forts of unbelieving man] for my name sake but he that shall endure to the end he shall be saved.
\p
\v 14 . When therefore ye shall see the abominations of desolation [see the exposition Matthew 24.15] whereof is spoken by the prophet Daniel standing where it ought not [that is in the holy place round about Jerusalem Matthew 24.15 Luke 21.20] he that readeth let him observe it and those that are in Judea let them flee up upon the mountains.
\p
\v 15 . And he that is on the house top roof [see hereof the annotations on Matthew 10.27] let him come down into the house neither enter therein to take ought away out of his house
\p
\v 16 . And he that is in the field let him not turn back again [Gr to the things which area behind] for to take his garment
\p
\v 17 . But wo to the women with child giving suck in those days
\p
\v 18 . But pray that your flight do not happen in the winter.
\p
\v 19 . For in those days shall be such affliction the like whereof was not from the beginning of the creatures [Gr of the creatures] which God created until now nor yet shall be [that is one affliction shall follow upon affliction see the like phrase Amos 5.20 Joel 2.2]
\p
\v 20 . And if the Lord had not shortened the days [see hereof the annotations on Matthew 24.22] no flesh should be saved but for the elects sake whom he hath chosen he hath shortened the days
\p
\v 21 . And then if any man shall say unto ye Lo here is Christ or Lo he is there believe it not.
\p
\v 22 . For they shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall do [Gr give] signs and wonders to seduce if it were possible the very elect.
\p
\v 23 . But take ye heed behold I have foretold ye all things
\p
\v 24 . But in those days after the tribulation [and after that the time of the gentiles shall also be fulfilled as also Luke adds Luke 21 verse24] the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her shining
\p
\v 25 . And the stars in heaven shall fall down and the powers in heaven shall be moved [the Greek word properly signifies a violent moving like as the sea is driven up and down by wind and tempest]
\p
\v 26 . And then shall they [namely all the nations of the earth Revelations 1.7] see the son of man coming in the cloud with great [Gr much] power and glory.
\p
\v 27 . And then he send forth his angels and shall gather together the elect from the four winds [that is out of he four corners or quarters of the world from one end to another] from the uttermost part of the earth unto the uttermost part of heaven
\p
\v 28 . And learn from the fig-tree this similitude when her branch is tender now [or sappy] and the leaves sprout forth ye know that the summer is near.
\p
\v 29 . So ye also when ye shall see things come to pass know that it [namely the kingdom of God as in Luke 21.31 in exprest] in nigh before the door.
\p
\v 30 . Verily I say unto ye that that this generation [namely of the Jewish people or the man of this age] shall not pass away [or perish] until all these tings shall be done.
\p
\v 31 . The heaven and the earth shall pass away [or perish] but my words shall in no wise pass away [or perish]
\p
\v 32 . But of that day and that hour knoweth no man nor the Angels which are in heaven nor the son [namely according to his humane nature and in the state of his humiliation for according to his go head he knows all things John 21.17] and after the exaltation the book of Gods providence sealed with seven seals in more fully opened unto him Revelations 5.5, 7, 9] but the father.

\s The chief priest and the Scribes seek occasion to put Christ to death 1 a woman anoints him at Bethany which deed Christ defends 3 He is by Judas sold for money by the chief priest priests 10causeth the pass-over to be made ready and eateth with his disciples 12 and reveals the treachery of Judas 18 institutes his supper 22 foretells his disciples of their scattering and Peter of his fall 27 Begins his suffering in the garden with great anguish and prayeth to the father 32 exhorting his disciples to watchfulness 37 is by Judas betrayed with a kiss 43 seized by the Jews 46 wherefore Peter cuts off the ear of the one of them 49 is forsaken for his disciples 50 brought before the council of the Jews 53 accused by false witnesses 56 examined by the high priest 60 As blasphemer declared guilty of death and reproachfully abused 63 Peter denies him thrice 66 and bewails it 72.
\p
\v 1 And the pass-over [see hereof Matthew 26.2] and the feast of the unleavened bread [so the feast of the pass-over is called because on that feast no leavened bread might be eaten for seven days together see Exodus 12.15 Leviticus 23.6] was two days after and the chief priest and Scribes sought how they might seize him by craft and put him to death
\p
\v 2 . But they said not in the feast left perhaps there be an uproar among [Gr of] the people
\p
\v 3 . And when he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the Leper where he sate at a table there came a woman [namely Mary the sister of Lazarus see Job 12.3] having an alabaster box with anointment of unsophisticated Nardus [Gr pistike that is faithful or upright but some translate it flowing or potable because it used also to be mingled with drink others anointment of spikenard see John 12.3] of great price and having broken the alabaster box she poured it on his head.
\p
\v 4 . And there were some [of which the principal was Judas and Traitour see John12.4] which took that very ill by themselves and said wherefore is this waste made of ointment?
\p
\v 5 . For the same might have been sold for above three hundred pence [Gr Denarii the value whereof is declared in Matthew 18.28 so that this sum would amount to ninety gilders and nine pounds steri] and those given to the poor and they were incensed against her [or grumbled with great discontent]
\p
\v 6 . But Jesus said let her alone what do ye trouble her? She bathed wrought a good work on me
\p
\v 7 . For the poor ye have always with you and when ye will ye can do them good but me ye have not always
\p
\v 8 . She hath done that which she was able [Gr that which she had ]she came before hand to anoint [or embalm ]my body [as the custome was to embalm the bodies of emirrent persons with precious ointment made of several spices before they were buried to preserve them from purification see Genesis 50.26] for a preparation to the burial .
\p
\v 9 . Verily I say unto ye whosoever this gospel [namely which I have hither to taught and published] shall be preached in the whole world there shall also be spoken of hat which she hath done for a memorial of her.
\p
\v 10 . And Judas Iscariot one of the twelve went away to the chief priests for to deliver him up unto them
\p
\v 11 . And they hearing that were glad promised to give him money [Gr silver namely thirty silver pence as Matthew 26.15 ]and he sought how he might conveniently deliver him up [Gr at a convenient time that is with good opportunity ]
\p
\v 12 . And on the first day of the unleavened bread when thy killed the Passover [that is according to Gods law they were to kill it as Luke speaks chapter 2. for the Jews this time killed it the day after and the reason whereof is given in the annotations on Matthew 26 verse 20] his disciples said unto hi where with thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the Passover? [That is the paschal lamb a sacramental manner of speaking.]
\p
\v 13 . And he sent forth two of his disciples and said unto them go your way into the city [namely Jerusalem where the pass over was to be killed and eaten Deuteronomy 16.5] and he shall a man meet you bearing a pitcher of water [or an earth vessel] follow him.
\p
\v 14 . And there he entereth say to the master of the house saith where is the dinning room [Gr loosening relaxation that is the chamber here the guests are entertained] where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples?
\p
\v 15 . And he shall shew you a great upper room dressed [Gr spread floored strawed] and prepared there make it ready for us
\p
\v 16 . And his disciples went forth and came into the city and found it as he had said unto them and they made ready the pass-over.
\p
\v 17 . And when it was become evening became with the twelve.
\p
\v 18 . And as they sate and did eat Jesus said verily I say unto that one of you which eateth with me shall betray me.
\p
\v 19 . And they began to be sorrowful one after another [Gr one after one] to say unto him is it I? And another is it I?
\p
\v 20 . But he answered and said unto them it is one of the twelve [see Matthew 26.23] which dippeth in with me in the platter.
\p
\v 21 . The son of man goeth away indeed as it is written of him but woe to that man whom the son of man is betrayed it were good for him if that man were not been born.
\p
\v 22 . And as they did eat Jesus took bread and when he had blessed he brake it and gave it to them and said take eat that is my body of these words of institution of the Lords supper see the annotations on Matthew 26.26 and the following verse]
\p
\v 23 . And took the cup and having given thanks having given to them and they all drank of the same [namely as Christ had commanded them Matthew 26.27]
\p
\v 24 . And he said unto them that is my blood of the New Testament which is shed for many
\p
\v 25 . Verily I say unto ye that I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I shall drink the same new in the kingdom of God
\p
\v 26 . And when they had sung an hymn or song of praise they went out in the Mount of Olives
\p
\v 27 . And Jesus said unto them in the night ye shall all be offended at me [that is your faith will be shaken by that which shall befall me ]for it is written I will smite the shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered .
\p
\v 28 . But after that I shall be risen I will go before ye towards Galilee
\p
\v 29 . And Peter said unto him though even all of them should be offended ye will not I be offended [namely at thee as is exrest Matthew 26 verse 33.]
\p
\v 30 . And Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee that today in the night before the cock shall have crowed twice [the other evangelist say simple before the cock shall crow or shall have crowed but Mark saith twice because the use commonly to crow at two several times once after midnight and once towards ay both which times are here to be understood] thou shalt deny me thrice.
\p
\v 31 . but he said yet so much the more, although I must die thee, yet will I no wife denies thee. And in like manner also said they all.
\p
\v 32 . And they came into a place [or, row, or ally of houses, or gardening: see matth. 26.26.] whose name was Gethsemane and he said unto his disciples, sit down here, until I shall have prayed.
\p
\v 33 . And he took with Peter, and James and john, and began to be amazed and much distressed.
\p
\v 34 . And said unto them, my soul is thorowly sorrowful, [or, on all sides] even unto death; Tarry ye here, and watch.
\p
\v 35 . And being gone forth a little fell on the ground and prayed, if it were possible that hour [viz. of his grievous suffering now at hand] might pass from him. [Of this whole prayer, see the annotations on Matth. 16.39.]
\p
\v 36 . And he said, abba, father, [Abba is a Syriack word signifying father: which word father the Evangelist addeth likewise, not only by way of exposition, but by that repetition, to set forth the exceeding great earnestness of Christ in prayer. See hereof, Rom. 8.15. Gal. 4.6.] All things are possible unto thee: take this cup away from me; yet not what I will, but what thou (wilt).
\p
\v 37 . And he came and sound them sleeping, and said unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? Canst thou not watch one hour?
\p
\v 38 . Watch ye and pray, that ye come not into temptation, the spirit (indeed) is willing, nut the flesh is weak.
\p
\v 39 . And being gone away again, he prayed, speaking the same words. [Gr. Word, r speech.]
\p
\v 40 . And being returned, he found them sleeping again: for their eyes were heavy, and they knew not what to answer him.
\p
\v 41 . And he came the third time, and said unto them, sleep on (now) [see Math. 26.45] and rest. It is enough: the hour is come. Behold, the son of man is delivered over into the hands of sinners. [That is, of the Gentiles: as Matth. 20.19.]
\p
\v 42 . Arise, let us go: behold, he that betrayed me, is hard by.
\p
\v 43 . And immediately while he yet spake, came Judas, who was one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, [Gr. Word: that is, spears, halberds, lances] (sent) from the chief priests, and the scribes and the elders.
\p
\v 44 . And he betrayed him, had given them a common token, [that is, such a sign, or watch-word, which they should well understand among themselves] saying, he whom I shall kisse, that is he, lay hold on him, and lead him away securely.
\p
\v 45 . And he was gone, he went presently unto him and said, Rabbi and kissed him.
\p
\v 46 . And they laid their hands on him, and took him.
\p
\v 47 . And one of those that stood by, [namely, Simon Peter, as appears out of John 18.10] drawing the sword, smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
\p
\v 48 . And Jesus answering, said unto them; are ye come forth with swords and staves, as against a murderer, [or, high-way-robber] for to take me? [These words he speaks properly to some of the chief priests and captains of the temple, who had brought these souldiers along with them Luke 22.52.]
\p
\v 49 . I was daily with you in the temple, teaching ye took me not; but (this comes to pass) [so Matthew relates this, chapter 26.56] that the scriptures might be fulfilled.
\p
\v 50 . And they [viz. his disciples] forsaking him, fled all.
\p
\v 51 . And a certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth put about [Gr. Cast about] upon the naked (body) and the young man laid hold on him. [These seem to have been some young souldiers. This passage is related to shew the fierceness of those that took Christ.]
\p
\v 52 . And he leaving the linen cloth, fled from them naked.
\p
\v 53 . And they led Jesus away to the high priest, namely, Caiaphas, see Matth. 26.57. John 18 verse 13.] and unto him assembled all the chief priests, and the elders, and the scribes.
\p
\v 54 . And Peter followed him afar off into the very hall of the priest; and he was sitting together with the servants and so warmed himself by the fire. [Gr. By the light.]
\p
\v 55 And the chief priests, and the whole council [Gr. Synedrion. See thereof, Matth. 5.22.] sought withness against Jesus to put him to death, and found nothing.
\p
\v 56 . For many witness falsly against him, and the witnesses were not agreeing.
\p
\v 57 . And some rising up, [Matth. 26.61. tells of two, whereof the one spake otherwise then the other; as also the Evangelists do diversely relate their testimonies] witnessed falsely against him, saying,
\p
\v 58 . We heard him say, I will break down this temple that is made with hands, and in three dayes build another, made without hands.
\p
\v 59 . And neither so was their witness agreeing.
\p
\v 60 . And the high priest standing in the midst asked Jesus, saying, Aswerest thou nothing? What do these witness against thee?
\p
\v 61 . But he held his peace and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, art thou the Christ the son of the blessed (God)?
\p
\v 62 . And Jesus said, I am, and ye shall see the son of man sit at the right (hand) of the power of God) [that is, at the powerful right hand of God] and come with the clouds of Heaven. [That is, upon the clouds, matth. 26.64. Or in the clouds, as Mark 13.26.]
\p
\v 63 . And the high priest rending his cloaths, [Gr. Word his coats] said, what need have we yet of witness?
\p
\v 64 . Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think yee? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.
\p
\v 65 . And some began to bespit him, and to cover his face and to smite him with fists and unto him, prophecy, and the servants gave him blowes on the cheeks, [or smote him with sticks or rods.]
\p
\v 66 . And as Peter was beneath in the hall, there came one of the maid-servants of the maid-servants of the high priest.
\p
\v 67 . And seeing Peter warning himself, she looked upon him, and said, thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth. [Namely, as one of his disciples.]
\p
\v 68 . But he denyed him, saying, I know (him) not neither know I what thou sayest. And he went out into the fore-house, [Or, porch] and the cock crew. [Namely, the first time as appears verse 72.]
\p
\v 69 . And the servant seeing him again, [About an hour after. See Luke 22.59.] Began to say to those that stood by. This is one of them.
\p
\v 70 . But he denyed it again. And a little after those that stood by, [namely, a servant of the high priest and kin to him whose ear Peter had cut off. See John 18.26.] said again unto Peter, truly thou art one of them; for thou art also a Galilean, and thy speech is like (theirs). [I.e. agreeth with their speech.]
\p
\v 71 . And he begun to curse (himself) and to swear, I do not know this man of whom ye speak.
\p
\v 72 . And the cock crowed the second time, and Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said unto him, before the cock shall crowed twice, thou shalt deny me thy ice. And getting himself thence or among the people. Or, beginning or bursting out; namely, into weeping] he wept.

\s Christ is by the Jewes delivered up to Pilate, and accused before him: whereof being examined he holds his peace, 1. Pilate endeavors to release him; but upon the importunity of the people, he lets Barabbas loose, and delivers Christ over to be crucified, 6, whom the souldiers mock and abuse, 16. Simon of Cyrene is compelled to bear his cross, 21. There is offered him myrrhewine, 23, he is crucified with two murderers, 24 and reviled by those that pass by, 29. Darkness cometh upon the earth, 33. Christ cryeth to his father and is mocked for It., 34, and as soon as vinegar was presented to him he gives up the ghost, 36. The vail of the Temple rends, 38. Certain women beheld it afar off, 40. Christ is buried by Joseph of Arimathea, 42.
\p
\v 1 And straight away early in the morning, the chief priests held consultations together, with the elders, and scribes, and the whole council, and having bound Jesus, they brought him away and delivered him to Pilate. [The cause wherefore they delivered him up to Pilate, see matth. 27.2.]
\p
\v 2 . And Pilate asked him, art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering, said unto him, thou sayest it. [of this manner of speaking, see the annotations on Matth. 26.25.]
\p
\v 3 . And the chief priests accused him of many things but be answered nothing.
\p
\v 4 . And Pilate asked him again, saying, answerest thou nothing? Behold how many things they witness against thee.
\p
\v 5 . And Jesus answered nothing more, [Gr. No more any thing. The reason of this silence, see Matth. 27.14] so that Pilate marveled.
\p
\v 6 . And on the feast [or, on every feast; namely, of the Passover, see Job 18.39.] he released one prisoner unto them, whomsoever they desired.
\p
\v 7 . And there was one called barabbas, imprisoned with other co-partners in roar, who had uproar, who had committed murder in the uproar.
\p
\v 8 . And the multitude cryed out and began to crave (that he would do) as he had always done to them, [Namely, that he would release one prisoner unto them.]
\p
\v 9 . And Pilate answered them, saying, will ye that I release unto you the king of the Jews?
\p
\v 10 . (for he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up through envy.)
\p
\v 11 . But the chief priest stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.
\p
\v 12 . And Pilate answering, said again unto them, what will ye then that I shall do (with him) whom ye call a king of the Jews?
\p
\v 13 . And they cried again, crusifie him.
\p
\v 14 . But Pilate said unto them, what evil then hath he done? And they cryed the more, crusifie him.
\p
\v 15 . Now Pilate willing to satisfie the multitude, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus over, [Namely, to the captain and souldiers] having scouged him for to be crucified.
\p
\v 16 . And the souldiers led him into the hall, which is the judgement-house, [Gr. Praitotion, whereby is exprest the Latine word Praetorium, which signifies the place where the roman governours dwelt, and kept their Tribunal or Judgement-seat] and called the whole hand together.
\p
\v 17 . And put on him a purple cloak, [Gr. Cloathed him with purple; i.e. with a purple cloak; see hereof more at large the Annotatios do Matth. 27.28.] and having wreathed a crown of thorns, put the same upon him.
\p
\v 18 . And began to salute him, saying, hail thou king of the Jews.
\p
\v 19 . And smote his head with a reed, and spit upon him, and falling on the knees, worshipped him. [honoring him by way of mockery, as the heathens in earnest use to honour their kings.]
\p
\v 20 . And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple cloak from him and put his own cloaths upon him and led him forth to crucifie him.
\p
\v 21 . And they compelled one Simon of Cyrene who passed by there, coming from the f field, the father of Alexander and Rufus, [the names of these are here exprest because afterwards they were famous persons in the church of God: of whom there seems likewise mention to be made, rom. 16.13.] that he should bear his cross. [Namely, christs. See the cause in the Annotations on Matth. 27.32.]
\p
\v 22 . And they brought him to the place Golgotha, which is being interpreted scull-place. [see Matth. 27.33.]
\p
\v 23 . And they gave him myrrhe-wine to drink, [hereof see Matth. 27.34] but he took it not.
\p
\v 24 . And they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots on the same, what every one should take away.
\p
\v 25 . And it was the third hour, [these hours must be reckoned after the manner of the Jew, from the sun rising to sun-setting; see Matth. 20 verse 3. John 11.9. And seeing the passeover came then, about the time that the days and nights were of equal length, therefore the third hour agrees with our ninth, the sixth with our twelfth and the ninth with our third in the afternoon: John saith, chapter 19 verse 14 that it was about the sixth hour when he brought him forth. How this agrees, see the Annotations there] and they crucified him.
\p
\v 26 . And the superscription of his accusation was written over him, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\p
\v 27 . And the crucified him two murderers, [or, high way robbers] one his right, and one at his left (side).
\p
\v 28 . And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, and is reckoned with the evil-doers,
\p
\v 29 . And they that passed by, reviled him, shaking their heads and saying, Ha! Thou that breakest down the temple and buildest it up in three days:
\p
\v 30 . Save thy self, and come down from the cross.
\p
\v 31 . And in the like manner also the chief priests with the scribes, said one to another mocking him, he delivered others, he cannot deliver himself: [others, can not save himself?]
\p
\v 32 . Let the Christ the King of Israel come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe it. They also that were crucified with him, [namely, one of them. See Matth. 27.44. and Luke 23.29.] reproached him.
\p
\v 33 . And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole earth [of this darkness, see Matth. 27.45. as also all that follows] until the ninth hour.
\p
\v 34 . And at the ninth hour, Jesus cryed with a great voice, saying, ELOI, LAMMA SABACTHANI, which is being interpreted, My God, My God, wherefore hast thou forsaken me?
\p
\v 35 . And some of them that stood by, hearing this said, behold be calleth Elias.
\p
\v 36 . And there ran one, and filled a sprunge with vinegar and stuck it [or, put it] o a reed, and gave him drink, saying, hold: let us see whether Elias cometh to take him down.
\p
\v 37 . And Jesus having sent forth a great voice gave up the ghost.
\p
\v 38 . And the vail of the temple rent in twain from the top to the bottome. [see hereof, Matth. 27.51.]
\p
\v 39 . And the centurion which stood by, over against him, seeing that he had given up the ghost, crying thus; [Namely, with such a strong voice, Heb. 5.7. and that thereupon he did forthwith expire and withal seeing the miracles which happened thereupon, as is related, Matth. 27.54.] said truly this man was the son of God.
\p
\v 40 . And there were women also beholding this afar off, amongst whom also was Mary Magdalene, and Mary [the wife of Alpheus. See Matth. 10.3 and 27.56.] The mother of James the less, [that is, the younger; which was so sirnamed to distinguish him either from another James which was the son of Zebedee; or from his uncle the brother of Alpheus, as some think] and Joses and Salome. [this was the wife of Zebedee, as appears by this place compared with Matth. 27 .56.]
\p
\v 41 . Who also when he was in Galilee followed him, and had ministered unto him and many other (women) which were come up with him to Jerusalem:
\p
\v 42 . And when it was now become Evening, [Namely, on the day before the Sabbath] seeing it was the preparation, [namely, of the passeover, which the Jews at this time had put off unto the Sabbath. The reason hereof is related in the Annotations on Matth. 26.20.] which is the (day) before the Sabbath.
\p
\v 43 . (There) came Joseph, who (was) of Arimathea, an honourable Councellor, whom also himself looked for the kingdome of God, [namely, which should be set up by the Messiah, Luke 2.25.38] and emboldening himself he went in unto Pilate, and desired the body of Jesus.
\p
\v 44 . And Pilate wondred, that he was already dead, [Gr. Whether, or if] and having the Centurion unto him, he asked him whether he had been, long dead?
\p
\v 45 . And when he had understood if of the Centurion, he gave the body so Joseph.
\p
\v 46 . And he brought fine linen, and having taken him down, wound (him) in that fine linen, and laid him in a grave, [sepulcher, monument] which was hewn out of a rock, [that is, it was hewn out in the rock, as it is, Matth. 27.60] and he rolled a stone against the door of the grave.
\p
\v 47 . And Mary Magdalene, [See the fortieth verse before-going] and Mary (the mother) of Joses beheld where he was laid.
\c 16
\s The women coming to the grave to anoint the body of Christ, 1. find the stone rolled away, 4. are informed by the angel that he was risen from the dead, 5. Christ himself appears to Mary Magdalene, 9. who tells it to the disciples, but is not believed, 10. he appears again to two disciples by the way, 12. and lastly, to the elen also, whom he chargeth to preach and baptize every where, 14. promiseth that divers signs shall attend on them that believe, 17. he ascends unto heaven, 19. and the Apostles successfully execute the command of Christ, 20.
\p
\v 1 And when the Sabbath past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary (the mother) of James, and Salome, had bought spices, [or, did buy, but this word had fits between here, for that the spices were brought the evening before the Sabbath: as Luke Declares, chapter 23.56.] for to come and anoint him. [this is, to embalm him.]
\p
\v 2 . And on the first day of the week [Gr. Of the Sabbaths, which was the third day after he had been buried, which day was therefore called the Lords day, because he arose on that day? See Rev. 1.10] they came very early to the grave, when the sun arose. [they had made themselves ready to go by day-break; when it was dark yet, John 20.1. but they came not to the grave till sun-rising.]
\p
\v 3 . And said one to another, who shall roll us the stone away from the door of the grave?
\p
\v 4 . And looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled away, [Namely, by the Angel, Matth. 28.2.] for it was very great.
\p
\v 5 . And being entered into the grave, they saw a young man [that is, an Angel in the shape of a young man] sitting at the right side clothed with a long white garment, [Gr. Stole. See thereof, Mark 12.38.] and they were affrighted.
\p
\v 6 . But he said unto them, be not affrighted: ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen, he is not here: Behold the place where they had laid him.
\p
\v 7 . But go your ways, say to his disciples, and to Peter, [That is, and especially to Peter, because he by reason of his denial and sorrow, stood in especial need of comfort] that he goeth before yee into Galilee: there ye shall see him, as he said unto you. [Namely, before his suffering Mark 14.28.]
\p
\v 8 . And they being gone forth speedily fled from the grave: and trembling and astonishment had taken hold of them, and they said nothing to any man, [Namely, of those that met them, until they came to the disciples, to whom they told it, verse 10. and Luke 24.9.] for they were afraid.
\p
\v 9 . And when Jesus was risen early in the morning, on the first day of the week, [Gr. Of the Sabbath; which is also sometimes taken for the whole week. See Luke 18.12] he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, [of this first appearance, see more largely, John 20.14] out of whom he cast out seven devils.
\p
\v 10 . This (woman) going her way, told it to those that had been with him, who mourned and wept.
\p
\v 11 . And when these heard that he lived, and was seen of her, they believed it not.
\p
\v 12 . And after this be appeared in another shape [not which he truly had, but which he seemed to them to have, forasmuch as their eyes were holden, that they knew him not, Luke 24.16] unto two of them as they walked, and went into the countrey: [Namely, to Emmaus, Luke 24.13. see there also this History more largely set down]
\p
\v 13 . These also going their ways told it to therest, (but) neither did they believe them.
\p
\v 14 . Afterwards he was manifested to the eleven as they sate at (meat), [or, sitting together] and upbraided (them) with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed them that bad seen him, after that he was risen.
\p
\v 15 . And he said unto them, Go your ways into all the world, preach the gospel unto all creatures, [Gr. To all Nations; Mat. 28.19. namely, not only to the Greek or Heathen: that is, to all sorts of people. See Col. 1.23.]
\p
\v 16 . He that shall have believed, and shall be baptized, shall be saved. But he that shall not have believed shall damned.
\p
\v 17 . And these signs shall follow them that shall have believed, [Namely, as far forth as shall be needful for the doctrine of the gospel: for the gift to work miracles is not given to all, 1 Cor. 12. verse 28. neither is it needful when the Gospel is sufficiently confirmed already] in my name they shall cast out devils, they shall speak with new tongues. [that is, with strange tongue, which they had not learned, Acts 2.4.]
\p
