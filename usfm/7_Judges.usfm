\s THE ARGUMENT OF THIS BOOK
\p The book containeth a very remarkable history of the state of Israel as well Ecclesiastical as civil after the death of Joshua unto the priesthood and government of Eli especially under the Judges that is, of such persons not who administered the ordinary function of judges among the people as this word is otherwise taken but whom God now and then as the state of the Israel required sometime out of one and sometimes out of another tribe according to his good pleasure extraordinarily raised called and with his spirit of wisdom and courage endowed and acted victoriously to execute his and his people right against Israel’s oppressors and enemies to restore and maintain the worship of God to defend and perverse Israel in the freedom and the holy laws which they received of God and to assist them with counsel and execution in any emergent difficulty. first then there are rehearsed in this book that wars which the tribes after the death of Joshua waged according to God’s command against the heathenish inhabitants of Canaan to expel and root them out wherein for the most part there were to remiss that is displeased God in so much that he suffered divers heathenish nations to remain in the land for Israel’s trial and punishments. Notwithstanding Israel for a while continued in the pure worship of God viz. as long as those Pious eldest lived that had seen the wonderful works of the Lord but after that it is related throughout how that Israel in posterity abusing their liberty from time to time fell into all kind of gross abominable idolatry of the heathen and the most shameful heathen and most shameful looseness of life whereof not only mention is often made in general but also in particular some fearful example are rehearsed as a clear glass well of this people corrupting and wickedness as of the righteousness of Gods wrath and heavy judgments whereof see the 17, 18, 19 and 20 chapters next withal is shewed that God was extremely provoked for this backsliding of these people and did punish the same not only in words but also in actual delivering them up into the hand of divers of their enemies as of the Cuschan king of Mesopotamia Eglon king of the Moabites the Philippine Jabin king of the Canaanites the Medianites Amalekites and other eastern people the Amorites and again of the Philistines who all grievously oppressed and afflicted Israel a long time yet notwithstanding when in their straits they truly repented and turned unto God and forsaking their idolatry and wickedness did servently cry and beg unto him for mercy and help the Lord then who is faithful and true as well in the gracious promises as in his threatening had compassion on them and delivered them ever and anon by valiant champions such as were Othiniel, Ehud, Sumgar, Deborah and Barak, Gideon , Jepthath and Samson although they were very quickly they forgat these mercies and favors of god successfully conferred upon them and returning to their former wickedness were every time a new plagued and upon true and hearty repentance against most gracious delivered by God in the meanwhile unto Gideon history there is added three years government of Abimelech who was unlawfully king and a tyranty and therefore remarkable punished of God. Also five judges are mentioned who wars are not recorded as Thola, Jaer, Ebzan, Elon, and Abdon this book comprehended according to the account of some history of 299 or 300 years from the year of the creation 1511 to the year 2810.

\s The tribe of Judah by Gods command begin to make war against the inhabitants of Canaan verse 1 &c. subdue Adonibezek 4 take Jerusalem 8 slay the children of Enak at Hebron 10 Othiniel subdued Debir and thereby getteth Cales daughters to wife 11 the kenites dwell among Judah 16 Simeon Subdueth Zephath 17 and Judah divers cities of Philistines 18 they of the house of Joseph subdued Bethel 23 a relation of remissness of the tribes of driving out of the Canaanites for which they are vexed by them and they are left to dwell one another 19, 20 &c.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after the death of Joshua that the children of Israel inquired of the Lord [by the high priest wearing the Epod see for this the command of God Numbers 27.21 and compare below chapter 20.18 1Samuel 23.9] saying who among us shall march up first towards the Canaanites to fight against them?
\p
\v 2 . And the Lord said Judah [ that is the tribe of Judah so in the following verse Simeon that is the tribe of Simeon and so forward in the rest ] shall march up behold I have given that land into his hand.
\p
\v 3 . Then said Judah unto his brother Simeon [the inheritances of Judah and Simeon were partly intermixed or common between them see Joshua 9.1, 2] march with me into my lot [that is to subdue and take possession of the land that is fallen to me by lot] and let us war against the Canaanites and I will also march up with thee into thy lot so Simeon marched with them.
\p
\v 4 . And Judah marched up and the Lord gave the Canaanites and the Pherezites into their hands [that is into the hand of Judah and Simeon] and they smote them by Bezek [which lay not far from Jerusalem see also 1 Samuel 11.8] ten thousand men.
\p
\v 5 . And they found Adoni Bezek at Bezek and fought against him and they smote the Canaanites and the Perezites.
\p
\v 6 . But Adoni Bezek fled and they pursued after him and they took him and cut off the thumbs of his hands and of his feet [the cause of this was of the abominable tyranny mentioned in the following verse.]
\p
\v 7 . Then said Adoni Bezek threescore and ten kings with the thumbs of their hands of their feet cut off under my table were gathering up the crumbs [that is that which fell from the table or was cast to them] according as I have done so hath God rewarded me and they brought him to Jerusalem and he died there.
\p
\v 8 . For the children of Judah had against Jerusalem [others fought or did fight but the opinion of the most is that here by occasion that is in the foregoing verse it is said that they brought down Adoni Bezek to Jerusalem the taking of Jerusalem and some other passages unto the 17 verse were repeated out of the book of Joshua as may be seen Joshua chapter 15 ]and had taken it [understand the part of the city which was fallen to their share, nor the other part which appertained to Benjamin together with them, and the strong hold: See Jos.15.8,13. & 18.11,28. Also below ver.21. With the Annot.] And smote it with the edge of the sword: [Heb. At the mouth of the sword] and they had set [Heb. sent] the city on fire. [i.e. they had cast fire into it: So below chap.21 48.]
\p
\v 9 . And after that [i.e. after the taking of Jerusalem] the children of Judah were gone down to war against the Canaanites, dwelling in the south and in the low grounds.
\p
\v 10 . And Judah was gone against the Canaanites [Under the conduct of Joshua and Caleb, Jos.15.14.] that dwelt at Hebron, [See Jos.15.13.] (Now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-Arba) and they smote Sefia and Abiman, and Thalmai. [Three Giants, children of Enak, as is related below ver.20.]
\p
\v 11 . And from thence he [viz. Judah] was marched forth against the inhabitants of Debir: now the name of Debir was formerly Kiriath-Sepher. [See Jos. 12.13.]
\p
\v 12 . And Caleb said, He that shall smite Sepher, and take it, to him will l also give my daughter Achsa to wife.
\p
\v 13 . Then Othniel the son of Kenaz, [i.e. one of Kenaz his posterity, as some do understand this] brother of Caleb,[i.e. cousin, near kinsman: some understand this of Othiel, others of Kenaz: compare Numb.32.12. Jos 15.17. below Chap.3.9,11. 1 Chron.4.13, 15.] who was younger then be, [Heb. smaller, or lesser then he, namely, Kenaz. Oth.who (viz. Othiel) was the youngest of, or out of him, namely, Kenaz; i.e. the youngest and meanest to see to among all the posterity of Kenaz, and yet not withstanding honoured and exalted above others, by this courageous and valiant act, the match that followed, and also the office of judge: below chap.3.9,etc.] took it: and Caleb gave him aches his daughter to wife.
\p
\v 14 . And it came to pass, when she came (unto him) [See of this relation, Jos.15.18,19. And the Annotat. There] that she moved him [Or, sought unto him] to ask a field of her father; and she lighted off the ass. Then said Caleb unto her, what (aileth) thee?
\p
\v 15 . And she said unto him, give me a blessing: [See Gen.33. on ver.11.] seeing thou hast given me a dry land, [Heb. south-land] give me also water (or springs of water) then Caleb gave her high wells, and low wells.
\p
\v 16 .Also the children of the Kenite, [Understand Jethro: See Numb.24.21,22.] Moseh his father in law, went up out of the Palm-city [viz. Jericho. See Duet.34. On ver.3.] With the children of Juda, toward the wilderness of Judah, which is toward the south of Harad: [the name of a city lying near mount Seir, and peradventure also of a King of the same place. See Numb.21.1. ] and they went and dwelt with the people. [ Heb. and he went and dwelt, or abode with, or by the people. He, namely, the Kenite, that is Jethro posterity. Some translate it thus: for he (the Kenite) was (along with them) and had remained, or had dwelt with the people, namely, Israel. See Numbs 10.29. and 24.21,22. 1 Sam. 15.6.]
\p
\v 17 .Juda then went with his brother Simeon, [Here the history, which above ver.8. was intermitted, is reassumed, and pursued] and they smote the Canaanites dwelling at Zephath, [this place is no where else mentioned; onely we find 2 Chron.14.9,10. The valley of Zephata, by Maresa in Juda: Some there translate it, the valley (lying) towards Zephath] and they banned it, [See Duet.2.onver.34.] and the name of this city was called Horma. [i.e. Bun banning. Compare Numb. 14 45. and 21.3. Some conceive, that this Horma was the Royal City, situate on the southern borders of Canaan] at the west-end of Mount Seir: See Jos.12.14. and 15.30. and 19.4. 1 Sam. 30.30. 1 Chron. 4.30.]
\p
\v 18 . Also Juda took Gaza with her border, [i.e. the circumjacent country: So in the following] and Askelon with her border, and Ekron with her border. [These Cities were situate in the Philistines country, at the mid-land Zea, and are often mentioned in the holy Scripture]
\p
\v 19 . And the Lord was with Juda, that he drave out (the inhabitants) of the mountain: but he. [viz. Juda (proceeded not) to drive out [Oth. But not driving out] the inhabitant of the valley, because they had iron charets. [although the Lord was with Judah in the subduing and taking of the mountain, yet notwithstanding he was not courageous enough for to pursue the rest through humane fear, which here prevailed more with him, then the command and promise of God, Jos.13.6. and 17.18. Of the iron charets then used in battle, see Jos.17.18.]
\p
\v 20 . And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, [See the History hereof, Jos.14, from the end of the Chapter] according as Moseh had spoken: and the expelled thence the three sons of Enak. [Of whom mention is made above, ver.10. Of Enak and his posterity which were Giants, see Numb.13. On ver .22. Oth. Of the Giant]
\p
\v 21 But the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites dwelling at Jerusalem: [Underst. In the upper part of the City, and the strong hold which was fallen unto Benjamin’s share, in regard their inheritances lay partly among those of Juda, Jos.1811. Judah had taken his, as above ver.8. Out of strong hold the Jebusites were not expelled till Davids time, 2 Sam.5.6,7.] But the Jebusites dwelt with the children of Benjamin at Jerusalem unto this day. [viz. when this was written by the Author of this book]
\p
\v 22 . And the house of Joseph went up also toward Bethel: and the Lord was with them.
\p
\v 23 . And the house of Joseph set spies near Bethel: now the name of this city was before-time Luz. [See Gen.28 ver.19.]
\p
\v 24 . And the watchmen [That were sent forth to spy out the situation of the City] saw a man going forth out of the city: and they said unto him, shew us, we pray, the entrance of the city, and we will shew kindness unto thee.
\p
\v 25 . And when he had shewed them the entrance of the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword, but they let go that man, and all his family.
\p
\v 26 . Then went this man into the land of the Hethites. [Which dwelt on the north-side of mount Ephraim] and he built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: this is the name thereof unto this day.
\p
\v 27 . And Manasseh [Understand, the half tribe which dwelt in Canaan, not those which dwelt beyond Jordan in Gilead, and Basan] drave not out Beth-Sean, [i.e. the inhabitants of Beth-Sean; as in the sequel is set forth. Beth-Sean lay by Jordan on the west-side: see Jos.1711.] nor her dependant places, [i.e. the circumjacent places, resorting under them] neither Taanach, situate in mount Gilboa. See also Jos.17.v.11. And 21.25.] With her dependant places, nor the inhabitants of Dor, with her dependant places, nor the inhabitants of Jibleam, [Jos.17.11. both these places lay near to the mid-land Sea] with her her dependant places, nor the inhabitants of Meggido, with her dependant places: and the Canaanites would dwell in the same land. [Or, found good, consented, or began (Heb. the Canaanite would, etc.) viz. either out of willfulness, or on condition of Tribute, as some expound this out of the following verse. So below ver. 35. See also Jos.17.12,13.]
\p
\v 28 . And it came to pass, when Isreal grew strong, that he put the Canaanites upon tribute: but he drave them not quite out. [Heb. driving out, he drave them not out; to wit, the Canaanites]
\p
\v 29 . Also Ephraim drave not out the Canaanites which dwelt at Gezer: [Situate by the brook of Gaas, toward the midland Sea; being also a City of the Levites; Jos. At 21. 21.] But the Canaanites dwelt in the midst of them at Gezer.
\p
\v 30 . Zebulon drave not out the inhabitant of Kitron, [Situate by the mountain of Zebulon, westward, near unto the source of the brook Jiphtahel] nor the inhabitants of Nuhalel: see Jos .19.15.] but the Canaanites dwelt in the midst of him, [viz. Zebulon] and were tributary.
\p
\v 31 . Aser drave not out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Zidon: [These places lay by the midland Sea, onely Achlab lay somewhat further land-ward. Of Asers lot, see Jos. 19.24, etc. Rehob was also a City of the Levites, Jos. 21. 31. Lying also land-ward. See Num. 13 21. ] nor Achlab, nor Achsib, nor Chelba, nor Rehob: [i.e. the inhabitants of these cities]
\p
\v 32 . But the Aserites dwelt in the midst of the Canaanites which dwelt in the Canaanites which dwelt in the land: for they drave them not out.
\p
\v 33 . Naphtali drave not the inhabitants of Beth-Semes, nor the inhabitants of Beth-Anath, [See of both these cities lying in Naphtali, Jos. 19.38.] but dwelt in the midst of the Canaanites which dwelt in the land: but the inhabitants of Beth-Semes and Beth-Anath became tributary unto them.
\p
\v 34 . And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain, for they suffered them not to come down into the valley. [i.e. the lower parts, or plains].
\p
\v 35 . Also the Amorites would dwell [See above on ver.27.] on mount Heres, at Ajalon, and at Saalbim: [see Jos.19.42. and 21. 24. Saalbim lay in the valley of Escol, Ajalon from thence in the northwest, toward the west sea, on the borders of Dan. Of other places of this name, see below chap 12.12.] but the hand of house of the house of Joseph became heavy, so that they became tributary. [Heb. became, or were tributary. The meaning is, those of the house of Joseph came to succor Dan, and compelled or forced the Amorites so far, that they became tributary unto them]
\p
\v 36 . And the border of the Amorites was from the going up of Akrabbim, [Lying by the south-end of the salt-sea, and on the east-end of mount Seer, upon the uttermost borders of Canaan toward the south. see Jos.15.2,3,] from the rock. [Oth. Sela, or Petra Arabia; a famous City, lying upon a rock] and along upwards.

\s The Angel of God reproveth Isreal at Bochim, v.1. & c. Where they bewail their sins, 4. A relation of the state of Israel under the judges, wherein their former worship of God, in the time of Joshua, and of the pious Eldest is compared with the sub seuent back –sliding unto all manner of idolatry, for which they are ever and anon punished of God by the enemies, and being delivered by the judges, do again relapse and fall from evil to worse, 6,7, etc. Wherefore God would not expel the Heathen, to try Israel, 20.
\p
\v 1 And an angel of the LORD [Understand the Son of God, as clearly appeareth out of the whole sequel. See also on Judg. 6. V.11.] came upward from Gilgal [See jos. 5.9.] to Bochim: [so called from the weeping of the people, below v.5. lying near Gilgal] and he said, I carried you up out of Egypt, and brought you into a land which I sware unto your fathers, and said; I will not break my covenant with you in eternity.
\p
\v 2 . And as for you, ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall break down their altars: but ye obeyed not my voice; wherefore have ye done this ?
\p
\v 3 . Therefore I also said, I will not drive them out before your face; [viz. the Heathen that dwell in Canaan] but they shall be on your sides, [see a further explaining hereof, Numb. 33. 55.] and their gods shall be a snare unto you.
\p
\v 4 . And it came to pass, when the Angel of the LORD had spoken these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lift up their voice and wept.
\p
\v 5 . Therefore they called the name of that place Bochim: [i.e, the weeping] and they offered there unto the LORD.
\p
\v 6 . When Josua [ In the sequel is given the reason wherefore God would not drive out the inhabitants of this land, to wit Israels back-sliding from God] had let the people go, [ after he had earnestly exhorted; and strongly engaged to the pure worship of God, jos. 24.] the children of Israel went away every one to his inheritance, for to possess the land hereditarily.
\p
\v 7 . And the people served the LORD all the days of Josua: and all the days of the eldest, who had lived long after Josua, [i.e. who had out lived Josua] who had seen all the great works of the LORD, which he had done to Israel.
\p
\v 8 . But when Josua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, was dead; being an hundred and ten years old; [heb. a son of an hundred and ten years.]
\p
\v 9 . And they had buried him in the border of his inheritance, at Timnath-Heres, [Otherwise called timnath-Sereh, jos. 24.30.] upon an hill of Ephraim, toward the north of mount-Jaas;
\p
\v 10 . And also0 all that same generation were gathered unto their fathers, there arose then another generation, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the work, which he had done to Israel.
\p
\v 11 . Then the children of Israel did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD: and they served Baalim. [By the name Baal, which signifieth a Lord, did the gentiles commonly call their Idols, because they held them for their Lords, and givers of all good things: and to distinguish them, in regard they were divers, not onely the Heathen, but also the idolatrous Jews, did give or adde unto them certain sirnames, as Baal-Berith, below chap.8.33. Baal-Peor, Numb.25.3. Baal-Zebub, 2 King.1.6 Baal-Astareth, compare below on v.13.and 1King .16.31 the idolatry commited with these was a total departing from God although the backsliding Israelites persuaded themselves that they could honor god by and together with them as that did also with the golden calves 1Kings 12.28 see Hosea 2.15 and below chapter 8 on verse 33.]
\p
\v 12 . And the forsook the Lord the God of their father who had brought them out of the land of Egypt and followed after other Gods of the gods of the nations which were round about them and bowed themselves before them and they provoked the Lord to anger.
\p
\v 13 . For they forsook the Lord and served Baal and Asharoth [that is the images of the idols whether male or female called of the heathen Arstarte which the Zidonations and the Philistines had set up in the shape of the sheep see 1Samuel 31.10 1Kings 11.5,33 2kings 23.14.]
\p
\v 14 . That the anger of the Lord kindled against Israel and he gave them into the hand of the spoiler who spoiled them and he sold them into the hand of the enemies [that is he delivered them over as the seller delivereth over the ware that are sold into the hands of the buyer so below chapter 4 on verse 2,19 and chapter 10.7 compare Psalms 44.13] round about and they could no more subsist before the face of their enemies.
\p
\v 15 . Everywhere whithersoever they went forth the hand of the Lord was against them for evil [to punish them with all manner of plagues detesters and calamities] according as the Lord had spoken and according as the Lord had sworn unto them and they were greatly distressed [or he viz. the Lord distressed them greatly.]
\p
\v 16 . And the Lord stirred up [by a special call and instigation of the spirit] Judges [understand not Lords of the land or kings neither such as executed the ordinary office of a judge and administered justice between man and man which continued among the tribes according to the order appointed and instituted of God by Moses but such as executed the public right and interest of God’s people against their enemies and oppressors and delivered them out of their hand purged and preserved religion paid and protected the commonwealth of Israel in their liberty and assisted the common good both by their service and good counsel see below chapter 3.9 10,15 &c. and 4.1 and 6.25 and 8.23 and so forth ] who delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.
\p
\v 17 . Yet hearkened not unto the Judges but went a whoring after other gods [see Leviticus 17 on verse 7 and 20 on verse 5] and bowed themselves before them they quickly departed out of the way in which their fathers had walked hearkened to the commandments of the Lord so did not they.
\p
\v 18 . And when the lord raised them up Judges then the Lord was with the Judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judges [that is as long as that judge lived] for it repented the Lord [see genesis 6 on verse 6] because of their groaning by reason of them who distressed them and who oppressed them.
\p
\v 19 . But it came to pass with the dying of the Judge that they turned about and corrupted it more then their fathers followed after strange gods serving them and bowing themselves before them they let nothing fall off their works [having no remorse or sorrow or ceasing from their purpose and practice ] nor of their hard way [that is of their obstinate and obdurate manner of life and practice whereby they provoked God and hurted themselves as a hard way hurteth and gauleth him that walketh in it .]
\p
\v 20 . Therefore the wrath of the Lord kindled against Israel that he said because these people have transgressed my covenant which I commanded their and they have not hearkened unto my voice.
\p
\v 21 . Therefore also I will not proceed to drive out of possession anyone of the heathen which Joshua left behind when he died understand which remained of those Joshua had driven out together with the other of whom chapter 1 mention is made.]
\p
\v 22 . That through them I may tempt Israel [see Genesis 22 on verse 1below chapter 3.1,4] whether they will keep the way of the Lord to walk in it as their fathers have kept in it or no.
\p
\v 23 . So the Lord let those heathen to remain that he drave them not hastily out of possession whom he had not delivered up [or and he gave them not over or had given them over] into the hand of Joshua.
\c 3
\s A catalogue of heathen people which God left in Canaan to prove Israel verse 1&c. Israel falling off from God is delivered up into the hand of the king of Mesopotamia 5 from whose tyranny is being delivered by Othiniel they relapse into former wickedness an dare punished and oppressed by Eglon king of the Moabites 9 from whom God delivereth by Judge Ebud 15 as also afterward from the Philistine by Judges Samgar 31.
\p
\v 1 Now these are the heathen which the Lord least remaining to teach Israel by them [ see above chapter 2 verse 22] these [ viz. Israelites ] that knew not of all the wars of Canaan [that is which before in Joshua’s life time where come against the Canaanites.]
\p
\v 2 . Only that the generations [that is the posterity ] of the children of Israel might know them [viz. the wars of Canaan whereof is spoken in the following verse ]that he [viz. the Lord]might teach them the war [who not only commanded these wars against the Canaanites but likewise had promised his divine conduct assistance and victory viz. if they should steadfastly cleave and adhere unto him but no contrary if they should forsake him in which they should experience in the manifold and grievous miseries which those wars do produce ] at the lest of those that before knew nothing thereof.
\p
\v 3 . The princes of the Philistines [see Joshua 13.3 and below chapter 16.5 or rulers governors commanders others governments Lordship ruling offices [and all the Canaanites and Sidonians and the Heavites dwelling in the mountain of Libanon [lying on the northern borders of Canaan very famous and often mentioned in the holy scripture ] from the mountain Baal Hermon [situate on east end of the mount Libanon northwards from Basan see 1 Chronicles 5.23 mount Hermon was in the west end of Libanon by Zida see Deuteronomy 3.9 and 4.48] until where they come to Hamath[ situate on the northern border of Canaan]
\p
\v 4 . These then were to tempt Israel by them [as above chapter 2.22] that it might be known [that is it might be manifest or made to appear see Deuteronomy 8 on verse 2] whether they would hearken to the commandments of the LORD which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses [that is ministry of Moses.]
\p
\v 5 . Now when the children of Israel dwealt in the midst of the Canaanites of the Heathites and of the Amorites and of the Perezites and of the Heavites and of the Jebusites.
\p
\v 6 . Then they took their daughters to wives and gave their daughters unto their sons and they served their gods.
\p
\v 7 . And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord and they forgot the Lord their God and served the Baalims and the Groves [understand consecrated idolatrous woods and trees which were planted and ordained for the honor of the heathenish idols or the groove gods so called because they were worshipped in thick dark groove and under goodly high trees after the heathen manner.]
\p
\v 8 . Then the anger of the Lord kindled against Israel and he sold them into the hand of Cuscham rischataim[see above chapter 2 on verse 14] king of Mesopotamia [Heb. Aram Kaharaim that is Syria of the two rivers so is Mesopotamia called in the Greek for the same cause or reason see Genesis on verse 10 below verse 10 it is only called that is Syria of the two rivers so is Mesopotamia called in Greek for the same cause or reason see Genesis 24 on verse 10is called Aram that is Syria] the children of Israel served Cuschan Rischataim eight years.
\p
\v 9 . So the children f Israel cried unto the Lord and the Lord raised up to the children of Israel deliverer who deliverer them Otheniel the son of Kenaz [see above chapter 2 on verse 16] the brother of Caleb who was younger that he.
\p
\v 10 . And the spirit of the Lord [understand the spirit of the of the fortitude courage wisdom government &c. working and producing in him that which was needful for theexecuting of this calling compare below chapter 6 on verse 34 and 11.29] was upon him and he judged Israel [see above chapter 2 on verse 16] and went forth to battle and the Lord delivered Cuschan Rischataim the King of Syria [Heb. Aram see on verse 8] into his hand so that his hand waxed strong against Cuschan Rishacim [that is he grew too strong for this king he over powered him.]
\p
\v 11 . Then was the land quiet then Othiniel the son of Kenaz died.
\p
\v 12 . But the children of Israel went on to do that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord then the Lord strengthened Eglon the king of the Moabites against Israel [that is he gave him power and victory against Israel for the punishment of their sins] because they did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord.
\p
\v 13 . And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and the Amalekites and he went forth and smote Israel and they took the palm city [that is Jericho see Deuteronomy 34.3 and above chapter 1 on verse 16] a possession.
\p
\v 14 . And the children of Israel serve Eglon the king of the Moabites eighteen years.
\p
\v 15 . Then the children of Israel cried unto the Lord then the Lord raised them up and delivered Ehud the son of Gera the son of Jemini [that is a Benjamite as below chapter 19.16] a man that was left handed or whose right hand was shut or locked up on or of his right hand compare below chapter 20.16 it is remarkable that it is pleased God to deliver these people by this man who in the judgment of man might seem to be most unfit for the business see below verse 31] and the children of Israel sent by his hand a present unto Eglon king of the Moabites.
\p
\v 16 . And Ebud made him a sword which had two edges [Heb. that hath two mouths that is it cut on both sides or was two edged or two ways cutting] the length whereof was an ell or cubit and he girded it under his garments on his right hip.
\p
\v 17 . And he brought that present unto Eglon the king of the Moabites now Eglon was a very fat man.
\p
\v 18 . And it came to pass when he had made an end of the delivering that present then he conducted [otherwise dismissed] the people which carried that present.
\p
\v 19 . But he himself turned again from the carved images that were by Gilgal [or hewen Graven &c. these might be reared up by the idolatrous Israelites or the Moabites at or by Gilgal because Israel at their first entrance into Canaan were there circumcised in which respect the same was accounted an holy place otherwise of the quarries of the place out of which the stones were hewen and digged applying this to the stones that were erected by Joshua at the command of God for a memorial of their miraculous passage through Jordan Joshua 4.20] and said I have secret thing or errand unto thee O king who said keep silence [viz. until the standers by be gone forth ] and al that stood about him went forth from him.
\p
\v 20 . And Ehud came in unto him, where he was sitting in a cool upper room (or parlour), [Heb. an upper room of cooling; i.e. a summer- parlour, serving to cool a man against the heat of the summer] which he had for himself alone; [Oth. he now sat in a cool upper-parlour, which was for him, or, which he had:] and Ehud said; I have a word of God unto thee: then he rose up from the seat.[Although he (being an Idolater) esteemed his Idols more then he did the God of Israel, yet notwithstanding he would shew his reverence and respect unto his word, or Ambassadour]
\p
\v 21 . Then Ehud stretched forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right hip, and thrust it into his belly.
\p
\v 22 . That even the hilt entred in after the blade, and the fat closed about the blade, (for he did not pull the sword out of his belly) [As being not able, for the reason mentioned in the fore-going words] and the dirt (or excrements) came out. [Otherwise, it came out of the fundament, viz the blade or the sword]
\p
\v 23 . Then Ehud went forth toward the porch, and shut the door of the upper-parlour close before himself, [Oth. before, or, upon him, viz. King Eglon] and put (it) into the lock. [or, bolted it.]
\p
\v 24 . When he was gone forth, his [viz. Eglons] servants came, and looked, and behold, the doors of the upper parlour were put into the lock: and they said; certainly, he covereth his feet in the cooling-chamber. [thus the going to stool, or easing of nature, is exprest in modest terms, in Scripture, because in sitting down, or bending the body, they covered their upper garment, 1 Sam.24.4.]
\p
\v 25 . Now when they had tarried till they were ashamed, behold, he [viz. Eglon] opened not the parlour; then they took the key, and opened (it), and behold, their Lord lay dead on the ground. [or, was fallen dead on the ground. [Or, was fallen dead on the ground. Then Hebrew word indeed for the most part signifieth, to fall, but it is also in many places translated to lie down. See Deut.21.v.1. Below chap.4.22. and 5.27. And 7.12. 1 Sam.31.8.]
\p
\v 26 . And Ehud escaped, while they [viz. the servants of the dead King] tarried: for he passed by the carved images, [see above on ver.19.] and escaped unto Sehirath. [Understand not the mountains of Seir, or of the Edomites, but a place lying at, or upon mount Ephraim, as may be gathered from the following verse]
\p
\v 27 . And it came to pass when he was come, that he blew with the trumpet [i.e. caused to blow chap. 6.34, &c.] on mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he himself before their face.
\p
\v 28 . And he said unto them, follow after me, [Or, pursue after, follow behind me] for the LORD hath delivered your enemies, the Moabites, into your hand: and they went down after him, and took the ferries of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered no man to pass over.
\p
\v 29 . And they smote (of) the Moabites at that times, about ten thousand men, all sat [i.e. corpulent, strong, well-set, the ablest and fittest men for battle, or rich, ones] and all warlike men, so that not a man escaped.
\p
\v 30 . So Moab was that day subdued under the hand of Israel: and the land was quiet for some years.
\p
\v 31 . Now after him was Samgar, [To wit, Judge, deliverer] a son of Anath, he smote (of) the Philistines, six hundred men, with an Ox goad, [The Hebrew word cometh from teaching, and signifieth such a Raff, Cudgel, or rod, that hath prickles on it, serving to teach Oxen to go onward when they are a plowing. Hereby is set forth the meanness and baseness of the means, which notwithstanding were so blessed by the Lord, that a great number of well armed men were not able to subsist against the same: as David felled down Goliath with his sling: compare 1 Cor.1 28. And see above v. 15. and below chap. 15 15, & c.] So be also delivered Israel.
\c 4
\s God plagueth Israel for their sins by King Jabin, whose Captain General was Sisera, v. 1,2, etc. Afterward God raiseth up the Prophetess Debora, who from the lord commandeth Barak to march forth against Sisera, promising him the victory, in so doing, and she her self marcheth forth with him, 4, etc. The host of Sisera is hereby beaten, 15. Jael hideth Sisera in his flight, and killeth him in her tent, King Jabin is Destroyed, 24.
\p
\v 1 But the children of Israel went on to do that which was evil in the evil in the eyes of the LORD: when Ehud was dead.
\p
\v 2 . So the LORD sold them [See above chap. 2. on v. 14.] into the hand of Jabin, [see of another Jabin, jos.11. 1.] King of the Canaanites, [hereby is sometimes in general understood all the heathen Nations which dwelt in Canaan, sometimes, as here, a particular Nation amongst them all, which dwelt on the North-borders of Canaan] who reigned at Hazor: [see jos. Chap. 11.ver.10,11. And 19.36. Also jer.49.28.] And his chief Captain was Sisera: the same [viz. Sisera, or, (as some) Jabin] now dwelt at Haroseth, of the Gentiles. [A city situate at the waters of Merom, of which see jos.11.5,7. It may be, that divers remaining Heathenish Nations pitched their habitations here, to be secured under Jabin and Sisera’s power against Israel. Heb. Charoseheth.]
\p
\v 3 . Then the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred iron charets, and he bad had violently oppressed the children of Israel twenty years.
\p
\v 4 . Now Debora, a woman, which was a Prophetess, [Heb. a women a Prophetess: so below chap.6.8. a man a Prophet] the wife of Lappidoth, [a man’s name, whereof the Scripture no where else maketh mention: some take Lappidoth for the name of Debora’s birth-place] this (said woman) judged Israel at that time.
\p
\v 5 . And she dwelt under the Palm-tree of Debora, [So called from Debora] between Bethel, or mount Ephraim, and the children of Israel went up to her for judgment. [To inquite of her (being a Prophetess) the will of the Lord, in things, wherein they knew not how to find out the issue of themselves; or by the ordinary ways of instruction, or Judicature]
\p
\v 6 . And she sent forth, and called Barak, the son of Abinoam, from Rodes Naphtali: [A city in the tribe of Naphtali, jos.19.32, 37. Appointed for a city of refuge, jos. 20.7. Also given to the Levites, jos. 21.32. See also 2 King .15.29. It lay upon hill between the waters of Merom, and the sea of Genesareth. There was another Rodes in the tribe of Issachar, 1 Chron.6.72.] And she said him: hath not the LORD the God of Israel command? [As if he said, judged, or certainly he hath commanded thee: such kind of queries strongly confirm that which is spoken by way question. So below v.14. chap.6, 14,&c.] go forth and draw [Understand, draw unto thee, i.e. assemble unto thee, bring together, cause to come unto thee, using for that purpose the reasons and arguments, wherewith I have made thee Acquainted, and the help of the chiefest, or heads of the tribes. Compare below chap. 5. On v.14. As on the contrary, the Lord saith in the following verse, I will draw Sisera unto thee.] On mount Tabor, [lying in the tribe of Zebulon, toward the west, by the brook Kison. See Psal. 89.13. and 1Sam.10.3, 19. Jer. 46.18. Hos. 5.1.] And take with thee ten thousand men, of the children of Naphtali, and of the children of Zebulon.
\p
\v 7 . And I will draw unto thee at the brook Kison, Sisera, jabins chief Captain, [i.e. I will by my Divine Power and ordering, cause him to meet thee there. The brook or river of Kison, ran out of the sea of Gennesareth, toward the west by Mount Carmel into the midland sea, being as a partition between Issachar and Zebulon] with his charets, and his multitude: and I will give him into thine hand.
\p
\v 8 . Then said Barak unto her, if thou wilt go with me, I will go forth: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.
\p
\v 9 . And she said, I will certainly go with thee, [Heb. going go, or marching march] saving that the honour shall not be thine, on this way which thou walkest: [or, in this expedition which thou makest. Oth. because of the way which thou goest; i.e. because thou art so weak in confidence, that thou without me wilt not follow the command of the Lord, therefore a woman shall go away with the honour thereof] for the LORD shall sell Sisera [i.e. deliver him up. See above chap.2. on ver.14.] Into the hand of a women: [this may be meant of Israel, or also of Debora herself] so Debora arose, and went with Barak to Kedes.
\p
\v 10 . Then Barak called Zebulon and Naphtali together unto Kedes, and he went up on his feet (with) ten thousand men: [Oth. caused ten thousand men to march up before him: Heb. together with, beside, or at his feet; i.e. which followed him, and trod after his footsteps. See Exod.11.8. & 1 Kings 20.10.] Also Debora went up with him.
\p
\v 11 . Now Heber [The husband of Jail, of whom below ver.17, etc. Heb. Cheber] the Kenite, [See Num.24.21, 22. and above chap.1.16. and the Annot. there] had severed himself from Kain; [i.e. from the Kenites, which had their dwelling place in the wilderness of Juda. See above chap 1.16.] (of the children of Hobab, [See Num.10. ver.29. Otherwise called Jethro] Moseh his father in law;) and he pitched his tents unto the oak in Zaanaim, which is by Kedes.
\p
\v 12 . Then they brought word to Sisera, that Barak the son of Abinoam, was gone up to mount Tabor.
\p
\v 13 . Then Sisera called all his charets together, [i.e. he caused them by proclamation to come together, or summoned them] nine hundred iron charets, and all the people that were with him, from Heroseth of the Gentiles, unto the brook Kison.
\p
\v 14 . Then Debora said unto Barak, Arise, for this is the day wherein the Lord hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone forth before thy face? [As the chief and supreme General of the army, to fight for thee, and to appoint the victory on thy side. See of this kind of questions above on ver.6.] So Barak went down from mount Thabor, and ten thousand men after him.
\p
\v 15 . And the LORD discomfited Sisera, with all his charets, and all the host, [See chap.5.20.] by the edge of the sword, [Heb. by, or at the mouth of the sword: So in the following verse] before the face of Barak: [Oth. affrighted, & c. before the & c. whereof the sense would be, that God terrified and dismayed them in a special manner, that they might fall by the sword of the Israellites without resistance] so that Sisera lighted down off the charet, and fled (away) on his feet.
\p
\v 16 . And Barak pursued after them, after the charets, and after the host, unto Haroseth of the gentiles: and all the camp of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword, so that there remained not unto one. [i.e. so that there remained not so much as one; or, there was not one left. Compare Psal.14.3. and 53.3. Rom.2 12, etc.]
\p
\v 17 . But Sisera fled on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber, the Kenite. for there was peace between Jabin in the King of Hazor, and between the house of Heber the Kenites.
\p
\v 18 . Now Jael went forth to meet Sisera, and said unto him, turn in, my Lord, turn into me, fear not: and he turned to her into the tent, and she covered him with a coverled. [Or, course rough covering spread upon him]
\p
\v 19 . Afterward he said unto her, give me (I pray) a little water to drink, for I am thirsty: then she opened a milk-bottle, and gave him to drink, and covered him close.
\p
\v 20 . Also he said unto her, stand in the door of the tent: and it shall be, if any man shall come, and ask thee, and say, is any man here? that thou shalt say, no man. [Or, No]
\p
\v 21 . Then Jael the wife of Heber took a nail of the tent, [Which they used in spreading and fastening their tents, being of such a length, that it could pierce through Sisera’s head to the ground; and so also was the hammer proportioned. See below chap.5.25.] and caught a hammer in her hand, and went softly into him, and drove the nail into his temples, that it stuck fast in the ground, [or, forced it self in, or, she fastened (it) in the ground: this act of Jael is highly commended by the Spirit of God in the following chap.5 23, etc. as being done out of a special zeal infused by God, and as his command published by Debora and Barak] now he was fallen into a deep sleep, and (was) tired, and died.
\p
\v 22 . And behold, Barak pursued Sisera, and Jael went forth to meet him, come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou sleekest; so he came into her, and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.
\p
\v 23 . So God on that day subdued Jabin, the King of Canaan, before the face of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 24 . And the hand of the children of Israel went still on, [Heb. went going: i.e. their might still increased, so that they over powered Jabin] and became hard (or waxed strong) against Jabin the King of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin the King of Canaan.
\c 5
\s Debora in this song of praise, exhorteth to praise and thanksgiving, and goeth before the people with her own example, ver.1, etc. recounteth the glorious mercies of God shewed to this people in times past, 4. compareth the miseries of former times, with the present estate, 6. exciteth the Governours, the congregation, her self, and Barak, to praise the Lord, 9. commendeth the chief of the tribes, who went forth willing to this battle, and checketh the unwilling ones that tarried at home, 14. describeth this wonderful victory in all its circumstance, 19. curseth those of Meroz, because they came not to help the people of God, 3 Extolleth the valiant woman Jael, and her act, 24. derideth the vain hope of Sisera’s Court-ladies, 28. and concludeth with a prayer for Gods people against their enemies, 31.
\p
\v 1 Further sang Debora, and Barak the son of Abinoam, on that day, saying.
\p
\v 2 . Praise the LORD for avenging the vengeances [That is, because he hath fully avenged himself and his people on his and their enemies] in Israel, [oth. for, or by Israel] for that people [to wit, Zebulon and Naphtali: see above chap.4.10. and below ver.18. together with some other tribes: see below ver.14, 15.] have willingly offered themselves.
\p
\v 3 . Hear, ye Kings, give ear, ye Princes, I will sing unto the LORD, I will sing psalms unto the LORD the God of Israel.
\p
\v 4 . LORD, when thou wentest forth, [That is, going before, and leading the people by thy pillar of cloud] from Seir, [that is, carrying thy people from Mount Hoi, (after the subduing of the Canaanitish King of Harad) along the borders of the Edomites, who denied them passage through their country, towards the land of the Kings, Sihon and Og, to destroy them, and to bring Israel into the land of promise. See Numb.20.21. and 21.4, etc.] When thou steppedest on from the field of Edom, the earth trembled, also the heaven dropped, the clouds also dropped of water. [it was as if all creatures from beneath and from above were amazed at thy coming and presence. Compare Psal.68.8,9.]
\p
\v 5 . The mountains dissolved (Or, flowed away) from the presence of the LORD, [it was so, or at least seemed not otherwise then if such things had happened. Compare Psal.68.16,17. and 97.5. This also may be applied to the heathenish nations, the Amorites and Canaanites, dwelling in the mountains, who, by reason of Israels coming against them, and of the great and mighty acts of God which thy heard of, trembled and quaked. Compare Duet.2.25. Jos.5.1.] even Sinai [i.e. all that they left behind them, as Sinai, as also the places to which they went, stood amazed; or, (according) as Sinai had done at the time when God gave his law. Compare Psal.78.9.] from the face of the LORD the God of Jacob.
\p
\v 6 . In the days of Samgar [See above chap.3.21.] the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, [see chap.4. 21, etc.] the ways ceased, [i.e. the common roads or high-ways could not be used or frequented, by reason of thieves and robbers] and they that walked on paths [Heb. the walkers of paths] went crooked ways. [i.e. they that were wont to use or ply the common roads, sought out hard and difficult by-ways, to escaped highway-men and enemies]
\p
\v 7 . The villages ceased in Israel, they ceased [i.e. the walled places, as towns, villages, hamlets, because no man could dwell safeand secure there, they fell to ruine, and lay waste and uninhabited. Oth. the husbandman, or the country people, inhabitants of villages, or townsfolk] until that I Debora arose, that I arose a mother in Israel. [that is, who as a Prophetess have instructed the people, being my disciples or scholars (who in Scripture are called the children of the Prophets) touching the will of God, and as a judges, or she-judge, here with motherly pitty and compassion laid to heart the miseries of the subjects, and turned away the same]
\p
\v 8 . (When) he [viz. Israel] chose new gods [i.e. the Idols of the heathen] then was war in the gates. [Thus God ever and anon punished them with war] Was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel? [they were so heartless and cast down, that no defence could be seen]
\p
\v 9 . My heart is toward the Law-givers of Israel, [That is, Governors of the people, or of the tribes, who made the people willing and courageous by their commands and examples] who willingly offered themselves [see above, v. 1. & chap.4 6.10.] among the people: praise ye the LORD.
\p
\v 10 . Ye that ride upon white she-asses, [As great and honorable persons were wont to do: see below chap.10.4. & 12.14.] Ye that sit in judgement, [oth. ye that dwell at Middin: understanding a place where the enemy received the greatest foil: see jos.15.61.] and ye that walk on the way, [see v.6.] speak of it. [oth. think, muse on it]
\p
\v 11 . From [Oth. Because of] the noise of the archors, between the places where water is drawn, [That is, souldiers coming on with a great noise, to disturb and molest the drawers of waters, by plundering, robbing, and other ways] speak there together [the Hebrew verb is also found below, chap11.v.40.] of the righteousnesses of the LORD, [that is, the righteous acts of the Lord, whereby he hath averaged his people, and freed them from the oppression of the enemy. Compare 1 Sam.12.7. Mic 6.5. with the annot.] of the righteousnesses (shewed) to his villages in Israel: [Heb. righteounesses of his villages; that is, shewed to the villages, or country people. Comp.above,v.6.] then went the people of the LORD down to the gates. [that is, they might freely and without fear go in and out at the gates]
\p
\v 12 . Awake, awake, Debora, awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captives [Heb. thy captivity] captive, thou son of Abinoam:
\p
\v 13 . Then he made him that remaineth, have dominion over the honorable. (among) the people: [That is, the Lord gave unto the remnant of Israel, the rule and dominion over the great and eminent ones of the Canaanitish people. Oth. he gave the dominion of the remaining (enemy) unto the honorable, or, mighty, great (ones) of the people (of Israel) or, he made the remaining people have dominion over the honorable (one)] the LORD maketh me to have dominion [or, giveth me dominion] over the mighty
\p
\v 14 . Out of Ephraim [Here Debora relateth, how the tribes behaved themselves in this battle; attributing to some; praise: to others, shame and disgrace, according to every ones demerit] was their root against Amalek. [Some understand this of Debora, dwelling on Mount Ephraim, above chap.4, 5. Who, by the grace of God, was as it were the root and original of all this expedition against the Canaanites, who in respect of their enmity and ruine, may well be compare with Amalek. Others apply it unto Josua, who also was of Ephraim, and subdued Amalek, Exod.17.13. Oth. whose root is by Amalek; that is, Juda and Simeon, whose beginning extended it self from mount Ephraim unto Amalek, as appeareth, comparing above chap.1.16. with 1 Sam.15.6.] after thee was Benjamin among thy people: [that is, the tribe of Benjamin followed also after thee, O Lord, among the rest of thy people. Some apply it unto Ephraim, whom Benjamin should have followed] out of Machir [that is, the tribe of Manasseh, whose first-born son was Machir, jos.17.1.] marched down the Law-givers, [that is, the Eldest, and Judges of the people] and out of Zebulon, drawing by the staff of the writer. [viz. the people to them: see above chap.4. on v.6. oth. who drew with the staff, or pen of the writer; that is, used the writing pen, or, by means of letters or missives, drew the people together, or caused them to assemble together. Compare above, chap.4. on ver.6.]
\p
\v 15 . The Princes [Oth. my Princes.] in Issachar, so was Barak, he was sent into the valley on his feet: [see above chap 4. 10,14.] in the divisions of Reuben dwelling on the other side of Jordan, keeping himself as it were separated from his brethren] the imaginations of hearts were great. [or, impressions, purposes, conclusions; that is, they were very show, dull, drowsie, having (as we say) great wisdom in the brain, and pretending many difficulties, which withheld and hindred them from coming to help their brethren, keeping themselves as neuters between both, having more regard to their own particular, then to the common interest. Oth. For, or, by reason of Ruebens separations, there be great thoughts of heart; that is, this causeth great jealousies and woundings: so in the following verse. Some conceive, that there is extolled the great valour and courage which they had formerly manifested in marching over the Jardon in the behalf their brethren, wherewith this remisness and backwardness of their now shewed, did not well agree]
\p
\v 16 . Why remainedst thou [viz. O Rueben] sitting between the stalls [or two rowed folds, or, sheep-cotes. The Hebrew word seemeth to relate to this, that the stalls or sheep-cotes were formerly made in two rows, one opposite to the other, (as it is now also usually practiced) between which, a man might sitly pass, and give to each heir due food or nourishment. Oth. between two burthens, like an Ass that loaden on both sides, layeth himself down to take rest. Compare Gen.49. 14.] to hear the bleatings [or whistings, pipings, hissings] of the flocks? [this tribe, to wit, the tribe of Reuben was exceeding rich, and abounding in cattel. See Num.32,1,&c.] the divisions of Reuben had great searchings of heart. [See on the former verse]
\p
\v 17 . Gilead [That is, the Gileadites, whereby is understood the half tribe of Manasseh, dwelling on the other side of Jordan. Gilead was a son of Machir: see jos.17.1,4. Otherwise, by Gilead may also be understood Reuben, God, and the aforesaid half tribe of Manasseh together, as dwelling in Gilead. Se Numb.32.5, 29, 33.] remained on the other side of Jordan; and Dan, why did he keep himself in ships? [the inheritance of Dan and after lay for the most part by the Sea. See concerning Dan, jos.19.40, 46. And concerning Aser also there; vrs.24, 26. These tribes also in this battle tarried at home, to escape the danger, or to save themselves with their goods in ships, or on high rocks] Aser-sate by the sea-haven, and abode in his torn places. [That is, in cities and villages that were ruined, and not well senced: or, in creeks which break into the land by sea-floods. Oth. upon his cliffs, or, high rocks.]
\p
\v 18 . Zebulon, it is a people, (that) have disdained their soul unto death, [Heb. that is, unto dying, and have so jeoparded their lived and persons unto death, that they seemed as it were to condemn life, and willingly to offer up themselves for Israels deliverance. Seeof the verb rendred disdaining, Job27. On vers.6.] likewise Naphtali: on the high places of the field; [that is, upon mount Thabor, keeping close to Barak, and with him courageously going down to battle. See above chap.4. 10,14.]
\p
\v 19 . The Kings came, they fought, then fought the Kings of Canaan at Thaanach, at the waters of Megiddo: [places pertaining to the half tribe of Manasseh. See above chap.1.27. and compare jos.17.15, 18.] They brought no gain of silver thence. [No silver, or, money; Oth. they brought not a (small) piece of silver thence, whence they thought to have had a great booty.]
\p
\v 20 . From heaven they sought: the stars out of their courses fought against Sisera, [By these phrases is intimated, that God fought both from above and beneath by manifold creatures, and means against Sisera and his Army.]
\p
\v 21 . The brook Kilon rolled them away, [or, swept them, brushed them away, through the violence of the steam, which was caused from above by storm and tempest] the brook Kedamim, [running from the mountain into the brook Kison, as the Map sheweth. Oth. the brook of antiquities; that is, the very old brook which was of old, from the beginning, and was made and preserved by God for that end and purpose] the brook Kison: O my soul, tread down the strong. [that is, despise the power of the enemy. Oth. my soul trod upon the strong: trusting through prayer, and Gods instinct or inspiration that they should be as it were trodden down and laid under foot. Hebr. the strength; viz. of the mighty and powerful enemy, who is now laid under our feet.]
\p
\v 22 . Then the horse hoofs were broken to shivers: by means of the running, [or, stamping, trotting, beating (the ground:) that is, by reason of their hasty and disorder war, and running away,] the running of his mighty ones. [Who being put to flight; sought to escape by the swistness of their horses, but all in vain.]
\p
\v 23 . Curse Meroz, [a City, or Country near the brook Kison, not far from the place where the battle was sought, on the South-borders of Issaschar] saith the Angel of the LORD, [compare below, chap.6.11, etc.] Curse her inhabitants continually: [Heb. curse cursing,] because they came not to the help of the LORD, [that is, to the help of Israel, which the Lord commanded and appointed: or, to the Lords people: Otherwise it is spoken of God after the manner of man, he properly needing no mans help,] to the help of the LORD with the mighty men. [viz. which followed Barak and Debora.]
\p
\v 24 . Blessed be [See Genes.14. on vers.19.] above women. So in the sequel] Juel, the wife of Heber the Kenite: blessed be she above women in the tent, [that is, in her tent, where she had done that praise-worthy act, Or, (that dwell) in tenes.]
\p
\v 25 . He asked water, she gave (him) milk: she brought butter [Oth. butter-milk; where the butter was yet in] in a Lords bowl. [Heb. in a bowl of glorious (ones:) that is, in such a great bowl or cup as your great and mighty men, Lords and Princes, and other Potentates were wont to use.]
\p
\v 26 . She put her hand [viz. her left hand] to the nail, and her right hand to the workmens hammer: [Or thus: her hands stretched themselves out, the one to the nail, the right hand to the workmens hammer,] and she knock Sisera, she strook off his head, [The Hebrew verb is properly used of the striking off of measures that are too full, or heaped up to the top. The meaning is, that she cut off his head] when she had nailed thorow, and pierced his temples. [The Hebrew verb rendered here piercing thorow, signifieth properly to change, for good or for evils and consenquently to go thorow; or, to pierce thorow from the one to the other: an to the other: an also to destroy.]
\p
\v 27 . Between her feet he bowed himself, [To wit, through pain, or striving to lift up himself, or to raise himself up. but straightway falling down, etc.] fell all along, lay down there: between her feet he bowed himself, he fell; where so ever he bowed himself, there be lay, quite spoiled. [Heb. properly wasted; that is, quite ruined, utterly undone. For here you might have seen such a mighty and stout General sled on foot quite disheartened, tired, and by a woman hid and covered close, lie nailed to the ground, bowed, and dead.]
\p
\v 28 . The mother of Sisera looked out at the window, and cried thorow the lattesse, [Or, little peep-window] why lingereth his charet to come? Why tarry the goings of his charets behind? [heb. the goings, the feet, or, footsteps of his charets.]
\p
\v 29 . The wisest of her Court-Ladies [Oth. Princesses] answered: [Oth. every one of her wisest Court-Ladies answered her,] she also answered her saying to herself:
\p
\v 30 . Should they not then find [That is, get, meet with] (and) divide the prey? [As if she had said, I do ill in looking so soon for them, considering they must first find out and divide the prey, etc.] a Damsel, [Or, sweet-heart, wench,] (or) two Damsels for every man? [Heb. for the head of one man: that is, for every head, for every man] For Sisera a prey of divers colours, embroidered of divers colours, embroidered on both sides, for the prey-necks. [Heb. for the necks of prey: that is, the necks of those, to whom the best prey belongeth, as Officers and Commanders, or such as have quit themselves well in the fight, and have gotten good booty, so that a great part belongeth to him; or them that came behind, and carried the prey upon their necks, or had fetch it with hazard of their necks.]
\p
\v 31 . So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD on the contrary let those that love him [viz. the Lord he] as the sun when he ariseth [or goeth forth ] in his might[that is let them go on in power and splendor as the sun ariseth and goeth forth compare Isaiah 40.31] an the land was quiet forty years.

\s Israel is grievously punished for their sins by the Medianites verse 1 &c. they cry unto the Lord who by a prophet shews them the cause of theses miseries 6 the angel of the Lord cometh to Gideon and calleth him to Israel’s deliverance from the power of the Medianites 11 the relation of the miracle that happened about the meats that Gideon set before the angels 17 Gideon buildeth an altar unto the Lord and breaketh down by the command of the Lord the altar of Baal for which he cometh in danger of the inhabitants but its protected by Joas 24 Gideon prepareth sight against the Medianites and strengthened of God in his calling by a miracle. 33.
\p
\v 1 But the children of Israel did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord so the Lord delivered them into the hands of the Medianites [Heb. of Median and so in this whole history see of these Numbers 25.17,18 and 31.2 &c.] seven years.
\p
\v 2 . Now when the hands of the Medianites waxed strong against Israel because of the Medianites the children of Israel made [ or prepared repaired fitted] themselves the dens which are in the mountains and the caves and the strong holds [to hide and secure themselves in them against the Medianites.]
\p
\v 3 . For it came to pass when Israel had sowen that the Medianites came up this they had done formerly every year and now they did it in the seventh year again and the Amalekites and those of the east [that is who dwealt eastwards especially the Arabians who were wont to abide in tents see below chapter 8.10,11 and Genesis 29 on verse 10 and Job 1 on verse 3 Heb. children of the east] came also up against him [Viz. against Israel as is said in the beginning of this verse.]
\p
\v 4 . And they camped themselves against them and destroyed the increase of the land till thou come unto Gaza [lying in the land of the great sea thus destroying the whole land of the east to west ] and they left no victual in Israel nor small cattle nor ox nor ass.
\p
\v 5 . For they came with their cattle and their tents they came like grasshoppers in multitude[for their army consisted of about an hundred and five and forty thousand of fighting men as may be seen below chapter 8.10 besides the revel rout that do usually follow such kind of camps that look for no resistence or opposition ] so that they and their camels could not be numbered [Heb. had no number that is they could very hardly by reason of their multitude be numbered so chapter 7.12 on the contrary its said of a small company of the people that were people of number that is easy to be numbered see Genesis 34 on verse 30 ]and they came into the land to destroy it.
\p
\v 6 . So Israel was much impoverished because of [Heb. before the face that is before or because of their presence ] the Medianites then the children of Israel cried unto the Lord.
\p
\v 7 . And it came to pass when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord because of the Medianites.
\p
\v 8 . That the Lord sent unto the children of Israel a man that was a prophet [Heb. A man a prophet compare above chapter 4 on verse 4] who said unto them thus saith the Lord the God of Israel I have caused you to come up out of Egypt and led you forth out of the house of bondage.
\p
\v 9 . And I have delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the ahnd of all that oppressed you and I have driven them out of your face and given you their land.
\p
\v 10 . And I said unto ye I am the Lord your Godfear not the gods of the Amorites in whose land ye dwelt but ye obey not my voice.
\p
\v 11 . Then came an angel of the Lord [understand the the son of God who below verse 14 and 16 is called by the proper name of God the Lord or Jehovah compare Genesis 18 on verse 17 and 48.16 see also above chapter 5.23.] and set himself under an oak which is an Ophra which he longeth unto Joas[because Joas as it is thought was the chiefest man there or executed the magistrate’s office compare below verse 31.32] the Abi-Ezrites [ of the tribe of Manasseh see Joshua 17.2 and below verse 34,35, 1Chronicles 7.14,18 there was another Ophra situate in the tribe of Benjamin Joshua 18.23] and is son Gideon thressed wheat [not with oxen whereof Detronomy 25 on verse 4 but with a stick of flail as some expound it to give the less suspition or to get speedily some provision] by the press [that is in the place where the wine press or olive press stood where according to the opinion of some they wont to thresh that no man might perceive it and that this wheat might be safer hid and laid up against the approaching want or necessity ] to flee the same [that is to take that wheat along with him in his flight or to make his fathers house flee when he should have threshed his wheat for their provision ]before the face of the Medianites[ who already where upon the march see below verse 33 an dteh following chapter.]
\p
\v 12 . Then the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him the Lord is with thee thou mighty man of valour.
\p
\v 13 . But Gideon said unto him oh![of this phrase or manner of speaking see Genesis 43 on verse 20 so below verse 15.] my Lord [Gideon sheweth him civil honor and respect for as much as he yet knew him to be no more then a man for that he appeared to him in the form of the shape of a man ] if the Lord be with us why then should this befallen us?[ Heb. hath all this found us ?that is come upon us ] and where be all his wonders which our forefathers told us of saying did the Lord not bring us up from Egypt ? But now the Lord hath forsaken us and hath delivered us into the hands of the Medianites.
\p
\v 14 . then the Lord turned himself unto him [ or the Lord beheld him looked upon him giving him with all the command and power requisite to deliver Israel as followeth ] and said go thy way in this thy might[which thou now receives of me ] and thou salt deliver Israel out of the hand of the Medianites have I not sent the?[ye indeed will the Lord say for thou hearest say go with promise of a good issue or event therefore doubt not but thou salt accomplishor bring to good effect that for which I give thee a commission compare above chapter 4 on verse 6.]
\p
\v 15 . And he said unto him oh! My Lord [see on verse 13] wherewith shall I deliver Israel? [thus he asketh to have further satisfaction and fuller assurance of this high and weighty calling compare Luke 1.34] behold my thousand [viz. unto which belong it appeared from Exodus 18.25 Deuteronomy 1.15that the people of Moseh were divided into thousand each thousand having their Governors and superiors &c.] it is the poorest in Manasseh and I am the least in my fathers house.
\p
\v 16 . And the Lord said unto him because I will be with thee therefore thou salt smite the Medianites as one man [as if thou hadst to deal but with one man that is thou salt easily slay them.]
\p
\v 17 . And he said unto him if now I have found grace in thine eyes do or shew me a token that it is thou that speaketh with me [that is to assure me thou art for this purpose sent of God that I ,may entertain and embrace this calling with a good conscience.]
\p
\v 18 . Depart not hence I pray thee until I come unto thee and bring forth my present and set it before thee [as yet he thanks him to be but a man and a prophet and therefore according to the manner and custome of the patriarchs desire in hast to entertain and welcome him with meat and drink verse 22 he first perceives that it was an angel compare herewith below chapter 13.15] and he said I will tarry until thou come again.
\p
\v 19 . And Gideon went in made ready a kid and unleavened cakes and lay them upon the rocks and pour out the broth [viz. upon the meat and cakes to make the miracle the clearer and the word illustrious compare 1 Kings 18.34] and he did so.
\p
\v 20 But the Angel of God said unto him: Take the flesh and the unleavened (cakes) and lay then upon the rock, and pour out the broth: [viz. upon the meat and the cakes, to make the miracle the clearer, and the word illustrious. Compare 1 King. 18.34] and he did so.
\p
\v 21 . And the angel of the Lord put forth the uttermost part of the staff that was in the hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes [compare Leviticus 9.24 1Kings 18.38 2Chronicles 7.1 and the angel of the Lord vanished of his eyes [understand very quickly and unawares so that he saw him no more whereby he was sore terrified and affrighted as followeth.]
\p
\v 22 . Then Gideon perceived that it was an angel of the Lord [viz. I must die Gideon feareth that he must die because he hath seen this vision as appeareth by the ways of God in the following verse compare below chapter 13.2 Genesis 16 on verse 13 and 32.30Exodus 33.20 Deuteronomy 5.24,26] from face to face[compare Deuteronomy 5 on verse 4.]
\p
\v 23 . But the Lord said unto him peace be unto thee fear not thou salt not die.
\p
\v 24 . Then Gideon built there an altar unto Lord and called it is the Lord is peace [Heb. Jehovah Schalom meaning the Lord is our peace promiseth giveth and sendeth us peace Isaiah 9.6 and 53.5 Micah 5.5 Luke 2.14 Acts 10.36 Hebrews 7.2 so is he called the lord our righteousness Proverbs 23.6 2 he had promised here Gideon unto his peace as also unto his people peace and deliverance from the Medianites] it is yet unto this day in Ophar of Abi-Ezrites [see above on verse 11 and compare below verse 34.]
\p
\v 25 . And it came to pass the same night that the Lord said unto him take a steer of the oxen which are thy fathers to wit the second steer [others and the other or second understanding that God had commanded to take two steers but as much as in the sequel only mention is made of that steer of seven years old and no command given concerning another what therewith should be done therefore the translation in the text is of the most interpreters approved ] of seven years old [even so and which have been fatted so many years as Israel’s miseries under the Medianites had lasted this steer is thought to have been kept and satted by Joas for to offer the same unto Baal according to the idolatrous custom of that time] and break down the altar of Baal, which is thy fathers and cut down the grove that is by it. [God will have Gideon to begin his calling from the purging of Religion.]
\p
\v 26 . And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top [Heb. head] of this strong hold, [Understand the rock, out of which the fire issued that consumed the meat with the broth, ver.21. Such kind of rocks they used in time of need for a strong hold and refuge] in a convenient place: [Or, orderly, decently. Heb. in, or, with order, decency, fitness. Oth. With a log (of wood) to place it orderly under the steer for burnt-offering] and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt-offering with the wood of the grove which thou salt have cut down. [This was a special command of God in this back-sliding time, otherwise the offering or sacrificing was ordinarily enjoyed the Priests]
\p
\v 27 . Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and die according as the LORD had spoken to him: but it came to pass, because he seared his Fathers house, and the men of the city, to do it by day, that he did it by night.
\p
\v 28 . Now when the men of the city arose early in the morning; behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove that was by it: and that second bullock was offered upon the altar.
\p
\v 29 . So they said the one to the other; [Heb. the man to his neighbor] who hath done this thing? [Heb. word, matter, thing. so in the sequel] and when they enquired, and asked, it was said, Gideon, the son of Joas, hath committed this.
\p
\v 30 . Then said the men of that city unto Joas; bring forth thy son that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.
\p
\v 31 . On the contrary Joas said unto all that stood by him; will ye contend [Plead, argue, dispute; so in the sequel] for Baal? Will ye deliver him? He that shall contend for him, [i.e. he that shall further dare to own his cause, and plead or speak before him. It seemeth that Joas before through humane frailty, yielded or connived at the people wickedness, but now being strengthened and confirmed by this divine apparition, he setteth himself strongly against it] shall yet this morning be put to death: if he be a God, let him contend for himself [or, let him plead against him (viz. Gideon) that he, etc.] because he hath cast down his altar.
\p
\v 32 . Therefore he called him on that day Jerubaal, [i.e. Joas called his son Gideon, Jerubaal, i.e. let Baal contend, or Baal shall contend. See below chap.7.1.] saying: Let Baal contend [or, shall contend, plead. Some conceive that the people being as it were drowned in Idolatary, expected that Baal should plague this Gideon in a special manner, but finding the contrary, followed him the more eagerly, as a stout and valiant champion of God] against him, because he hath cast down his altar.
\p
\v 33 . Now all the Midianites, and the Amalekites, and the children of the East, were gathered together: and they passes over, [i.e. over the Jordan. See below chap. 7.v.24.] And they camped themselves in the valley of Jisreel [Which lay in Issachar, on the other side of mount Gilboa, which was between Manasseh and Issachar. See Jos.19.18. ending Westward by the city of Jisreel. There was another Jisreel in Juda, Jos.15.16.]
\p
\v 34 . Then the spirit of the LORD arrayed Gideon, [Or, clothed him, viz. with such gifts of wild dome, zeal, courage, and valour, as the spirit of the Lord knew to be needful for him, as weapons for this work. See of this phrase also, 1 Chron. 12.18. 2 Chron. 24.20. Luke 24.49. Rom 13.14. And compare Gal. 3.27. Ezr.4.24. Col.3.12.] and he blew with the trumpet [i.e. caused it to be blown: as above chap.3.24.] and the Abi-Ezrites were called together after him. [Heb. Abi-Ezer, i.e. they that were of the family or kindred of Gideon and his father Joas, (above v 11.) were called together, and gathered themselves unto him. So in the sequel.]
\p
\v 35 . Also he sent messengers into all Manasseh [Because the one halt tribe dwelt on this, and the other half on the other side Jordan] and they also were called together after him: likewise he sent messengers into Aser, and into Zebulon, and into Naphtali, [these three tribes were nearest, and lay one by another, toward the North, and at the sea. In Issachar which lay between Manasseh and Zebulon, was the whole army of the enemy as above, vers.33.] And they came up to meet them.
\p
\v 36 . And Gideon said unto God: [Otherwise, Gideon had said: conceiving that this was done aforetime, before Gideon went up against the Midianites: and that it is here again re-iterated as a reason or ground, whereby Gideon being fully strengthened and confirmed in his faith, embraced and executed the calling with zeal and servancy of spirit, it is worthy our observation, that God granted Gideons request without any reprehension at all from whence, as also from the manner of his request, it plainly appeareth, that he requested it not out of diffidence and unbelief, but out of humility, for the strengthening and confirming of his faith] if thou wilt deliver Israel by mine hand, according as thou hast said.
\p
\v 37 Behold, I will lay a woolen fleece on the floor: [Or, Ground-plat, court-place without doors meaning an even void place in the open air] if there shall be onely dew upon the fleece, and driness upon all upon all the earth [Understand the over earth thereabout, and so below ver.39.] then shall I know that thou wilt deliver Israel by mine hand, as thou hast spoken.
\p
\v 38 . And it was so: for he rose up early the next day, and he crushed the fleece together, and he wrang the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.
\p
\v 39 . And Gideon said unto God; Let not thine anger kindle against me, that I may speak but this once: let me prove I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let there I pray thee be driness onely upon the fleece, and let dew be upon all the earth.
\p
\v 40 . And God did so the same night: for dryness was onely upon the fleece, and (there) was dew upon all the earth.
\c 7
\s Gideon campeth himself against the Midianites with his men of war, v.1. which upon Gods command by Proclamation and atoken, he is sain to lessen to the number of but three hundred, which he alone keepeth to him, 2.he spyeth out the camp of the Midianites, and being strengthened by the telling and interpretation of a strange and wonderful dream, divideth his army into three companies or brigades: who all with one accord blow with trumpets, and break the pitchers ( wherein the lamps were) in pieces, 15. Whereby the Midianites are terrified, and put to flight, yea destroy one another, 21. The next adjoining Israelites are sent for up, to pursue after the enemy that fled, and to stop their passage over the Jordan, 23. two Princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Seeb, are taken prisoners, and slain, 25.
\p
\v 1 Then Jerubbaal (who is Gideon), [See above chap. 6.33.] rose up early, and all the people that were with him, and they camped themselves at the fountain of Harod: [Heb. Charod, lying on the borders of Manasseh, on this side of the mountain, behind which the Midiates were camped on the other side. See chap.6. On v 33. This name the fountain might have obtained from the fear and trembling of the 22000. Israelites, below v.3. There was another fountain by Jisreel, at the end of this mountain Westward. See 1 Sam.29. 1.] so that he had the half of the Midianites toward the North, behind the hill More, [This seemeth to have been one of the mountains of Gilboa: so called from the timely, or seasonable rain, that fell in great abundance upon the fields that lay on the top of it; as some do gather, by comparing of 2 Sam.1.21. Upon this mountain Gilboa was Saul also slain by the Philistines, 1 Sam.31.1.] in the valley.[viz. Jizreel, as above chap.33.]
\p
\v 2 . And the LORD said unto Gideon ;The people that are with thee are too many ,that l should deliver Midianites into they hand: left Israel vaunt themselves against me saying ,my hand hath deliver me.[Or my hand hath brought me salvation ,or deliverance, procured the victory. See the like phrase ,Exodus.8.9.]
\p
\v 3 . Now then proclaim [that is cause to be proclaimed or published] now before (or in) the people saying; whoever is fearful [Deutronomy20.vs.8] and dismayed,[or quaketh, trembleth, is afraid] let him return and make baste [or fly away, pack himself away this morning, or early. The Hebrew word seemeth to look at go on speedily, quickly, hastily,] to the mountain Gilead: [Hebrews, from, or, towards the mountain of Gilead; i.e. along the way that goeth toward and from that mountain, being the same mountain that lay right over against Gideons army, beyond the Jordan, from whence those of the half tribe of Manasseh were come to him. See above chap 6.on v.36.] Then (there) returned of the people two and twenty thousand, (so) that they remained ten thousand.
\p
\v 4 . And the LORD said unto Gideon; the people are yet too many, make them go down to the water, and I will try them [Heb. properly, separate, purifie, as a Goldsmith purifieth the silver, separating the good metal from the dross] for thee there: and it shall be, (that) of whom I shall say unto thee; This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee: but also those of whom I shall say: This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go with thee.
\p
\v 5 . And he made the people go down to the water: then said the LORD unto Gideon; Whosoever shall lap with his tongue of water. [viz. which he in a standing posture shall have taken up with hand, as is declared, v.6. This was a token of courage and nimbleness: as the bending of the knee was a token of flowness and laziness] according as a dog would lap, him shalt thou set alone by himself; likewise every one that shall bow down upon his knees for to drink.
\p
\v 6 . Then was the number of those that had lapped with their hand (put) to their mouth, three hundred men, but all the rest of the people had bowed down upon their knees to drink water.
\p
\v 7 . And the LORD said unto Gideon; by these three hundred man that have lapped, will I deliver you, and give the Midianites to thine hand: therefore let all that people [Understand the rest of the people] depart, every man unto his place.
\p
\v 8 . And the people took victual in their hand, and their trumpets; [Otherwise, then they took the victual of the people in their hand, as also their trumpets. To wit, those three hundred men took of the people victual for themselves, so much as was needful, as also trumpets, to wit, three hundred, (v.16.) holding in their march, as they went, yet twenty more, according to the account of some; for Gideons army was at first 32000 strong, as appeareth above v.3. each thousand having ten trumpets, or each hundred one] and he [viz. Gideon] let all those men of Israel [viz. all the rest, as in the former verse] go, every men unto the tent, but he kept those three hundred men: and he had the host of the Midiantes beneath in the valley. [On the other side of the mountain, so that he had it before him, in the valley of Jizreel, when he stood upon the mount, where also it may be a part of Gideons camp lay, as may be gathered from the following verse]
\p
\v 9 . And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him; Arise, go thy ways into the camp: [viz. of the Midianites] for I have delivered it into thine hand.
\p
\v 10 . But if thou fear to go down, [viz. thy self alone] then go down, thou, and Pura, thy boy (or servant) unto the camp.
\p
\v 11 . And thou salt hear what they shall speak, and afterwards shall thine hands be strengthened, that thou salt march down it the camp: [i.e. thou salt become courageous, and fitted ready, prepared to fall upon their camp, or army] then went he down, with Pura his boy unto the out side of the files [the Hebrew word properly signifieth; fived, that by fives, or five in a rank, or five a breast, are wont to march, as Exod. 13.18. Hence proceedeth the signification of the armed men, as the military orders, and especially the ranks and files commonly ought to be ] that were in the camp.
\p
\v 12 . And the Midianites, and Amalekites, and all the children of the east, lay in the valley, [Heb. Fell, or were fallen in the valley, i.e. they lay spread abroad in the valley] as grasshoppers in multitude; [see above chap.6.v.5.] and their camels were innumerable, [as above chap.6.5.] as the sand which is on the sea shore, [Heb. on the lip of the sea] in multitude.
\p
\v 13 . Now when was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, behold, I have dreamed a dream, and behold a tosted barley loaf [Or, a pan cake of barley bread; otherwise, a noise of barley bread. This implyeth the meanness and contemptibleness of the means, whereby God would smite the Midianites, and deliver his people] rolled it self into the camp of the Midianites, and it came to the tent, and smote it, that it fell, and overturned it upside down, [Heb. overturned it upward,] that the tene lay along.
\p
\v 14 . And his fellow answered, and said; This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon, the son of Joas, the Israelitish man: God hath delivered the Midianites and this whole camp into his hand.
\p
\v 15 . And it came to pass, when Gideon heard the telling of this dream, and the interpretation, [Heb. breaking; i.e. dismembering, expounding, unloosening. It seemeth that the phrase is borrowed from fruits, that have had shells which must be broken ere a man eat the kernel] thereof, that he worshipped: [Heb. he bowed himself: honoring and praising God for his wonderful providence, and this comfort. See Gen.22.on v.3.] and he returned unto the camp of Israel, and said; Arise, for the LORD hath delivered the camp of the Midianites into your hand.
\p
\v 16 . And he divided the three hundred men into three heaps: [Heb. heads: so below v.20. and chap.9 34.] and he gave every one a trumpet in his hand, [Heb. he gave trumpets into all their hands] and empty pitchers, and lamps in the midst of the pitchers.
\p
\v 17 . And he said unto them; Look towards me, [Heb. look or, thou shalt look, or, from me, that is, according to the nature of the Hebrew tongue, sometimes as much as, towards, or, on me, right opposite against me. Compare above on v.3. Else it may be translated, from, or, of me shalt tlou look, and do so, i.e. thou shalt learn and observe of me, or, from me, what thou shalt do] and do so: [viz. as ye see me do] and behold, when I shall come to the outside of the camp, it shall be, that according as I shall do, so shall ye do.
\p
\v 18 . When I shall blow with the trumpet, and all that are with me; then also shall ye blow with the trumpet, round about the whole camp, and ye shall say, For the LORD, and for Gideon. [Understand with all, is this battle fought. So is the Hebrew letter Lamed used in matters of battle, Exd.14.14 and 25. Or thus, unto the LORD, and Gideon; viz. be the victory. or thus. of the LORD, and of Gideon; viz. the sword, from vers.20.]
\p
\v 19 . So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came into the outside of the camp, in the beginning of the middlemost night watch, [i.e. About midnight, when the Watchers were wont to be changed] when they had but newly set the centinels; [Heb. setting they had set; otherwise, but they had raised up all the centinels; or, they raised up onely the centinels] and they blew with the trumpets; also they beat the pitchers in pieces, that were in their hands. [Or, they beat them one against another, so that the pieces were scattered here and there. Compare Psal.2.9. Jer.13. 13. and 48. 12.]
\p
\v 20 . So the three heaps blew with the trumpets, and brake the pitchers; and they held with their left hand the lamps, and with their right hand the trumpets to blow: and they cryed, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.
\p
\v 21 . And they stood every one in his place, round about the camp: then all the camp ran away, and they cryed, and fled.
\p
\v 22 . When the three hundred blew with the trumpets, then the LORD set [i.e. ordered] the sword of the one against the other, [Heb. of the man against his neighbor, or, fellow, companion: i.e. the Lord ordered it so, that through amazedness and astonishment they fell one upon another, and slew one another] and (that) in all the camp fled unto beth-Sitta [out of the valley where they were camped, along the mountain towards Jordan, and again along Jordan inward toward the land: where lay Abel-Mehola, and Tabbath in Manasseh. Of Abel-Mehola see 1 Kings 4.12. and 19.16.] toward Tseredath, unto the border [Heb.lip] of Abel-Mehola, above Tabbath.
\p
\v 23 . Then were the men of Israel called together, out of Naphtali, and out of Aser, and out of all Manasseh, and they pursued after the Midianites.
\p
\v 24 . Also Gideon sent messengers into all the mountain of Ephraim, [Lying on the other side of Manasseh Southward, that the Midianites being inclosing on both sides, and being stopped at their passage over the Jordan, might no ways escape. But between these were Zebah and Tsalmunna with about 15000. Men got over the Jordan, whom Gideon with his three hundred men pursued, and flew. See chap.8.10,12.] saying; Come down to meet the Midianites, and intercept them the waters, unto Beth-Bara, [lying near by Jordan: some take this for Bethabara, Job. 1.28.] to wit, Jordan: so every man of Ephraim was called together, and they intercepted (then) the waters unto Beth-Bara, and [the particle and, is here (according to the opinion of many) as much as, to wit] the Jordan.
\p
\v 25 . And they took captive two Princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb, and killed Oreb upon the rock Oreb, [Situate by the East- end of the mountain of Ephraim, not far from the Jordan. This place was afterward so called, because of this history, as also the other place Zeeb] and they killed Zeeb in [otherwise by, or, at] the press sat Zeeb, and pursued the Midianites: and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb unto Gideon over the Jordan. [Or, on this side of Jordan: for the Hebrew word, according to the occasion of the thing, signifieth both. In the following chapter is mentioned, that Gideon with his three hundred men passed over the Jordan, to pursue after the Midianites, and the rest of the East-Country people. See there v.4. The opinion of most Interpreters is, that this, and that which followeth in the three first verses of the eighth Chapter, is here in the first place related, to give a full and perfect account of what was bravely and gallantly acted by the men of Ephraim on this side Jordan, but that it was then onely first offered, when Gideon returned from pursuing the Midianites beyond Jordan, and had gotten the full victory over them. But the attentive Reader will be able to Judge aright by comparing this verse with the third verse of the next Chapter. See the annotation there.]
\c 8
\s The Ephraimites murmur against Gideon, but are appeased by him, ver.1, 2, etc. be pursueth the two Kings of the Midianites beyond the Jordan, where those of Succoth and Penuel spitefully refuse to refresh his men, 4. He falleth upon and taketh captives the two kings of the Medianites and scattereth the rest of their army 11. Returneth back he punisheth those of the Succoth and Penuel 13 putteth the two kings to death viz. zebah and Tsalmunna 18 refuseth to rule over Israel 22 demandeth a present of the spoil and maketh thereof a scandalous Ephod and placeth it at Ophra 24 Gideon children, wives, death and burial 30 Israel revolteth again from God and is ungrateful to Gideon’s family 33.
\p
\v 1 Then said the man of Ephraim unto him [see the annotate on the last verse of the former chapter ] what crime [ [Heb. thing matters] is this that thou haste done to us that thou didst not call us when thou wentest forth to fight against the Medianites? And they contended strongly with him.
\p
\v 2 . He on the contrary said unto them what have I now done like ye? [that is which may be compare with your did or act are not the gleanings of Ephraim [he understandeth the pursuit after the flying army of the Medianites and the taking of the two princes captive this he compareth to the gleaning of the grapes which were left in the vintage and that which did to the vintage itself.] better then the vintage of Abiezer? [ That is whole work done by me my house for he was an Abiezrite see above chapter 6.11.]
\p
\v 3 . God hath delivered the princes of the Medianites Oreb and Zeeb into our hands what could I do like ye? [it seemeth that Gideon at this time had not as yet slain the two kings of the Medianites zeeba and Tsalmuna] then their anger [ Heb. spirit courage] cease from when he spake this word.
\p
\v 4 . Now when Gideon was come to Jordan he passed over with the three hundred men that were with him being weary and pursuing [viz. the enemy.]
\p
\v 5 . and he said unto the men of Succoth [lying next beyond Jordan in the inheritance of Gad by the brook or river Jabbok see hereof Genesis 33 on verse 17 Psalms 60.8 and 108.8and of another Succoth exodus 12.37 Numbers 33.5] give I pray to you some loaves [others pieaces ] of bread unto the people which follow my footsteps [Heb. which are or at my feet that is follow my footsteps or are in my service or under my conduct compare Exodus 11.8] for they are weary and I persue under Zebah and Tsalmuna kings of the Medianites.
\p
\v 6 . But the princes of the Succoth saith [Heb. said in the singular number to wit each of them or as the president in the name of all] is then the palm of the hand of Zelbah that we should give bread unto thine army ?[that is hast thou unto their strength or mighty in thy power ? they not only refuse or deny to grant the request of Gideon but they also vilify him and flout at him as one that would too soon become a conquerour singing as we say triumph before the victory is obtained they conceive that it will fall otherwise out and therefore will have nothing to do with Gideon.]
\p
\v 7 . then said Gideon however when the Lord shall deliver Zebah and Tsalmuna in mine hand I will then thresh your flesh [that is your bodies punishing the unfaithfulness and division in a special manner which shall extend to your contempt and shame ] with thorns of the wilderness[which lay between Succoth and Penuel by the brook Jabbok which Jacob passed over when he had wrestled with God and before had seen the armies of angels and had said of that place that is Gods field calling the place Mahanajim that is the two armies Genesis 32.1,2,22,24hence this wilderness lying nearby said place is called the wilderness of Jahanajim as appears from 2Samuel 17.27,29] and with briers.
\p
\v 8 . And he went up thence unto Penuel [see genesis 32.30 and 1Kings 12.25] and spake unto them [viz. those of Penuel ] in the like manner and in the men of Penuel answered him according as the men of Succoth hath answered.
\p
\v 9 . Therefore he also spake unto the men of Penuel saying when I return in peace I will cast down this cover [on which perhaps they relied as on a strong hold and therefore spake the most disdaintfull and proudly.]
\p
\v 10 . Now Zebah and Tsalmunna were at Korkorand their camps with them about fifteen thousand all that were left of the whole camp of the children of the last and those that fell [viz. that were before slain were an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew the sword [ Heb. drew in the singular number that is everyone of them hath been sitteth and traineth up for the war this serveth the more to argument and increase Gideon’s victory see also this phrase of the drawing of the sword below chapter 20 on verse 15, 17,25,40 2Samuel 24.9 2 kings 3.26 &c.]
\p
\v 11 . And Gideon went up by them that dwell in tents [viz. of the Arabians who from thence are called of the Sinitae as if we should say tentners or tent inhabitants] towards the east of the Naboh and Jogheha [these two places lay also beyond Jordan towards the east] and he smote the camp for the camp was careless [or secure quietnot imagining the Gidoen with his men being wearied with chasing and persuing the enemy would be able so soon to get over Jordan and so on by the way towards the east to overtake them.]
\p
\v 12 . And Zebah and Tsalmunna fled but he pursued after them and he took captive both the kings of the Medianites Zebah and Tsalmunna and affrighted all the camp [because he fell upon them unaware they were affrighted and slain as they fled or at least quiet routed and scattered and altogether enfeebled.]
\p
\v 13 . Now when Gideon the son of Joas returned from the battle before the rising of the sun [or from that emmediately after or towards the rising of the sun for he without taking rest he wearied with his men and had pursed the enemy others from by the rising of Heres or from the sun rising that is from the east wither he had pursued from the Medianites others after the ascension of the sun that is towards the time that it began to descend.]
\p
\v 14 . he took captive a boy or servant of the Succoth and examined him the same described unto the princes of the Succoth and their eldest threescore and seventeen [that he gave unto Gideons the names of the princes in writing that he might punish none but those that were guilty.]
\p
\v 15 . then came he unto the men of Succoth and said behold there Zebah and Tsalmunna concerning whom ye scornfully upbraided me saying is the palm of the hand of Zebah and Tsalmunna already in thine hand that we should give bread unto men that are weary?
\p
\v 16 . And he took the eldest of that city and the thorns of the wilderness and briers and by the same made the men of Succoth understand it [viz. therein they had offended that is this punishment or special chastisement he left an example for to unteach those of Succoth such pride and high mindedness as appeared in them whether they were slain as those of Penuel or whether with this despicable chastisement they left alive here is no mention made.]
\p
\v 17 . And threw down the tower of Penuel and flow the men of the city [understand the governors of the city and all guilty persons as from the former example may be gathered.]
\p
\v 18 . Afterwards he said unto Zebah and Tsalmunna what manner of man where they ye flew at Thahor ?[ a mountain lying in Zebulon towards the sea close by the brook Kison on the south side of the mountain over against the valley of Jesreel where the Medianites had had their camp when this was done is not here mentioned its supposed to be that they did it in expedition as well in respect of the situation of the place as because it seemeth to have known that some of his brethren were slain and that these kings had slain upon this mountain certain persons of note and quality without knowing who they were although he suspected them to be his brethren ]and they said as thou art were they of like form as the sons of a king.
\p
\v 19 . Then said he they were my brethren the sons of my mother so truly as the Lord liveth if had not let them live would not slay you.
\p
\v 20 . And he said unto Jether his first born rise up slay them but the youth drew not the sword for he feared because he was yet a youth.
\p
\v 21 . Then said Zebah and Tsalmuna rise thou up and fall upon us for according as the man is so his strength then Gideon rose up and slew Zebah and Tsalmuna and took the little moons [viz. those golden neck ornament which in the Hebrew had their name from the moon because they were round like the full moon] which they were on the necks of their camels.
\p
\v 22 . Then said the men of Israel [Heb. the man that is one among the people] unto Gideon rule over us as well as thou and thy son, sons [Heb. also thou also thy son also thy son, sons.]
\p
\v 23 . But Gideon said unto them I will not rule over you neither shall my son rule over you the Lord shall rule you [from these words and below verse 29 appeareth plainly that those that are called Judges in this book were no kings governors in these countries or ordinary judges or rulers of the people but were in a special and peculiar manner called for the deliverance defense help and service of Israel preserving and maintaining the freedom and order of their commonwealth see above chapter 2 on verse 16.]
\p
\v 24 . Moreover Gideon said unto them I would desire a request of you give me but each of you a fore head ornament of his prey [or the forehead ornament which he hath taken for a prey Heb. a forehead ornament or ear ornament of his prey the Hebrew word is used of both as well of golden ornament on the forehead as on the ears see Genesis 24.22,47 and 35.4] for they [viz. the enemies] had, had golden ornament because they were Ishmaelite [see Genesis 37 on verse 25 13 &c.]
\p
\v 25 . And they said we will willingly give them [Heb. giving we will give] and they spread abroad a garment and cast thereunto every man a forehead ornament of his prey.
\p
\v 26 . And the weight of the golden ornament which he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold [see genesis 24 on verse 22 and Numbers 7 on verse 14 ] besides the little moons and chains [others golden vials boxes cafes wherein they carried along with them sweet smelling of precious ointments to be used in the swooning sicknesses and diseases as also for the wounds and sores ] and purple garments for which the kings of the Medianites had wore and besides the neck-bands or collars that had been on the necks of the camels.
\p
\v 27 . And Gideon therefore made an Ephod [see Exodus 28 on verse 4] and put it [ viz. upon an high staff pole or some such things for a memorial of this victory but the same was after his death much abuse as some gather from verse 33] in his city at Ophra and all Israel went thither a whoring after it [commiting with the spiritual whoredom that is idolatry and superstition see Leviticus 17 on verse 7 and 20 on verse 5 as they did with the brazen serpent set up by Moseh 2Kings 18.4] and it became a snare unto Gideon and his house [compare Exodus 20.33and 34.12 Deuteronomy 7.16 the meaning is that it was counted unto Gideon as having given occasion unto the people who were very prone to idolatry for sin and tended to the ruin and destruction of his house see the following chapter.]
\p
\v 28 . Thus the Medianites were subdued before the face of the Israel and lifted up their hands no more [ Heb. added not or went not on to lift up their head and the land was quiet forty years in the land of Gideon [that is as long as Gideon lived.]
\p
\v 29 . And Jerubbaal [that is Gideon see above chapter 7.1] went his way and dwelt in his own house [not taking open him the government of his own people which was offered him yet serving him with his authority and countenance for the maintenance and preservation of the religion and defense of their liberty as from verse 28 and 33 may be gathered quite otherwise did his illegitimate so Abimelech chapter 9.]
\p
\v 30 . Now Gideon had seventy sons which came forth out of his thigh [see genesis 46 on verse 26] for he had many wives.
\p
\v 31 . And his concubines [of concubines see Genesis 22 on verse 24] which was at Sichem [situate on a mountain in Ephraim not far from Samaria westward from Ophra were Gideon dwelt see Genesis 12 on verse 6 and 33.18 it was one of the cities of refuge Joshua 20.7 hereabout also were Josephs bones buried Joshua 24.33] she bare him also a son and she called [Heb. made set] ] his name Abimelech [whom the Sichemites after Gideon’s decease made king passing by yea murdering all the legitimate sons of Gideon save Jotham who hid himself see chapter 9.]
\p
\v 32 . And Gideon the son of Joas died in a good old age [Heb. grayness hoariness see Genesis 15 on verse 15] and he was buried in the sepulcher of his father Joas at Ophrah of the Abi-Ezrites [ see above chapter 6.11.]
\p
\v 33 . And it came to pass when Gideon was dead that the children of Israel turned themselves about and went whoring after Baalim and they made Baal Berith[that is the Lord of the covenant of the same God who had oftentimes clearly and in highest measure and degree forbidden them to do it although they persuaded themselves that this might well consist when they comprised the name and covenant of God therein and pretended the same to be done to the service and honor of God see also of this idol below chapter 9.4 and of the Baals Judges 2 on verse 11] their God.
\p
\v 34 . And the children of Israel remembered not the Lord their God who had delivered them out of the hand of their enemies round about them.
\p
\v 35 . And they shewed no kindness to the house of Jerubaal that is of Gideon according to all the good which he had done unto Israel [see below chapter 9 verse 5,16,17,24,56,57.]
\c 9
\s Abimelech the son of Gideon moveth by his friends those of Sichem to make him king and to furnish him with money verse 1 &c. he murthered his seventy brethren 5 Jotham the youngest escaping setteth before the eyes of Abimelech and the Sichemites that had and made him king by a very fit comparison what they had done and should betide them both in regard thereof 7 some three years after ariseth tumult and war between the Sichemites and Abimelech 22 who warreth against Sichem conquereth and destroyeth it 43 and setteth the tower of Sichem into which the people were fled on fire 46 Subdueth also Thebez 50 But when he intended to burn the tower with people that were in it a woman by casting down a piece of milstone upon his head breaketh hi s scull in pieces and likewise he is run through by own armor bearer, 52.
\p
\v 1 Now Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Sichem [see above chapter 8 on verse 31] unto his mother brethren [that is kinsmen and friends so verse 3, 18] and be spake unto them and to all the family of the house of his mothers father saying.
\p
\v 2 . Speak I pray you before the ears of all the citizens [Heb. Lords masters citizens see of the Heb. word Baal Genesis 14 on verse 13] of Sichem what is better for you that seventy men all the sons of Jerubaal should reign over you or that one men should reign over you?[ intimating that this without doubt is best understanding by this one men himself ] remember also that I am bone and your flesh [of the mothers side sprung from Sichem and near in blood unto many of you see of the phrase Genesis 2 on verse 23 and 29 on verse 14.]
\p
\v 3 . Then spake his mothers brethren of him before the ears of all the citizen of sichem all the same words and their hearts inclined towards Abimelech [Heb. after that is follow after him ] for they said he is our brother.
\p
\v 4 . And they gave seventy silverlings [see Genesis 20 on verse 16] out of the house of Baal Berith [that is out of the idolatrous temple of this idol which stood upon the high hill of the map as the map sheweth see also of this idol above chapter 8 on verse 33] and Abimelech hired therewith vain and light men [that is company of bare needy vain fellows that had no fear of God before their eyes compare 1Chronicles 13.7] which followed after him.]
\p
\v 5 . And hecame into his fathers house at Ophra and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubaal seventy men [there were but sixty nine slain but Joas escaped but the holy scripture according to the custom nameth the full and perfect number see Genesis 42.13 Numbers 14.33 1Chronicles 15.5] upon one storm but Jotham Jerubaal’s youngest son was left for he had hid himself.
\p
\v 6 . Then all the citizens of Sichem and all the house of Millo [Heb. Beth-millo a city lying as the map sheweth eastward from Sichem at the mountain of Ephraim not far from Beth-aven others understand hereby the strong hold mentioned below verse 46,49 which was the court or city hall where the council were wont to meet being beset or guarded with a garrison of soldiers which also was used in this transaction or dealing the word Millo cometh from filling fullness fulfilling whereby some take it from a deep valley or pit which being filled up with earth and rubbish served a building of a strong hold which from thence was called Millo some conceive that the generation or family of Abimelechs grandfather by the mothers side and from hence was also called the word Millo is also found 2 Samuel 5.9 1Kings 9.15 and 11.27 2Kings 12.20 1Chronicles 11.8,2Chronicles 32.5] assembled themselves and went and made Abimelech king [Heb. as if we should say that kinged him king] by the high oak or pillar oak [see Joshua 24.26,27 this place they purposely made choice of to cloth their work with a shew of holiness which not withstanding they had begun with abominable tyranny and without calling thereunto the other tribes or asking counsel of God had finished others by the plain of the pillar ] which is by Sichem.
\p
\v 7 . When they told this to Jotham he went and stood on the top [ Heb. the head] of the mountain Gerizim mount Ebal whereof may be seen Deuteronomy 11.29,30 Joshua 8.33] and lifted up his voice and cried and he said to them [as it seemeth by instinct or inspiration of God who confirmeth Jot hams words below verse 24.67] hearken to me ye citizens of Sichem and God will hearken to you.
\p
\v 8 . The trees [see a like rhetorical speech or parable serving for instruction 2Kings 14.9] went once [or at a time] forth [ Heb. going they went] to anoint a king over them and they said unto the olive tree be thou king over us.
\p
\v 9 . But the olive tree said unto them should I live [or shall I cause to cease or be compelled to cease so in the sequel] my fatness[ that is the oil] which God and men commend in me [for the oil was used in the sacrifices and lamps of the tarbenacle as also in the anointing of the priest kings and as is gathered from the 1Kings 19.16 prophet and usually for meat and ornament and to trick up mans body others wherewith by me they honor God and man ] and should I go forth to bear forth sway over the trees ?[ that is as king to go run about to turmoil and take care of other trees.]
\p
\v 10 . Then said the tree unto the fig tree come thou and be the king over us.
\p
\v 11 . But the fig tree said unto them should I leave my sweetness and good fruits? And should I go forth to bear sway over the trees?
\p
\v 12 . Then said the trees unto the vine come thou and be king over us.
\p
\v 13 . But the vine said unto them should I leave my new wine which cherisheth God and men [because wine was used in sacrifices and rejoiceth the heart of men Psalms 104.15 others which cherisheth gods that is great Lords and men that is common people] and should I go forth to bear sway over the trees?
\p
\v 14 . Then said all the trees unto thorn-bush or bramble come thou be king over us.
\p
\v 15 . And the thorn-bush said unto the trees if you in truth anoint king over me come then put your confidence under my shadow but if not let fire go forth out of the thorn bush and consume the Cebars of Libanon [this mountain was very famous for very fair glorious cedar trees being exceeding strong and long lasting which grew in great abundance upon it whereof divers parable and similitudes are taken in scripture see 2Kings 14.9 2Chhronicles 2.8 Psalms 29.6 and 92.13 Cant 3.9 and 5.15 Isaiah 60.13 Jeremiah 22.23 Ezekiel 17.3 and 31.3 Hosiah 14.6,7,8.]
\p
\v 16 . So now [Here Jotham expounded the propounded parable] if ye have done it in truth and sincerity that ye have made Abimelech king and if ye have done well by Jerubaal an dby his house and if ye have done him according to the dessert [[or benefit] of his hands.
\p
\v 17 . for my father fought for ye and he cast his soul [that is spared not his life and persons but adventured or put the same in great danger for your sake] far away [Heb. from over against ye or from near at hand as when a man casts a thing out of his sight far from him asas not willing to look upon it to provide for it or to mind it compare Deuteronomy 28.66 and below chapter 12.3] and delivered ye out of the hand of the Medianites.
\p
\v 18 . But ye risen up this day [that is at this time] against the house of my father and have slay sons seventy men upon one stone [he upbraideth the Sichemites against this murder because they had assisted Abimelech in it see verse 24] and ye have made Abimelech a son of his maidservant [thus he calleth a disdaintful manner his fathers concubines to wet upon the Sichemites the seemliness an dinjustice of their act [king over the citizens of Sichem because he is your brother.
\p
\v 19 . If ye then have dealt in truth and sincerity with Jerubaal and his house this day then rejoice ye over Abimelech and let him also rejoice over ye.
\p
\v 20 .. But if not then let fire go forth from Abimelech and consume the citizen of Sichem and the house of Millo an dlet fire go forth from the citizens of Sichem and from the house of Millo and consume Abimelech.
\p
\v 21 . Then Jotham ran away and fled [it seemeth that by this connexion of words which signify one and the same thing is intimateth his celerity and swiftness in fleeing that he might not be overtaken by his brother] and went to beer [where this place lieth is uncertain some do guess that in the tribe of Simeon on the uttermost border of Canaan where are some places that bear the name beer but with some addition] and he dwelt there because of his brother Abimelech.
\p
\v 22 . Now when Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel.
\p
\v 23 . Then God sent an evil spirit [this may be understood of an evil angel or Satan as 1Samuel 18.9 and 19.9 or of a great disagreement or disaffection dissension which Satan by the just judgment of God stirred up between them compare 1 Samuel 16.14 and 2 Samuel 16 on verse 10 and 24 on verse 1] between Abimelech and between the citizens of Sichemdealt deceitfully towards Abimelech.
\p
\v 24 That the violence [that is punish of violence ] e to the sons of Jerubaal [Heb. the violenvce or the cruelty of the seventy sons that is doneo them so o] might come an that their blood might be laid upon Abiech their brother who had slain him and upon the cizens of sicem[Viz. on the head of Abmelech and of the Sichemites these phrases the holy scripture useth to signify the revenge that shall be taken of violence murder and blood shed compare 1Samuel 25.39 2Samuel 1.16 1Kings 2.31 ,32,33 Esther 9.25 Psalms 7.17 Jeremiah 51.35 Matthew 23.34,35 & 27.25 Acts 5.28 & 18.6 &c. see also below verse 56,57] who had strengthened his hands to kill his brethren[that is who had strengthened and assisted Abimelech in his wicked design compare above chapter 7 verse 11.]
\p
\v 25 . And the citizens of Sichem set those that lay in wait for him upon the tops [Heb. heads] of the mountains and they robbed all [viz. that were affected to Abimelech] that passed along on the way by them [Sichem lay upon the pass from and towards Jerusalem and the mountains of Gerizim Ebal of the Baal berith Zalmon &c. lay close by it see above verse 7 and below verse 46,48.] and it was told Abimelech.
\p
\v 26 . Gaal the son of Ebed came also with his brethren and went over into Sachem [leaving their former dwelling place] an the citizens of Sichem relied on him [Viz. Gaal of whom they made use as their head and captain general against Abimelech.]
\p
\v 27 . And they went out into the fields and gathered their vineyards and trod the grapes [in token of confidence and wilifying in Abimelech] and made songs of praises [others made good chear as they were wont to do in vintage time] and they went into the house of their god [viz. into the idolatrous temple of Baal berith see above verse 4] and did eat and drink and cursed Abimelech.
\p
\v 28 . And Gaal the son of Ebed said who is Abimelech? [See the like upbraiding phrase 1Samuel 25.10] and what is Sichem? [as if they should say Sichem is to be accounted more excellent and honorable then so as that the Lords and citizens thereof should be servants to this abimelech others who is Sichem? Conceiving it here to be the son of hemor Genesis 34 whom the son of Jacob would not serve but slew him or some of his posterity hearing that name to whom Abimelech as being a tyranny and of mean descent is not to be compared ] that we should serve him? [viz. Abimelech] is he not the son of Jerubaal?[that is of Gideon who was an utter enemy of our God Baal and as a mean man lived in no place of government or authority] and Zebul his chief captain?[who by Abimelech was made governor of Sichem verse 30 and was here present at this time or at least wise in the city verse 36] serve rather men of Hemor the father of Sichem for why should we serve him?[the men of Hemer and see that is that are descended from or were of posterity of Hemor that father of Sichem or those that govern not tyrannically as abimelech but formerly as abimelech did who was esteemed as the father of this city some take it as that if ye must need serve would to God ye might serve Hemor and his posterity but our ancestors would not do that why then should we now serve this Abimelech.]
\p
\v 29 . O that this people [ Heb. which shall give that &c. see of this manner of wishing Deuteronomy 5 on verse 29] where in my hand [that is in my power under my command] I would then take away abimelech [that is I will make a quick riddance of him ] and he said unto Abimelech [Viz. to him being absent as if he had been present as boasters or braggadorios where wont to do scornfully disdaining] increase thine army and go forth [strengthen thy people as thy wilt or canst and come out an meet me in the field.]
\p
\v 30 . When Zebul the governor of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed his anger kindled.
\p
\v 31 . And he sent cunningly [that is secretly letting it to be known that he sent Heb. with craft deceit and falsehood some take the Hebrew word therma for a city which they conceive to be the same which below verse 41 is called Aruma] messengers unto Abimelech behold Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren are come to Sichem and behold they with this city deal enemy like with thee [or they compel strengthen arm fortify this city against thee others they besiege thee with the city viz. aruma wherein thou art .]
\p
\v 32 . Now therefore get up by night thou and the people that is with thee and lie in wait in the field.
\p
\v 33 . And be it in the morning when the sun riseth that get up early and fall upon this city and behold if he [viz. Gal] and the people that is with thee came out against thee then do to him according as thy hand shall find [that is so as the opportunity shall offer itself according as the thing shall require and thou shalt find sitting see like signification of this phrase or manner of speaking Leviticus 25 on verse28 1Samuel 10.7 & 25.8 Ecclesiastes 9.10.]
\p
\v 34 . Then Abimelech rose up and all the people that was with by night and they laid wait against sichem with four heaps [Heb. heads so above chapter 7.16 and below verse 43.44]
\p
\v 35 . And Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood at the door or entering of the city gate and Abimelech rose up and all the people that was with him out of the ambush.
\p
\v 36 . When Gaal saw that people he said unto Zebul Behold there cometh people down from the tops [heb. heads] of the mountains but Zebul said unto him thou seestteh shadow of the mountains for men.
\p
\v 37 . But Jaal proceeded further to speak and said behold there come people down out of the midst [Heb. the navel a similitude taken from the mans body] often land [otherwise out of the top of the land] and the heap cometh from way of oak Meonenim [or even plain of the stone gazers sooth sayers jugglers.]
\p
\v 38 . Then said Zebul unto him where is now thy mouth [that itchy boasting and big speaking] wherewith thou sadist who is Abimelech that we should serve him? Is not this the people thou hast dispised us? Go now out I pray thee and fight with him.
\p
\v 39 . And Gaal went out before the face of the citizen of Sichem and he fought against Abimelech.
\p
\v 40 . And Abimelech pursued after for he fled before his face and there fell many slain unto the door of the city gate.
\p
\v 41 . Now Abimelech abode at Aruma [a city lying southwad of Sichem not far off from the meeting of the led from Jerusalem and Silo to Sichem in the mid way between Silo and sichem] and Zebul thrust out of Gaal and his brethren that they might not dwell in Sichem.
\p
\v 42 . And it came topazes the next day that the people went to the field and they told it to Abimelech.
\p
\v 43 . then took the people and divided them into three heaps an he laid wait in the field and he looked an behold the people went out of the city then he rose up against them and he rose them.
\p
\v 44 . For Abimelech and the heaps or companies [that is one heap of the heaps or troops see below chapter 12 on verse 7] that were with him fell upon them and stood still at the door of the city gate and the two other heaps fell upon all that were in the field an demote them.
\p
\v 45 . Moreover Abimelech fought against the city that whole day and took the city and slew the people that were therein an he brake down the city and sowed it with salt[intending now fully an to triumph an not imagining what himself deserved he doth this out of pride for a token that Sichem should remain forever barren desolate and inhabitated for an everlasting memorial for an exemplary punishment of this rebellion compare Numbers 18.19 Deuteronomy 21.23 2Chronicles 13.5 Zeph2.9 but that Sichem was afterwards built and inhabitated appeareth 1Kings 12.1,25.]
\p
\v 46 . when all the citizens of the tower heard that they went into the strong hold into the house of god berth [called above verse 4 Baal-Berith some think that this was Bethel berith yet another temple of Baal lying upon a hill close to Sichem westwards as Baal temple and thought themselves very safe and secure in them but as it appeareth all in vain.]
\p
\v 47 . And it was told abimelech that all the citizens of the tower of the Sichem had assembled themselves together.
\p
\v 48 . Therefore Abimelech went up to the mountain Zalmon [which lay on the west side of Sichem see also of this mountain Psalms 68.15] be all the people that was with him and Abimelech took an axe [Heb. axes] in his hand and cut down a bough from the trees and took in up and laid it upon his shoulder and he said unto the people that with him what ye have seen me do [otherwise I have done what ye have seen ] make haste do as I [to wit have done.]
\p
\v 49 . So all the people likewise cut down every man his bough and followed abimelech and put them to the sword and burned the hold with fire so that also all the people of the tower of Sichem died about a thousand man and women.
\p
\v 50 . Moreover Abimelech went [imagining that these victories would continually follow him] to Thebez [a city lying north of Sichem between the mountains of Samaria and Gilboa] and he camped himself and took it.
\p
\v 51 . But there was a strong tower in the midst of the city so all men and women and the citizens of the city fled thither and shut the gate before them and went up to the roof of the tower.
\p
\v 52 . Then came Abimelch unto the tower and stormed the same [or fought against it] a he approached at the door of the tower to burn the same with fire.
\p
\v 53 . But a woman cast a piece of millstone [properly the uppermost piece of the millstone which is turned about upon the nether most stone] upon Abimelech head and brake his skull in pieces.
\p
\v 54 . Then called he hastily the youth that carried his arms and said unto him draw out thy sword and kill me that they may not say of me a woman hath killed him an his youth thrust him and he died.
\p
\v 55 . Now when the men of Israel [that had held with Abimelech or were of his side] saw that Abimelech was dead they departed everyone of his place.
\p
\v 56 . Thus God hath caused Abimelech’s wickedness to return [to wit upon Abimelechs head that is rewarded recompensed him see above verse 24] which he had done to his father killing his seventy brethren [his own brethren his father legitimate sons above verse 5 whereas he was but the son of concubines chapter 8.30,31.]
\p
\v 57 . likewise all the evil of men of Sichem [that had aided abimelech in his tyrannical design above verse 24] did God cause to return upon their head and the curse of Jot ham the son of Jerubaal came upon them see above verse 20.]
\c 10
\s Thola and Jair are judges verse 1 &c. Israel falleth into abominable idolatry 6 therefore God delivers them up into the hand of the philistines and the Ammonites who grievously plagued them 7 Israel at length by humble prayer and supplication and departing from idolatry obtaineth favor with God 10 the Ammonites and Israelites camp themselves the one against the other in Gilead 17.
\p
\v 1 Now after Abimelech arose [being thereunto raised by Godwin a special manner a the other judges were so verse 3] to save Israel [to restore Israel in peace and well being after Abimelechs death and to defend them against all that should go about to molest assault and oppress them ] Thola a son Pua the son of Dodoa man of Issachar[ one of the least tribes ] and he dwelt at Samir on the mountain of Ephraim [to distinguish it from another Samir lying upon a mountain in Judea at the uttermost border of Canaan Joshua 15.4.]
\p
\v 2 . And he judged Israel three and twenty years and he died and was buried at samir.
\p
\v 3 . And after him Jair that Gileadite [out of the land of Gilead Lying on east side of Jordan see Numbers 3.2Joshua 17.1,5 and Genesis 31 on verse 21, 48] and he judged Israel Israel two an twenty years.
\p
\v 4 . And he had thirty sons riding upon thirty ass colt [see above chapter 5 on verse 10] and they had thirty cities which they called Havvoith Jair [or Jair towns villages so called from their fathers Jair or from the former Jair or from the former Jair of whom we read Numbers 32.41 Deuteronomy 3.14 perhaps this Jair was one of the former Jair posterity] unto this day which are in the land of Gilead.
\p
\v 5 . And Jair died, and was buried at Kamon. [A city lying on the North of mount Gilead, in the land of Basan, belonging to the half tribe of Manasseh]
\p
\v 6 . Then the children of Israel went onto do that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, [Each man proceeding from evil to worse, as appeareth by that which followeth,] and served Baalim, and Astharoth, [see above chap.2.on v. 13.] and the Gods of Syria, and the Gods of Zidon, and the Gods of Moab, and the Gods of children of Ammon, together with the Gods of the Philistines: and they forsook the Lord, and served him not.
\p
\v 7 . Therefore the anger of the Lord kindled against Israel: and he sold them into the hand of the Philstines, and into the hand of the children of Ammon, [That is, he gave them, or delivered them into the power, &c. See above chap 2.on v.14.]
\p
\v 8 . And they oppressed and trod upon [Or, offered violence, brake, crushed. Otherwise, had oppressed and trodden upon] the children of Israel that same year: [when they fell into this abominable Idolatry, so ill requeting the lord for the long-continued peace he had given them] unto eighteen years [otherwise, being the eighteenth year, (to wit) all, &c.] (Oppressed they) all the children of Israel, that were on the other side of Jordan, in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead. [See above on verse 3.]
\p
\v 9 . Besides the children of Ammon went over Jordan, to war, even against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was sore distressed.
\p
\v 10 . Then the children of Israel cryed unto the Lord, saying; We have sinned against thee, as well because we have forsaken our God, as because we have served Baalim?
\p
\v 11 . But the Lord said unto the children of Israel: Did not I (deliver) you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines.
\p
\v 12 . And the Zidonians, and Amalekites, and Maonites, [Hebrew.Maon. There was a city of that name in the South of Juda, by the Wilderness of Maon, See Josua.15. on v.55. Otherwise, the inhabitants (of the land)] (which) oppressed you, when you cryed to me, (did not I) then delivered you out of their hand?
\p
\v 13 . Not withstanding ye forsook me, and served other Gods: therefore I will not deliver you any more. [Hebrew. I will not add or proceed to deliver you. This the Lord threaten on condition, if they do not sincerely repent, forsake all Idolatry, and serving the true God onely, as the sequel declareth,]
\p
\v 14 . Go your ways, and cry unto Gods, which ye have chosen: let them deliver you, in the time of your distress. [This is a phrase or manner of speaking called Ironia, or scoffing: as if God had said, go try whether the Gods whom ye here to fore worshipped will deliver you]
\p
\v 15 . But the children of Israel said unto the LORD; we have sinned, do thou to us according to all that is good in thine eyes: [Hebrew. That is, according to thy good will and pleasure] onely delivered us, we pray thee, this day.
\p
\v 16 . And they put away the strange Gods, [Hebrew. The Gods of strangers; that is, of the heathen that were estranged from God and Isael] out of the midst of them, and served the LORD: then his soul was grieved [or, distressed, perplexed. Hebrew. Properly shortned, moved down. This is after the manner of men, and by way of comparison affirmed of God. Compare Exodus.6.9. Numbers.21.4. and below chap.16.16. Job 21.4,&c.] For the labour [or weariness: that is, the misery, suffering, sorrow, which happened unto them, and wherein their soul labored] of Isreal.
\p
\v 17 . And the children of Ammon were called together, and camped themselves in Gilead: [See above on v.3.] on the contrary the children of Isreal [being after their repentance comforted and strengthened of the Lord, who raised up Jephtah, for their deliverer. See chap.11.] were gathered together, and camped themselves at Mizpa. [Lying upon or at the mountain of Gilead. See Genesis.31.49. And below chap.11.11,29. There are other places more of this name; because the Hebrew word signifieth a top, or otherwise a fit place, where watch may be kept, and a man may see afar off: see of a country called Mizpa, Josua.11.3. Lying under mount Hermon at the sea. Of Mizpa in Judah, Joshua. 15.38. And in Benjamin, Josua.18.26. And Mizpe of the Moabites, 1 Samuel.22.3. See also 1 King.15.22. Nehem.3.7, 15, 19. Jeremaih.40.6. Hos.5.1.]
\p
\v 18 . Then said the people, the Princes of Gilead, [Theeldest of the people. See below chap.11.5.] The one to the other; the man to his neighbor] who is the man that shall begin to fight with the children of Ammon? The same shall be head to all the inhabitants of Gilead. [The meaning is, he that shall do that, shall be the Commander in chief, or Judge over all the Isrealites that dwell in Gilead. See such manner of asking or questioning, duet.20.5,6, etc. Psalms.34.13, 14. And elsewhere.]
\c 11
\s Jephtah, as illegitimate, being then sent by his brethren, goeth to dwell in the land of Tob, where he, with some few people, exerciseth himself in expeditions, verse.1, etc, is afterward called by the eldest to be Commander in chief against the Ammonites, 5. Which he accepteth of but with condition, 9. Sendeth twice messengers to the King of the Ammorites, to move him to desist from war, but all in vain, 12. Wherefore Jephtah moved by the spirit of God, marcheth up against him, and maketh a rash vow, 29. He smiteth the Ammorites, 32. And performeth his vow on his daughter, 34.
\p
\v 1 Now Jephtah the Gileadite [See above chap.10.on verse.3.] was a mighty man of valour; he was a child of an harlot: [Hebrew. Was arson of a woman, and harlot? See Deut.23.on verse 2. Otherwise, the son of a hostess] but Gilead had begotten Jephtah. [To distinguish him from the son of Machiz, Josua.17.1,3. Being nevertheless of his posterity, of the same name]
\p
\v 2 . Gileads wife bare him also sons: and the sons of this woman [To wit, of his lawful wife,] being grown great, thrust Jephtah out, and said unto him; thou shalt not inherit in the house of our father, for thou art a son of another woman. [That is, of a strange woman, which was no legitimate or lawful wife of our father]
\p
\v 3 . then Jephtah fled before the face of his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: [A country lying along the mountain of Gilead, by the entering of the West-Arabia, on the borders of the Ammonites. See also 2 Samuel.10.6, 8.] And vain [or idle, necessitous, that had no means, or took no course for a livelihood] men assembled themselves unto Jephtaah, and went out with him. [to wit, to fetch, or take prey, perhaps from the Ammonites, which the more might move the Isrealites to make use of him in their war against the Ammonites]
\p
\v 4 . And it came to pass, after certain days, that the children of Ammon made a war against Israel, [Here is now prosecuted the history, which was begun in the end of the former chapter, after that there was inserted the precedent relation concerning Jephtah] after certain days [viz. after the Declaration made by the Rulers or Governours of the Gileadites, chap.10.18. or after the time expressed in the same chap.v.8.]
\p
\v 5 . So it came to pass, when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, that the eldest of Gilead went their way to fetch Jephtah [To wit, either by the Lords command, of whom they peradventure might have asked counsel, or at least by his special instinct and providence] out of the land of Tob. [See on verse.3.]
\p
\v 6 . And they said unto Jephtah; Come, and be a Governour to us [Or, Duke, General, but no King, as the Sichemites had made Abimelech] that we may fight against the children of Ammon.
\p
\v 7 . But Jephtah said unto the eldest of the Gilead; did ye not hate me, and thrust me out of my fathers house? Wherefore then ye come unto me now, while ye are in distress? [Hebrew. While anguish or, distress is to you]
\p
\v 8 . And the Eldest of Gilead said unto Jephtah; Therefore are we now come unto thee again, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon: and thou salt be a head unto us, over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
\p
\v 9 . Then said Jephtah unto the eldest of Gilead; If ye fetch me back again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD shall deliver them up before my face, shall I then be an head unto you?
\p
\v 10 . And the eldest of Israel said unto Jephtah; the LORD be an hearer between us, [For to be witness, or as judge between us both, to punish us, if we deal otherwise by thee. Compare Deut.1.16. 1 King.3.11. Lam.3.61,62. Malach. 2. 14.] If we do not so according to thy word.
\p
\v 11 . So Jephtah went with the Eldest of Gilead, and the people made him an head and Ruler over them: and Jephtah and spake all his words [which he had spoken before the ambassadors of the people ] before the face of the Lord at Mispa [not by or before the ark of the covenant as this is often so taken but in the general assembly of the people made he this speech or declaration as a champion of faith Hebrews 11.31 with religious attention as in the presence of God or with calling upon his name and mutual oath the ark of the covenant was in Joshua’s time brought unto Silo Joshua 18.1 and was yet there in Bila’s time 1Samuel 1.3.]
\p
\v 12 . Moreover Jepther sent passengers unto the king of the children of Ammon saying [understand by the ambassadors so below verse 17 and in the following] what have I and thou to do one with another [Heb. what is it to me and thee? Or what have I and thou? See this Phrase also 2Samuel 16 on verses 19 John 2.4 &c.] That thou art come unto me to make war against my land?[Jupiter speaketh here in the name of the people whose champion he was.]
\p
\v 13 . And the king of the children of Ammon said unto the messengers of Jephtar because Israel when he went up out of Egypt took my land from Ammon unto Jabbok [see of Ammon Numbers 21.13,14,15 of Jabbok Genesis 32.22 &c.] and unto Jordan [from the mountain of Gilead eastwards unto Jordan westwards ] therefore restore now that again unto peaceably.
\p
\v 14 . But Jephtah proceedeth yet further and sent messengers unto the king of children of Ammon [this is a very discreet and remarkable act of Jephtah that he considering Gods command Deuteronomy 2.19 first desisteth to know the cause which have moved the Ammonites unto this war and thereupon seeketh to convince their king with many very strong and impregnable arguments and to draw him to desist all the tending to quitting and quieting of his conscience as also to the confirming and strengthening of Israel.]
\p
\v 15 . And he said unto him [that is by the messengers or ambassadors or sent this message to him ] then said Japthah Israel hath not taken the land of the Moabites nor the land of the children of Ammon [For God hath given command to the contrary concerning both because they were lots offsprings or posterity see Deuteronomy 2.9,19.]
\p
\v 16 . For when they were come up out of Egypt Israel then walked through the wilderness unto the red sea and came unto Kades [otherwise called Zin distinct or different from Cades Barnea see Genesis 14 on verse 7 Numbers 13 on verse 26 and chapter 20.14 and 33.36.]
\p
\v 17 . And Israel sent messengers unto the king of the Edomites saying let me I pray thee pass through thy land but the king of the Edomites gave no hearing and he sent also unto the king of the Moabites who would also not [this also may be gathered from Deuteronomy 2.29] so Israel also abode kades.
\p
\v 18 . Afterwards he [to wit Israel] walked in the wilderness and went round about the land of the Edomites and the land of the Moabites came from the rising of the sun at the land of the Moabites and they [the people of Israel ] camped themselves to the other side of Arnon [see above on verse 13] but they came not with the border of the Moabites for Arnon is the border of the Moabites.
\p
\v 19 . But Israel sent messengers unto Sihon the king of Amoritesking of Hesbon and Israel said [see above on verse 12] unto him let us I pray thee pass through the land unto my place [that is our to wit Israel our that is which is given us of God to wit the land of Canaan.]
\p
\v 20 But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his border [that is through his land so below verse 22] but Sihon gathered all his people and they camped themselves at jaza and he fought against Israel.
\p
\v 21 . And the Lord God of Israel delivered Sihon with all his people into the hand of Israel that they smote them so Israel took hereditarily all the land of the Amorites that dwelt in the land.
\p
\v 22 . And they took hereditarily all the borders of the Ammorites[ that is all the land Sihon included between the borders Arnon in the south Jabbok in the awest and in the wilderness or Arabia desert in the east and Jordan in the west] from Arnon unto Jabbok and from the wilderness unto Jordan.
\p
\v 23 . So now the Lord the God of Israel had driven out of possession the Ammorites from the face of his people Israel and shouldst be thou their heir? [Heb. shouldst thou inherit him? him to wit the Amorites that is the land of the Amorites so also in following verse Deuteronomy chapter 9.1 and elsewhere often as is Jephtar should say this is against right and equity.]
\p
\v 24 . Shouldst thou inherit him whom thy God Camos hath driven out of possession before thee? So shall we inherit all those whom the Lord our God driveth out of possession before our face [an idol of the Moabites and as here appeareth of the Ammorite see Numbers 21.29 1Kings 1.7 Jeremiah 48.7,13,46 to wit justly far as much as our God is the only true God to whom all belongeth and appertaineth.]
\p
\v 25 . Now then are ye much better [Heb. Better, better] then Baalak the son of Zippor the king of the Moabites ?[ the meaning is have ye so much more or greater right then Balak who was never changeable to Israel in or about it see concerning Balak Numbers chapter 22,23,24.] did he ever contend with Israel? Did he also ever war against them? [Heb. contending condend and so fighting fight or warning war.]
\p
\v 26 . Whilst Israel dwelt three hundred years [here as also elsewhere in the holy scripture is a full compleat Number set down although according to the computations of some some few years should be over and above when we count the years the departure of the children of Israel out of Egypt whereof Jephtah hath begun this Netative an more years are under three hundred when we should count from the victory of Israel obtained against Sihon see concerning this use of custom of the holy scripture Genesis 15 on verse 13 and below chapter 20 on verse 46 2Samuel 5.5] in Hesbon and in her towns and in Aroer and in her towns and in all the cities which are on the side of Aroer wherefore then did ye not recover over it that time?[ which the Ammonites in so long a time without doubt would have attempted to do if they had such right thereunto as they pretended to have.]
\p
\v 27 . Neither have I sinned against thee [as if Jephtah had said Israel hath given unto the Ammonites no cause to make war against them] but thou doest ill by me [Heb. thou dost ill with me] that thou makest war against me the Lord who is Judge this day between the children of Israel and between the children of Ammon.
\p
\v 28 . But the king of the children of Ammon hearken not unto the words of Jephtah which he had sent unto him [that is had caused to be told him to the ambassadors.]
\p
\v 29 . Then the spirit of the Lord came [ Heb. was waxed that is endued him as above chapter 6.34 and chapter 3.10] upon Gideon that he passed through Gilead and Mannasseh [ Through the division of the land of Gilead which the half of Mannasseh beyond the Jordan inhabited ] for he passed through unto Mizpa in Gilead [distinct from other places bearing the same name see above chapter 10. On verse 17] and from Mizpa in Gilead he passed through unto the children of Ammon.
\p
\v 30 . And Jephtah vowed a vow unto the Lord an said if thou shalt wholly [or certainly] deliver up [Heb. delivering salt deliver up] the children of Ammon into mine hand.
\p
\v 31 . Then shall that which goeth out that which shall go forth out of the door of mine house to meet me when I return in peace from the children of Ammon that shall be the LORDS [or unto the Lord to wit be hallowed or be consecrated ] and [otherwise or as if he should say if it may offered or may offer it if not it shall not withstanding he hallowed or consecrated unto the Lord ] I will offer it for a burnt offering [he meaneth if it be such a thing which according to the law of God it is lawful to offer now it was not only forbidden to offer man or any of mankind but also unclean beasts see Leviticus 27.11,12,13.]
\p
\v 32 . So Jephtah pass through unto the children of Ammon to fight against them and the Lord delivered them into his hand.
\p
\v 33 . And smote them from the Aroer [lying at the brook Arnon Deuteronomy 3.12 now where this brook runneth down from the mountain Gilead westward into the Jordan but out of the south end of the mountain runneth along southwards & at length falleth into the salt sea] till thou come to Minnith [lying in the east beyond the brook Arnon] twenty cities and unto Abel Rearming [this is by some translated the plain of the vineyards ] with a very great slaughter thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the face of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 34 . Now when when Japhtah came to Mizpa near his house behold his daughter went to meet him with drums and dances now she was a lone and only child he had not of him [ that which came or sprung from him ] else any other son or daughter.
\p
\v 35 . And it came to pass when he saw her that he rent his clothes and said Ah! My daughter thou hast quiet bowed me down [Heb. bowing down thou hast bowed me bowed me down thus is Jephtah troubled because his only child was to continue a virgin and no offspring or posterity was to be born unto him for her] and thou art among those that trouble me [that is thou troublest me in this thing as others have troubled me in other things compare Psalms 54 on verse 6] for I have opened my mouth unto the Lord and I shall not be able to go back [ that is I shall not be able to recede from my vow so high and strong that it could no ways be loosened nor broken.]
\p
\v 36 . And she said unto him my father hast thou opened thy mouth unto the Lord do unto me according as that which hath proceedeth unto thy mouth[ the daughter submitteth herself to the vow of her father under whose power she was yet stood and with whose consent she was besides might make a vow see Numbers 30.4,5 compare also Luke 2.37 1Corinthians 7.25,26,27,28]for as much as the Lord hath given thee perfect vengeance [Heb. hath done vengeance ] of the enemies of the children of Ammon.
\p
\v 37 . Moreover she said unto her father let this thing be done unto me cease two months from me [that is grant me two months time] that I may go my ways and go down to the mountains [some gather from hence that from Jephtah’s house lay upon an high mountain as places called Mizpa did commonly as watch places do lye upon high mountains see above chapter 10.17] and bewail my virginity [because of the bringing forth of the children was at that time highly esteemed and the contrary was held ignominiously and contemptible see Genesis 30 on verse23 observe here and in that which followeth that she will not go weep because she was to be sacrificed and killed for he offered up for a burnt offering but she speaketh only of her virginity agreeing with that which is relate thin the following verses] and my companions.
\p
\v 38 . and he said go thy ways and he permitted her to go two months then she went away with her companions and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.
\p
\v 39 . And it came to pass at the end of two months that she returned to her father who towards her fulfilled his vow [causing her to abide as is mentioned in that which followeth in her maiden state and condition and consencrating her apart from the Lord according to his vow verse 31 compare 1Samuel 2.22 Luke 2.37 1Corinthians 7.32] which he had promised and she knew no man [see Genesis 4 on verse 1 and 19 on verse 8 these words are a plain and naked exposition of that which Jephthah did unto hi daughter according to the sense and meaning of his vow ] moreover it became a custom [Heb. statute ordinance ] in Israel.
\p
\v 40 . That the daughters of Israel went their ways from year to year to speak with [talk together with discourse] the daughter of Jephtah the Gileadite [Viz. to accompany her and to comfort and cherish her in her maiden condition the Hebrew word is also found above chapter 5.11 where it hath the same signification which is here followed in the text] four days in the year.
\c 12
\s Those of Ephraim war against Jephtah without a cause verse 1 &c. and are slain to the number of the two and forty thousand 4 Jephtar dieth 7 after him are judges Ebzan 8 Elon 11 Abdon 13.
\p
\v 1 Then were the men of Ephraim called together and passed over towards the north [understand over Jordan unto the land of Gilead were Jephtar was northward ] and they said unto Jephtah why didst thou pass through to the fight against the children of ammon [as they had formerly spoken unto Gideon above chapter 8 on verse 1 but suffered themsemselves at that time to be persecuted but here they out of meer pride and insolence raise an intestine war and shew great ingratitude towards Jephtah to their own damage and detriment] and didst no call us to go with thee?[Jephtah declareth the clean contrary in the following verse ] we will burn thine house with thee with fire [others burn thine house over or above thee with fire.]
\p
\v 2 And Jephtah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon, [Heb. I was a man of strife, and my people, and the children of Ammon greatly] and I called you, but ye delivered me not out of their hand. [intimating, that although the Ammonites pretended or claimed not any right to the land of Ephraim, but of Israelites that dwelt in Gilead; yet not withstanding he had called the man of Ephraiom, as beingtheir brethren and confederates, to aid and assist them, but all in vain. Jephtah seeketh first by arguments to move them to desist from taking up arms, as he had before done before to the Ammonites. Concerning the Hebrew phrase, compare 2 Samuel.8.on v.10.]
\p
\v 3 . Now when I saw that ye [To wit, Ephraim] delivered (me) not, then I put my soul in my hand, [Heb. palm; that is, I jeoparded my self exceedingly: so 1 Samuel 19. On v.5. & 28.21. Job 13.14. Psalm.119.109. The phrase seemeth to be taken from those that carry some costly and precious, yet very brittle commodity, as glass, or the like, in their hand that are in danger to let it fall, and be broken. Compare above chap.9.17.] and passed throw to the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into mine hand; [confirming my calling, and the equity and justness of this war] wherefore are ye then this day come up unto me? [Seeing ye have no cause at all]
\p
\v 4 . And Japhtah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim; for the Gileadites being between Ephraim(and) between Manasseh, [In the Hebrew are the words thus transposed: for they said, ye are fugitives from Ephraim; (namely) the Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim, in the midst of Manasseh; that is, those that dwelt at the ferries of Jordan, between Ephraim and Manasseh: this verse is expounded in the following. Oth. ye Gileadites are Fugitives of Ephraim, among the Ephraimites and among the Manassites: As if those of Ephraim had spoken so scornfully and disdainfully of the Gileadites, or were wont to speak; and that was the cause or occasion of this war, and of their discomfiture: whereof the understanding reader may judge] said, [understand, unto the Ephraimites, whom they knew by their speech, when they, after that Ephraim was conquered and put to flight, thought to escape over Jordan into their own land] ye are fugitives [Heb. properly, such as have escaped, out-run, got sheer away] of Ephraim.
\p
\v 5 . For the Gileadites took from the Ephraimites the ferries of Jordan: [As Ephraim by Jephtahs edict had done to the Medianites, Judges.7.24. that they might not escape] and it came to pass, when the fugitives of Ephraim said, let me go over: that the men of Gilead said unto him, [to wit, unto every one of Ephraim that desired to pass over the Jordan] Art thou an Ephratite? [That is, Ephraimite: so 1 Samuel.1.1.] When he said, no:
\p
\v 6 . Then they said unto him, say now [to be sure, that he was of no tribe dwelling in Gilead, as Ruebenite, Gadite, or Manassite, who also might come to the ferries to pass over] shibboleth: [ that is, a stream, flood, or current: sometimes also an ear of corn. This word they made choice of, because it agreed well with the ferries of Jordan, and the Ephratites without suspition should bewray their speech; as it often happeneth, that one people or nation having one sort of language, yet in one part of the land pronounce divers words and letters, otherwise then they do in another. Compare Matthew.26.73.] but he said Sibbeleth, and could not so utter it right: so they caught him, and slew him at the ferries of Jordan: [Hebrew. Cut his throat, throated him] (so) that there fell at that time of Ephraim, two and fourty thousand.
\p
\v 7 . Now Jephtah judged Israel six years: and Jephtah the Gileadites died, and was buried in the cities of Gilead. [That is, one of the cities of the land of Gilead. See the like phrase Genesis.19.20. 2 Chronicles.35.24. And below chapter.18.14. Nehemaih.6.2. Jon.1.5. Matthew.27.44. some conceive, that the chiefest city in Gilead might be thus called, because it might have been divided into sundry parts, each part having a perculiar name, as Jerusalem, Ramathaim, 1 samuel.1.1. And at this day many suchlike great cities are found]
\p
\v 8 . And after him Ebzoan of Bethlehem [See Genesis.35.19. There were two cities of that name; one in Judah, where our savior Jesus Christ was born; the other on the northern borders of Zebulon: see Josua.19.15. Which seemeth to be here meant, because the other is commonly called, Bethlehem Juda] judge Israel:
\p
\v 9 . And he had thirty sons: and he sent abroad thirty daughters and brought in from abroad thirty daughters for his sons: [i.e. he gave thirty daughters abroad in marriage, and took again thirty from abroad, to be wives for his sons] and he judged Israel seven years.
\p
\v 10 . Then Ebzan died, and was buried at Bethlehem.
\p
\v 11 . And after him Elon the Zebulonite Judged Israel: and he judged Israel ten years.
\p
\v 12 . And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried at Ajalon, in the land of Zebulon. [To distinguish it from another in the land of Dan, above chapter.1.35. It seemeth that there were more cities of this name in other tribes: see 1 Chronicles .6.69. & 8.13. 2 Chronicle.11.10. & 28.18.]
\p
\v 13 . And after him Abdon a son of Hillel the Pirhathonite, [From hence was also Benaia, one of Davids worthies, 2 Samuel.23.30. The city Pirhaton lay to westward of Samaria and Sichem, on a high mountain, called, the mountain of the Amalekite, or of the Amalekites] judged Israel.
\p
\v 14 . And he had fourty sons, and thirty sons sons, riding seventy ass-colts: [See above chapter.5. on v.10.4.] and he judged Israel eight years.
\p
\v 15 . Then Abdon, a son of Hillel the Pirhathonite, died: and he was buried at Pirhathon, in the land of Ephraim, upon the mountain of the Amalekite. [The upper land of the amalekites lay without the borders of Canaan, in the south-east, over against Egypt, by the Red-sea, at the wilderness of Havila; see 1 Samuel.15.7. and compare Exodus.17.8. But it seemeth from this place, that formerly a part also dwelt in Ephraim, or at least fought to settle there]
\c 13
\s God delivereth Israel up for their sins into the hand of the Philistines a long time, v.1. The angel appeareth unto Manoahs barren wife, telling her that she should bear a son, and how she should demean her self, and and they should deal with the child, 2. Manoah having understood this of his wife, prayeth and obtaineth, that the angel returneth, an dinstructeth them both concerning the child, 6. Manoah is desirous to provide food for the Angel, and inquireth after his name, 15. But the Angel ascendeth into heaven in the flame of the burnt- offering, which he requireth in stead of meat, 20. Whereby being much affrighted, is comforted by his wife, 22. Who beareth him Simson, 24. In whom the spirit of God beginneth towork, 25.
\p
\v 1 And the children of Israel proceeded to do that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD: therefore the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines fourty years.
\p
\v 2 . And there was a man of Zora, [Lying on the west-side of the mountain, which parteth Judah and Dan from each other; on the east-side did the tribe of Judah dwell: see Josua.15.33. and 19.40,41.] of the family of the Danite, [i.e. of the tribe of Dan] whose name was Manoah: and his wife was barren, and bare not.
\p
\v 3 . And an angel of the Lord [Understand here the son of god himself, as Judges.6.11. see below the annot. On v.16.] appeared unto the women: and he said unto her, behold now, art barren, and hast not born, but thou salt be with child, and bear a son.
\p
\v 4 . Therefore take heed unto thy self now, I pray thee, and drink no wine, nor strong drink: [See Numbers.6.3,4.] and eat no unclean thing. [See Leviticus, chapter.11.]
\p
\v 5 . For behold, thou salt be with child, and bear a son, upon whose head no razor shall come, [See Numbers.6.5.] for that male-child shall be a Nazarite of God, [i.e. set apart: see hereof Number.6. on v.2.] from the mothers womb, [the word Mother, is here and in the seventh verse inserted from Chapters16,17.] and he shall begin to deliver [but not wholly deliver, which afterward was done in the time of Samuel and David: see 1 Samuel.7.13,14. 2Samuel.8.1. & 21.15, etc. & 23.12.] Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.
\p
\v 6 . Then this woman came in, and spake unto her husband, saying, There came a man of God [So are the Prophets and Teachers of Gods people called, because they are called of God to a holy and Godly function, unto whom he (they being as it were his messengers) revealeth most familiarly his sacred will, to manifest and declare the same unto the people, and because they are instruments of his holy spirit: see Josua.14.6. 1 Samuel.2.27. 1 Kings v3.1. & 17.18,24. &2 Kings chapters.4,5,6,7,8. Ezra 3.2. Nehemaih 12.24,35. Also 1 Tim.6.11. 2 Tim.1.17. 2Peter.1.21.] unto me, whose face was as the face of the angel of the God, very dreadful: [i.e. honourable, reverend, or also terrible] and I asked him not whence he was, and he told me not his name.
\p
\v 7 . But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive and bear a son: therefore drink no wine, nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing, for that male-child shall be a Nazarite of God from the (mothers) womb, to the day of his death. [See Genesis.24. on verse 21.]
\p
\v 8 . Then Manoah prayed unto the LORD servently, and said, O LORD, let, I pray thee, the man of God whom thou didst send, come again unto us, and teach us, what we shall do to the male-child that shall be born.
\p
\v 9 . And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah: and the Angel of God came again unto the woman; now she sate in the field, but her husband Manoah was not with her.
\p
\v 10 . Therefore the woman made haste, and ran, and told it her husband: and she said unto him, Behold, that man hath appeared unto me, which came unto me on that day.
\p
\v 11 . Then Manoah arose, and went after his wife: and he came unto that man, and said unto him, Art thou that man that spakest unto this woman? And he said, I am he.
\p
\v 12 . Then said Manoah, now let thy words [Or, every one of thy words] come: [i.e. let all thy words come to pass, or be fulfilled] (but) what shall the male-childs manner, and his work be? [i.e. how shall we deal with him, and what shall we observe in his education or bringing up?]
\p
\v 13 . And the Angel of the Lord said unto Manoah, of all that I said unto the woman, she shall beware. [The Angel answereth indeed concerning the duty of the duty of the woman, but all this looked chiefly upon the state and office of the son, for which those commands were given to the Mother]
\p
\v 14 . She shall not eat of any thing that procedeth from the vine of wine; [ Which is edible, or may be eaten, as grapes, raisins, etc. see Numbers.6.3,4.] neither shall she drink wine nor strong drink wine nor strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: whatsoever I have commanded her, she shall observe.
\p
\v 15 . Then said Manoah unto the Angel of the Lord, let us (I pray thee) detain thee, and make ready a kid before thy face. [i.e. to set before thee. Compare above chapter.6.18,19.]
\p
\v 16 . But the Angel of the Lord said unto Manoah, If thou shalt detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; [i.e. meat, victuals] and if thou wilt make a burnt offering, that salt thou offer unto the LORD: [as if he should say, that kid should be either for food for me, or for a burnt-offering: Now I have no need of any meat, as being not a Man, but an Angel, yea, the son of God. If then thou offerest unto me a burnt-offering, that shalt thou offer up even to God himself; giving thereby to understanding, that he was very God. Compare the three following verses, and verses.22,23.] For Manoah knew not that it was an Angel of the LORD. [This is the reason why Manoah provided meat, and set it before him.]
\p
\v 17 . And Manoah said unto the Angel of the LORD, What is thy name? That when thy word shall come (to pass) we may honour thee. [Viz. with a present, in token of thankfulness. Compare 1 Kings 9.7,8. & 2 Kings 14. On v.3.]
\p
\v 18 . And the Angel of the LORD said unto him, why asketh thou thus after my name? Which is indeed wonderful. [Hebrew. Peli; i.e. wonderful, or, hidden. Compare Israel.9.5. Oth. And he was wonderful, viz, in his doing, as appeareth in the following verse]
\p
\v 19 . Then Manoah took a kid, and the meat-offering, and offered it upon the rock, [Compare Judge.6. on v.26.] unto the LORD: [according to the words of the Angel, verse.16.] and he [viz. this Angel] dealt wonderfully in (his) doing: and Manoah and his wife looked on.
\p
\v 20 . And it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from the Altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar: when Manoah and his wife saw that, they fell on their faces to the ground.
\p
\v 21 . And the Angel of the LORD appeared no more [Hebrew. Added no more, or proceeded no more to appear] unto Manoah and unto his wife: then Manoah acknowledged that it was an Angel of the LORD.
\p
\v 22 . And Manoah said unto his wife, we shall certainly die: [Hebrew. Dying die. Compare above, chapter.6.12. and the Annotat. There] because we have seen God.
\p
\v 23 . But his wife said unto him, If the LORD had a mind to kill us, he had not accepted the burnt-offering and meat-offering at our hand, nor shewed us all this, nor let us at this time hear (such) as this is. [Being no token of anger, but of special favour and grace]
\p
\v 24 . After that, this woman bare a son, and she called his name Simson: [Hebrew. Schim schon] and that child waxed great, and the LORD blessed it.
\p
\v 25 . And the spirit of the LORD began at times to drive him [i.e. secretly, and in an extraordinary or special manner, to put him on, and move him to be zealous in his calling, and to seek and catch at all opportunity to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines. The Hebrew word hath divers significations, as of going, footstep, once, or more times, turn, time, and is also taken for an anvit, whereon they strike one blow after another, or, by turns and successively. Whence cometh the signification of smiting, driving, driving on, as if so be a smith strook upon an Anvil. Compare the phrase used Matthew.4 1. Luke 4.1. Romans.8.14. 2 Peter.1.21.] In the camp of Dan, [Hebrew. Machane-Dan, why this place was so called, see below chapter.18.11,12. It may be that Simson had here some what to do with the Philistines] between Zora, [see above on verse.2.] and between Esthaol. [Esthaol lay farther off in the west, toward the sea, by the brook Serek: see below chapter.16.4,31.]
\c 14
\s Simson seeking opportunity to execute his office against the Philistines of Thimnath, v.1,2,4, etc. wherein his parents being not well contented, nevertheless gratifie him, 3. On the way he meets and tears a young Lion, 5. In whose carcase at his return be findeth boney, 8. Keepeth a marriage-feast, and propounded a Riddle to his adjoined Philistine-companions, with promise and condition of reward, or present, 10. The exposition whereof, his wife, by the instigation of the Philistines, extorteth from him, and discovereth, 15. Wherefore Simson slayeth thirty Philistines of Askelon, and payeth his companions the promised present, 19. His wife is given to another, 20.
\p
\v 1 And Simson went down to Thimnath: [lying in the west of Zora, not far from the mid-land sea] and having seen a woman at Thimnath, of the daughters of the Philistines;
\p
\v 2 . Then he went up, and told it his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman at Thimnath, of the daughters of the Philistines: now then, take her for me to wife. [See concerning the right of parents in the marriages of their children, Genesis.21. and 24. On v.3. and 26. On v.34.]
\p
\v 3 . But his father said unto him, together with his mother, is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, [i.e. Kindred, or countrymen: see Genesis.13. on v.8. and 24. On v.27.] And among all the people, that thou goest thy ways to take a woman of the Philistines, those uncircumcised (one)? [See Genesis.34.14. with these heathenish inhabitants of Canaan had God forbidden to make any league or marriage: see Exodus.34.12,16. And elsewhere. Wherefore they had cause to heed the revealed command of God, and to reprove Simson, for as much as they were ignorant of the secret providence and purpose of God, (see the following verse) who hath not onely right and power to impose laws upon his creatures, but even to do according to his own good pleasures, but even to do according to his own good pleasure, and to permit something contratry exaordinarily to be done. Compare Genesis.22.2. Exodus.3.22, etc.] Take the same for me, [see Genesis.19. on v.14.] for she is pleasing [Hebrew. Right] in mine eyes.
\p
\v 4 . Now his father and his mother knew not that this was of the LORD: [Who hereby intended to give Simson the occasion and opportunity to fulfil his calling and function] that he [viz. Simson: for though he was called to it of God, yet might he so seek to that which without it was good and right, that men could not justly blame him for it] sought occasion of the Philistines: [that they of their side might give occasion to begin against them] for the Philistines at that time had dominion over Israel. [See above chap.13.4.]
\p
\v 5 . So Simson went down with his father and his mother to Timnath [being now changed because they imagined and suspected by all that happened before his conception and birth that this must needs be of God and because Simson had covered unto them his purpose and the divine instigation ] when they came unto the vineyard of Thimnath behold there met him a young lion roaring [Heb. a young of lions roaring his meeting it seemeth that he was gone down some other way from his parents compare below verse 8.]
\p
\v 6 . Then was the spirit of the Lord ready upon him [or fell or came mightily upon him making him extraordinary courageous and strong to fit and qualify him by this proof or experiment for the execution of his office and calling and therein to confirm and strengthen him and also to administer matter unto him for riddle and that which followed thereupon ] that he rent [viz. the lion ] in twain as he should rent a kid in twain and there was nothing [ no instrument or weapon only using his hands ] in his hands but he told no of his father and his mother he had done.
\p
\v 7 . And he came down and he spake unto the woman [both himself and his parents] and she was pleasing in Simsons eyes [Heb. she was right in Simsons eyes.]
\p
\v 8 . After some days [Heb. from or after days see Genesis 4. On verse 3] came he again to take her [that is to marry her] then turned he aside [viz. from the common rod towards the place where he cast the slain and rent lion see on verse 5] to see the carcass of the lion and behold the swarm of bees was in the body was of the lion with honey.
\p
\v 9 . And he took the same [viz. the honey ] in his hands and went on going and eating and he went unto his father and unto his mother an gave them thereof and they did eat bathe told them not that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion.
\p
\v 10 . Now when his father was come unto that woman then Simson made there a wedding [the Hebrew word signifieth commonly a feast but here is to be understood a wedding feast] for so the young men used to do.
\p
\v 11 . And it came to pass when they [viz. the Philistines of the Thimnath who having observed some special things in Simson by his countenance and behavior got mistrust and therefore got under shew and color of honor by this adjoined company which they by the brides friend could perceive with a glance did exceeding hed him.]Saw him that they took [that is they took and brought see Genesis 12 on verse 15] thirty companions that should be with him.
\p
\v 12 . Then Simson said unto him now will I give you to advise of a riddle [that is a witty dark and strange saying or sentence under which something is hidden which the words do not declare but which pondering and considering upon it must be found out an then is clear and delightful Heb. as if he should say to riddle a riddle so below verse 13 and 16 Ezekiel 17.2 see further 1Kings 10 on verse 1] if ye shall well declare [Heb. declaring declare] unto me that in the seven days of this wedding and find out then will I give you thirty fine linen and a sheet shirt or somewhat else there made of to cover one of the night therewith or also to wear in the day the same word we find is used in the new testament in the Greek tongue Matthew 27.50 Mark 14.51,52 and 15.46 Luke 23.53] and thirty changeable suits of apparel made of the same fine linen compare below verse 19Heb. changes and alterations of the garment.]
\p
\v 13 . And if ye shall not be able to declare it unto me then shall ye give thirty fine linen garment and thirty changeable garments and they said unto him give thy riddle to advise of Ana let us hear it.
\p
\v 14 . And he said unto them meat[ or for the handsomeness of a riddle and to come nearer to the Hebrew tongue thus eating as we say bring eating that is the meat upon the table ] went forth from[or came forth from] the eater [from whom that used to give no meat from him to devour even all to wit the lion] and sweetness [viz. honey ] went forth from the strong[ or sweet came forth from the sour or sharp the Hebrew word signifieth not only strong but also hard cruel sharp &c. Sour as we say of very sour vineger that is very strong and a sour countenance is taken for a sourly cruel strong look or countenance] and they could not expound that riddle in three days.
\p
\v 15 . Afterwards it came to pass on the seventh day [after the first three days finding that they had profited nothing with their own wit and pains they seem from time to time to have minded the business more seriously and to have tied it faster together by Simsons wife until by their threat and his wife’s craft it happened according to their liking on the seventh day otherwise seven days understanding thereby a part of the seven days ] that they said unto Simson’s wife persuade thy husband [induce allure entice him with persuasive words and carriage such doth the Hebrew word signifieth ] to expound unto us that riddle lest peradventure they burn thee an they fathers house with fire have yet invited us to possess that which is ours? [Heb. to inherit after us or to possess hereditarily Us that is our good substance because besides the disgrace they should have the loss damage of linen and clothes] is it not so? [others or not?]
\p
\v 16 . And Simson’s wife wept before him and said thou doest but hate me [or at least thou hatest me] and doest not love me thou hast given not to the children of my people [viz. to Simsons Philistines companions so in the next verse] a riddle to guess at arid hast not told it me and he said unto her behold I have not told it my father nor my mother an should I tell it thee?
\p
\v 17 . And she wept before him on the seventh of the days [Heb. seven that is here on the seventh as 1Chronicles 5 and so elsewhere often ] wherein they had this wedding so it came to pass on the seventh day that he told her for she urged him and she told that riddle to the children of her people.
\p
\v 18 . Then said the men of the city unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down what is sweeter then honey? And what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them if ye have not ploughed with my heifer [ as if he should say if ye had not by means of a wife drawn from me the exposition Tis a Rhetorical phrase taken from the ploughing of husbandmen who by the service of the beast do by in a manner dig and cast up the ground that what ever was hidden therein may be discovered thus did Simson at once upbraid them wittily with his wife’s unfaithfulness and their deceit.]
\p
\v 19 . Then was the spirit of the Lord ready upon him[compare above on verse 6] and he went down unto the Askelonites [Heb. Askelon that is those of Askelon as above chapter 1 on verse 27 &c. lying on the borders of Dan beyond tehbrook of Zorek at the midland sea belonging to the tribe of Judah and Simeon but inhabitated by the Philistines see above chapter 1.18] and slew of them thirty men and he took their apparel [ which they had on and he had stripped them off and gave the change garments [so above verse 12] unto those that had expounded the riddle not withstanding his anger kindled and he went up unto his fathers house [leaving his wife for a time see the following chapter verse1] an his wife became his companions [Heb. became to his companions to wit a wife see chapter 15.16] who had accompanied him [see above on verse 11.]
\p
\v 20 No text on verse.
\c 15
\s Simson desireth to visit his wife but she is denied him vesre1 &c. therefore he setteth the Philistines corn on fire by foxes with fire brandstied to their tails 4 For which the Philistines burn simsons wife with her father 7 which act of theirs Simson again revengeth 8 the Philistines go forth to revenge themselves to Simson whom the men of Judah he being sent unto them deliver over 9 but he breaketh his bond and slayeth a thousand Philistines with the jaw bone of an ass 14 out of which being weary and thirsty he obtaineth of God by prayer a fountain drinketh and is revived 18.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after some days in the days of wheat harvest that Simson visited his wife[that is went to visit her] with a kid and he said let me go in [see Genesis 6 on verse 4 ] to my wife into the chamber but her father suffered him not to go in.
\p
\v 2 . For her father said I said surely [Heb. saying said that is aid unto my people or thought surely utterly see Genesis 20 on verse 11] that thou utterly hatest her [Heb. hating hated ] therefore igave her [see Genesis 38 on verse 14] to thy companion is not her least sister [that is youngest sister see Genesis 9 on verse 24 and 29.16] fairer [Heb. better] then she? Let her I pray thee tube to thee instead of her.
\p
\v 3 . Then said Simson concerning them [viz. concerning the Philistines when I do evil to them [intimating that he had just cause to hurt the Philistines compare above chapter 14.4 and below verse 11.]
\p
\v 4 . And Simson went his way and caught [either himself alone or also with the help and assistance of his friends] three hundred foxes [which were in multitude in those country as may be gathered from Nehem 4.3 Psalms 63.11 Cant 3.14 an dis appeareth especially from this place] and he took torches and turned tail to tails and put a torch in the midst between tails.
\p
\v 5 . And he kindled the torches with fire [Heb. the kindled fire in the torches] an letting them run into the standing corns of the Philistines and he sate as well the corn heaps [viz. the fruits that were cut down by the shearers brought together an heaped up in bundles] as standing corn on fire even on the very vine yard and olive trees.
\p
\v 6 . Then said the Philistines who had done this? And they said Simson the son in law of Thimnath because he [viz. the Thimnite father in law] took his wife [viz. Simsons wife] and her father with fire.
\p
\v 7 . Then said Simson should ye do this? Assuredly when I have revenged myself unto ye then I will afterwards cease [others although ye have done thus to wit when my wife was taken away from me yet will I be revenged on ye &c. as if he had said though ye have done that yet nevertheless I will not cease until I shall full have revenged myself in all this Simson is not to be looked upon as a private person but as a judge and deliverer of Israel being called thereunto by God in an extraordinary manner.]
\p
\v 8 . And he smote them sank and hip [Heb. upon near at by the hip or thigh it seemeth to have been proverb signifying the breaking of the mans body strengthen power compare Deuteronomy 28.31 otherwise he smote them with the shank upon the thigh that is he brake their limbs] with a great blow and he went down [Viz. from his fathers habitation towards the south ] and dwealt on the top of a rock [or a steep sticking out place] of Etam [a city lying by the south end of the mountain of Judah upon a very high and firm rock near unto which ran the brook Etham on the borders of Judah and simeon over against in the land of Simeon lay another Ethan on the west side of the mountain of Judah as the maps do shew 1Chronicles 4.32 Etham is reckoned to the tribe of simeon yet Simeon’s inheritance was part among the tribe of Judah Joshua 19.1.]
\p
\v 9 . Then the Philistines went up and camped themselves against Judah and spread forth themselves in Lechi [called afterwards so by simson below verse 17 lying in the tribe of Dan.]
\p
\v 10 . And the men of Judah said why are ye come up against us? And they said we are come up to bind Simson to do to him according as he hath done unto us.
\p
\v 11 . Then came three thousand men down from Judah to the cave often rock of Etam and said unto Simson knewest thou not to the Philistines have dominion over us? Wherefore then hast thou done this to us ? And he said unto them according as they have done unto me so have I done to them.
\p
\v 12 . And they said unto him we are come down to bind thee to deliver thee over into the hand of the Philistines then said Simson unto them swear unto me that ye will not fall upon me [viz. to kill me as this phrase is often taken in the holy scripture and the following verse explaineth.]
\p
\v 13 . And they spake unto him saying no but we will bind thee well [Heb. binding bind] and deliver thee over into their hand but we will in no wise kill thee [Heb. killing we will not kill thee] and they bound him with two new cords an drought him up from the rock [northwards towards Lechi where the philistines were encamped verse 9.]
\p
\v 14 . when he came to lechi when the Philistines shouted [for joy thinking they had now their enemy in their own hands ] to meet him but the spirit of the Lord was ready upon him an dteh cords that were on his arms became as linen threads that are burnt of the fire[he brake them as easily and quickly as if they had been finged threads or as flax is burnt with fire ] and his bonds melted off from his hands [they were so easily and quickly loosened as wax melted by the fire.]
\p
\v 15 . And he found a moist [that is yet new fresh and firm not withered or dried the word is also taken from the pulrunent moisture Isaiah 1.6] jaw bone of an ass and he stretched forth his hands and tookit and slew therewithal thousand man.
\p
\v 16 . Then said Simson with the Jawbone of an ass one heap two heaps [it seemeth that he had being assaulted and oppressed on both sides made two heaps of slain man] with the jaw bone of a n ass have I slain a thousand men.
\p
\v 17 . And it came to pass when he had made an end to speaking that he cast the jaw bone out of his hands an he called the same place ramath-Lechi [that is the height of the jaw bone others the casting away of the jaw bone this place is also called lechi only without any addition to it see above verse 9.]
\p
\v 18 . Now when he was sore a thirst then he called on the Lord and said thou hast given this great salvation by the hand of thy servant should I then now die for thirst and fall into the hand of these uncircumsised ones ? [Hereby Simson declareth his faith and putteth God in mind of his gracious covenant see Hebrews 11.32 and compare Genesis 34.14 1Samuel 17.26,36 2Samuel 1.20.]
\p
\v 19 . Then God clave the hollow place the Hebrew word coming from beating stamping should properly signify a mortar and so forth hallowness or hollow place which in regard thereof may be compared to a deep and hallow mortar see the same Hebrew word proverbs 27.22 Zeph 1.11 some understand here a great back tooth of the ass jaw and the hollowness thereof but the Hebrew word is nowhere else found in this signification ] which is in Lechi and is there issued forth water out of it and he drank then his spirit came again [which by reason often thirst seemeth to gone from him for as much as he had fear to faint or die of thirst ] and he became alive[that is revived leaped lustly nimbled ]therefore he [to wit Simson in token of thankfulness to God and in memorial of victory given to Israel called the name thereof[viz. the name of the fountain ] the fountain of him that called upon [Heb. En-hakkore ] which is in Lechi unto this day.
\p
\v 20 . And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years [that is he executed the Lords vengeance for Israel against the Philistines see concerning the use of this word in these histories above chapter 2 on verse 16.]
\c 16
\s Simson being hemmed in at Gaza,riseth up by night ,and taketh the city gate ,with their bars,on his shoulders ,and carrieth them up to a mountain ,verse.1&c.He falleth in love with Delila ,who by the instigation of the Philistine Pricencess vexed him so long that at last he tells her plainly wherein his strength lay 4 so he betrayed and taken captive by the Philistines who put out his eyes and cast him into prison 19 his hair being grown again when the Philistine were gathered together to make sport of him to the honor of their idols he avengeth himself on them by throwing down the whole house so dieth an dis buried 22.
\p
\v 1 Now Simson went his way [viz. after the slaughter of the Philistine described in the former chapter] unto Gaza [one of the chiefest citis of te philistines lying at the midland sea in the land of Simeon] and eh saw there a woman which was an harlot [Heb. a woman an harlot otherwise an hostess] and he went unto her [see gensis 6 on verse 4 some understand here by this phrase used that he took up his lodging at her house.]
\p
\v 2 . Then it was told to the Gazites [heb. to the Gazite saying which abrupt sentence is thus supplied then it was told to the Gazite by saying or they made it known to the Gazite saying this is implieth according to the meaning of some that they had straightway notice given them of Simsons coming that by no means they might lose this opportunity] Simson is come in hither so they went round about [the one telling the other that they were to be all up with one according and to eye Simson well that he might by no means escape away ]and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city yet they kept them selves quiet all night [Heb. they were silent that is they kept themselves quiet and did nothing see below chapter 18 on verse 19 and 1Kings 22 on verse 3] saying until the morning light [understand hereupon let us be quiet until it grow light] then we will kill him.
\p
\v 3 . But Simson lay till night but he arose at midnight and he laid hold of the doors of the city gates which both the posts and took them away with the bar beam an laid them upon his shoulders and carried them up to the top[Heb. to the head] of the mountain which is in sight of Hebron [this was a high mountain laying eastwards before Gaza upon the top whereof as from the text may be gathered they looked at Hebron which also lay upon an high mountain by the western borders of Judah herewith do the maps also agree some conceive that he carried them to the top of the mountain of Judah which is close to Hebron.]
\p
\v 4 . And it came to pass afterwards and he loved a woman at the brook of Sorek [which runned by the valley of Escol or the valley of grapes whereof see Deuteronomy 1 on verse 24 out of the mnountain of Judah into the midland sea and parting the tribes of Dan and Simeon from each other according to the opinion of others Escol and Sorek should be named of one and the same brook but Numbers 13.25 it is said that the place not brook was called by the Israelites Nathal Escol ]whose name was Delilah.
\p
\v 5 . Then came up the princes of the Philistines [see above chapter 3 on verse3] unto her and said unto her persuade him [see above chapter 14 on verse 15] and see wherein his great strength is and whereby we might over power him and bind him to plague him [or to humble him so verse 6] then will we give thee everyone of us a thousand and hundred silverlings [see Genesis 20 on verse 16.]
\p
\v 6 . Then said Delilah unto Simson tell me I pray thee wherein thy great strength is and wherewith thou mightiest be bound that one might plague thee.
\p
\v 7 . And Simson said unto her if they should bind me with seven fresh cords [otherwise fresh or sound green osier rods or wits bonds osier bond willow bonds] which are not dried then should I wax weak an dbe as another man [or as one of the man as only man so verse 11.]
\p
\v 8 . Then the prince so the Philistines brought up to her [Heb. cause to come up to her that is they brought or furnished caused to be brought to her] seven fresh cords which were not dried and there bound him therewith.
\p
\v 9 . Now the leers in wait [that is the Philistines that are watched and heeded in matter] sat by her in a chamber then she said unto him the philistines are upon thee Simson [that si there be Philistines that is set upon thee] then brake he the cords even as a thread of course flax [or towe] is broken when it smelleth the fire[that is cometh near the fire and feeleth perceiveth the fire as we used to say compare Psalms 58 on verse 10] so his strength was not known.
\p
\v 10 . Then said Delilah unto Simson behold thou hast mocked me and spoken lies unto me tell me now I pray thee wherewith thou mayst be bound.
\p
\v 11 . And he said unto her if they should bind me first [Heb. binding bind] with new cords wherewith no work no work hath been done they should I become weak and be as another man.
\p
\v 12 . Then Delilah took new cords and bound them therewith an said unto him the Philistines are upon thee Simson now the liers in wait were sitting in chamber then he brake them [viz. thich ropes or cords ]off from his arms as a thread.
\p
\v 13 . and Delilah said unto Simson hither to thou hast mocked me tell me now I pray thee wherewith thou mayst be bound and he said unto her if thous houldst twist thee seven hair locks of mine head [that is all the hair of mine head being as it where divided into so many locks compare below verse 19,22] at weaver beam [others web which is waved about the weaver looms understand hereupon as in the former then I should become weak and be as another man.]
\p
\v 14 . And she fastened them with a pin [understand after she had done according to his saying with the twisted hair locks she then besides for the greater care fastened them with a pin of the weavers beam others understand that she nailed the weavers beam fast that simson might not be able to remove it out of its place or loosen it ]and said unto him the Philistines are upon the Simson then awake up out of his sleep and took away [or went away with the nail and with the weaver loom shewing his former strength that this was not the means to entrap and compel him] the pin of the twisted hair locks [that is the pin or herewith Delilah that fastened the twisted hairlocks Heb. Of the twisting] and the weavers loom.
\p
\v 15 . Then she said unto him how wilt thou say I love thee whereas thy heart is not with me? Thou hast now thrice mocked me and not told me wherewith thy great strength is.
\p
\v 16 . And it came to pass when she daily pressed him with words and was troublesome to him that his soul was grieved [Heb. was shortened as the fruits that are mowed and cut down the meaning is that all his mind and courage perished vanished away yea as we use also to say this breath grew short an his spirit also fainted through anguish whereby he suffered himself at length to be overcome by Delilah a very remarkable and pitiful frailty and inconsiderateness in so excellent and transcendent a companion of God as Simson was compared Job 21 on verse 4] even unto death.
\p
\v 17 . then he told her all his heart and said unto her there never came razor on mine head for I am Nazarite of God [see above chapter 13 on verse 5] from my mothers womb if I should be shorten should my strength depart from me [not that this strength lay in the hair was the breaking of the vow of Nazaritaship see Numbers 6.5 an above chapter 13.5 whereunto he was engaged by Gods command who endowed him by his spirit with his extraordinary strength as long as he kept his Nazariteship but deprived him thereof when he became guilty of the breach thereof ]and I should become weak and be as weak as all man.
\p
\v 18 . When Delilah now saw that he had told him with all his heart then she sent her ways an called[ Heb. caused to call sent for commanded to tell ] the princes of the Philistines saying come up this once for he hath told me all his heart and the princes of the Philistines came up to her and brought that money [or silverlings see above verse 5] in their hand.
\p
\v 19 . then she caused him to sleep upon her knees and called [that is caused to call sent for] a man and made him cut off the seven hair locks of his head and she began to plague him [that is to jog him or otherwise to push or stir prick &c. to awaken and to give him notice as before of the Philistines coming that there might see whether he might be taken captive and compelled yea or no] and his strength departed from him.
\p
\v 20 . And he said the Philistines are not upon thee Simson and he awaked out of his sleep and said I will go out this time as at other times [Heb. as time in or at time that is as before more than once ]and shake myself out[as one that is shorn or rouzeth up himself and gathereth up his strength unto any work or business otherwise I will shake myself out of their hands as if he should say I will easily reed of myself out of their hands ] for he new not that the Lord was departed from him [understand so far an din regard thereof that he had withdrawn from him that former strength .]
\p
\v 21 . Then the Philistines laid hold on him and digged out his eyes [ that he might not be able to hurt them anymore yet suffering him to life for a spectacle and shew unto their idol dragon see verse 23] an they carried him down unto Gaza and bound him with two copper chains and he was grinding in the prison house [Heb. the house of those that were bound.]
\p
\v 22 . And the hair of the head began again to grow [and Simson by sincere repentance to come again to his former state of Nazariteship and to receive of God the former strength He. To wax green to shoot forth even as grass and herbs] as when he was shorn [ or as him that was shorn or according as it was shorn off that is the hair began to grow again as long as it was at the time when he was shorn by Delilah’s deceit others after he was shorn.]
\p
\v 23 .Then the Princes of the Philistines gathered themselves together ,to offer up a great offering unto their god Dagon,[The idol of the Philistines ,so called ,because of respect of his lowermost part he was like a Fish,(now the Philistines dwelt by sea )and the uppermost had the form of a man :see 1Samuel.5verse2,3,4,5so other heathens have had theirs idols as Neptune Triton Leucothea &c. some conceive that this idol was so called from the Hebrew word dragon that is corn because they held him to be the god of husbandry or tillage of such kind of idolatry see Romans 1.23,25 and for merriments and they said our God hath delivered Simson our enemy into our hands .
\p
\v 24 . Likewise when the people saw him they praised their god for they said our god hath delivered our enemy into our hand and him that wasted our land and who made many of ourslains ones [that is who at time hath slain multitude of Philistines.]
\p
\v 25 . And it came to pass when their heart was merry [Heb. good that is merry cheerful rejoiced so below chapter 18.20 and 19.6 Ruth 3.7 2Samuel 13.28] that they call Simson that he may play [or laugh procure laughter that we may take our pleasure and delight sport and trifle time away by it as King Belsazar did with the gold and silver vessels of the temple Daniel 5 to the phrase and glory of the idols an dishonor of God ] and they called Simson out of Prisons house and he played [others that he might play] before their faces and they made him stand between the pillars.
\p
\v 26 . Then said Simson unto the lad that held him by hand let me go [or set lead me] that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house is founded that I may lean upon them [as if he had been wearied with laboring at the mill in prison an with making such haste to come to this place.]
\p
\v 27 . Now the house was full of men and women also the princes of the Philistines were there and upon the roof [which was flat and according to the manner and custom of some countries see Deuteronomy 22 on verse 8] where about three thousand men and women which looked on when Samson played.
\p
\v 28 . Then Simson called unto the Lord and said Lord, LORD remember me I pray thee and strengthen me I pray thee only this once O God that I may revenge avenge myself on the Philistines for my two eyes [this he prayed out of faith and he was heard of God who gave him that by the putting out of his eyes by the Philistines was made unfit as they conceive to execute his calling this occasion this design and extraordinary strength breathed into him this prayer and gave him in his death as well in his life wonderful victory to the praise of his holy name defiance of idols and shaming of his enemies see verse 30.]
\p
\v 29 . And Simson caught hold of the two middle most pillars [He. Pillars of the middle] whereupon the house was founded and whereupon it leaned [otherwise he viz. Simson leaned upon or stayed himself against it] of the one of his right hand an don the other with his left hand.
\p
\v 30 . And Simson said let my soul die [which is here as much as let myself my person die see Genesis 12 on verse 5 & 9 on verse 5] with the Philistines and he bowed himself with might [or stretched out himself thrusting away the pillars from him an bowing them in] an the house fell upon the princes and upon all the people that was in it and often dead which he slew in his dying were more than those that he had slain in his life.
\p
\v 31 . Then came down all his brethren and all his fathers house took him up and brought him upward and buried him between Zora [see above chapter13 on verse 2] and between Eschaol [see above chapter 13 on verse 25] in the Sepulchre of his father Manoah now he had judged Israel twenty years [as above chapter 15.20 this conclusion here repeated intimeth that this last act of Simson appataineth as well to this judge-office as the other foregoing as he also especially in the death is held to be a type and figure of our Lord Jesus Christ who conquered all his and our enemies chiefly by his death.]
\c 17
\s Micha’s moter causeth the idolatrous images to me made of money which her son Micha had stolen from her and restored back Verse 1 &c. for which Micha prepareth an idols house with an Ephod and household gods and maketh one of his sons a priest 5 how the case stood at Israel at that time 6 afterwards Micha getteth a Levite that travelled through country whom for a certain salary or wage he entertaineth to be priest in his sons stead 7 thinking that God therefore must needs favor and bless him 13.
\p
\v 1 And there was a man of the mountain of Ephraim whose name was Micha [when the things mentioned in this and the following chapters of this book were there be divers opinion concerning it the nearest seemeth to be that least the order of the history of the judged should be broke they are hither to pur off and after adjoined the present lively before out eyes the much decayed estate of Israel and the justice of Gods punishment but were not done after Simsons death but shortly after the death of Joshua and of the pious eldest within that time which is described above chapter 2.10,11,12,13, and chapter 3.5,6,7,8 the attentive reader may compare Joshua 9.47 with above chapter 13.25 and below chapter 18.1,7,12,27,29 item below chapter 19.11 with above chapter 1.8 also consider chapter 20.28 where mention is made of the priest Pineas Aarons grandchild living at that time of whom we read Numbers 25.7 &c. and Joshua 22.13,3.]
\p
\v 2 . The same said unto his mother the thousand and hundred silverlings [see genesis 20 on verse 16] which more were taken from thee for which thou cursedst [viz. thereof that had taken them from thee] and also speaketh before mine enemies [so that I myself heardteh curse he seemeth hereby to be moved to confession and restitution ] behold that money[or silverlings] with me have taken it then said his mother blessed beamy son to the Lord [as if she should say far beit from me my son that I should wish that curse to come upon thee in regard of thee I do utterly revoke it.]
\p
\v 3 . So he gave his mother the thousand and hundred silverlings but his mother said I have wholly dedicated that money to the LORD[ Heb. Dedicated have dedicated unto the Lord this was the cloak of idolatry that they would thrust the same upon God as if it were done to his service against so many express command of the Lord as the book of Moses and the ten commandments themselves testify] from my hand for my son [that is sons son see verse 5] to make a carved image and a molten image [it seemeth that she meant two images one carved and one molten as may be seen chapter 18.17,18 although there in verse 20,30,31 there is only mention made of one likewise here verse 4 its said in singular numbers that viz. image was in the house of Micah which the attentive reader may observe ] now therefore will I restore to it again.
\p
\v 4 . But he restored that money unto his mother and his mother took two hundred silverlings and gave them to the goldsmith who made thereof a carved image and a molten image [it is understood that it was first graven or carved in marble or some other staff afterwards laid in or covered over with silver plates far of so small a sum no pure silver image could be made which should be of that bigness that it should be first used in this idols house and afterwards used as a common image in the image often city of Dan.] that was in the house of Micah.
\p
\v 5 . And the man Micah had an house of gods he made [viz. often remaining sum of money]an Ephod [see Exodus 28 on verse 4] and Teraphim [see Genesis 31 on verse 19] and filled the hand [see Leviticus 7 on verse 27 so below verse 12] of one of his son that he might be a priest unto him [he did all this against the expess command of God for God had commanded but one Ephod to be made Viz. for eh high priest in Israel who was to ask counsel of God by Urim and Thummim Numbers 27.21 images in the presence of God were severely forbidden and none might be priest but he was one of the Aarons race see Numbers 16.40 an d18.2,7 &c.]
\p
\v 6 . In those days there was no king in Israel [that is no governors rulers judges or supreme magistrate who kept the people in discipline and order otherwise it might seem as if formerly they had been kings in Israel but now not so is the word king also commonly taken for ruler Genesis 36.31 Deuteronomy 33.5] everyone did that which was righteous in his eyes [this is here and in the following chapter more than once rehearsed as a reason of this gross looseness and lincentiousness that everyone did not that which was right and good in the eyes of God but in his own eyes that is what seemed good unto himself and that he had a mind to from hence also may be gathered that these histories may appertain to a time wherein no judge or lawful magistrate or supreme power was in Israel.]
\p
\v 7 . Now there was a young man [ of the Hebrew word see Genesis on verse 5] of Bethlehem Judah of the tribe of Judah [these words are by most understood ofBethlehem Judah so that they are here added by the holy ghost to express more clearly that this Bethlehem to distinguish or difference it from other which belonged to Zebulon Joshua 19.15 without appertaining to the family and tribe of Judah and that because this should be one of the birth place of Messiah our Lord Jesus Christ some apply them to the Levites who was indeed of the tribe of Judah levi but born and bred up at Bethlehem or by mothers side of the tribe of Judah or also as some conceive in truth of the tribe of Judah but not withstanding to the corruption and depravedness of those times made there at Levite and so used as Jeroboam likewise likewise did 1Kings 12.31 2Chronicles 11.14,15 but this seemeth not to agree well verse 13 for Micha would as well been contended with his own son who was of Ephraim as with his man if he had been of Judah not of Levi]this was a Levite and conversed there as a stranger.
\p
\v 8 . And this man was gone out of that city out of Bethlehem Judah to converse where he should find opportunity now when he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micha to go [ Heb. to do] his journey [otherwise doing his journey.]
\p
\v 9 . Micah said unto him from whence comest thou? and he said unto him I am a Levte f Bethlehen Judah and I walk to converse where I shall find opportunity.
\p
\v 10 . Then said Micah unto him tarry with me and be unto me a father [he giveth this title which of right belongeth to the true prophets and sincere teachers of the church of God in respect of their spiritual right fatherly benefits and offices done to the people of God as children unjustly and wrongfully to this idolatrous parasite see 2King 6.21 and 8.9 and 13.14 Isaiah 22.21 1Corinthians 4.14,15 1Thessalonians 2.11] and a priest and a I will give thee yearly [Heb. In days that is in a year of days that is a whole or full year see above chapter 11 on verse 40] ten silverlings and order of garments [that is will furnish thee as many clothes as thou according to thy condition salt have need of others a suit or two suits of apparel also the worth of apparel] and thy victual so the Levite went with him [viz. with Micha to his house.]
\p
\v 11 . And the Levite consented to tarry with that man was unto him as of his sons [that is he loved and esteemed him as if he had been one of his sons.]
\p
\v 12 . And Micha filled the hand of the Levite [as above verse 5] that he became a priest unto so he was in the house of Micha.
\p
\v 13 . then said Micha now I know that the Lord will do well unto me because I have this Levite for a priest [although he many ways as is mentioned above committed idolatry yet he persuade himself that he is idolatry must needs please God a clear glass of abominable corruption at that time.]
\c 18
\s Those of the tribe of Dan having not sufficient inheritance send forth five men to spy out a place verse 1 these in their travelling come to the house of Micha and desire the Levite to ask counsel of God touching their journey 2 having received the answer they spy out the city Lais and make report thereof unto their brethren whom they instigate to set upon the city7 whereupon six hundred armed Danites march forth and by the way cease upon Micha’s priest and idols 11 Micha in vain demandeth again 22 they pull down build up again and inhabit Lais and call it Dan 27 consencrate a priest and set up idolatry with the images of Micha,30.
\p
\v 1 In those days there was king in Israel [see chapter 17 on verse 6 this was the cause that those of the tribe of Dan where fain to shift for themselves whereas the tribe formerly assisted one another to provide for everyone a convenient and sufficient inheritance according to the command of Moseh Numbers 32.21,22 &c. Joshua 22.2,3 and above chapter 1.3] and in the same days did the tribe of Dan seek for themselves an inheritance to dwell in fro unto that day there was not sufficient fallen to them for inheritance among the tribes of Israel [viz. neither by lot in the life time of Joshua nor afterwards by order of supreme authority or assistance of other tribes their inheritance indeed was fallen to them under Joshua but it was too little see Joshua 19.47 where is here related in brief what is more largely described.]
\p
\v 2 . So the children of Dan sent five out of the their family out of their cities [others from other uttermost that is both of high and low estate degree] men that were warlike from Zoar and from Esthaol [see above chapter 13 on verse 2, 25] to spy out the land and search it and they said unto them go and search the land and thecae unto mount Ephraim to the house of Micah [see chapter 17. 1&c.] and overnighter there.
\p
\v 3 . Being near the house of Micah they knew the voice of the young man the Levite [see above chapter 17.7 &c. it may be that they being lodged in some inn or tarven hard by as commonly inns tarvens and Alehouses were wont to be seated near such idol houses because of the concourse of people desirous of news and superstitiously given heard him sing or speak not as an Ephraimite but as a Jew in gods house of Micha ] and they turned in this the [ viz. into the house of Micha]and said unto him who hath brought the thee thither and what makest thou here and what hast thou here ?
\p
\v 4 . And he said unto them thus and thus Micha done to me and he had hired me and I am a priest unto him.
\p
\v 5 . Then said they unto him ask counsel we pray thee of God [ so they call the idolatry of false Ephod and of the images whereof the Levite had told and was well remembered of them see below verse 14 and above chapter 17 on verse 5] that we may know whether our way whereon we walk shall be prosperous.
\p
\v 6 . And the Priest said unto them [viz. after that he had according to his manner he asked counsel of the idols ] go in peace your way which ye shall go is before the Lord [as if ye had said these eyes of the Lord as the holy scripture also speaketh are open upon your design and this your journey to direct and prosper the same the Lord taketh care of it thus the bodily and presumptously abused the name of the Lord in his idolatrous practice .]
\p
\v 7 . Then those five men went their ways, and came unto Lais: [See below v.28.] and they saw the people which was in the midst thereof, lying in security, [Or, dwelling in security. Understand, that the city of Lais lay in a very safe secure place, out of all danger of any in rode or invasion, according to their own and the common opinion. Others applying this unto the inhabitants, whereof is spoken in the following words] after the manner of the Zidonians, being quiet and secure, [Hebrew. Confident; i.e. being secure and careless] and was no Lord of inheritance, [oth. no man that offered (them) any Ignominy or disgrace, (also none) that possessed the Government hereditarily. Some apply this unto the people, that they had a Republic or Commonwealth free from inheritance. Hebrew, Possessing hereditarily the government, or, the highest command or constraints. It seemeth that they took some times one, sometimes another to be their ruler or Governor, who would not displease the Subjects, but let them have their wills in all things. Or perhaps they might have lived without any magistrate or Ruler at all] that put (any man) to shame for any thing in that land: [i.e. that durst put shame and disgrace upon man or any offence committed, so that every one did what he listed; their sins in that respect being ripe for judgment] they were also far from the Zidonians, [so that they would not come to help them, as lying too far westward on the sea] and had no business with no man. [Hebrew. They had no word, thing, or, nothing with one man; i.e. neither league, nor commerce, nor converse with any man, but lived for themselves in all security and voluptuousness]
\p
\v 8 . And they came unto their brethren at Zora, and at Esthaol, and their brethren said unto them, What (say) ye?
\p
\v 9 . And they said, Arise, and let us go up to them, for we have seen that land, and behold, it is very good: should ye then be still? [without saying or doing anything, or taking any thing in hand? Hebrew. Be silent. See of the use of such words, above chapter.16.2. Exodus.14.14. 1 King. 22.3. Psalm.28.1. with the Annot. There] be not slothful to go, that ye may come in thither, to take the land in hereditary possession.
\p
\v 10 . (When ye come thither, then ye shall come to a careless people, and that land is large in compass) [Hebrew. Wide in hands, or sides: see this phrase Genesis.34. on v.21.] for God had given it unto your hand: a place, where there is no want of any thing that is on the earth.
\p
\v 11 . Then there journey from thence out of the family of the Danites, from Zora and from Esthoal, six hundred men, girt about with weapons of war.
\p
\v 12 . And they went up, and camped themselves by Kiriath-Jearim, [Otherwise called Kiriath-Baal: see Joshua. 5.60. lying upon a mountain at the uttermost borders of Judah and Dan, toward the north] in Judah: therefore they called this place Machane-Dan [i.e. the camp of Dan: see above chapter.13.25.] unto this day. Behold, it is behind Kiriath-jearim.
\p
\v 13 . And from thence they passed thorough unto the mountain of Ephraim, and they come unto the house of Micah. [See above chapter.17.1.]
\p
\v 14 . Then answered [i.e. they spake, began to spake, began to speak: so is the same word also elsewhere used; see 1 Samuel.14. v.29. 1 Kings 1.28. & 13.7. 2 Chronicles. 29.31. Ezra 10.2. Isa.14.10. and in the New Testament, Matthew.11.25. & 17.4. & 22.1. & 28.5. Acts 5 8. & 10.47. & 15.13. Rev.7.13.] the five men, [see above v.2, etc.] that were gone to spy out the land of Lais, and said unto their brethren, Do ye also know, that there is in those houses [i.e. in one of those houses: see above cha.11 on v.7.] an Ephod, [as above chapter.17.5.] and Teraphim, [as above chapter.17.5.] and a carved and a molten image: [see above chapter, 17. On v.3.] Now therefore know what ye have to do. [i.e. advise wether it be not good to take all these along with us, to use them in the place where we shall come, as in our former journey we asked counsel by them of God: see above v.5.]
\p
\v 15 . Then [viz. after they had concluded to take away all these instruments of Idolatry] turned they thither, and came to the house of the young man [ of whom chapter 17.7.] the Levite, to the house of Micah: and they asked him [viz. when he was called forth, or by the five men was brought to the gate] concerning peace. [i.e. touching his welfare, how he did, wether he was yet in good health, etc. See Genesis.37. on verse. 14. And Exodus.18.7.]
\p
\v 16 . And the six hundred men, which were of the children of Dan, girt about with their weapons of war, tarried at the door of the gate.
\p
\v 17 . But the five men that were gone to spy out the land; went up, came in thither, took away the carved image, [Or this carved, and the other molten image, see chapter.17. on v.3.] and the Ephod, and the Teraphim, and the molten image, now the Priest tarried at the door of the gate, with the six hundred men that were girt about with weapons of war.
\p
\v 18 . Now then they [viz. the five men] were entered into the house of Micha, and had taken away the carved image, the Ephod, and the Teraphim, and the molten image: then the Priest said unto them, What do ye?
\p
\v 19 . And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thy hand upon thy mouth. [That is (as we use to say) Hold thy mouth close, restrain it, do not gainsay, make no noise. See this phrase Job 21.5. & 29.9. & 39.37 Proverb.30.32. Micha.7.16.] and go with us, and be to us a father, and a priest: is it better that thou be a priest for the house of one man, or that thou be priest for a tribe, and a family in Israel? [intimating, that he should greatly better his condition, and have cause to rejoice in it]
\p
\v 20 . Then the heart of the priest waxed glad, [ A clear sign and demonstration of a parasite, that was all for the belly, and did all for gain and worldly honor; Hebrew. Good, as above chapter.16,25.] and he took the Ephod, and the Teraphim, and the carved image, and he came into the midst of the people.
\p
\v 21 . So they turned themselves, and went on: and they put the children, and the cattie, and the baggage [Or, carriage; or, also their precious commodities, as their treasure, gold, silver, jewels, etc.] before them. [that they might be out of danger and gun-shot (as we say) and not be in their way, if any one should fall upon their rear, to fetch back that which was stolen and plundered.]
\p
\v 22 . Now when they were gone a good way off from Micah’s house, then were gathered together the men that were in the houses which were near Micah’s house, [i.e. which dwelt near and about him, the whole neighborhood were meet also together] and ever took the children of Dan.
\p
\v 23 . And they called after the children of Dan; who turned their faces about, and said unto Micha, What aileth thee, that ye are assembled together?
\p
\v 24 . Then said he, ye have taken away my Gods, which I had made, together with the Priest, and are gone away: What have I now more? [Intimting, as a blinded idolater, that they had berest him of that which was most near and dear unto him] what is it then that ye say to me, what ailest thou?
\p
\v 25 . But the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, left perhaps men of bitter mind [Hebrew. Bitter of soul; i.e. whose mind or stomach is embittered, or bitterly incensed against thee: so 2 Samuel.17.8. Sometimes this phrase signifieth grieved in spirit, as 1 Samuel.1.10. Proverb.31.5, etc.] fall upon thee, and thou lose thy life, and the life of thy house. [Hebrew. Gather thy soul, and the soul of thy house; i.e. and thy household perish, or die. Compare Psalms.26. on v.9.]
\p
\v 26 . So the children of Dan went their way: and Micha perceiving that they were stronger then he, turned himself about, and came back to his house.
\p
\v 27 . Then they [viz. the Danites] took that which Micha had made, and the Priest whom he had, and came to Lais, to a quiet [Hebrew. Resting, or, being quiet and confident; as above v.7.] and secure people, and smote them with the edge of thje sword: [Hebrew. The mouth of the sword] and they burnt the city with fire.
\p
\v 28 . And there was no man that delivered it: for it [viz. the city of Lais] was far from Zidon, [lying aside from Zidon eastward, close by mount Libanon, where the two fountains, Jor and Dan, running into one, make the Jordan. See further Genesis.14. on v.14. Josua.19. on v.47.] and they [to wit, the inhabitants: see verse.7.] had no dealing with any man; and it [viz. the city] (lay) in the valley, which is by Beth-rechob: [Compare 2 Samuel.10 6,8.] afterward they [that is the Danites ] rebuilt the city and dwealt therein.
\p
\v 29 . And they called the name of the city Dan after the name of the Dan their father who was born in Israel [that is Jacob see Genesis 30.6.] how be it the name of his city was formerly Lais.
\p
\v 30 . And the children of Dan set up before that carved image [see above verse 14,17 and chapter 17.3] and Jonathan [of whom above chapter 16.7 &c.] the son of Gesom the son of Mannaseh he and his sons were priests for the tribe of Danites until that the land [that is the inhabitants of the land ] was carried away captive [which as may be gathered from the following verse came to pass at the time when the Philistines smote Israel with a very great slaughter and carried away the ark of the Lord 1Samuel 4 verse 10,11,17 such great discomfitures were wont to be accompanied with a transportation or carrying away of many captives.]
\p
\v 31 . So they set up among them the carved images of Micha which he had made all the days that the house of God was Silo [whither the house of God was brought in the time of Joshua, Joshua 18.1 the ark being carried away by the Philistines and sent back was brought to Kiriath Jearim 1Samuel 7.1,2 and all idols removed buy Samuel 1Samuel 7.3 ,4 amongst which without doubt was also this idol of Micha and of the Danites afterwards the ark was brought into Jerusalem by David 2Samuel 6.16,17.]
\c 19
\s A Levite travelled from mount Ephraim to Bethlehem to fetch back his concubines that was gone from him verse 1 &c. is kindly entertained by her father and detained until the fifth day 3 Then he departed and came to Gibea of Benjamin 10 where he at length was lodged by an old man that was of mount Ephraim 16 but the man of the city compass the house round but will offer horrible violence to the Levites who through necessity delivers unto them with concubines whom they abuse till they killed her22 her husband carrieth her home dead divideth her into twelve parts and sendeth them round into borders of Israel 28.
\p
\v 1 Also it came to pass in those days when there was no king [ that is no lawful supreme magistrates or governors that punished malefactors see above chapter 17 on verse 6 hence arose the looseness of the Levites wife who was neither punished in Ephraim nor in Judah and the subsequent abominable fact of the inhabitants in Gibea] in Israel that there was a Levitish man sourjoning at the sides [that is at one of the sides see above chapter 12 on verse 7] of mount Ephraim who took him a wife a concubine [see Genesis 22 on verse 24] from Bethlehem Judah [see Genesis 35 on verse 19 and above chapter 12 on verse8.]
\p
\v 2 . But his concubines played the whore being with him [or against him that is she committed adultery with others against the faith of marriage which she had promised him for although the concubines in the old testament were not held in that honor and esteem as the chief wives and mothers of the family yet they were accounted legitimate children see below chapter 20.4] and went away from him[viz. either through fear of her husband or out of some dislike or distaste that she had taken against him [to her fathers house at Bethlehem Judah and she was there certain days to wit four months [others a year and four months or the days of four months that is four complete months Heb. Days four months.]
\p
\v 3 . and her husband arose and went after her to speak according to her heart [or Topeka to upon at her that is to move her with friendly speeches which might work upon her heart to repent and to return to him again desiring rather to be reconciled to her then forsake her if it were possible see of this phrase Genesis 34 on verse 3] and to fetch her back and his servants was with him and a couple of asses and she [viz. his concubines ] brought him into her fathers house and when the young woman’s father saw him he rejoiced at his meeting.
\p
\v 4 . And father in law the young woman’s father retained him so that he abode with him three days and they ate and drank and overnighter there.
\p
\v 5 . now it came to pass on the forth day that they were early up in the morning and he [viz. the Levite ] rose up to depart then said the young woman’s father unto his son in law strengthen thine heart with a morset of bread and afterward ye shall depart [that is take a little breakfast and depart see Genesis 18 on verse 5 and 1Kings 13.7.]
\p
\v 6 . So they sate down and they did both eat and they drank together and then they said the young woman’s father unto mans consent I pray thee and overnight and let thine heart be merry. [Heb. Good that is merry cheerful see above chapter 16 on verse 25 so below on verse 9.22.]
\p
\v 7 . But the man rose up to depart then his father in law urged him so that he overnighter there again [Heb. returned and overnighter there.]
\p
\v 8 . When he was up early in the morning on the fifth day to depart then said the young woman’s father strengthen thine heart I pray thee and they tarried until the day declined [that is until the sun began to go down and it was near towards the evening] and they did both eat together.
\p
\v 9 . Then the man arose to depart he and his concubines and his servants and his father in law the young woman’s father said behold I pray thee the day is far spent so that it will be evening overnight I pray thee behold the day campeth itself[Heb. Behold camping of the day that is the day declineth draweth toan end or about this time of the day are travelling people wont to camp themselves or as if they should say wilt thou now begin to travel ? others camp thyself at thios day today that is let thy camping place be here today ]overnight here and let that night be merry an dtomorrow get ye early on your wayandgo thy tent [that is thy dwelling place.]
\p
\v 10 . but the man would not overnight but rose up and departed and came over against Jebus which is Jerusalem [afterwards so called at this time inhabitated by the Jebusite [see the two following verse and Joshua 15.63 2Samuel 5.6] and with him the coupler of asses saddled [or bound up and also laden as may be gathered from verse 19] also his concubines was with him.
\p
\v 11 . Now when they were at Jebus the day was much declined and the servant said unto his Lord go on I pray thee and let us turn into this city of Jebusite [see Genesis 10 on verse 16] and overnight in it.
\p
\v 12 . But his Lord said unto him we will not turn hither unto a strange city [Heb. City of stranger that is some city of heathen which were enstranged from God and his people hence may be gathered that Jerusalem at the time when this happened was not inhabitant of that Israelite or at least not so that they were masters of the city compare Joshua 15.63 and above chapter 1 on verse 8,21 and 2Samuel 5on verse 6 its possible that tehisraelites now and then were provoking God did as well lose Jerusalem as other places againalthough it was given them of the Lord by inheritance and made choice of by him to set his name there and afterwards happened in the time of David Solomon &c.] which is not of the children of Israel but we will not go on unto Gibea.
\p
\v 13 . Moreover he said unto his servants go before that we may draw near unto one of those places and overnight at Gibea or at Ram [both these cities lay on mountains not far from Jerusalem northwards on the day towards mount Ephraim nowhere the Levites then dwealt see verse 1.]
\p
\v 14 . So they went on and walked and the sun went down upon them by Gibea which is Benjamin’s [that is pertain to the tribe of Benjamin and lying in it.]
\p
\v 15 . And they turned thither so that they came into overnight at Gibea now when he came in he sate down in a street of the city for there was no man that took them into the house[Heb. Gathered or assembled as we say took them up took them into his house so below verse 18 see further concerning the use of the Hebrew word Psalms 26 on verse 9]
\p
\v 16 . And behold an old man came from his work out of the field in the evening which man was also of the mount of Ephraim [where the Levite sourjoned above verse 1]but sorjouned at Gibea ] where children of Jemini [that is of the tribe of Benjamin see Genesis 35 on verse 18 an d2Samuel 16.11 and above chapter 3.15.]
\p
\v 17 . Now when he with the old man lift up his eyes he saw the way faring man [viz. the Levite in the street of the city and the old man said wither goest thou and from whence comest thou?
\p
\v 18 . And he said unto him we pass through from Bethlehem Judah unto the sides of mount Ephraim from whence I am and I went towards Bethlehem Judah but now I go towards the house of the Lord which was then at Silo in Benjamin not far distant from mount Ephraim as may be gathered from verse 18.1 above chapter 18.31 1Samuel 1.3 ] and there is no man that taketh me into his house.
\p
\v 19 . Whereas our asses have as well straw as fodder and there is also bread and wine for me and for thine hand maid [meaning his concubine ] and for the boy [meaning with us ,which we have taken along with us for our journey. Or thus ,There is also bread and wine with thy servants, for me ,and for thine handmaid, and for the youth] (who) is with thy servants: [i.e. with us we and my concubine] there is no want of any thing .[save lodging.]
\p
\v 20 .Then said the old man ,peace be unto thee all that; thou wantest is however with me [Heb. All thy want is upon with or over me that is whosoever might be wanting unto thee let it be or lie upon me or I take upon or over me or is with me ] only overnight not in the street .
\p
\v 21 . And he brought him into his house and gave asses provender and having washed their feet [see Genesis 16 on verse 4] they did eat and drink.
\p
\v 22 . Now as they made their heart merry behold the man of that city men that were children of Belial[see Deuteronomy 13 on verse 13] compassed the house knocking at the door and they spake unto the old man the master of the house saying bring forth the man that came into thine house that we may know him[see Genesis 19 on verse 5.]
\p
\v 23 . And the man the master of the house went out unto them and said unto them no my brethren do not so ill I pray ye seeing this man is come into mine house [see Genesis 19 on verse 7,8] do not commit such folly [see Genesis 34 on verse 7.]
\p
\v 24 . Behold my daughter which is a virgin and his concubines [viz. the Levites ] then will I bring forth that ye may violate them [compare this filthy inconsiderateness with Genesis 19 on verse 8] and do unto us them what is good in your eyes [that is seemeth good unto ye or as it pleaseth ye see also Genesis 19 on verse 8] but unto this man do note foolish a thing [Heb. a matter or thing or fact of this folly.]
\p
\v 25 . But the man will not hearken to him then the man [viz. the Levite] took his concubine and brought her forth unto them and they knew her [see Genesis 4 on verse 1] and were busied with her [or abused her] all the night until the morning and let her go when it began to go of days.
\p
\v 26 . And this woman came towards the dawning of the day and fell down [Heb. fell or lay there that is being fallen lay there see concerning such use of some words Genesis 12 on verse 15] at the door of the mans house where her Lord [see Genesis 18.12,27 1Peter 3.6] was till it grew light [Heb. Until the light.]
\p
\v 27 . Now when her Lord rose up in the morning and opened the doors of the house and went to go his way behold the woman his concubine lay at the door of the house at her hands upon the threshold.
\p
\v 28 . And he said unto her rise up and let us go but no body answered [for she was dead see chapter 20.5] then he took her upon the ass compare above on verse 26] and the man rose up and went unto his place.
\p
\v 29 . Now when he came into his house he took a knife and he took his concubines and divided her with bones [or threw her bones that is cutting the body through in the joining together of the bones] into twelve pieces [Heb. As if one should say pierced them into twelve pieces or parted them into twelve parts] and he sent them into all the borders of Israel [because there was at that time up king that is no supreme lawful authority in Israel to whom he might make his complaint above verse1 this act of his no ways to be commended for it was a shameful thing to deal thus with the dead body of his wife.]
\p
\v 30 . And it came to pass that all that saw it say no such thing was done nor seen from that day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day lay your heart upon it [ the word heart is here inserted from 1Samuel 25.25 where the like phrase is found and here complete and perfect the meaning is take it to heart and consider of it might else be slightly taken thus lay yourselves upon it as we also speak so in our own language ] give counsel [or take counsel advise ] and speak [viz. one with another or tell us your judgments what think you of it what’s to be done in this case to put away such an evil from Israel as below chapter 20.13.]
\c 20
\s The children of Israel assemble with an accord at Mizpa and take notice of the fact done to the Levites concubines verse1&c. give orders what tope done and send men to the tribe of Benjamin to require the delinquents to be delivered up to justice but receive a flat denial 8 whereupon having consulted up with God they march up to fight against them but are twice followed 18 afterwards being humbled and receiving clearer revelation from god by Pinehas the high priest they march up yet once more and smite those of Benjamin so as that they destroy the whole tribe both men and women and burn all the cities there only remaining six hundred men that fled away.26.
\p
\v 1 Then all the children of Israel [excepting the Benjamites see verse 12,13 &c.]] went out and the congregation gathered themselves together as one man [that is with special unanimity and willingness and disquieted or troubled at all so below verse 8,11 and 1Samuel 11.7 2Samuel 19.14 Ezra 3.1 Nehemiah 8.7 &c.] from Dan even to Beersheba [the city of Dan was the northern 1Kings 4 on verse 25] also the land of Gilead [that is the Israelites that dwealt there in the east beyond Jordan to wit Reuben Gad and the half tribe of Mannasseh see Numbers chapter 32] unto the Lord [to pray unto him and besides to ask counsel at Silo ] at Mizpa [ lying in Benjamin Joshua 18.26 westwards from Silo as the map also sheweth a place fit for a solemn assembly as being strong according to the length lying in the midst off Canaan see1samuel 7 on verse 5,16 & 10.17 &c. 2Kings 25.222 &c. Jeremiah 40.7 &c. & 41.1 &c. some are of opinion that here at special place was appointed for public prayers and exercise of piety as synagogue and dyers more have been although the ceremonial worship of offering sacrifices &c. were to be done at Silo where the tabernacle and the ark compare other places bearing the same name see above chapter 10 on verse 17.]
\p
\v 2 . And from the corners of all the people [that is from all even the uttermost quarters others all the heads of the people meaning that those are called of the people by way of similitude as being the chiefest and firmness or strength of the people as the corners of a house] did all the tribe of Israel present themselves in the assemble of the people of God four hundred thousand man on foot that drew sword [see above chapter 8 on verse 10.]
\p
\v 3 . Now the children of Benjamin heard [ but appeared not also at MiPad ] that the children of Israel were gone up to MiPad and the children of Israel said [meaning the Levites whose concubines was abused even to death and who was here present as also question less his servant that was with him at that time when he was so abused ] speak how was this wickedness done ? [they will not resolve nor attempt anything without first searching and sifting out the matter.]
\p
\v 4 . Then answered the Levitish man [ that is having leave granted him to speak he uttered and related the whole business see chapter 18 on verse 14] the husband of the woman [although the woman was his concubine yet were they accounted lawful man and wife see chapter 19 on verse 2] that was killed [that is so abused that she died of it as is related in the following words ] and said I came with my concubines unto Gibea which is Benjamin’s to overnight.
\p
\v 5 . And the citizens of Gibea rose up against me and beset the house round against me [to abuse me abominable ] by night they thought to have killed me [viz. if I have would have not yielded to their abominable wickedness and had rather die then do so] and my concubines have they forced that she is dead.
\p
\v 6 . Then I took my concubines and divided her [into twelve pieces above chapter 19.29] and sent her into all the land of inheritance of Israel because they [that is those of Gibea ] had committed a leud act and folly [see Genesis 34 on verse 7so below verse 1] in Israel.
\p
\v 7 . Behold ye all children of Israel [whom as being Gods people in covenant in no ways besitteth such horrible wickedness to go unpunished.] give here for yourselves words and counsel.
\p
\v 8 . Then all the people arose as one man saying we will not go [meaning unless we shall first have acted that which is related in the following words ] every man to his rent nor turn every man into his house.
\p
\v 9 . But now this is the thing which we will do unto Gibea against her by Lot[to cast lots who shall victual the camp and who shall fight .]
\p
\v 10 . And we will take ten men of an hundred out of all the tribes and a hundred of a thousand and thousand of a ten thousand to fetch victual for the people [which shall fight] to Gab of Benjamin[in the former verse and so continually in the history that is called Gibea of Benjamin] they may do unto it [viz. to the inhabitants of Gibea ]according to all the folly which it hath committed in Israel [that disaccording to their desert.]
\p
\v 11 . So all man of Israel were gathered against this city combined together [Heb. Companioned accompanied joined together] as one man.
\p
\v 12 . And the tribes of Israel sent men through all tribe of Benjamin [Heb. throughout all the tribes that is the thousand into which the tribe of Benjamin as others was divided ] saying what wickedness is this that is done among ye?
\p
\v 13 . Now therefore deliver in those men [who are guilty of his abomination ]those children of Belial[as above chapter 19.22 see Deuteronomy 13 on verse 13] which are at Gibea that we may put them to death and put away evil from Israel but the children of Benjamin will not hearken to the voice of Israel [making themselves thus guilty of that horrible fact of the inhabitants of Gibea.]
\p
\v 14 . But the children of Benjamin gathered together out of the city unto Gibea to go forth to battle against the children of Israel.
\p
\v 15 . And the children of Benjamin were that day numbered out of the cities six and twenty thousand men [of this number were slain five and twenty thousand an done hundred verse35 the nine hundred were perhaps left to possess the cities to abide by the baggage and to victual the camp these after the fight were all slain in the cities verse 48 six hundred fewer than those of Gibea only excepting the rest set out escaped and remained alive verse 47,46 ] besides that the inhabitants of Gibea were numbered seven hundred chosen men.
\p
\v 16 . Among all the people were seven hundred chosen men which were left handed [Heb. locked up on their right hand or whose right hand was locked up see above chapter 3 on verse 15.] all these [or every one of these ]slung with a stone at an hair breadth that they missed not [Heb. and caused not the same to miss or fail to go astray even from hitting an hair here in the Hebrew text is the word used which signifieth every where to sin or cause t sin because sin is a missing failing or straying from the law of God when anything agreeth not therewith or as the apostle John saith in the 1Epistle chapter 3 verse 4 is unlawness or unlawfulness compare Job 5 on verse 24.]
\p
\v 17 . And the men of Israel were numbered besides Benjamin four hundred thousand men that drew sword all these were man of war.
\p
\v 18 . And the children of Israel arose and went up to the house of God [which was at Silo eastward of Mizpa and nor far distant from Gibea see above chapter 19 on verse 18 Heb. Beth-el that is the house of God see below on verse 26] and asked counsel of God [see above chapter 1 on verse 1] and said [ not being troubled about the justness of this war nor about the victory which not withstanding they though much stronger then Benjamin were to desire and expect from God they only ask counsel concerning the ordering of the battle wherein they seem not to have agreed so well together compare above chapter 1.1] who among us shall go up first.
\p
\v 19 . So the children of Israel rose up in the morning and camped themselves against Gibea.
\p
\v 20 . And the men of Israel went up to battle against Benjamin moreover the men of Israel ordered the battle [that is they put themselves in order to fight or put themselves to battle array ]against them by Gilead.
\p
\v 21 . Then the children of Benjamin went forth from Gibea and they destroyed [Heb. spoiled so below verse 25,35,42 the Hebrew word tendeth to the aggravaton of slaying if one should say as if one should say utterly and totally ruin destroy see Ezekiel 9.6,8] to the ground of Israel on that day two and twenty thousand men.
\p
\v 22 . But the people to wit the men of Israel strengthen themselves [that is they took courage and recruited themselves notwithstanding this slaughter] and they are ordered by the battle again [Heb. they proceeded or added to order the battle ] at the place where they had ordered the same the day before.
\p
\v 23 . And the children of Israel went up and wept before the face of the Lord [viz. that of the congregation where the ark of the covenant which was a visible token of Gods presence and favor was see below verse 16,27 & Leviticus 1 on verse 3] until the evening and asked counsel of the Lord saying I shall [viz. Israel so below verse 28]again draw nigh [Heb. shall I add or proceed to draw nigh ] to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother ? [ it seemeth that they in regard of the slaughter they had sustained doubted whether it were pleasing to God that they should thus fight against their brethren without asking counsel concerning the event of the battle or victory] and the Lord said go up against him.
\p
\v 24 . So the children of Israel drew neer to the children of Benjamin the second day.
\p
\v 25 . And those of Benjamin of Benjamin went forth to meet them out of Gibea the second day and felled [Heb. spoiled]down to the ground of the children of Israel yet eighteen thousand men all those drew the sword [that is all these were man of war see verse 17 and 15.]
\p
\v 26 . Then all the children of Israel and all the people went up and came to the house of God [Heb. Beth-el that is Gods house as is rendered by the most translators in this history this is also the name of the famous place Beth-el see Genesis 18.14 and because in the following verse its said that there was the ark of the covenant at that time some gather from thence that is was at Bethel and not at silo no where mentioned in this history but only below chapter 21.12,19,21because the particle there seemeth not to agree so well if there had been no place before named but Beth-el was so far distant eastward from Gibea as the best maps tell us that the people could not easily go thither and come back again in so short time but Silo was close by Gibea the attentive reader will be able to judge hereof see above chapter 19 on verse 18and below chapter 21.12] and wept and tarried there before the face of the Lord.
\p
\v 27 . And the children of Israel asked counsel of the LORD for these[viz. In the house of God at Silo: others understand Bethel: see the annotate. On the former verse] was the Ark of the Covenant of God in those days.
\p
\v 28 . And Pinehas, [See above chap. 17 v.1] the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron stood [i.e. ministered as High Priest, see Deut. 10.8 & 18.5, & c.] before his face[viz. the Lords, or, before it, to wit, the Ark on the Covenant] in those days, saying: Shall I yet any more go forth, Heb. shall I (namely Israel.) yet, or hence forth added, or procced to so forth] to battle against the children of Benjamin, my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up, for tomorrow will I deliver him[viz. Benjamin into thine hand.
\p
\v 29 .Then Israel set liars in wait round about Gibea.
\p
\v 30 .And the children of Israel went up on the third day, against the children of Benjamin: and thy ordered (the battle) against Gibea, as at other times.
\p
\v 31 .Then the children of Benjamin went out, to meet the people, [viz. Israel] (and) were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, (and) to stab, [Heb. stabbed, or stabbing, or wounded to death, or were killed] as at other times, in the streets, whereof the one goeth up to the house of God,[or, Beth-l] and the other to Gibea, in the field about thirty men of Israel.
\p
\v 32 Then said the children of Benjamin; They are beaten before our face, is formerly; but the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw him[ To wit:, Benjamin] away from the city unto the streets.
\p
\v 33 . Then all the men of Israel rose up out of their places, and ordered (the battle)at Baal-I’bamar:[Lying West-ward of Gibea, as the Maps shew] also Israels ambush brake forth out of their place after the making; bare [i.e. after the city was bereft, or made bare of the soldiers, that now were drawn away from it, oth,out-of the medow; , pastures] of Geba, [ i.e. Fibea, as above v.10]
\p
\v 34 . An (ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel came, from over against Gibea, [ To step in between the city and the soldiery, to the end, they might not get into the city again] and the battle waxed heavy: but they [viz. those of Benjamin] knew not, that the evil would hit them [or, would over take them, or, that the evil were near at hand, or, approaching: so below verse.41.]
\p
\v 35 . Then the LORD smote Benjamin before the face of Israel, that the children of Israel destroyed [Hebrew. Spoiled: As below v.21,25. How this happened, is particularly mentioned in the following words] of Benjamin that day five and twenty thousand, and an hundred men: all those drew the sword. [See chapter.8. on v.10. and above v.7. and below v.46.]
\p
\v 36 . And the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted to the ambush, which they had placed against Gibea.
\p
\v 37 . And the ambush hasted, and brakes forwards [Or, fell on, broke thorow] upon Gibea: yea the ambush drew right thorough, [or, drew, viz. the people that were hard by to them, to press thorough into the city. Compare above chapter, 4. On v.6. Otherwise, made a drawing sound, blew with along breath, drawing, viz. with the Trumpet, as Exodus.19.13. Josua.6.5.] and smote all the city, [i.e. all that were found in the city] with the edge of the sword. [Hebrew. At the mouth of the sword.]
\p
\v 38 . And the men of Israel had an appointed time with the ambush: when they should cause a great rising up of smoke to rise up out of the city. [Hebrew. Should multiply a lifting up of smoke to cause it to rise up from the city: That then those of Israel should wheel about, and fall upon the Benjamites, for it should be a token that the city was taken.]
\p
\v 39 . So the men of Israel turned themselves about in the battle: [As fleeing men, or fugitives, to draw those of Benjamin off from the city: as was related above verse.31.] and Benjamin had begun to smite, (and) to stab [Hebrew. stabbed; as v.31.] of the men of Israel, about thirty men, for they [viz. those of Benjamin] said; indeed be [to wit, Israel] is certainly smitten [Hebrew. being smitten, he is smitten] before our face, as in the former battle.
\p
\v 40 . Then the lifting up [Whereof above v.38.] began to rise up out of the city, (as) a piller of smoke: now when Benjamin looked behind him, behold the burning of the city, [Hebrew. the whole consumption, i.e. the burning, whereby the whole city was consumed] ascended up to heaven. [i.e. into the air, or skies.]
\p
\v 41 . And the men of Israel turned themselves about, and the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that the evil would hit them. [as above v.34.]
\p
\v 42 . Therefore they turned themselves before the face of the men of Israel toward the wilderness; but the fight [i.e. the fighters] clave unto them, [i.e. nevertheless overtook them, hit them, as v.45.] and those out of the cities, destroyed them in the midst of them. [Hebrew. spoiled them in their middle: i.e. then round about on all sides, they smote them, as followeth]
\p
\v 43 . They beset Benjamin [i.e. The men of Benjamin; or the Benjamites] round about, they pursued him, they trod him down easily. [Hebrew. (in, or, with) rest: i.e. without much trouble or pains. Some take it for the name of a place, called Menu, or Menucha] until before Gibea toward the Sun-rising. [Hence some do gather, that they was yet another Gibea, lying Eastward from Gibea, or Geba, continually mentioned in this history; as the maps also do place both these cities, calling the one Gibea, or Geba, and the other (which is also called Gibea) Gibeath, or Gabaath.]
\p
\v 44 . And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men: all these were men of war.
\p
\v 45 . Then they turned themselves, and fled towards the wilderness, unto the rock of Rimmon; [A city lying upon a rock between Bethel and Gibea, on the Southern borders of Benjamin] but they made gearing among them on the street, [Hebrew. they gleaned him (i.e. Benjamin) in the streets: i.e. they smote them here and there by parties, as they are wont to glean the remaining grapes in the vintage, and at last to cut them off that nothing might remain: see above chapter.8.2] of five thousand men: besides, they clave close to them behind, [i.e. they followed or pursued them close upon the heels, gave them no breathing time, no rest, or time to escape or flee away] unto Gideon, and smote of them two thousand men.
\p
\v 46 . So all that fell that day of Benjamin, were five and twenty thousand men, [In this number, are (according to the customer of the Scripture) left out the hundred (whereof above v. 35.) because of the wardens or completeness of the number. Compare above chapter 11. On verse 26.] that drew sword, all those were men of war.
\p
\v 47 . But six hundred men turned themselves, and fled toward the wilderness, unto the rock of Rimmon, and abode in the rock of Rimmon four months.
\p
\v 48 . And the men of Israel turned again unto the children of Benjamin, [viz. which remained in the cities] and smote with the edge of the sword, [Hebrew. at the mouth of the sword] those of the whole city [Hebrew of the city of wholeness: compare Psalm.38.4.] even to the Breasts, [othertwise, from the men of the city, to the very beasts] yea all that was found; also they set [Hebrew. sent: as above chapter1.8.] all the cities that were found on fire.
\c 21
\s The children of Israel mourn for the destruction of the tribe of Benjamin, v.1.etc. Find out a way to help the residue that remained unto wives, without breach of their oath; The Inhabitants of Jabes in Gilead, for not coming up to this battle are all destroyed, excepting four hundred damsels, whom the children of Israel bestow on a part of the remaining Benjamites, 8. For the others, they find good, to grant them leave, to seize upon the dancing maidens at the feast in Silo, and to carry them away, as many as they have need of, 10, bethinking themselves, with what kind of answer they might pacific their lamenting friends, 22.
\p
\v 1 Now the men of Israel had sworn at Mizpa, [See above chapter.20. on v.1.] saying: None of us shall gave unto the Benjamites his daughter to wife.
\p
\v 2 . So the people came unto the house of God, [Or, Bethel] and they continued there until the evening, before the face of God: [see above chapter.20. on v.23.] and they lifted up their voice, and wept with great weeping.
\p
\v 3 . And said; O Lord, God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that this day there is a tribe lacking in Israel? [Had they considered this before, and used their victory more moderately, they might easily have avoided all these troubles and grievances.]
\p
\v 4 . And it came to pass the next day, that the people rose up early, and built there an altar: [Understand, an extraordinary Altar, Besides the ordinary one, which was done by reason of the great number of sacrifices of all the people. Compare 1 King.8.64.] and they offered burnt-offerings and thank-offerings.
\p
\v 5 . And the children of Israel said; who is there out of all the tribes of the Israel, that came not up into the congregation unto the LORD? [see above chapter.20. on v 1.] for there was a great oath made concerning him that came not unto the LORD at Mizpa, saying; he shall certainly be put to death. [Hebrew. he shall dying be put to death: or, dying he shall be made to die.]
\p
\v 6 . And it represented the children of Israel concerning their brother Benjamin: and they said, this day is one tribe cut off from Israel. [Or, should we this day cut off one tribe from Israel?]
\p
\v 7 . What shall we do concerning wives, [ i.e. That they may get wives, and that the tribe may be preserved] to those that remain? For we have sworn by the LORD, that we will give them none of our daughters to wives.
\p
\v 8 . And they said; is there any one of the tribes of Israel that came not unto the Lord at Mizpa? And behold, there came none up from Jabes [Which lieth beyond the Jordan, where the same runneth thorough the sea of Genesareth, toward the East. See also 1 Samuel.11. verse 1,3,9 & c. and 31.11, &c.] in Gilead up into the camp unto the congregation.
\p
\v 9 . For the people were numbered, and behold, therewas none of the inhabitants of Jabes in Gilead.
\p
\v 10 . Then the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men, of the most warlike: [Hebrew, of the children or sons of war likeness, or, of the army,] and they commanded them, saying; Go forth, and smite with the edge of the sword the inhabitants of Jabes in Gilead, with the women, and the little children.
\p
\v 11 . But this is the thing which ye shall do: all that is male, and all women, that have known the lying with a man, shall ye ban. [i.e. Destroyed, kill, see Duet.2. on v.34.]
\p
\v 12 . And they found among the inhabitants of Jabes in Gilead four hundred damsels, that were virgins, which had known to man by lying with the male; and they brought them to the camp at Silo [see Josua.18.1.] which [viz. Silo, or, which camp] is [or, which (viz.camp) was, &c.] in the land of Canaan.[beyond the Jordan toward the West accounting from Gilead, which lay on the other side Jordan toward the East.]
\p
\v 13 . Then all the congregation sent forth and spake [Hebrew both verbs are put in the plural number, that is, they sent some, and by them did speak with them] unto the children of Benjamin, that were in the rock of Rimmon: and they cryed peace to them.
\p
\v 14 . So the Benjamites came again at the same time: and they gave them the women which they had saved alive [The other being all bound or killed, as was enjoyed v. 10.] of the women of Jabes in Gilead, but yet so there were not enough for them. [Hebrew. they found not for them. See of this phrase, Number.11. on v.22. and Josua.17.16,etc.]
\p
\v 15 Then it repented the people concerning Benjamin: [Because there seemed no means to be left to provide wives for the rest] because the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
\p
\v 16 . And the Eldest of the congregation said; what shall we, touching wives, do to those that are left? [Meaning the other, which were yet two hundred in number] for the women are destroyed] out of Benjamin.
\p
\v 17 . They said further; The inheritance of these that are escaped, is Benjamin; [Hebrew. of the escaping; that is, of those that are escaped. The meaning is, those that are escaped must keep the whole inheritance, which was allowed to the tribe of Benjamin, in the time of Joshua: no part thereof may be given to any other tribe. Now forasmuch as those that remain are few in number, therefore they ought to be provided of wives, that the tribe being enlarged, might continue in being, and might occupy and inhabit his inheritance. Oth. those that are escaped of Benjamin, (must keep their) possession: that no tribe, etc.] and there must be no tribe destroyed out of Israel.
\p
\v 18 . But we may not give them any wives, out of our daughters? For the children of Israel have sworn, saying cursed be he that giveth a wife to the Benjamites.
\p
\v 19 . Then said they; behold, there is a feast of the LORD at Silo, [What kind of feast this was, is uncertain and doubtful. Some guess that it was the feast of leaf- huts, or of Tabernacles] from year to year, [Hebrew. from days to days; that is, from year to year: the meaning is, every year, or yearly. See this signification of the word days, Leviticus.25.9. and the annotation there] which is kept toward the North (part) of the house of God, [This is by, most Expositors held to be a description of the places where the people, coming up in great multitudes, from all quarters, were went to spread, and recreate themselves, in regard that they had not room enough for that purpose in Silo. This description of the place was of use to the Benjamites, to make them heed the same, as followeth, of the house of God. Oth. Bethel] toward the sun-rising, at the high-way, which goeth up from the house of God toward Sichem, and toward the south of Lebona.
\p
\v 20 . And they commanded the children of Benjamin saying: Go your ways, and lie in the vineyards.
\p
\v 21 . And give good heed; and behold when the daughters of Silo shall be gone forth to dances, [Or, to pipe with pipes, or, to flute with flutes] then come ye forth out of the vineyards, and snatch [or, take, steal] unto yourselves, every one his wife, out of the daughters of Silo: and go your ways into the land of Benjamin. [unto the places, which they formerly inhabited, to build them up again, see v.23.]
\p
\v 22 . And it shall come to pass, when their fathers, or their brethren, shall come to plead before us, that we will say unto them, be gracious unto them for our sakes, [The meaning is, Grant us these Benjamites favorably, that we may favor them at this once (according to the opinion of some) grant us these daughters for this once, give, yield them to us freely, out of meer grace and favour, for the following reasons or grounds. Oth. Be gracious unto them (viz. these Benjamites) for our sakes, or, have compassion on them for our sakes, or, have compassion on us for them] because we took not a wife for every one of them in this war: [i.e. because we took no heed to reserve wives enough for all the remaining Benjamites, out of the inhabitants of the city of Jabes in Gilead. See above, v.11,12. so they take upon themselves the guilt of having dealt inconsiderately and imprudently] for ye gave them not, that ye should be guilty at this time. [But they took themselves, so that ye are not in any wise guilty of the breach of the oath that ye have taken, see above verse.1,7,18.]
\p
\v 23 . And the children of Benjamin did so, and carried away according to their number, wives, of the dancing maidens, whom they took: and they went their ways, and returned to their ways, and returned to their inheritance, and built the cities again, [which were burnt with fire, above chapter.20.48.] and dwelt in them.
\p
\v 24 . Also the children of Israel departed thence that time, every man to his tribe, and to his family: So they went out from thence, every man to his inheritance.
\p
\v 25 . In those days there was no King in Israel, [see above chapter.17. on v.6] every one did what was right in his (own) eyes. [i.e. what seemed right to him, not what was right in the eyes of the Lord.]
