\mt2 THE SECOND BOOK OF THE
\mt CHRONICLES
\s The Argument of this Book
\p As for the appellation of this Book, and the former, the Reader may consult the Argument of the first Book of the Chronicles. In this second is the history of the people of God, and their kings, as the same was left in the former Book, prosecuted unto the Babylonish captivity. Now although here be also mention made of the kings of Israel, who are so called in a special manner, after that the ten tribes had separated themselves from the house of David, yet in this Book is chiefly described by Ezra (as is conceived) the history of the kings of Juda. For which there were remarkable reasons. For besides that Juda had still in some kind kept the doctrine, and the pure worship of God, from which the ten tribes had so far departed, that God at length suffered them to be carried away captive out of their own land by Salmanasser king of Assyria without hope of deliverance, and that consequently Juda was then properly the only people of God, whose history Ezra especially intended. The Messias also was to come of that tribe, even of the royal Family to David according to the flesh. For which cause the history of his Ancestrours the kings, from the beginning of them, until his coming, was carefully to be recorded, that the promises of God might be found true. And for as much as the history of David is written in the former book, therefore now this second beginneth with a relation of the reign of Salomon, who succeeded in his Fathers stead. He is extraordinarily ended with great wisdom, which he had asked of God: Whereunto were added both riches, (which he bestowed and laid out upon the building of the Temple, and other buildings) and honor which he received of the nations round about. But for his sins his kingdom was divided, when Rehabeam his son succeded in his stead, Ten tribes revolted from Juda, making choice of Jerobeam for their king. After Rehabeam followed successively in order in the kingdom of Juda, Abia, Asa, Josaphat, Joram, Ahazia, Joas, Amazia, Uzzia, Jotham, Achaz, Hizkia, Manasseh, Amon, Josia, Joahaz, Jojakim, Jojachin, Zedekias; many of which were idolaters; some maintaining the true Religion and the pure worship of God, as Asa, Josaphat, Joas, Amazia, Uzzia, Jotham, Hizkia, Josia; although they were unequal to one another in Godly zeal and true piety. Likewise some of them either turned aside from good to evil, as Joas and Amazia, or turned from evil to good as Manasseh. In the mean while the Lord never ceased to call as well the kings as all the commonalty to repentance, using for this end the ministry of the Prophets, who all this time followed each other in great abundance, even from Elia and Elizeus, unto Ezekiel and Daniel. But in regard they were not hearkened unto, but contemned and derided by the greatest multitude, therefore God at length suffered this kingdom of Juda to be overpowered by Nebuchanezer King of Babel, who carried the Jews away captive into this land: where they remained seventy years, until Cyrus, who translated the Monarchy from the Babylonians to the Persians, etc gave them liberty to return home into their own country, as this further appeareth in the Books of Ezra and Nehemia. Now there is in this book (according to the opinion of some) contained a history of four hundred and four and twenty years.
\c 1
\s Salomon being settled in his kingdom, offereth at Gibeon, v.1. &c. It being put to his choice by God what to ask of him, he prayeth for wisdom, 7. Which he obtaineth, with a promise of riches and honor, 11. He returneth from Gibeon, 13. His power and great wealth, 14.
\p
\v 1 . And Salomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom: [That is, took courage, or became courageous, observing his lawful choice to the crown, the joint consent of the people, and the general peace of the land, and removing of all lets and hinderances thereof] for the LORD his God was with him, [see Gen.ch.21. on v.22.] and magnified him exceedingly. [Heb. Upward. So 1 Chr.22.5. and 23.7. and 29.25. The meaning is that he lifts him up as it were on high in respect of greatness of estate, honor, peace, and wealth.]
\p
\v 2 . And Salomon spake unto all Israel, to the chief of the thousands, and of the hundreds, and to the judges, and to all the Princes [Understand by or under this name, those that among others excel in nobility, famousness, and high offices] in all Israel, the heads of the Fathers; [see 1 Kings 8.on vers.8. where they are called the chief of the Fathers.]
\p
\v 3 . And the went, Salomon, and all the Congregation with him, to the high place, [Called a great high place, 1 Kings 3.4. See the annotate.] which was at Gibeon; [a city in the tribe of Benjamin. See 1 King. Chap.3. on v.4.] For there was the Tent of the Congregation of God, [that is, the holy Tabernacle, of which see Exod.26. item Lev.1.on v.1.] which Moseh the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.
\p
\v 4 . (But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirian-Jearim, [A city in the tribe of Juda. See Jos.9 17. Judg.18.12. 1 Sam.7.1. The Prophet Uria’s country, Jer.26.20.] to the place which David had prepared for it; for he pitched a tent for it.)
\p
\v 5 . Also the copper altar, which Bezalelel the son of Uri, the son of Hurhad made, was there [Not at Jerusalem where the ark was, but at Gibeon, where the Tabernacles stood] before the Tabernacle of the LORD; Now Salomon and the Congregation visited the same. [to wit, the copper altar, to offer upon it, according to Gods command, Lev.17.3,4. Oth. Sought him, to wit, the LORD.]
\p
\v 6 . And Salomon offered there before the face of the LORD, [See Lev.1.on ver.3.] upon the copper altar, which was at the Tent of the Congregation: [so Lev, 1.5.] and he offered a thousand burnt-offerings upon it.
\p
\v 7 . In that night did God appear unto Salomon [To wit, in dream, 1 Kings 3.5. Of the appearance of God by means of dreams, see Gen.20.on v.3. and 28. On vers.12.] and he said unto him; ask what I shall give thee.
\p
\v 8 . And Salomon said unto God; thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my Father: And thou hast made me king in his stead. [See 1 Chron.28.5.]
\p
\v 9 . Now LORD God, let thy word be true (made) unto David my Father: For thou hast made me king over a people, manifold as the dust of the Earth. [See Gen.13.on v.16.]
\p
\v 10 . Give me now wisdom and knowledge, [See the difference between these two gifts, 1 Kings 3. on v.12.] that I may go out, and come in before the face of this people? [see the exposition of this phrase, Num.27.on v.17. and Deu.31.on v.2.] For who shall (be able) to judge [that is, govern, so in the following verse. See judg.2.on v.16. The word be able is here inserted out of 1 Kings 3.9. although it be otherwise also included in the sense, and, who should judge? Is as much, as who should be able to judge] this thy great people?
\p
\v 11 . Then God said unto Salomon; because this was in thine heart, [That is, the desire and purpose of thine heart] and thou hast not asked riches, goods, nor honor, nor the soul of thy haters, neither also hast asked many days, but hast desired wisdom and knowledge for thy self, that thou mightiest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king.
\p
\v 12 . Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee: Besides I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honor, the like no kings that have been before thee, have had; and after thee shall not the like be. [Compare herewith 1 Kings 3.12. and the annotate thereon. Oth. Which happened not so to the kings that have been before thee, neither shall happen so after thee.]
\p
\v 13 . So Salomon came to Jerusalem; from the high place which is at Gibeon, from before the Tent of the Congregation; And he reigned over Israel.
\p
\v 14 . And Salomon gathered charets and horsemen, so that he had a thousand and four hundred charets, and twelve thousand horsemen: and he placed them in the charet-cities [That is, wherein the charets were disposed, and which had good pasture for the horses] and with the king at Jerusalem.
\p
\v 15 . And the king made the silver and the gold in Jerusalem to be as stones, [See 1 Kings 10.on verse 27. and 2 Chron.9.27.] and the Cedars he made to be as sycamore trees which are in the low grounds in multitude.
\p
\v 16 . And the bringing forth of horses, was that which Salomon had out of Egypt; and concerning the linen yarn; the kings merchants took the linen yarn for the price. [See the exposition of this verse, and the next, 1 Kings 10.on verse 28,29.]
\p
\v 17 . And they brought up, and carried a charet out of Egypt for six hundred (shekels) of silver, and an horse for an hundred for six hundred and fifty; and so they brought (them) out by their hand, for all the kings of the Hithites, and for the kings of Syria.
\c 2
\s Solomon appointeth workmen to build the temple, verse 1, etc. He requesteth also of Hiram the King of Tyre labourers, and timber, 3. Promising to furnish them with victuals, 10. Huram consenteth, and sendeth an eminent Artificer to him, 11. Solomon numbereth, and divideth his labourers, 17.
\p
\v 1 Now Solomon thought [Heb. Said, to wit, within himself, that is, determined, purposed, was minded, had concluded. See 1 Kings 5.5. and the annotate. Thereon] to build an house [that is a temple. Compare Gen.28.on verse 17, and 22.] for the name of the LORD; [that is, unto the LORD, see 1 Kings 5. On verse 3. Item Deut.28.on verse 58.] and a house for his kingdom [that is, a royal palace for him, and those that should succeed him in the kingdom, to dwell in, so below verse 12.]
\p
\v 2 . And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear hurthens, and fourscore thousand men to hew [See 1 Kings 5.on v.15.] in the mountain; [namely of Lebanon. See 1 Kings 4.on verse 33.] together with three thousand and six hundred [see 1 kings 5.on verse 16.] oversees over them, [or commanders, or taskmasters, these were surveying officers, that had authority to overlook the laboring men, and to see that the work went on apace. See verse 18.]
\p
\v 3 . And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, [See of mthis king also 1 kings 5. On verse 1. Where he is called Hiram] saying, according as thou hast dealt with David my father, and hast sent him cedars to build him an house, to dwell therein; (so deal likewise with me.)
\p
\v 4 . Behold, I will build an house for the name of the LORD my God, to hallow him, [That is, dedicated to his glory, and for the salvation of men, and to the solemn duties of Gods holy worship. Compare Levit.8.on verse 10.] to burn incense of sweet smelling spices before his face, and for the preparing of the continual (bread,) [understand the twelve shew-bread (loaves,) called a continual bread, Num.4.7. because they ought always to lie upon the holy table, being for that purpose renewed every Sabbath-day, Exod.25.30. Levit.24.8.] and (for) the burnt-offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God: which is for ever, [Heb in eternity; that is, during the time of the law. See Gen.13.on verse 15.] in Israel.
\p
\v 5 . And the house which I shall build, shall be great; for our God is greater then all Gods.
\p
\v 6 . But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heavens, yea the heaven of heavens cannot contain him? [see 1 Kings 8.on verse 27.] and who am I, that I should build an house for him, unless it were to burn incense before his face? [the meaning is, that he would not build that house, that God according to his essence, which is infinite, might be included in it, but that he might be worshipped there according to his revealed will.]
\p
\v 7 . Send me now then a wise man to work [That is, a cunning workman: and so in the sequel] in gold, and in silver, and in copper, and in iron, and in purples, and in crimson, and skie- colour, and that hath skill to grave gravings, with the wise (men) that are with me in Juda, and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.
\p
\v 8 . Send me also cedar, fir, and algummim-wood [See of this wood, 1 Kings 10. On verse 11. Where it is called almuggim-wood] out of Lebanon, for I know that thy servants have skill to cut the wood of Lebanon, and behold, my servants shall be with thy servants.
\p
\v 9 . And that to prepare me wood in multitude: for the house which I shall build, shall be great, and wonderful.
\p
\v 10 . And behold, I will give [Heb. I have given, that is, firmly determined to give] to thy servants the hewers measure, 1 Kings 4.on verse 22. and compare this place with 1 kings 5.11. and with the annotate. Thereon] of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand Cors of barley: besides, twenty thousand Baths, [see of this measure, 1 Kin.7.on verse 26.] of wine, and twenty thousand Baths of oil.
\p
\v 11 . Now Huram the king of Tyre answered [Heb. Said] in writing, and sent (it) to Solomon, because the LORD loveth his people, he hath made thee king over them.
\p
\v 12 . Moreover Huram said; Praised be the LORD the God of Israel, that made the heavens and the earth, for that he hath given to king David a wise son, able in prudence and understanding, [Knowing prudence and understanding: so in the sequel] who buildeth an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.
\p
\v 13 . Now then I send a wise man, endued with understanding, Huram Abi: [Oth. Huram my father, or, Huram my Fathers, or, who was my father Hurams: otherwise called Huram Abiu, below chap.4.16. that is, Huram his father, or, his fathers.]
\p
\v 14 . The son of a woman [That was a widow, 1 Kings 7.14.] of the daughters of Dan, [that is, one of the women that were of the tribe of Dan. Some conceive that 1 Kings 7.14. she is said to have been of the tribe of Naphtali: but that King Hiram here to belong to the tribe of Dan, through ignorance, naming this tribe for the tribe of Nephtali, as sometimes in scripture some are brought in speaking, not according to truth, but according to their own opinion and meaning, whose words the holy Ghost indeed reciteth, but not therefore approveth, as Sam.4.8. Mark 16.1. Joh.1.45. &c. See yet another exposition of this place, on the fourteen verse of 1 Kings 7.] and whose father was a man of Tyre, that is skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in copper, in iron, in stones, and in wood, in purple, in skie-colour, and in fine linen, and in crimson, and to grave all manner of graving, and to all (or every) cunning device, [Heb. Invention; that is, all kind of artificial work, that a skilful and cunning artificer, putting all his skill and judgment together, were able to invent] which shall be propounded to him, [or, even as, or, according as shall be propounded to him] with thy wise (men) and the wise (men) of my Lord David thy father.
\p
\v 15 . Now then let my Lord send to his servants the wheat and the barley, the wine, and the oil which he hath spoken (of.)
\p
\v 16 . And we will hew wood out of Lebanon, according to all thy need, and will bring it to thee in floats over the sea, to Japho: [Otherwise called Joppe, Acts 10 32. a city lying in the border of the tribe of Dan, by the mid-land sea, see Jos.19 46. Ezra 3.7. Jona. 1.3.] and thou shalt cause it to be brought up to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 17 . And Solomon numbered all the strange men that were in the land of Israel, [These strangers were Canaanites, that yet remained in the land, whose ancestors the Israelites had not destroyed, although God had commanded them to do it, see 2 Chron.8.7.] after the numbering, wherewith David hid father had numbered them: and there were found an hundred, and three and fifty thousand and six hundred.
\p
\v 18 . And he made threescore and ten thousand of them (to be) bearers of hurthens [So is the Hebrew word taken, below chap.34.13. Nehem.4.10.] and fourscore thousand (to be) hewers in the mountain [to wit, of Lebanon] together with three thousand, and six hundred overseers, [see above on verse 2.] to cause the people to work.
\c 3
\s The place where, and the time when the temple was built, v.1. etc. The measure and ornaments thereof, 3. The Cheribims, 11. The vail, and the pillars, 14.
\p
\v 1 And Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem on mount Merija, [That is, the mount of vision upon which Abraham somewhat less then nine hundred years before was commanded to offer up his son Isaac. Concerning the reason and original of this appellation, see Genes.22. verse 2, 8, 14. And the annotate. Thereon] which was shewed to David his father: [namely. By the prophet Gad, 2 Sam.24, 18. 1 Chron.21.18. &c. oth. Where (the LORD) appeared unto David his father: to wit, by the fire, which fell from heaven upon the altar, and the offering, of which see 1 Chron.21.26.] in the place that David had prepared in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. [of whom David had bought this place to build the temple thereon, 2 Sam.24.24. I Chron.21. verse 24,25.]
\p
\v 2 . Now he began to build in the second month, [Called Zin. See of this month, 1 Kings 6.on verse 1.] on the second (day) in the fourtieth year of his reign.
\p
\v 3 . And these are the foundations Solomon to build the house of God: [That is, according to which Solomon laid the foundation of the temple,] the length in ells (or cubits) according to the first measure [some understand this of the measure that is, used in holy building: Others, of the measure of the temple, which David had left behind to his son Solomon in writing: Some, because measures are sometimes changed through length of time, conceive the first measure to be that which was in use in Moses time. Some also understand the first measure to be meant of the first raw draught, or measuring of the ground-work or place of the temple, to wit, of its length and breadth, without the distinction of parts, and the addition of those courts and chambers, which were designed and made afterward] was threescore ells, and the breadth twenty ells. [here is no mention made of the house, because here is onely spoken of the foundation, see of the height, 1 Kings 6.2.]
\p
\v 4 . And the porch that was in the front, [To wit, of the house of the Lord, see 1 Kings 6.on verse 3.] was in the length according to the breadth of the house, [that is, it was as long as the temple was broad. Oth. And the porch that was before the length, was etc.] twenty ells, and the length, was etc.] twenty ells, and the length an hundred and twenty; [of the breath which was ten ells, see 1 Kings 6.3.] which he overlaid within with pure gold.
\p
\v 5 . Now the great house [That is, the fore part of the temple, called the holy place; which is here said to be great, in respect of the holy of holies, see 1 Kings 6.on verse 17.] he covered over with fir-wood; [to wit, the floor of it, but the walls were covered over with cedar-wood, 1 Kings 6.15.] then he overlaid that with good gold: and he made thereon palm-trees, and chain-work. [Heb. Chains.]
\p
\v 6 . He also overlaid the house [To wit, the rest of the floor of the temple, which was not yet covered over with fir-wood] with precious stones [as marble, or some other stone sit to make a pavement] for ornament: now the gold was gold of Parvaim. [of Havila, as is conceived, where the gold was very precious, Gen.2 12. Which David had gotten from the spoil of the kings that dwelt thereabout, and had laid it up for the building of the temple, and is likewise called close gold, 1 Kings 6 20. See the annotate. There; others understand this gold to be meant of the gold of Ophir, or Peru.]
\p
\v 7 . Besides, he overlaid at the house the beams, the posts and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof with gold, and he granted cherubims on the walls.
\p
\v 8 . Moreover, he made the house of the holy of holies, [Heb. Holiness of holinesses; That is, that most holy place of the temple which was the hinder and innermost part thereof: where the ark of the covenant and the cherubims stood, otherwise called the oracles place, because God there uttered a voice, and gave answer 1 Kings 6.5.19,20.] the length whereof according to the breadth of the house; [to wit, of the great house a little before mentioned verse 5.] was twenty ells, and the breadth thereof twenty ells: and he overlaid it with good gold, (amounting) to six hundred talents. [of the weight of a talent of gold, see Exod.25.on verse 39.]
\p
\v 9 . And the weight of the nails was unto fifty shekels of gold: [Of the value hereof, see Gen.24.on verse 22.] and he overlaid the upper chambers [these were placed on high over the porch; of which see 1 Chron.28.11.] with gold.
\p
\v 10 . He also made in the house of the holy of holies two cherubims [see Gen. 3. On verse 24. And 1 Kings 6. On verse 23] of forth-drawing work; [Heb. A work of drawing out, or lifting out; that is according to the opinion of some, a work, whose parts or pieces, or members could be taken, lifted, or drawn out one from another, which was needful to be done in respect of the greatness, and heaviness of the work: oth. A work (according to the shape) of young men, or of image-work] and he overlaid them with gold.
\p
\v 11 Concerning the wings of the cherubims, the length thereof was twenty ells: the wing of one was five ells, reaching to the wall of the house, and the other wing five ells, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.
\p
\v 12 . Likewise the wing of the other cherub was five ell, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five ells reaching to the wing of the other cherub. [See the exposition hereof, 1 Kings 6. On verse 27.]
\p
\v 13 . The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty ells: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were toward the house. [oth. Inward. Compare Exod.25.20.]
\p
\v 14 . He made also the vail [which parted or distinguished the holy place from the most holy place. See of this Exod.26.31. 1 Kings 6.21. and the annotate. Thereon] of skie-colour, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and he made cherubims thereon.
\p
\v 15 . Moreover he made for the house two pillars of five and thirty ells in length: [See 1 Kings 7.on v.15.] And the chapter that was on the head of them, was five ells.
\p
\v 16 . He also made chains, [Understand golden chains, or fillets. See of those, by which the vail hung, 1 Kin.6.21. and the annotate. Thereon] (as) in the oracle-place, [see 1 Kings 6.on v.5.] and he put them on the heads of the pillars: Besides he made an hundred pomegranates, [to wit, in each row. And there being two rows, its said, 1 Kings 7.20. that there were two hundred pomegranates] and put them between the chains.
\p
\v 17 . And he reared up the pillars before the Temple, one on the right hand, and one on the left hand; and he called the name of the right-(hand pillar) Jachin, and the name of the left-(hand pillar) Boaz. [See the exposition hereof, 1 Kings 7.on v.21.]
\c 4
\s A description of the copper altar for the burnt-offering v.1. &c. Of the molten sea, 2. Of the Lavers, 6. Of the Candlesticks, 7. Of the Tables, 8. And the courts, 9 with a relation of all the pieces that Hiram made for the use of the Temple, which were either of copper, 11. Or of Gold, 19.
\p
\v 1 He made also a copper altar, [This altar was indeed like unto the altar that was made by Moseh in the wilderness, in fashion, because it was foursquare, and in the covering, which was of copper; but not in bigness, because it was much larger: besides that was made sit to be removed, and carried from place to place, but this was made to abide standing. Compare Exod.27.1, 2.] of twenty ells in the length thereof, and twenty ells in the breadth thereof, and ten ells in the height thereof.
\p
\v 2 . Besides, he made the molten sea: [See of this, 1Kings 7.on v.23. where likewise is the exposition of this text] it was of ten ells, from the one brim [Heb. Lip] thereof to the other brim thereof round in compass, and of five ells in the height thereof, and a measuring line of thirty ells did compass it round about.
\p
\v 3 . Now under the same [To wit, the sea, meaning the brim thereof, 1 Kings 7.v.24.] was the similitude of oxen [understand this of the small images of oxen, which were under the brim at the belly of the sea, not of the great oxen, upon which the sea stood, as followeth. Compare further 1 Kings 7.on v.24.] compassing the same round about, ten in a cubit compassing the sea round about; Two rows of these oxen were cast in the casting thereof. [that is, which were cast together in one mould with this copper vessel, when it was cast.]
\p
\v 4 . It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the West, and three looking toward the South, and three looking toward the East: and the sea was above upon them; and all their hinder parts were inward. [See 1 Kings 7.on verse 25.]
\p
\v 5 . Now the thickness of it was an handbreadth, [that is, four fingers: so great is an handbreadth; called by the Latines Palmus minor; and is to be distinguished from another measure of this name called Palmus major, three times as broad, that is, a span] and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a beaker, (or) of a lily-flower, containing (many) Baths; it held three thousand.
\p
\v 6 . And he made ten Lavers, [See of these, 1 Kings 7.38. and the annotate.] and put five on the right hand, [namely, of the Court] and five on the left, to wash in them, [to wit, the flesh of the offering] what belongeth to the burnt-offering, [Hebr. The work of the burnt-offering] they put in them: [to wit, to rinse and wash the same off. The Hebrew word signifieth properly such putting in or dipping, which tendeth to washing off, or washing away, whereby the filth and dirt or slime is gotten off. Compare Isa.4 4. Ezek.40.38.] but the sea was for the Priests to wash themselves in it.
\p
\v 7 . He made also ten golden Candlesticks, according to their manner, [That is, according to the prescript, or pattern given by God, Exod.25.31. or delivered by David unto Salomon, 1 Chron.28.15.] and he set them in the Temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left hand.
\p
\v 8 . He made also ten Tables, and placed them in the Temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left hand; And he made an hundred golden sprinkling-basins.
\p
\v 9 . Furthermore, he made the court of the Priests; [See hereof, 1 Kings 6.on v.36.] and the great Court: [understand the outer Court, wherein the people assembled for the exercise of the worship of God, and to crave the help and assistance of God, which when it was done uprightly, according to the command and ordinance of God, then the help of God appeared. And hence the Hebrew appellation hath its original; as if we should say a help, or, place of help. See 1 Kings 7.v .12. and the annotate.] together with the doors of the Court, and overland the doors of them with copper.
\p
\v 10 . Now he set the sea on the right side, toward the East, over against the South.
\p
\v 11 . Moreover Huram [The craftman, whom the king of Tyre had sent to Salomon, of whom see 1 Kin.7.on v.13,14. And above chap.2.13,14. And below v.16.] made the pots, and the shovels, and the sprinkling-basin; So Huram finished the work that he made for king Salomon for the house of God.
\p
\v 12 . The two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapters, on the head of the pillars: And the two nets, to cover the two pommels of the chapters, that were upon the head of the pillars.
\p
\v 13 . And the four hundred pomegranates for the two nets: Two rows of pomegranates to each net, to cover the two pommels of the chapter, which were above upon the pillars. [Hebr. Upon the face of the pillars.]
\p
\v 14 . He made also the bases; and lavers made he upon the bases.
\p
\v 15 . One sea, [understand one sea because there was but one, wherein the priests washed themselves, and is to be distinguished from the lavers, wherein the flesh of the offerings, and what ever belonged thereunto, was washed, above v.6.] and the twelve oxen underneath.
\p
\v 16 . Likewise the pots, and the shovels, and the flesh hooks, and all their vessels did Huram Abiu [Oth. His Father, or, his Fathers. See above chap.1.on ver.13.] make for king Salomon for the house of the LORD, of polished copper.
\p
\v 17 . In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in close Earth, between Succoth, and between Zeredatha, [See the exposition of this verse, 1 Kings 7.on verse 46.]
\p
\v 18 . And Salomon made all these vessels in great abundance: For the weight of the copper was not searched.
\p
\v 19 . Salomon also made all the vessels, that were for the house of God, and the golden altar, and the tables, on which the shew-bread-(loaves) are.
\p
\v 20 . And the candlesticks with their lamps of close gold, [See of this gold, 1 Kings 6.on v.20.] that they should kindle after the manner, [that is, after the law given of God, Exod.25.31,etc. and 37.17,etc.] before the oracles-place.
\p
\v 21 . And the flowers, and the lamps, and the snuffers of gold, it was the perfectest gold: [Heb. The perfections of gold; that is, the best, finest, and purest gold.]
\p
\v 22 . Together with the forks, [See 1 Kings 7.on v.50.] and the sprinkling-basins, and the incense bowels, and the censers of close gold: Concerning the entry of the house, the inner door, thereof, of the holy of holies, and the doors of the house of the Temple were of gold. [that is, overlaid with gold: For the inner part of the doors was of wood, 1 Kings 6.31, 32, 35.]
\c 5
\s Salomon causeth all the dedicated things of his father, v.1. &c. and the ark of God, with other vessels to be brought into the temple, 2. What was in the ark, 10. Glory and praise is sung unto God, 11. Whereupon the LORD appeareth in a cloud, which filleth the house, 13.
\p
\v 1 Thus all the work that Salomon made for the house of the LORD, was finished: Then Salomon brought (in) all the hallowed things [Heb. Holinesses; that is, things hallowed to the LORD. See 1 Kings 7.on v.51.] of David his Father; and the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels, laid he among the treasures of the house of God.
\p
\v 2 . Then Salomon assembled the Eldest of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the Fathers among the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem: To bring up [To wit, into the Temple, into which they were to go up with steps, or stairs] the ark of the covenant of the LORD [the reason or ground of this appellation, see Numb.10.on vers.33.] out of the city of David, which is Zion. [Compare this relation with 1 Kings 8.1, etc. and see there the annotate. Which likewise appertaineth to this place.]
\p
\v 3 . And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the King at the feast: which was (in) the seventh month. [Called 1 Kings 8.2. Ethamim, almost agreeing with our September. See the annotate. There.]
\p
\v 4 . And all the Eldest of Israel came, and the Levites [Namely, the Priests out of the family of Levi] took up the ark. [compare 1 Kings 8.3. and below v.5. and 7Item see Num.4.on v.15.]
\p
\v 5 . And they brought up the ark, and the tent of the congregation together with all the holy vessels [Hebr. Vessels of holiness, that is, holy vessels; so called, because they were ordained for the holy use. See Lev.16.on ver.4.] that were in the Tent, these did the Priests (and) the Levites bring upwards.
\p
\v 6 . Now king Salomon, and all the Congregation of Israel that were assembled with him before the ark, offered sheep, and oxen [See of the proper signification of these words, Gen.12.on ver.26.] which could not be told, nor numbered for multitude.
\p
\v 7 . So the Priests brought the ask of the covenant of the Lord unto its place, to the oracles-place, [That is, the inner part of the Temple, forthwith in the sequel called, the holy of holies. Why it was called Oracles-place, see 1 Kings 6.on v.5.] of the house, to the holy of holies, under the wings of the cherubims. [see the annotate. On 1 Kings 6.27. and 8 6.]
\p
\v 8 . For the Cherubims spread forth both wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark, and the head-beams thereof [See of these, Exod.25.13,14,15.] from above.
\p
\v 9 . Then they shoved the head-beams further out, that the heads [That is, the outermost ends] of the hand-beams were seen from the ark [to wit, in regard the ends of the hand-beams were thence drawn forth and shoved out. See hereof further, 1 Kings 8.on v.8.] before the oracles place, but were not seen without: And it was there unto this day. [That is, until the burning of the Temple by the Babylonians.]
\p
\v 10 . There was nothing in the ark, save only the two tables, which Moseh had put (therein) at Horeb, [In the wilderness, in the camp of the Israelites, where the ark with its appurtenances was made. See likewise of this mount, Num.10.on v.33.] when the LORD made (a covenant) with the children of Israel, when they were come forth out of Egypt. [see the exposition of this ver. 1 Kings 8.on v.9.]
\p
\v 11 . And it came to pass, when the Priests went forth out of the holy place: [See 1 Kings 8.on v.10.] (for all the Priests that were found had hallowed themselves, [that is, had purified themselves according to the ordinance of the law, and prepared themselves for this solemn business of the dedication of the temple, which was done by prayers, fasting, washing of garments, abstaining from conjugal society. Compare Gen.35.2. and see the annotate. Item Exod.19.10. and the annotate.] without keeping the divisions. [understand the distinction of courses or turns, which the Priests were to observe in the executed of their office, according to the order appointed by David, 1 Chron.24. this they could not now follow in this extraordinary work wherein they were all of them to be employed.]
\p
\v 12 . And the Levites which were singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, [These were chief singers, and very wise men of the tribe of Levi, having under them many other singers, and among these their sons, etc. See of them, 1 Chron.25.1,2,etc.] and of their sons, and of their brethren, cloathed in fine linen, with cymbals, and with lutes, and harps [oth. Citherns] stood toward the East of the altar, and with them to (the number of) an hundred and twenty Priests sounding with trumpets.)
\p
\v 13 . It came to pass then, when they trumpeted, and sung with one accord, [Heb. As one, to wit, man] to cause an uniform voice to be heard, praising, and thanking the LORD; and when they lift up (their) voice with trumpets, and with cymbals, and (other) musical instruments, and when they praised the LORD, (saying) for he is good, for his mercy is for ever; [it is thought that they sung, and played upon musical instruments, the 136. Psalm; wherein the verses do end with these words. It may be also, that they sung some other Psalms besides, and thereunto added these words, as the 96. The 105. Etc. Compare 1 Chron.16.7,8,etc.] that the house was filled with a cloud, (namely) the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 14 . And the Priests could not stand minister, by reason of the cloud: For the glory of the LORD had filled the house. [See Numb.14.on v.10.]
\c 6
\s Salomon seeing the token of Gods presence in the Temple, praiseth and thanketh God, that he had fulifilled his promise made to David his Father, 4. Maketh an excellent prayer, wherein he sheweth the right use of the Temple, 12.
\p
\v 1 Then said Salomon, the LORD hath said, that he would dwell in the darkness. [See the exposition of this and the following verses, 1 Kings 8.on verse 12, etc.]
\p
\v 2 . And I have built thee an house for a dwelling-place, and a sure place for thine everlasting habitation. [That is, as long as the law should continue. See Gen.13.on v.15. Heb. For thy dwelling (in) eternities.]
\p
\v 3 . Then the King turned his face about, [To wit, toward the people] and blessed all the congregation of Israel: [Otherwise, praised (God) with all the congregation] And all the congregation of Israel stood. [to wit, in the great court to hear the Kings speech and prayer. See below ver.13. and the annotate.]
\p
\v 4 . And the he said, praised be the Lord God Of Israel, who spake with his mouth to David my Father, and hath fulfilled it with his hands, [That is, hath actually performed, as he hath spoken and promised. So below v.15.] saying;
\p
\v 5 . From that day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose [See 1 Kings 8.on v.16.] no city out of all the tribes of Israel, to build an house that my name should be there: [see 1 Kings 8.on v.16.] Neither chose (I) any man to be a leader over my people Israel. [indeed the Lord did in time past provide Princes, Judge and Levites for his people, but not like David, in whose posterity the sovereignty of Government was to continue till the coming of the Messiah, of whose everlasting Kingdom he was a type.]
\p
\v 6 . But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name should be there: And I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.
\p
\v 7 . It was also in the heart of David my Father, [That is, he found it good, and purposed. So in the sequel. Item 1 Sam.14.7. 2 Sam.7.3. 1 Chron.17.2. Heb. it was also with the heart, etc.] to build an house for the name of the LORD the God of Israel. [that is, for the LORD himself: so in the sequel. See 1 Kings 5.on v.3.]
\p
\v 8 . But the LORD said unto David my Father: Forasmuch as that was in thine heart, to build an house for my name; thou hast done well, (in) that it was in thine heart.
\p
\v 9 . Not with standing thou shalt not build that house; but thy son, which shall come forth out of thy loines, [That is, that shall be born of thy flesh and blood. See Genes.35.on vers.3.] he shall build the house unto my name.
\p
\v 10 . The Lord then hath confirmed his word, which he had spoken: For I am risen up in the room of David my Father, and I sit on the Throne of Israel, according as the LORD hath spoken, and I have built an house for the name of the LORD the God of Israel.
\p
\v 11 . And I have placed the ark there, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, which he made with the children of Israel, [Meaning the two tables of stone, wherein the ten commandments are written, as being the laws of the covenant, which God had made with the Israelites. See 1 Kings 8.on v.21.]
\p
\v 12 . And he stood before the altar of the LORD, over against all the congregation of Israel: And he spread forth his hands:
\p
\v 13 . (For Salomon had made a copper scaffold, [Understand such a scaffold as is here in this verse described by the matter of it, the greatness of it, and the place where it stood, appointed for it this end and purpose, that the king from thence might pray unto God, and speak unto the people. See hereof also, 2 Kings 11.on v.14.] and had set it in the midst of the Court, [That is, of the peoples court, called otherwise the great Court, 1 Kings 7.9, 12. See also above chap.4.on v.9.] being five ells in the length thereof, and five ells in the breadth thereof, and three ells in the height thereof, and he stood upon it, and he kneeled on his knees [this ceremony was used in prayer, as a token of the humility of the heart, wherein men are convinced, that we are not able to subsist before the Majesty of God, Psa.130.3. See of this ceremony, Ezra 9.4. Luke 22.14. Acts 20.36. Eph.3.14.] before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands towards heaven.) [see of this ceremony which the ancients used in prayer, 1 Kings 8.on v.22.]
\p
\v 14 . And he said; LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee in the heaven, nor on the earth: Keeping covenant and mercy unto thy servants, that walk before thy face with all their heart.
\p
\v 15 . Which hast kept unto thy servant David my Father, that which thou hast spoken unto him: For thou hast spoken with thy mouth, and fulfilled with thine hand, as it is this day. [Heb. according to this day; that is, as it appeareth this day, or as this day testifieth]
\p
\v 16 . And now LORD God of Israel; keep unto thy servant David my Father, that which thou hast spoken unto him, saying; (there) shall not be cut off unto thee a man, to sit upon the throne of Israel: [See 1 Kings 8.on v.25.] only if thy sons keep their way, [see 1.Kings 2.on v.4.] to walk in my law, [that is, to believe and live with all uprightness, according to the revealed word of god. So Psa.26.3. and 119.1. Compare 1 Kings 8.25. where this is called walking before the face of the LORD, and 11.33. walking in the way of the LORD. See the annotate. There] according as thou hast walked before my face.
\p
\v 17 . Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant, unto David.
\p
\v 18 . But truly, will God dwell with men on Earth? Behold, the heavens, yet the heavens of heavens cannot contein thee; how much less this house which I have built.
\p
\v 19 . Turn thy self then yet to the prayer of thy servant, [That is, to my prayer, who am thy servant: so in the sequel] and to his supplication, O Lord my God, to hearken to the cry, and to the prayer, which thy servant prayer before thy face.
\p
\v 20 . let thine eyes be open day and night upon this house, upon the place whereof thou hast said, that thou wouldest put thy name there, [That is cause his word to be taught there, his name to be called upon, his service to be performed, and his people to be assembled together for the practicing of holy duties, and his spirit to be likewise powerfully and effectually there. Compare 1 Kings 8. The annotate. On v.16.] to hearken unto the prayer, which thy servant shall pray in this place.
\p
\v 21 . Hearken then unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, who shall pray in this place: [Oth. Which they shall pray, etc.] and hear thou from the place of thy dwelling, from heaven; yea hear, and forgive.
\p
\v 22 . When any man shall have sinned against his neighbor, and he shall have laid upon him an oath of the curse, to curse himself, and the oath of the curse shall come into this house before thine altar.
\p
\v 23 . Then hear thou from heaven, and do, [To wit, according as thy justice in respect of his oath, and the cause it self shall require. See 1 Kings 8. On v.22. and in the same chapter the exposition of some things here following] and judge thy servants, rewarding the wicked, rendering his way upon his (own) head; and justifying the righteous, rendering to him according to his righteousness. [understand, according to the righteousness of his curse in his dealing with men, not according to the righteousness of his person, which no man so hath, as that he is able to stand or abide before God, Psa.130.3. and 143.2.]
\p
\v 24 . When also thy people Israel shall be smitten before the face of the Enemy, because they have sinned against thee: And shall return, and confess thy Name, and pray, and make supplication before thy face in his house.
\p
\v 25 . Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sins of thy people Israel, and bring them again into the land, which thou gavest to them, and to their Fathers.
\p
\v 26 . When the heaven shall he be shut up, that there is no rain, [Understand the lowermost heaven that is, the air, wherein the clouds are, from which the rain proceedeth Compare Gen.2.on v.6. and 1 Kings 18.45.] because they have sinned against thee, and they shall pray in this place, and confess thy name, (and) turn from their sins, when thou shalt have plagued them: [Oth. Because thou shalt have testified against them. See 1 Kings 8.on ver.35.]
\p
\v 27 . Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou shalt have taught them the good way wherein they should walk; and give rain upon thy land, which thou gavest to thy people for an inheritance.
\p
\v 28 . When there shall be famine in the land, when there shall be pestilence, when there shall be blasting, or mildew locusts, and caterpillars, when any of his Enemies shall besiege him in the land of his gates, [See 1 Kings 8.on v.37.] (or) any plague, or any sickness shall be.
\p
\v 29 . Every prayer, every application that shall be made by any man, or by all the people Israel: when they acknowledge every one his (own) plague, and his (own) grief, and every one shall spread forth his hand in this house: [Or toward this house. See 1 Kings 8.on 44. And below v.34. and 38.]
\p
\v 30 . Hear thou then from heaven, the sure place of thy dwelling, and forgive, and render to every man according to all his ways, as thou knowest his heart: For thou only knowest the heart of the children of men. [Understand this in general of all men: For the word all is added hereunto, 1 Kings 8.39.]
\p
\v 31 . That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, [See 1 Kings 11,on v.33.] all the days, that they shall live in the land, which thou hast given to our Fathers.
\p
\v 32 . Even also concerning the stranger, that shall not be of thy people Israel; but shall come from a far country, for thy great names sake, and thy strong hand, and thy stretched arm, [See Exod.6.on v.5. and 1 Kings 8.42.] when they shall come and pray in this house.
\p
\v 33 . Hear thou then from heaven, from the sure place of thy dwelling, and do according to all, that stranger shall call unto thee for; that all the nations of the Earth may know thy name, as well to fear thee, [Observe here, how that from the true knowledge of God, ariseth the true power of God; as from the fear of God is the walking in his ways, above vers.31.] as thy people Israel, [to wit, acknowledgeth thy name, and feareth thee] as to know, that thy name is named upon this house, [see 1 Kings 8.on v.43.] which I have built.
\p
\v 34 . When thy people shall go forth to war against their Enemies by the way which thou shalt send them, and shall pray toward the way of this city, which thou hast chosen, and toward this house, which I have built for thy name.
\p
\v 35 . Then hear thou from heaven their prayer, and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
\p
\v 36 . When they shall have sinned against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not) and thou shalt be angry with them, and shalt deliver them over before the face of the Enemy, that those that have taken them captive, carry them captive away into a land that is far or near at hand.
\p
\v 37 . And they shall bring again to their heart in the land, whither they are carried away captive, that they convert themselves, and make supplication unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying; we have sinned, done perversely, and dealt wickedly.
\p
\v 38 . And they convert themselves to thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their captivity, whither they [To wit, their Enemies, 1 Kin.8.48.] have carried them away captive, and shall pray [namely, to thee, O Lord, 1 Kings 8.48.] toward the way their land, which thou gavest unto their Fathers, and toward this city, which thou hast chosen, and toward this house, which I have built to thy name.
\p
\v 39 . Then hear thou from heaven, from the sure place of thy dwelling, their prayers and their supplication, and maintain their cause: and forgive thy people that they shall have sinned against thee. [Oth. What they have sinned against thee]
\p
\v 40 . Now my God, let I pray thine eyes be open, and thine ears attentive [Spoken of God after the manner of men, to shew that God takes notice of the affliction and prayers of his people] unto the prayer of this place. [To wit, which shall be made in this place, or in this temple, or those that shall make it in this place, so below, chap.7.15.]
\p
\v 41 . And now, LORD God, get the up to thy rest, [That is, to the place wherein thou hast purposed to rest, and to be quiet, and to be no more removed with the Tabernacle from one place to another, as happened in the wilderness, when the Israelites changed their camping places. This is spoken of God after the manner of men, in respect of the ark, upon which God revealed himself. See 2 Sam.7.6. Psal.132.8.] thou, and the ark of thy strength; [so Psa.132.8. By which thou usually givest thine answer concerning thy grace and help which thou powerfully shewest unto thy people] let thy Priests, LORD God be cloathed with salvation, [that is, be preserved and adorned with thy favour, blessing, and mercy, as with a garment. So Psa.132.16. The contrary is, to be cloathed with shame: In the same place v.18.] and let thy favourites [or, godly ones, the Hebrew word is attributed to God and to men. Being ascribed to God; it signifieth the favourable, gracious, and merciful one, as Psa.145.17. Jerem.3.12. it’s ascribed to godly and religious persons, because they either do good, or good is done to them by God. According to the first sence it may be translated, holy, gracious, merciful, godly, according to the second, favourites, as here] rejoice in the good. [to wit, which thou shewest to them.]
\p
\v 42 . O LORD God, turn not away. [That is, reject not, or refuse not. Compare 1 Kings 2.on v.20.] the face of thine anointed; [that is, my face, or my prayer, whom thou hast anointed to be king] remember the mercies of David thy servant. [that is, shewed to David, and in respect of him promised to his posterity.]
\c 7
\s The fire falleth from heaven, consumeth the offerings, and the glory of the LORD filleth Temple, v.1.&c. A description of the ceremonies, wherewith Salomon dedication the Temple, 4. The Feast of Leaf-huts is kept, 8. The LORD appeareth to Salomon, 12. Promiseth him his favour, on condition of obedience, 17. Else threateneth grievous judgements, 19.
\p
\v 1 Now when Salomon had made an end of praying, then the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt-offering, and the slay-offerings, [To shew openly, that God heard Salomons prayer. See the like examples of the fire falling from heaven, Lev.9.24. Judg.6.20. 1 Kings 18.38. 1 Chron.21.26.] and the glory of the LORD [understand this of the cloud, which was a token of the special presence of God. See Numb.14.on vers.10. and above chap 5.vers.13.14.] filled the house.
\p
\v 2 . And the Priests could not enter into the house of the LORD; for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 3 . And when all the children of Israel saw that fire came down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house; then they bowed with their faces to the ground on the floor, and worshipped, and praised the LORD, that he is good, that his mercy is for ever. [See above chap.5.on vers.13. and compare the following six verse of this chapter.]
\p
\v 4 . Now the KING, and all the people offered slay-offerings before the face of the LORD.
\p
\v 5 . And king Salomon offered slay-offerings [Namely, a thank-offering, as is expounded 1 Kings 8.36. of which offering, see Lev.3.on vers.1.] of oxen two and twenty thousand, and of sheep [the Hebrew word signifieth also goats, although it be for the most part used of sheep. See Gen.12.on v.16. and Levit.1.on ver.2.] an hundred and twenty thousand: So the King and all the people dedicated the house of God.
\p
\v 6 . The Priests also stood in their guards, [To wit, according to the division of their courses, which they were not able formerly to keep in the dedication of the Temple, above chap.5.11.] and the Levites with the musical instruments of the LORD, [that is, made for the honour of God, to praise and thank him therewith, according to the manner that was ordained by God, and was in use under the Law] which King David had made to praised (him) by their ministry: [Hebr. Hand Oth. By Davids songs of praise in their hand; or, when David praised (him) by them: to wit, the musical instruments] and the Priests sounded with trumpets over against them, and all Israel stood. [to wit, in the great or outer court, called the peoples court, separated from the inner court, wherein the Priests stood.]
\p
\v 7 . And Salomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: For there he had prepared the burnt-offerings, and the fat of the thank-offerings, for the copper altar, which Salomon had made, was not able to receive the burnt-offering, and the meat-offering, and the fat. [meaning of the thank-offerings. See 1 Kings 8.64. see the exposition of this verse, 1 Kings 8.64. in the annotate.]
\p
\v 8 . Also at the same time Salomon kept the feast [To wit, of Leaf-huts, or Tabernacles. See 1 Kings 8.on vers.85.] seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath, to the River of Egypt. [that is, from the north-border to the south-border of the land of Canaan. Compare Gen.15.18. and Jos.13.3,4,5. Of the city Hamath, see Gen.13.on v.21. and of the river of Egypt, called Sichor, Jos.13.3.]
\p
\v 9 . And on the eighth day [To wit, of the feast which had lasted seven days] they kept a prohibition-day: [that is, a holy day, on which all daily work was forbidden. See Lev.23.on v.36. This was called the great day of the Feast, John 7.37.] For they kept the dedication of the altar [see the signification of the word dedication, Numb.7.on v.10.] seven days, [which went before the days of the feast] and the Feast seven days.
\p
\v 10 . But on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month, [That is, the day after the prohibited-day: For this feast began with the fifteen day of the seventh month, and ended with the two and twentieth day of the same month, Levit.23.34.] he let the people go to their tents, glad and cheerful, [Heb. good of, or, in heart] for the good which the LORD had done unto David, and Salomon, and to his people Israel.
\p
\v 11 . Thus Salomon finished the house of the LORD, and the kings house: And all that came into Salomons heart, to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.
\p
\v 12 . And the LORD appeared to Salomon [To wit, immediately after the finishing and dedication of the Temple, and after the prayer which Salomon then had uttered: Whereupon then followed the building of the kings house, See 1 Kings 9.on ver.2.] by night: [to wit, in a dream. Compare 1 Kings 3.5. and 9.2. See of such divine apparitions, Gen.20.3. and 28.12. together with the annotate.] and he said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to my self for an house of offering.
\p
\v 13 . If I shut up heaven, that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts, [God is said to command the unreasonable creatures, because he appointeth, produceth, and useth them, either to punish men, as here, and Amos 9.3. or to help them, and do them good, as 1 King.17.4.] to devour the land, [that is, the increase and fruits of the land] or if I send pestilence among my people.
\p
\v 14 . And my people, upon whom my name is called, [That is, who derive their name from me, or are called by, or after me: For the godly are called the children of God, the Lords inheritance, his peculiar people. The same phrase is used, Deut.26.10. Amos 9.12.] do humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, [to seek the Lords face, is to learn to know him, as he hath revealed himself in his word, works, and tokens of his mercy, among which in the old Testament there was also the ark of the covenant. See Psa.24.6. and 27.8.] and turn from their wicked ways. Then will I hear from heaven, and forgive their sins, and heal their land. [that is, free it from all hurtful and noxious creatures, from barrenness, from pestilence, etc.]
\p
\v 15 . Now mine eyes shall be open, and my ears attentive unto the prayer of this place. [See above chap.6.on v.40.]
\p
\v 16 . For now have I chosen, and hallowed this house, that my name may be there forever; and mine eyes and my heart shall be there at all days (or perpetually.) [See the annotate. Serving for the exposition of this, and the sequel, 1 Kings 9.3, etc.]
\p
\v 17 . And as for thee, if thou shalt walk before my face, according as David thy Father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgements.
\p
\v 18 . Then will I stablish the throne of thy Kingdom, according as I have made (a covenant) with David thy Father, saying; (there) shall not be cut off unto thee a man, to rule in Israel.
\p
\v 19 . But if ye shall turn away, and forsake my statutes, and my commandments, which I have given before your face, and shall go serve other gods, and bow your selves down before them.
\p
\v 20 . Then will I pluck them up by roots out of my land, which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed to my name, will I cast away from my face, and will make it (to be) a proverb and (a) by-word among all nations.
\p
\v 21 . And this house that hath been exalted, every one that passeth by shall be astonished at it; (so) that he shall say, wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and unto this house?
\p
\v 22 . And they shall say, because they have forsaken the LORD God of their Fathers, which had brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and have laid hold on other Gods, and bowed down before them, and served them: Therefore hath he brought all that evil upon them.
\c 8
\s Salomon buildeth cities and strong holds, v.1 &c. maketh the heathen, that yet remained in the land tributary 7. The offices and places of honour he bestoweth only upon the Israelites, 9. His wife. Pharaos daughter, cometh into her habitation, 11. His ordinary and usual sacrifices, 12. His care for the service of God, 14. His navy going Ophir, 17.
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass at the end of twenty years, [Whereof he had spent seven in building the temple of the LORD, and thirteen in building his own palace] wherein Salomon had built the house of the LORD, and his (own) house.
\p
\v 2 . That Salomon built the cities, which Huram had given him; [Heb. to Salomon, given him, that is, restored to him. For Salomon had given these cities to king Huram, for an acknowledgement of the good offices that he had received from him, but Huram taking no content in them, restored them to Salomon again, who afterward repaired them, and caused them to be inhabitated by the Israelites, as the following words declared. See 1 Kings 9.11,12,13.] and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.
\p
\v 3 . Afterward that Salomon went to Hamath [See Numb.13.on v.21.] Zoba: [a country reaching from Batanea unto Euphrates. See thereof 1 Sam.14. chap.47. 2 Sam.8.3.] and he over-powered it.
\p
\v 4 . He built also Tadmor in the wilderness, [See 1 King.9.on ver.18. where it is called Tamor] and all the treasure-cities [oth. Ammunition, or, store-cities. So below v.6. See 1 Kings 9.on ver.19.] which he built in Hamath. [the land of Hamath, 1 Chron.18.3.]
\p
\v 5 . He also built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether; [See 1 Kings 9.on ver.17.] fenced cities with walls, gates, and bars.
\p
\v 6 . Together with Baalath, [See 1 Kings 9.on v.18.] and all the store-cities that Salomon had, and all the charet-cities, [see 1 Kings 9.on v.19.] and the cities of the horsemen, and whatever Salomons desire had desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Libanon, [see 1 Kings 7.on v.2.] and in the land of his dominion.
\p
\v 7 . As for all the people that were left of the Hethites, and the Amorites, and the Perezites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, [See of these nations, Gen.10.on v.15,16. And below chap.15.on v.19,20,21.] which were not Israel.
\p
\v 8 . Of their children [To wit, the children of the fore-mentioned nations] who were lift after them in the land which the children of Israel had not consumed, them did Solomon bring under a leavie, [understand servile or slavish leavie, 1 Kings 9.21. and see the annotate. The meaning is, that they were to do servile labour for the king as his bond-men. See also 1 Kings 5.on v.13,14. Oth. Did Salomon cause to come under tribute, that is, compelled them to pay tribute or taxes] unto this day.
\p
\v 9 . But of the children of Israel, them Solomon made not (to be) slaves in his work; (for they were men of war, and chief of his Captains and Commanders of his charets, and of his horsemen.)
\p
\v 10 . (Of) these then were chief of the appointed, [Understand those that were set over the workmen and labourers, to overlook their actions and labours. The Hebrew word is also used of other Governours and Rulers. See 1 Kings 4.on v.5. Oth. Forces, or, garrisons] which king Salomon had, two hundred and fifty, [see 1 Kings 9.on v.23.] which had dominion over the people.
\p
\v 11 . Now Salomon caused the daughter of Pharao to come up out of the city of David to the house which he had built for her: For he said; my wife shall not dwell in the house of David the king of Israel, because the places are holy, [That is, were to serve for a pure, peculiar, and holy use, and not for an ordinary dwelling-place of men, which might easily be able to prophane and pollute them, both with their moral and ceremonial defilements] whereunto the ark of the LORD is come.
\p
\v 12 . Then Salomon offered unto the LORD burnt-offerings upon the altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch: [Which was between the Temple and the Court of the Priests: That is, before the Temple. See 1 Kings 6.3.]
\p
\v 13 . Even Alter the task of every day, offering according to the commandments of Moseh, on the Sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set high times, [That is, in the offerings, which according to the law were to be performed on certain days, observing each day of them. Heb. in the work, or, thing of the day, or, on its day, as in the following 14. Verse. Compare Exod.5.13. 1 Kings 10.25. The meaning is, that he diligently observed and kept the set days, wherein certain offerings were to be made] three times in the year: On the Feast of unleavened (bread loaves), and on the Feast of weeks, and on the Feast of Leaf-huts.
\p
\v 14 . He also appointed, according to the manner of David his Father, [That is, which David by the instinct of the holy Ghost had ordained, 1 Chron.28.19. as also by the direction of the Prophets, below chap.29.25.] the divisions of the Priests concerning their service, and of the Levites concerning their charges, to praise (God,) and to minister before the Priests as every day required: And the porters in their divisions at every gate: [Heb. at the gate, and gate; that is, at every gate. See Gen.7.on v.2. By divisions here is meant distinct companies and courses. See of these, 1 Chron. Chapters 24. And 25. And 26. They were of the Priests and Levites. The Priests were either high Priests, or common and ordinary Priests. The Levites ministered unto the Priests, or were singers, or porters, or keepers of the treasury, or those that had the care of ordinary, or extraordinary matters] for so was the commandment of David the man of God. [see Judg.13.on v.6.]
\p
\v 15 . And they departed not [Or, there was no departing Heb. they departed not. See Job.4.on v.19.] from the commandment of the King [namely, of Salomon, who would have the ordinance of God delivered by David, and other Prophets, precisely kept] unto the Priests, and the Levites, [That is, which was given and imposed upon the Priests and Levites] concerning all (or any) matter [touching mostly the persons and offices of the service of God] and concerning the treasures. [to wit, of the Temple.]
\p
\v 16 . Thus all the work of Salomon was prepared until the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD, and until the finishing of the same; [Oth. From the day of the foundation, etc. to the finishing, etc.] (that) the house of the LORD was perfected.
\p
\v 17 . Then Salomon went to Ezeon-Geber, [A Haven lying at the Reed-sea, or Red-sea. See 1 Kings 9.on v.26.] and to Eloth [called also Elath, Deut.2.8. and 2 Kings 14.22. See there the annotat.] at the bank Red-sea, to wit, borders of the land of Edom, for the king of Edom extended his dominion unto this very place.]
\p
\v 18 . And Huram sent him by the hand of his servants, ships, [Hereby may be understood materials prepared for ships. Because a man cannot come from Tyre into the Red-sea with ships, but by a very long voyage. Compare 1 Kings 9.26,27. Others conceive that he sent indeed ships with servants to Joppa, but no ships to go to the Red-sea, and they went with Salomons servants to Ophir: [see 1 Kings 9.on vers.28.] and they fetch from thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, [there being contained under this number thirty talents, which the setting out of the ships had cost: Otherwise the clear gain was but four hundred and twenty talents, 1 Kings 9 28. See of the weight of a talent of Gold, Exod.25.on v.39.] which they brought to king Salomon.
\c 9
\s The Queen of Scheba visiteth Salomon, to hear his wisdom, v.1, &c. at which she is greatly amazed, 3. And giveth him presents, 9. Receiveth also presents from Salomon, and returneth homeward, 12. Salomons gold and revenues, 13. His targets and shields, 15. Ivory throne, 17. Golden vessels, 20. What presents were given him by the neighbor kings, 23. His power and riches, 25. His reign and death, 30.
\p
\v 1 And when the Queen of Scheba had heard (of) the fame of Salomon, she came to prove Salomon with riddles at Jerusalem, with a very heavy host, and camels bearing spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones; and she came to Salomon, and communed with him (of) all that was in her heart. [See the further exposition of this chapter, 1 Kings 10. Where this History is first described.]
\p
\v 2 . And Salomon declared to her all words; and there was nothing had before Salomon, which he declared not to her.
\p
\v 3 . Now when the Queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Salomon, and the house, which he had built:
\p
\v 4 . And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, [See 1 Kings 10.on vers.5.] and the standing of his ministers, [understand the well-ordered, worthy, and ready service, that was done to him, as he sate at table, by his courtiers. It may be also understood of his minister in general, which stood about him, or were at hand, ready to attend and wait upon his commands] and their apparel, and his cup-bearers, and their apparel, and his ascent, by which he went up into the house of the LORD; then (there) was no more spirit in her. [See 1 Kings 10.on vers.5.]
\p
\v 5 . And she said unto the King, It was a true word which I heard in my land, of thine affairs, [Hebr. Words] and of thy wisdom.
\p
\v 6 . And I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes saw (that), and behold, the half of the greatness of thy wisdom hath not been told me: thou hast exceeded the fame that I have heard. [Hebr. Thou hast added to, or, above the fame, etc.]
\p
\v 7 . Right happy are thy men, and right happy are these thy servants, that stand continually before thy face, and hear thy wisdom.
\p
\v 8 . Praised be the LORD thy God, who hath had delight in thee, to set thee on his throne, [1 Kings 10. Vers. 9. It’s said, on the throne of Israel. She conceiveth that the Israelites were Gods peculiar people, and the Kings Gods Vicegerents, and consequently that was to acknowledge God in his government to be his Sovereign, and to do right unto his people in his Name] (to be) King for the LORD thy God: [that is, so to minister unto him in such a royal estate, that his Name may be thereby magnified] because thy God loveth Israel, to set up the same [or, to establish it, or, to keep it standing] forever; therefore he made thee King over them, to do judgment and justice.
\p
\v 9 . And she gave the King an hundred and twenty talents of Gold, [see Exod.25.on vers.39.] and spices in great abundance, and precious stones; and there was no spice like unto this, [To wit, in such abundance. Compare 1 Kings 10.10.] which the queen of Sheba gave king Salomon.
\p
\v 10 . Moreover also Hurams servants, and Salomon’s servants, that brought Gold from Ophir, [See 1 Kings 9.on vers.49.] brought Algummim-wood, [called also Almuggim-wood, 1 Kings 10.11. See there the annotation] and precious stones.
\p
\v 11 . And the King made of that Algummim-wood terrises [Passage, or, galleries, having on both sides hand-leanings and under proppings, wherefore they were also called props or stays, 1 Kings 10.12.] to the house of the LORD, and to the KINGS house, [by these galleries they went from the Kings house to the house of the Lord. See 1 Kings 10. On vers.12.] as also Harps, and Lutes for the singers: the like [to wit, Algummim-wood] had not been before in the land of Israel.
\p
\v 12 . And King Salomon gave to the Queen of Scheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, besides that, which she had brought unto the King: [That is, besides that which he gave her for that, which she had presented him withal] so she turned, and went to her (own) land, she, and her servants.
\p
\v 13 . Now the weight of the Gold, that came in for Salomon in one year, was six hundred, and threescore and is talents Gold;
\p
\v 14 . Besides that which they brought in from the Mercers [See of these 1 Kings 10.on vers.15.] and the merchants; all the Kings of Arabia also, and the Princes of the same land brought Gold and silver to Salomon. [To wit, to pay their yearly tribute.]
\p
\v 15 . Besides King Salomon made two hundred targets of beaten Gold: he caused six hundred (shekels) of beaten gold [Of the common shekel of gold, see Gen.24.on vers.22.] to be weighed out forever target.
\p
\v 16 . Likewise three hundred shekels of beaten gold; he caused three hundred (shekels) of gold [Or, three pounds, or mina’s of Gold, as it is said, 1 Kings 10 17. Each pound making an hundred shekels. See there the annotate.] to be weighed out for ever shield: and the King put them in the house of the forest of Libanon. [See of this house, 1 Kings 7.2. etc. and the annotations.]
\p
\v 17 . Moreover, the King made a great ivory throne, and he overlaid it with pure gold. [Yea with the most refined. See1 Kings 10 on vers.18. where it is called close gold.]
\p
\v 18 . And the throne had six steps, and a foot-stool of gold, fastened to the throne, and leaning [Hebr. Hands] on both sides, [Hebr. Hence and thence, or, hither and thither. So in the following verse] to the sitting place; and two lions standing by the leanings.
\p
\v 19 . And twelve lions stood there on both sides, upon the six steps; the like hath not been made in any kingdom.
\p
\v 20 . Also all the drinking vessels of King Salomon were of Gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Libanon were of inclosed gold: [see 1 Kings 6.on vers.20.] silver was not accounted any thing in the days of Salomon. [These words are also thus rendered by some: there was no silver on them, for it was (not) accounted any thing in the days of Salomon.]
\p
\v 21 . For the Kings ships sailed to Tarsis, with the servants of Huram: once [The original word, which otherwise signifieth one, is also thus taken for once or one time, Exod.30 10. Jos 6 3. 2 Kings 4.35. and 6.10. Job 33.14. and 39.38.] in three years came in the ships of Tarsis, [see 1 Kings 10. On vers 22.] bringing Gold, and silver, Ivory, and Apes, and Peacocks.
\p
\v 22 . So King Salomon waxed greater then all the Kings of the earth in riches, and wisdom.
\p
\v 23 . And all the Kings of the earth, [To wit, to whom the fame of Salomons wisdom and riches was come] sought the face of Salomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.
\p
\v 24 . And they brought every man his present, silver vessels, and golden vessels, and raiment, harness, and spices: horses, and mules, each from year to year. [Hebr. The thing of the year in the year: that is, every present yearly. So 1 Kings 10.25.]
\p
\v 25 . Salomon had also four thousand stalls for horses, [How this is to be compared with 1 Kings 4 26. Where the number is fourty thousand, see the annotate. There] and charets, [understand not, that these charets were likewise four thousand in number; but the number thereof is here concealed, and is expressed, 1 Kings 10.26.] and twelve thousand horsemen; and he put them in the charet-cities, [see 1 Kings 9.on vers.19.] and with the King at Jerusalem.
\p
\v 26 . And he reigned over all the kings from the River, [Namely, Euphrates, which by way of eminency is called the River. See Genes.31.on vers.21.] to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt. [Here is the fulfilling of the Promise made to Abraham, Gen.15.18. See also 1 Kings 4.21. and the annotate. Take notice here of the borders of Palestina. The river Euphrates was the border of it, east, and northward, the land of the Philistines westward, and Egypt southward Compare Gen.15.18.]
\p
\v 27 . The King also made the silver in Jerusalem to be as stone; and the cedars he made to be as the Sycamore-trees, that are in the low grounds in abundances.
\p
\v 28 . And they brought for Salomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all those lands. [Of the toll or tribute of horses, and other wares coming out of Egypt, which Salomon raised, see 1 Kings 10.28. and the Annotat. And Above chap.1.16.]
\p
\v 29 . Now the rest of the acts [Hebr. Words] of Salomon, first, and last, are they not written in the words [That is, books, or writings] of Nathan the Prophet, [see of this Prophet 2 Sam.7.2.] and in the prophesy of Ahia the Silonite, [see of this Prophet also 1 Kings 11. 19.] and in the visions [of prophetical visions, see Gen.15. on vers.1.] of Jedi [see of this man below chap.12.15. where he is called Iddo, and 15.1. where he is called Oded] the Seer, [meaning, a Prophet, to whom God revealeth secret things by visions. See Numb.12.6. and 24.4. 1 Sam.9.9.] concerning [others, of, or, against] Jerobeam the son of Nebat? [These books or writings, to wit, of the Prophets aforementioned, contained the histories of Salomon, and Jerobeam, but are not now extant, though without prejudice to the church of God, the canonical Scripture as it is left us by God, being most perfect and entire, and able to instruct us perfectly in all that is needful to believe and do unto salvation.]
\p
\v 30 . And Salomon reigned at Jerusalem over all Israel, fourty years.
\p
\v 31 . And Salomon fell asleep with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David his father: [See 1 Kings 2.on vers.10.] and Rehabeam his son became King in his stead.
\c 10
\s Rehabeam goeth to Sichem to be made King by the people, that were there assembled, vers.1, etc. The people by means of Jerobeam request lament of their heavy burdens, 2. Rehabeam following the counsel, not of the aged, but of the young Lords, returneth a sharp answer to the people, 6. Wherefore ten Tribes revolt from him, 16. And stone Adoram his Commissioner, but himself fleeth to Jerusalem, 18.
\p
\v 1 And Rehabeam went to Sichem: [See Gen.12.on vers.6.] for all Israel was come to Sichem , to make him King. [The further exposition of this Chapter is to be found 1 Kings 12. Where this History is first described.]
\p
\v 2 . Now it came to pass when Jerobeam the son of Nehat heard (that), (now the same was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the face of King Salomon:) [For fear of Salomon, who sought to kill him: perhaps because he had heard of the prophesy of Ahia, 1 Kings 11.40.] that Jerobeam returned out of Egypt: [to wit, not presently as soon as he had heard that Salomon was dead, but when he was sent for by the Israelites. See 1 Kings 12.2,3. And here the following verse.]
\p
\v 3 . For they sent [To wit, messengers] and caused him to be called: so Jerobeam came with all Israel, and spake unto Rehabeam, saying:
\p
\v 4 . They father made our yoke hard: [Understand this of the civil burdens; for they were sain to bring in to King Salomon his revenues, who held a very costly and sumptuous Court. See 1 Kings 4.7, etc. and especially vers.22, and 23.] now then, make thou thy fathers hard service, and his heavy yoke, that he hath laid upon us, lighter: [Hebr. Ease, or, lighten (somewhat) of thy fathers hard service, and of his heavy yoke. So below vers.9. This may also be thus translated, lessen, or, diminish of the hard service of thy father: and so in the sequel] and we will serve thee.
\p
\v 5 . And he said unto them; Come again unto me after three days; and the people departed.
\p
\v 6 . And Rehabeam consulted with the eldest, that had stood before the face of Salomon his Father, when he was alive, saying; How do ye advise to answer this people?
\p
\v 7 .And they spake unto him, saying; If thou shalt be kind [Hebr. For good, or, to the good: that is, prone or inclined to goodness, kindness, and mercifulness. Compare Nehem.5.19. Psalm 86 17.] and be favourable toward them, and speak good words unto them; then will they for all days (or forever) [that is, as long as thou livest] be thy servants.
\p
\v 8 . But he forsook the counsel of the eldest, which they had counseled him: and he advised with the young men, that were grown up with him, that stood before his face. [These young Lords must needs have been of a reasonable age, seeing Rehabeam, with whom they were grown up, was one and fourty years old, when he came to the Crown, 1 Kings 14.21. and below chap.12.13.]
\p
\v 9 . And he said unto them; What Advice give ye, that we may answer this people, that spake unto me, saying; Make the yoke, which thy father hath laid upon us easier?
\p
\v 10 . And the young men that were grown up with him, spake unto him, saying; Thus shalt thou say unto that people, which spake unto thee, saying; Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter upon us; thus shalt thou speak; My least (finger) shall be thicker than my fathers loins. [See the exposition 1 Kings 12.on vers.10.]
\p
\v 11 . Now if my father hath caused a heavy yoke to be laden upon you, then will I besides your yoke yet add thereunto; my father hath chastisied you with whips; [See 1 Kings 12. On vers.11.] but (I will chastise you) [these words are here and below vers.14. inserted out of whips, that have sharp and crooked hooks, to tear and rent the flesh most cruelly in pieces, as the Scorpions with their crooked and sharp tails do give most deadly wounds. See a further exposition of these words 1 Kings 12.on vers.11.]
\p
\v 12 . So Jerobeam, and all the people came to Rehabeam, on the third day; according as the King had spoken, saying; Come again unto me on the third day.
\p
\v 13 . And the King answered them, [To wit, the people, that with Jerobeam were come to the King, 1 Kings 12.13.] roughly: for King Rehabeam forsook the counsel the eldest. [Namely, which they had given him, as is said, 1 Kings 12.13. and see the counsel above vers.7.]
\p
\v 14 . And he spake to them after the advice of the young men, saying; My father made your yoke heavy, but I will yet add thereunto: my Father chastised you with whips, but I (will chastised you) with Scorpions.
\p
\v 15 . So the King hearkened not unto the people: for this turning about was of God, [The Hebrew word Nesibbah, which we have here, is according to the opinion of some, of the same signification with Sibbah, which is used, 1 Kings 12.15. as they are both of one Root. They both signify wheeling about, going about, turning about;item, cause. Understand then by this turning about the work that here came to pass, whereby the Israelites turned themselves about from the house of David; for as much as the cause of it was in Gods just Judgement, punishing the sins of men. See the exposition hereof further, 1 Kings 12.on vers.15.] that the LORD might confirm his word, which he had spoken by the ministry [Hebr. Hand] of Ahia the Silonite, to Jerobeam the son of Nebat.
\p
\v 16 . When all Israel [To wit, excepting the tribe of Juda, and the Israelites that resorted under it; of whom is spoken in the following verse] saw it, that the king hearkened not unto them; then the people answered the king; [the Hebrew word is likewise taken for answering, without having the word dabar added to it, Job.13.21. and 33.32. but it is found joined with it, 1 Kings 12.16.] saying; what portion have we in David? Yea (we have) no inheritance in the son of Isai: Every one man to your tents, O Israel; now O David provide for thine (own) house; so all Israel went to their tents.
\p
\v 17 . But concerning the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Juda, Rehabeam reigned also over them.
\p
\v 18 . Then King Rehabeam sent Hadoram [Called also Adoram, 1 Kings 12,18. Item (according to the opinion of some) Adoniram, 1 Kings 4.6.] that was over the tribute, [understand the personal tribute, or tax, whereof see 1 Kings 5.13,14. This man was sent by the King to appease the angry Israelites, and to reduce them to the obedience of the house of David] and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died: But king Rehabeam encouraged himself, to get up into a charet, that he might flee to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 19 . So the Israelites revolted from the house of David unto this day. [That is, which revolting and treacherous dealing conitueth still even to this day, to wit, when is was written.]
\c 11
\s Rehabeam attempteth to make war upon the Israelites v.1. &c. but he is forbidden to do it from God by Semaja the Prophet, 2. He buildeth strong holds, which he furnisheth with all manner of store, 5. Receiveth, and entertaineth the Priests and Levites, who forsook Israel because of Jerobeams idolatry, 13. He taketh many wives and concubines, by whom he getteth many children, 18. Whom he maketh Governours of his fenced cities, 23.
\p
\v 1 Now when Rehabeam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered (of) the house of Juda, [i.e. of the tribe of Juda. See 1 Kings 15.on vers.27.] and Benjamin, [understand that part of this tribe, which followed the tribe of Juda] an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen (men) exercised in war, [or, practicing war; Hebr. Making war] to fight against Israel, that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehabeam. [see the further exposition of this chapter, 1 Kings 12.21, etc.]
\p
\v 2 . But the word of the LORD came to Semaja the man of God, [i.e. Prophet. See Judg.13.on ver.6.] saying;
\p
\v 3 . Speak unto Rehabeam the son the son of Salomon, the king of Juda; and to all Israel in Juda and Benjamin, [That is, that dwelt in Juda and Benjamin, and were Rehabeam subjects, called, 1 Kings 12.23. the remanant of the people.]
\p
\v 4 . Thus saith the LORD; ye shall not march up, nor fight against your brethren, [Namely, the children of Israel; which exposition is expressed, 1 Kings 12.24. They are called brethren that are of one nation and people, Exod.2.11. Lev.10.6. Deut.5.12. Rom.9.3.] return every man to his house; for this thing is done of me: [see 1 Kings 12.on v.15.] and they hearkened to the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jerobeam.
\p
\v 5 . Now Rehabeam dwelt at Jerusalem; [The metropolis, or chief city of his kingdom] and he built cities for strong holds [understand this principally of the fortifying of those cities, which were built before. So bel.chap.14.6. and 16.1,5.] in Juda. [that is, in that part of the land that yet sided with him, and remained under his jurisdiction, as especially the tribe of Juda, under which was also be reckoned a part of Simeon and of Benjamin.]
\p
\v 6 . Now he built Bethlehem, [Lying in the tribe of Juda, and therefore called Bethlehem Juda, Mat.2.5,6. Distinguished from another Bethlehem lying in Zebulon, Jos.19.15. See Gen.35.on v.19. where this Bethlehem in Juda is also called Ephrata] and Etam, [a city in Simeon, about the west –border of the tribe of Juda, 1 Chron.4.31.32.] and Tekoa. [this city and the three following lay in Juda. See of these four, Jos.12.15. and 15.35,58. 2 Sam.14.2. 1 Chron.2.24. 45.]
\p
\v 7 . And Beth-Zur, and Socho, and Adullam.
\p
\v 8 . And Gath, [See of this city 1 Kings 2.on v.39.] and Maresa, [This city, and the four following lay in Juda. See of them Jos.10.10. and 15.24. 2 Kings 14.19. 1 Chron.2.42. and 4.21. Jer.34.7.] and Ziph.
\p
\v 9 . And Adoraim, and Lachis, and Azeka.
\p
\v 10 . And Zora, [We read of one Zora in the tribe of Juda, Jos.15.33. and of another in Dan, Josh.19.41.] and Ajalon, [there were also more cities of this name, but understand here an Ajalon in Benjamin and appertaining to the Kingdom of Juda. Compare Jos.19.42. 2 Chron.8.13.] and Hebron, [see Gen.23.on v.2.] which were in Juda, and in Benjamin the fenced cities.
\p
\v 11 . And he fortified these strong-holds, and put Captains therein, [understand Governours, and Commanders, to whom he commited the keeping of those cities: and the land lying under them and about them: against all hostile invasion thereunto he chose his sons. See below ver.23.] and stored of victual, and oil, and wine.
\p
\v 12 . And in every city [Heb. all (or every) city and city. See Gen.7.on v.2.] shields, and spears, [understand all manner of weapons or instruments of war, as well for offence as defence] and fortified them exceedingly; so Juda and Benjamin were on his side.
\p
\v 13 . Moreover, the Priests, and the Levites that were in all Israel, [That is, which with their habitations were spread over all the dominion and kingdom of Jerobeam] restored to him out of all their borders.
\p
\v 14 . For the Levites left their suburbs, and their possession, and came into Juda, and into Jerusalem: For Jerobeam and his sons had cast them off from administering the Priest-hood unto the LORD. [Compare 1 Kings 12 27, etc.]
\p
\v 15 . And he had ordained him Priests for the high places, [To wit, which he had caused to be reared up to the honour and service of Idols, 1 Kings 12.31. Of the high places, see Lev.26.on ver.30.] and for the devils, [see Lev.17.on vers.7.] and for the calves, [see 1 Kings 12.28,29. And the annotate.] which he had made.
\p
\v 16 . Also after them [Namely, the Levites, of whom is spoken in the foregoing 14.verse] came out of all the tribes of Israel unto Jerusalem, those that gave their heart, to seek the LORD the God of Israel, [that is, to learn to know him aright, to worship him purely, to call upon him servently, to obey him faithfully, and in all these to persevere constantly, to live with him forever hereafter. See below chap.15.2,12,15. Psa.69.33. Jerem.50.4. Amos 5.4.] to offer sacrifice unto the LORD the God of their Fathers.
\p
\v 17 . SO they Strengthened the kingdom of Juda, and made Rehabeam the son of Salomon strong three years; for three years [After which time they forsook the LORD. See below chap.12.1.] they walked in the way of David, [see 1 Kings 15.on ver.26.] and Salomon. [the praise of piety is here attributed to Salomon in respect of the first years of his reign, or also in respect of the end of it: For it is conceived that before his death he turned from his sins and vanities, and for proof thereof seemeth to have written in his old age the book that is called Ecclesiastes, or, the Preacher. Consider especially the two last verses of the last chapter.]
\p
\v 18 . And Rehabeam took him, besides [Of this word see 1 Kings 11.on vers.1.] Mahalath, the daughter of Jerimoth, the son of David, to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliah [called also Elihu, 1 Chron.27.18.] the son of Isai.
\p
\v 19 . Which bare him sons; Jeus, and Semaria, and Zaham.
\p
\v 20 . And after her he took Maacha [Called also Michaja, below chap.13.2.] the daughter of Absalom: [understand not King Davids son; for he died without leavening any children behind, but a certain man of Gibea, otherwise called Uriel, below chap.13.2.] this (woman) bare him Ahia, and Atthai, and Ziza, and Selomith.
\p
\v 21 . And Rehabeam loved Maacha the daughter of Absalom above all his wives, and his concubines, [See Gen.22.on vers.24.] for he had taken eighteen wives, and threescore concubines: And he begat eight and twenty sons, and threescore daughters.
\p
\v 22 . And Rehabeam made Ahia the son of Maacha an head, to be a Ruler among his brethren: [Wherein he offended against the law, Deut.21.15,16. Abia was not the first-born, as he seemeth not to have been, v.19. of this chapter, unless he had a special command from God by some Prophet to do this; whereof nothing is recorded] for it was to make him King.
\p
\v 23 . And he dealt understandingly, (so) that he dispersed of all his sons thorough out all lands of Juda, and Benjamin, in all the fenced cities [Heb. he understood and dispersed, etc. to wit, being afraid of further revolt] to whom he gave victual in abundance; [to wit, to his sons, that they might not change or burden the people] and he desired a multitude of wives. [understand that either he desire many wives of the parents of them for his children, or also that he for his own part was prone and enclined to a multitude and plurality of wives.]
\c 12
\s Rechabeam forsaking the law of God, is warred against by Sisak King of Egypt, v.1, &c. He humbling himself with his Princes, is preserved in his Kingdom, 5. But bereaved of the treasures of the Temple, and of his Royal palace, 9. He causeth copper shields to be made, in the room of the golden ones that Sisak had taken away, 10. For what cause God did still in some manner spare Juda and Jerusalem, 12. Rehabeams reign and death, 13. Ahia his son becometh King, 16.
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass, when Rechabeam had established the Kingdom, and he was grown strong, [To wit, after three years, wherein he had walked after Davids and Salomons example. See above chap.11.17.] that he forsook the law of the LORD, [that is, fell from the true doctrine, pure religion, and upright conversation, prescribed by the law of God. Compare Deu.32.15. 1 Kings.18.18. above chap.7.19. and 13.11. Job.6.14. Prov.2.13. Jos.1.4. Jer.21.13,etc.] and all Israel with him. [that is, Juda, and all the Israelites that appertained to Juda. See 1 Kings 12.on v.17. For the Other tribes were formerly by Jerobeam brought to revolting. Not with standing this apostasy or backingsliding is so to be understood, that God yet had his chosen remnant, consisting of Prophets, as Ahia, Semaja, Jeddo, and some of the Priests, Levites, and people, who gave ear to the Prophets, kept themselves pure and clean from the pollutions of Idolatry. See below v.12.]
\p
\v 2 .Therefore it came to pass in the fifth year of King Rehabeam, that Sisak King of Egypt marched up against Jerusalem; [See 1 Kings 14.25.] (for they had transgressed against the LORD.) [see of their abominable sins committed against the first and second table, 1 Kings 14.23,24.]
\p
\v 3 . With a thousand, and two hundred charets, and threescore thousand horsemen: And there was no number of the People that came with him out of Egypt, Lybians, of the people that came with him out Egypt. See of them alsoDan.11.43. Nahum.3.9.] Suchites, [otherwise called Troglodites, also a people in Africa] and Moors. [Heb.Cuschim, the Cusites: That is, the Moors and Arabians. See Gen.10.on v.6.]
\p
\v 4 . And he took the fenced cities that Juda had: [Compare above chap.11.5.] and he came unto Jerusalem.
\p
\v 5 . Then came Semaja the Prophet [See of this Prophet also, 1 Kings 12.22. and the annotate.] to Rehabeam; and the Governours of Juda that were gathered together to Jerusalem, because [or, by reason. Heb. from the face. Oth. For fear] of stick: And he said unto them, thus saith the LORD: ye have forsake me, therefore I have also left you in the land of Sisak.
\p
\v 6 . Then the chief men of Israel, [That is, of the Israelites, that were under the dominion of Rehabeam] and the King humbled themselves; [to wit, acknowledging with the heart, and confessing with the mouth the wickedness and iniquity of their sins, and the justice of Gods punishment] and they said, the LORD is righteous.
\p
\v 7 . Now when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Semaja, saying; they have humbled themselves, (therefore) I will not destroy them, but I will shortly [Or, after a little, to wit, while: SO Job 32.22. Psa.2.19. and 81.15. or, a small deliverance, or some little thing (tending) to deliverance] give them escaping, [That is, deliverance] (so) that my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Sisak. [that is, my wrath shall not proceed so far, that Jerusalem should be destroyed, and the people carried away captive, as at length came to pass by Nebuchadnezer King of Babel, 2 Kings 25. Below chap.36. Jerem.52. Oth. Shall not drop; that is, shall not last or continue long.]
\p
\v 8 . Never the less they shall be his servants; [That is, they shall be sain to yield up the city him, pay ransom, suffer him to carry away what so ever he will, and receive such terms of peace, as he shall be pleased to allow them] that they may discern my service, and the service of the Kingdoms of the lands. [or, earthly Kingdoms. To wit how happy the state and condition of those is, that serve and obey me according to my word; and no the contrary, how grievous and miserable a thing it is, to serve the idolatrous and tyrannical Kings of the earth, after their covetous and ambitious desire.]
\p
\v 9 . So Sisak King of Egypt marched up against Jerusalem, and he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the Kings house; [To wit, it being (as it seemeth) permitted hi by the King and the people to take them as the cities ransom, that they might not be taken by force of arms, and plundered] he took all away: [see 1 Kings 14.on vers.26.] he took away also all the golden shields that Salomon had made.
\p
\v 10 . And King Rehabeam made in the room of them copper shields: And he committed (them) under the hand of the chief of the guard [See 1 Kings 14.on vers.27.] that kept the door of the Kings house.
\p
\v 11 . And it came to pass, when the King entred into the house of the LORD, that the guard came, and carried them, [To wit, the shields] and brought them again into the guard-chamber. [see 1 Kings 14.on verse 28.]
\p
\v 12 . And when he [To wit, the King] humbled himself, [by testifying his sorrow, and repentance] the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he might not utterly destroy (him:) (there) were also good things in Juda. [As, 1. The Law of Moses. 2. The word of the Prophets. 3. Circumcision.4. Somewhat of the pure worship of Gd.5 There were some true believers, and godly people, that had not corrupted their way: for which things all, the Lord yet spared the city; as he would have spared Sodom, had there been but ten righteous persons in it, Gen.18.32. Compare herewith above the Annotat. On vers.1.]
\p
\v 13 . SO King Rehabeam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehabeam was one and fourty years old, when he became King, and reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city, which the LORD had chosen out of all the Tribes of Israel, to put his Name there; [See 1 Kings 8.on vers.29.] and his mothers name was Naamah, an Ammonitess.
\p
\v 14 . And he did that which was evil, because he settled not his heart to seek the LORD. [Although man be not able to do this by the strength of Nature, but onely by the grace of regeneration, Jerem.31.18. Matth 7. Vers.18. John 15.5. yet he is bound to do it, and liable to punishment, when he doth it not, because the fault is in him, that he doth it not, nor can do it. Of the phrase, seeking the Lord, see above chap.11.on vers.16.]
\p
\v 15 . Now the acts of Rehabeam, first, and last, are they not written in the words, [Others, in the books, or, in the book. See above chap.9on vers.22.] and Iddo the Seer, [see above chap.9.on vers.29.] relating the genealogies: [Others, in the relation of the genealogies, or, in the genealogies, that is, in the book describing the generations or pedigrees of Kings, called the History of the Prophet Iddo, below chap.13.22.] besides, the wars of Rehabeam, and Jerobeam, [that is, are not also in these words written the wars, etc.] in all their days? [That is, which lasted all their life-time. Or, and the wars of Rehabeam, and Jerobeam were all (their) days: that is, as long as they lived.]
\p
\v 16 . And Rehabeam fell asleep with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abia [otherwise called Abiam, 1 Kings 14.31. and 15.1, etc.] his son reigned in his stead.
\c 13
\s Ahia warreth against Jerobeam King of Israel, v.1, etc. setteth forth the justiness of his cause, 4. Trusting in God, getteth the victory, 13. Ahia’s wives, and children, 21.
\p
\v 1 In the eighteenth year of King Jerobeam, Ahia became King over Juda.
\p
\v 2 . He reigned three years at Jerusalem; and his mothers name was Michaja, [Above chap.11.20. called Maacha] the daughter of Uriel [he was also called Absalom, above chap.11.20. See there the annotations, and distinguish between this Uriel and another of the same name, that was a Levite, 1 Chron.15.11.] of Gibea: [divers cities have had this name, and that from the height of the place, on which they were built, (for Gibea Hebr. Gibhah signifieth an hill:) but some conceive that here is spoken of Gibea in Benjamin; of which see Judges 20.4,5,10,20.] and there was war between Ahia, and between Jerobeam.
\p
\v 3 . And Ahia bound on the battle [See of the meaning of this word, 1 Kings 20.on vers.14.] with an host of warlike champions, four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jerobeam set the battle in aray against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, valiant champions.
\p
\v 4 . And Ahia gat him up from above the mountain [The sense or meaning seemeth to be this, that he being on the top of the mountain, came somewhat lower down, that he might be the better heard and understood by Jerobeam, and his people] Zemeraim, [it is conceived, that this mountain lay on the South border of Ephraim, as it bordereth on Benjamin, and hath its name from a city the same name, unless the city should have its name from the mountain. See Josh.18.22.] which is in mount Ephraim, and he said; Hearken to me, Jerobeam, and all Israel.
\p
\v 5 . Ought ye not to know, that the LORD the God of Israel gave the Kingdom over Israel to David forever, [See 2 Sam.7.on vers.13.] to him, and to his sons, by a covenant of salt? [That is, an everlasting, and never failing covenant, which perisheth not: as that which is sprinkled and rubbed over with Salt, doth not easily perish or decay. See Numb.18.19. and the Annotat.]
\p
\v 6 . Not wit standing Jerobeam the son of Nebat the servant of Salomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his LORD.
\p
\v 7 . Besides, vain men, [See Judges 10.on vers.4.] children of Belial, [that is, wicked Varlets, lewd and licentious Rascal, who not onely do no good to any man, but also will not live under any Laws. See Deut.13.on vers.13.] have gathered themselves to him, and have strengthened themselves against Rehabeam the son of Salomon, when Rehabeam was young, [to wit, in mind, heart, and courage, as the following words declare. The meaning is, that he was no warrior, or expert man: compare Eccles.10.16. Otherwise, in respect of Age he was one and fourty years old, when he came to the Crown, above chap.12.on vers.13.] and tender hearted, (so) that he could not strengthen himself against them.
\p
\v 8 . And now, ye think [Hebr. Ye are saying: to wit, within your selves. See Genes.20.on vers.11. and 1 Kings 5.on vers.5.] to strengthen your selves against the Kingdom of the LORD, [understand the Kingdom of Juda, whereof the Lord is the author and protector] (which) is in the hand of the sons of David: ye are indeed a great multitude; but ye have golden calves with you, [it may seem by these words, that they had brought the golden calves with them into the camp, as formerly the Ark of the Covenant was brought into the Camp, 1 Sam.4.3,4,5, etc.] which Jerobeam made you for Gods.
\p
\v 9 . Have ye not driven out the Priests of the LORD the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you Priests like unto the Nations of the lands? Every one, that cometh to fill his hand [That is, to put and consecrate himself into the Priests Office. See Lev.7.on vers.37.] with a young bullock? [Hebr. With a son of the bullock: that is, in a manner, which is devised by thee, and not instituted by God] and seven Rams, that same is a Priests of them, that are no Gods.
\p
\v 10 . But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsake him: and the Priests that minister unto the LORD, are the sons of Aaron; and the Levites are (employed) in the work. [To wit, in that work, which is prescribed them in the Law of God.]
\p
\v 11 . And they [To wit, the Priests] do kindled before the LORD burnt-offerings, every, morning, and every evening [Hebr. In morning in morning, in evening in evening: So in the sequel; that is, every morning, and every evening. See this phrase Gen.7.2. and the Annotations] also incense of sweet-smelling spices, [see hereof Exod.30.34, etc.] besides, the disposing of the bread [meaning, the Shew-bread, whereof see Lev.24.5. etc.] upon the pure Table, [see of this Table, Exod.25.23,etc.it is called pure, because it was overlaid with pure Gold, Exod.25.24.] and the golden Candlestick, [see of this, Exod.25.31, etc.] and the lamps thereof, to cause (them) to burn every evening, [according to the Law, Lev.24 2,3, etc. 2,3, etc] for we observe the charge of the LORD our God: [see Lev.8.on vers.35.] but ye have forsake him. [See above chap.12.on ver.1.]
\p
\v 12 . Therefore behold, God is with us at the top, [Hebr. In, or, at the head; that is, in the front, in the battalia. See Deut.20 9. MIch.2.13. Others, for an head; that is, for a Captain and Protector] and his Priests with sounding trumpets, [see of the use of these trumpets in war, Numb.10.9.] to sound and alarm against you: O children of Israel, fight not against the LORD God of your fathers: [see Gen.26.on vers.24. So below vers.18.] for ye shall not prosper.
\p
\v 13 . But Jerusalem caused an ambushment to turn about, for to come behind them: [Namely, those of Juda. This ambushment consisted of a part of his forces, which had hid themselves close in the field, to fall upon those of Juda unawares in the war] so they [namely, the camp of the Israelites] were before the face of Juda, and the ambush (was) behind them. [namely, those of Juda]
\p
\v 14 . Now when Juda looked back, behold, they had the battle before and behind; and they cried unto the LORD: and the Priests sounded with the Trumpets. [To wit, to hearten on those of Juda, and to excite and stir them up to manly courage.]
\p
\v 15 . And the men of Juda sounded an alarm: and it came to pass, when the men of Juda sounded an alarm; that God smote Jerobeam, and all Israel, [That is, discomsited them, or gave them the overthrow. So 1 Sam.4 2. Below chap.14.12. Or plagued them with terror, astonishment, confusion, or, otherwise] before Ahia, and Juda.
\p
\v 16 . And the children of Israel fled before the face of Juda, and God gave them into their hand.
\p
\v 17 . Ahia then, and his people smote them with a great blow; [That is, with a great overthrow of them. So Josh.10.10. 1 Kings 20.21. This phrase is also used of other sore judgements, whereby God, beside the cause of war, slayeth many people at once, as Numb.11.33. 1 Sam.19.] for of Israel (there) fell (down) slain five hundred thousand chosen men.
\p
\v 18 . Thus the children of Israel were humbled [That is, pressed down, and brought under. So Judges chap.8.28. Psalm. 106. Vers.42, etc.] at that time, and the children of Juda grew mighty, because they had relied on the LORD God of their fathers.
\p
\v 19 . And Ahia pursued after Jerobeam, and took the cities from him, Bethel, [See of this city Gen.12.on vers.8. Here Jerobeam had set up one of the golden calves, 1 Kings 12.29.] with her dependent places, [Hebr. Daughters. So Numb.21.25,29,32. And in the sequel] and Jesana, with her dependent places, and Ephron, [lying in the Tribe of Benjamin, called also Phra, Josh.18.23.] with her dependent places.
\p
\v 20 . And Jerobeam retained no strength more [To wit, to war against Ahia] in the days of Ahia: but the LORD smote him, that he died. [it seemeth that Jerobeam after this over throw had a long continuing sickness, whereof he at length died in the second year of King Asa’s reign. Others, undertstand this Abia, who reigned but three years, above vers.2. so that he did not live long after this victory, below chap.14.1.]
\p
\v 21 . So Ahia strengthened himself; and he took unto him fourteen wives; [To wit, some while he was King, and some before, while his fathers was yet alive] and begat two and twenty sons, and sixteen daughters.
\p
\v 22 . Now the rest of the acts of Ahia, both his ways, [That is, his deeds and works] and his words; are written in the history of the Prophet Iddo. [See 2 Chron.9.on vers.29.]
\c 14
\s After the death of Ahia Asa his son becometh King, v.1,etc. He destroyeth idolatry, and restoreth the pure worship of God, 2. Having peace he fortifieth his cities, and furnisheth himself with store of men, 6. Being in a strait by reason of Zera the Ethiopian, he crieth unto God, and smitteth an huge camp, with many cities, 9.
\p
\v 1 So Ahia fell asleep with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son become King in his stead: in his days the land was quiet ten years. [Understand this of the first years of this Kings reign, wherein he was let alone, and unmolested by the heathenish Nations, although there was enmity between him and Baeza the King of Israel, which indeed might occasion jars and fallings out on both sides, but did not break out in open war. See below vers 6. And compare 1 Kings 15. The Annotations on vers. 16.]
\p
\v 2 . And Asa did that which was good, and right in the eyes of the LORD his God. [See 1 Kings 11. On vers.33. But understand this commendation here wholly of the reforming of religion that was fallen to decay. So below chap.25.2. and 26.4.]
\p
\v 3 . For he took away the altars of the strangers, [To wit, either Nations that worshipped idols, which those of Juda did imitate: or Gods, which they worshipped after the manner of the heathen, and are called Dung-Gods, 1 Kings 15.12.] and the high places: and brake (down) the images reared up; and cut down the groves.
\p
\v 4 . And he said unto Juda, [That is, caused it to be told, or to be charged upon all the Subjects of his Kingdom] that they should seek the LORD the God of their fathers, and that they should do the Law and the Commandment. [That is, that they should keep and practice that which was commanded in the Law. Compare Josh.22.5. and below chap.31.21.]
\p
\v 5 . Also he took away out of all the cities of Juda the high places, [See Lev.26.on vers.30.] and the Kingdom was quiet before him. [Hebr. Before his face: that is, under his conduct, or, for his own good, and welfare, or, while he thus reigned, for he had restored and reformed that pure Religion in his land, which establisheth the throne of Kings.]
\p
\v 6 . Moreover, he built fenced cities, [Hebr. Cities of defence, or, strength. The meaning is, that he inclosed some open cities, and made weak ones strong. Compare above chap.11.5.] in Juda: for the land was quiet, and there was no war in those years against him, because the LORD gave him rest.
\p
\v 7 . For he said unto Juda; Let us build these cities [The word these intimateth, that the cities here mentioned, were yet in being, and that consequently the building of them is to be understood of their fortifying, as the following words do also import] and make about them walls, and towers, doors, and bars, whilest the land is yet before our face; [That is, whilest we may yet peaceable possess and enjoy the land. Compare Gen.13.on vers.9.] for we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought (him,) and he hath given us rest round about: so they built, and prospered.
\p
\v 8 . Now Asa had an army of three hundred thousand (men) out of Juda, bearing target and spear, and two hundred and fourscore thousand out of Benjamin, bearing shield, and bending the bow: [Hebr. Treading the bow; that is, with the foot, which weapon or instrument of war, we yet at this day call the Foot-bow. See 1 Chron,5.18. and 8. On vers.40.] all these were valiant champions. [That is, warlike and valiant Souldiers. It seemeth that Asa gathered and prepared these forces, when he understood that the King of the Ethiopians intended to set upon him.]
\p
\v 9 . And Zerah the Moor, [Or, Arabian. Heb. Cuschi. See Num.12.on v.1.] came out against them, with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred charets: And he came to Maresa. [a city lying in the tribe of Juda. See above chap.11.on v.8.]
\p
\v 10 . Then Asa marched forth against him: And they set the battle in aray in the valley of Zephata [Oth. Towards Zephath. See Judg.1.on vers.17.] by Maresa.
\p
\v 11 . And Asa cryed unto the LORD his God, and said; LORD, it is nothing with thee to help whether him that is mighty, or him that is impotent: [Or, it matters not with thee to help the mighty one, or him that is without power: or, it is nothing with thee to help the impotent (one), coming between him that is mighty; that is, setting thy self against him. Or thus: It is not with thee to help, &c. Heb. between the mighty one, him that hath no power] help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name [that is, according to thy will, under thy conduct, in confidence of thy help, to thy glory. See 2 Kings 2.on vers.24.] are we come against this multitude: O LORD, thou art our God, let not mortal man prevail [or, have the upper hand] against thee. [That is, against thy people. Evil done to the people of God, is done to God himself, Zach.2.8. Acts 9.5.]
\p
\v 12 . And the LORD plagued the Moors before Asa, and before Juda: And the Moors fled.
\p
\v 13 . Now Asa, and the people that were with him, pursued them unto Gerar; [See of this city, Gen.20.on v.1.] and there fell (so many) of the Maors, that there was no rallying for them; [Heb. no making alive, or, liveness; that is, strength to recover themselves, and to rally again together, that they might reiterate, or reassume the batter. So it is said: And Joab made the rest of the city alive, 1 Chron.11.8. see the annotate. There] for they were broken before the LORD, and before his camp; and they [to wit, those of Juda] carried (away) very much spoil from thence.
\p
\v 14 . And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the terror of the LORD was upon them: [That is, a very great terror sent by God, fell upon them. Compare chap.35.v.5. and see the annotate. Thereon. So below chap.17.10. and 20.29.] and they spoiled all the cities, because there was much spoil in them.
\p
\v 15 . And they smote also the tents [That is, the inhabitants of tents. Understand the Arabians that dwelt in tents on the borders of the Edomites and Philistines, whither the Moors being beaten, perhaps were fled. Or it may be understood of the Arabians themselves, 1 Chron.4 41.] of cattle, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels: and returned to Jerusalem.
\c 15
\s Azaria the Prophet exhorteth Asa and the people, to go on in the Reformation of Religion already begun, v.1. &c. which exhortation they obey, 8. And renew the covenant with the Lord, 12. Asa deposeth Maacha his mother from her regency, because of her idolatry, 16. He bringeth the hallowed things again into the Temple, 18. The land hath rest, 19.
\p
\v 1 Then the spirit of God came upon Azaria the son of Oded. [A Prophet, called before (according to the common opinion) Jedi, above chap.9.29. and Iddo, above chap.12.15. And he is to be distinguished from another Prophet called Oded, who lived in the time of king Hizkia, below ch.28.9. In the Hebrew the words run thus: And Azaria the son of Oded, the spirit of God was upon him.]
\p
\v 2 . And he went out [To wit, out of Jerusalem] toward Asa, [Heb. before the face of Asa: that is, toward Asa, or to meet Asa. So 1 Chron.12.17. and below chap.28.9. He went to meet the King, when he returned to Jerusalem from the defeat of the Moors] and he said unto him; hear me, Asa, and all Juda and Benjamin; The Lord is with you, [that is, he helpeth you, and giveth you victory your Enemies. See above chap.14.v.12,13,14. And compare Deut.20.1. Jos.1.5. Psa.118.6. Jerem.20.15, &c. This may be also translated in the future tense: The LORD shall, or, will be with you, &c. O. in the preterperfectense: The LORD hath been with you] while ye are with him: [That is, while ye stand for his pure worship, and destroy idolatry] And if ye seek him, [see above chap.11.on v.16.] he will be found of you, [Heb. be found unto you, or, for you. So below v.4. and 5. That is, actually assist you with his grace, help and comfort. So Deut.4.29. Prov.8.17. Isa.55.6. Jer.29.13,14.] but if ye forsake him, [see above chap.12.on v.2.] he will forsake you. [that is, actually withdraw his grace, help and comfort from you. So below chapter 24. Verse.20. Psalm 71.9,11.]
\p
\v 3 . Now Israel hath been many days without the true God, [Heb. the God of truth. That is, without the public pure worship of God] and without a teaching Priests, and without the Law. [some take this to be meant of the twelve tribes in general, in the time of the Judges, etc. Others apply it to the ten tribes, and their state and condition, from the time that they revolted from the house of David. See 1 Kings 12.28,29,30, etc.]
\p
\v 4 . But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.
\p
\v 5 . And in those (times) there was no peace [that is, it went not well in Israel] to him that went out, not to him that came in: [understand those that dwelling in Israel, were to go from one place to another, and those that came in from other places abroad, to converse and trade there a while] but many disturbances were upon all the inhabitants of those lands; [to wit, that were under Israel. See the book of Judges, and 1 Kings 14. 10,11. And 15.27.29. and chap.16.]
\p
\v 6 . (So) that people against people, and city against city were dashed in pieces: [i.e. so that they were oppressed by divers Enemies in the time of the Judges, and by home-bred divisions crushed, brake in pieces, and destroyed one another, after they were separated from Juda. Others take the 3.4,5, and 6. Verses, to be as it were a prophecy of future times. Compare it with Hos.3.4,5, etc.] for God had terrified them [to wit, the Israelites] with all adversity. [see 1 Kings 16.21.]
\p
\v 7 . Therefore be ye strong, [That is, go on courageously in reforming and restoring the true and pure worship of God, taking warning by the forementioned examples] and let not your hands grow slack: [see the explaining of this phrase, 2 Sam.4.on v.1.] For there is reward according to your work. [to wit, not in regard of the worth or desert of the work which they owed unto God; but in regard of the grace, mercy, and favour of God, who hath promised to reward the good works of those that belong unto him for Christs sake.]
\p
\v 8 . Now when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of the Prophet Oded, [Above v.1. this prophecy is ascribed or attributed to Azaria the son of Oded: therefore this Prophet must have either had two names, or else this prophecy was not only his, but also his Fathers, who (as some conceive) lived at the same time] he strengthened himself, and he put away the abominations [that is the abominable images, that were yet somewhere left, either in public or private places and houses. See of some of these abominations, 1 Kings 11.7. and 2 King.23.13.] out of all the land of Juda, and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, [See above chap.13.19.] and renewed the altar of the LORD [together with the court of the Priests, (as is conceived) wherein the altar stood: which court is therefore called the new court, below chap.20.vers.5.] which was before the porch of the LORD. [see 1 kings 6.on vers.3. item above chap.3,4. And below chap.29 7.]
\p
\v 9 . And he gathered all Juda and Benjamin [that is, all those that belonged to these two tribes] and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon; for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, [to wit, from the Kings of Israel, with whom through hatred of their idolatry they would have no fellowship] when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.
\p
\v 10 . And they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem, in the third month, [Called Sivan, Esth.8.9. almost agreeing with our May. In this month the feast of Pentecost fell, of which see the command of God, Exod.23.16. and 34.22. and Deut.16.9.] in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
\p
\v 11 . And they offered unto the LORD the same day of the prey which they had brought, [To wit, out of the battle against the Moors. See above chap.14.v.13,14,15.] seven hundred oxen, and seven thousand sheep.
\p
\v 12 . And they entered into a covenant, [This phrase seemeth to point at the use, formerly practiced in the making of covenants. There were certain beasts slain, and these were afterward cut in pieces, thorough the midst whereof the confederates went, etc. See hereof further, Gen.15.on vers.17.] to seek the LORD God of their Fathers with all their heart, and with all their soul. [see 1 Kings 2.on v.4.]
\p
\v 13 . And whosoever would not seek the LORD the God of Israel, should be put to death, from the small to the great; from the man to the woman.
\p
\v 14 . And they sware unto the LORD with a loud [Heb. great] voice, and with shouting: [That is, sound of joy. So 1 Sam.4.6. 2 Sam.6.15. Ezra.3.11.] likewise with trumpets, and with corners.
\p
\v 15 . And all Juda rejoiced at this oath: For they had sworn with all their heart, [See 1 Kings 2.on ver.4.] and sought him with all their will, and he was found of them, [see above on vers 2.] and the LORD gave them rest round about.
\p
\v 16 . Also concerning Maacha the mother of King Asa, [Meaning his grand-mother, his father Abia’s mother, Rehabeams widow, 1 Kings 15 2. And above chap.13.2. where she is called Michaja] he [namely, Asa] deposed her, that she should be no Queen because she had made an abominable idol [Hebr. Miphlezeth. See of this idol 1 Kings 15. On ver.13.] in a grove: Also Asa destroyed her abominable idol, and stamped (it), and burnt (it) at the brook Kidron. [see 1 Kings 2.on v.37.]
\p
\v 17 . The high place indeed were not taken away out of Israel, [The high places indeed were for the most part taken away out Juda, above chap.14.5. but not out of Israel, that is, out of the land of Israel, that was under K.Asa. By Israel then in this place must be understood the countries, cities, and people, that of the Kingdom of Israel were under Juda: Of which see above chap.13.19. and here v.8.9. an compare below chap.17.2. and 19.4. and 21.2, and 4.] yet the heart of Asa was perfect. [how this perfection is to be understood, see 1 Kings 15.on v.14.]
\p
\v 18 . And he brought into the house of God the hallowed things [see Lev.5.on vers.15.] of his father, and his (own) hallowed things, silver, and gold, and vessels.
\p
\v 19 . And there was no war [To wit, between Asa and the kingdom of Israel] unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa. [that is, of the Kingdom of Juda, as it was divided from the Kingdom of Israel, whereof Asa was now King, for here are not expressed the years that Asa reigned, but the years that the Kingdom, of Judalasted, after the ten tribes were revolted from it. The years are thus counted: Rehabeam reigned seventeen years, above chap.12.13. Abia his son three years, ab. Chap.13.2. hereunto added fifteenth years of Asa’s reign, above vers.10. they make in all five and thirty years.]
\c 16
\s Asa requireth aid of the King of Syria against Baesa the King of Israel, ver.1, &c. and obtaineth it, 4. For which he is reproved by the Prophet Hanani, 7. Whom he therefore casteth in prison, 10. Falling sick, he relyeth more upon the Physicians then upon the LORD, 12. He dieth at last, and is buried sumptuously, 13.
\p
\v 1 In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, [See above chap.15. on the last verse] Baesa king of Israel went up against Juda, and built [That is, strengthened, fortified. So above chap.11.5. and 14.6. and bel.v 5.] Rama, [a city lying on an high place in the tribe of Benjamin, not far from Silo, Josh.18.25.] that he light let none go out, [to wit, out of his Kingdom into Juda] or come in [to wit, from Juda into his land] to Asa King of Juda. [to wit, of the ten tribes, over whom he was King. For inasmuch as many saw that the true worship of God was set up under Asa, and tat the Lord was with him, there did many revolt to Asa to Juda. Many likewise came to Jerusalem, to worship God on the Feasts, and otherwise. This Baesa sought to hinder by this means. See above chap.15.9. Hebr. That he might not permit the goer out and the comer in, &c.]
\p
\v 2 . Then Asa brought forth the silver and the gold, out of the treasures of the house of the LORD, and of the Kings house, and sent to Benhadad the King Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, [Hebr. Darmesek] saying;
\p
\v 3 . There is a covenant between me, and between thee, and between my Father, and between thy Father; [Oth. Let there be a covenant, &c. as between, &c.] behold, I send thee silver and gold; go now, make void thy covenant with Baesa the King of Israel, that he may march away [Heb. march up] from me. [that is, break the peace, which thou hast with him, and make war with him, that he may let me be quiet.]
\p
\v 4 . And Benhadad hearkened unto King Asa, and sent the Commanders of his arms, which he had, against the cities of Israel, and they smote Hison, and Dan, and Abel-Maim; [See of these cities, 1 Kings 15 on v.20.] and all the store-cities [that is, magazine, ammunition-cities. See 1 Kings 9.on v.19. Heb. treasure-houses of cities] of Naphtali.
\p
\v 5 . And it came to pass, when Baesa heard (this), that he left off building of Rama, and let his work cease.
\p
\v 6 . Then king Asa took all Juda, [That is, those that pertained to the tribe of Juda. See 1 Kings 15.on vers.22.] and they carried away the stones of Rama, [wherewith the King of Israel intended to fortified Rama. So in the words following, the wood thereof] and the wood thereof, wherewith Baesa had built; and he [namely, King Asa, 1Kings 15.22.] built therewith Geba, [namely, Geba of Benjamin, 1 Kings 15.22. See the annotate. There] and Mizpa. [see Judg.11. v.11.]
\p
\v 7 . And at that time Hanana [This man was the father of the Prophet Jehu, below chap.19.2.] the Seer, [see of this title above chap.9.on v.29.] came to Asa King of Juda, and he said unto him; because thou hast relied on the Syria, and hast not relyed on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Assyria escaped out of thine hand. [for otherwise thou shouldest have subdued as well the king of Syria as the king of Israel, as thou hast overcome the Moors. Oth. Got away, hath withdrawn it self; whereof the meaning would be, thou hast lost thy labour and thy charges, in called the Syrians in to thine aid: For although for the present by their falling upon the Syrians, they have hindred king Baesa in going on in his design of fortifying and strengthening Rama, yet when they shall be marched away, they will not help thee in the war, which Baesa will re-assume against thee. See the end of the 9. Verse following.]
\p
\v 8 . Were not the Moors and the Lubains a great host [Heb. for an host, for, or, in a multitude] with very many charets and horsemen? [see above chap.14 v.9.] yet when thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.
\p
\v 9 . For (as for) the LORD, his eyes run (to and fro) thorough the whole Earth, [Meaning his providence, whereby he seeth and knoweth what is done all lands, not only in general, but also in particular, observing every ones actions or doings. See the like saying, Zach.4.10] to shew himself strong to (those) whose heart is perfect toward him; [what kind of perfection it is, which the godly attain unto in this life, see 1 Kings 8.on vers.61. Hence it seemeth to be now said, that Asa’s heart was not upright, or perfect towards the Lord, contrary to that which we read, 1 Kings 15.14. and above chap.15.17. But see the comparing of both, 1 Kings 15.on v.14.] herein thou hast done foolishly; for from henceforth wars shall be against thee. [to wit, made against thee by king Baesa. See 1 Kings 15.16.]
\p
\v 10 . But Asa waxed worth against the Seer, and laid him in the prison house; [Heb. in the house of subversion, or, destruction: That is, in prison, wherein those were shut up, that were to be destroyed or put to death. He conceive that the Prophet had wronged and abused his royal Majesty, and therefore had deserved to lose his life. Some interpret it the house, or prison of the stocks, where they locked up prisoners in the stocks, or in setters and chains. The same word is also used, Jer.20.2. and 29.26.] for he was disturbed against him [Heb. in vexation, to wit, through anger. See of the proper signification of this word, Gen.40.on ver.6.] for this (thing): Besides, Asa oppressed [the Hebrew word signifieth properly to beat a thing, or, a man in pieces, to throw down on the ground, to tread down, or, crush under foot, to oppress] (some) of the people the same time.
\p
\v 11 . And behold, the acts of Asa, the first, with the last, [The first were good and commendable: The last had great failings, and consequently were reproveable. He was indeed faithful and constant in maintaining the pure worship of God, but his confidence in God was small, and his severity against some of the people was great] they are written in the book of the Kings of Juda and Israel.
\p
\v 12 . Now Asa in the nine and thirtieth year of his reign, fell sick in his feet; his sickness was (come) to the highest: Moreover also in his sickness he sought not the LORD, but the Physicians. [that is, he did not ask counsel of God by any Prophet: He did not humbled himself by counfession of this sins, he relyed not on the Lord, neither called upon him, as he ought to have done; but relyed only on the Physicians, and on the help of man. Heb. in, or, of the Physicians.]
\p
\v 13 . So Asa fell asleep with his Fathers: And he died in the one and fourtieth year of his reign.
\p
\v 14 . And they buried him in his (own) sepulcher, [Heb. sepulchers. Compare 2 Kings 29.20. and see the annotate.] which he had digged for himself in the city of David, and laid him on the bed which he had filled with spices, and that of divers kinds, prepared according to the Apothecaries: And they burnt a very great burning over him. [there is, they honoured him at his burial, by burning of precious, and sweet-smelling spices. Compare below chap.21.19. Jerem.34.5.]
\c 17
\s Josaphat succeeding his father Asa, strengtheneth his kingdom, vers.1.&c. and because he feared God, he is blessed of God, 3. Destroyeth idolatry, 6. Causeth his people every where to be instructed in the book of the law, 7. Is feared and honored by the nations rounds about, 10. The names of the Commanders of his army, and the number of his men of war, 14.
\p
\v 1 And Josaphat his son became king in his stead: And he strengthened himself against Israel. [that is, he furnished himself with store of arms, and all kind of instruments wars, to manifest his power against the ten tribes, to resist and oppose them, and to divert their strength and power. Oth. He strengthened himself over Israel: that is, he comfirmed himself in the Kingdom, which he had over Juda, Benjamin, and the strangers of Israel, and the cities Ephraim, which his father had taken. See the next verse.]
\p
\v 2 . And he put men of war [Or, Forces] in all the fenced cities of Juda, and put Garrisons in the land of Juda, [that is, men of war under the conduct of their Officers and Commanders, to secure the land against the invasion of the Enemy. The Hebrew word is so taken, 1 Sam.13.3. and 2 Sam.8.6.] and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his Father had taken.
\p
\v 3 . And the Lord was with Josaphat: For he walked in the former ways of his father David, [That is, wherein his fore-father David had walked. Oth. First, meaning before David had commited adultery, caused Uria to be slain, and the people to be numbered, 2 Sam.11.4,14. And 24.2.] and sought not the Baalims. [that is, he gave them no religious honor, to have aid from them, had them in no account. Understand by the Baalims all manner of idols; and see of this word Judg.2.on v.11.]
\p
\v 4 . But he sought the God of his Father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel. [Heb. after the word, that is, after the idolatry of the back-sliding Israelites, who worshipped the golden calves, and other idols.]
\p
\v 5 . And the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand, and all Israel gave present to Josaphat: [Kings and Princes were honored with presents, either by their own subjects, in token of willing subjection, whereby they did submit themselves to their command and government, as 1 Sam.10.28. and here: Or by strange nations in token of reverence, and to maintain friendship and peace, as 1 Kings 10.25. and above chap.4.v.24.] and he had riches and honor in abundance.
\p
\v 6 . And his heart was lift up in the ways of the LORD: [Not through conceit of his own vertues, riches, and honor, but through and for a courageous resolution to root out idolatry, to reform Religion, and to set up the pure worship of God, to bring in all good orders according to the law of God, and to make himself strong against all lets and hinderances, that he might meet withal by the way. Some take it thus, that he counted it his highest honor to walk in the ways of the Lord] and moreover he took away the high places and the groves out of Juda. [which were yet remaining since Asa’s time, or were planted about the end of his life by the Jews, who were so prone to idolatry, that even not withstanding Josaphats zeal, they were not utterly abolished and destroyed: below chap.20.33.]
\p
\v 7 . Now in the third year of his reign he sent to his Princes, to Benchail, and to Obadia, and to Zecharia, and to Nethaniel, and to Michaia, to teach in the cities of Juda: [The meaning is, that they should every where exhort and command the people of the Jews in the Kings name, to hear the Law of the Lord at the mouth of the Priests and Levites, and to order and regulate their lives according to it; and remove by public authority all lets and hinderances whatsoever.]
\p
\v 8 . And with them the Levites, Semaja, and Netania and Zabadia, and Asahel, and Semiramoth, and Jonathan, and Adonia, and Tobia, and Tob Adonia, the Levites, and with them the Priests, Elisama, and Joram.
\p
\v 9 . And they [To wit, the Priests and Levites] taught in Juda, and the book of the Law of the LORD was with them; and they went about in all the cities of Juda, and taught among the people.
\p
\v 10 . And a terror of the LORD [That is, a very great terror. See above chap.14.on vers.14. Item, compare Gen.13.on vers.10.] was over all the kingdoms of the lands, that were round about Juda: (so) that they warred not against Josaphat.
\p
\v 11 . And from the Philistines they brought presents to Josaphat with the imposed money: [Hebr. And, or, with the silver of the burden: that is, with the set money, which they were injoined to pay yearly as a Tax or Tribute to the Kings of Juda] also the Arabians brought him small cattle, seven thousand, and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand, and seven hundred he goats.
\p
\v 12 . So Josaphat increased, and waxed exceeding great, [To wit, 1. In riches, above vers.5. and below chap.18.1. 2. In military force, below vers.14,15, etc.3. In honor, and renown, above vers.5. and 10. And below chap 18.1. Hebr. He was, or, became, going and waxed great] moreover, he built in Juda strong holds, [or, Castles, Forts. Others, Palaces] and cities of store.
\p
\v 13 . And he had men in the cities of Juda: [Understand this work not onely of the preparation, means, and provision, which he had in readiness for war, and other affairs, (as some take the Hebrew word here) but also of the labour, transaction, and business, which he had every where therein, to manage all things aright, to order, make, and put the same in practice] and men of war, valiant champions in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 14 . Now this is their numbering, [Others, number, or, chief commanders, or, commanding power] according to the houses of their fathers: In Juda were chief of the thousand; Adana the chief, and with him were three hundred thousand valiant champions.
\p
\v 15 . Now next to him [Hebr. At his hand: and so in the sequel] was Jobanan the chief: and with him were two hundred and fouescore thousand.
\p
\v 16 . And next to him was Amasia the son of Zichri, who had willingly given up himself unto the LORD: [To wit, to fight the Lords battles against the enemies of the land] and with him were two hundred thousand valiant champions.
\p
\v 17 . And of Benjamin was Eliada, valiant champion: and with him two hundred thousand, that were armed with bow and shield.
\p
\v 18 . And next to him was Jozabad; and with him were an hundred and fourscore thousand, ready prepared for the war.
\p
\v 19 . These were in the Kings service, [Or, ministered unto the King. Others, waited on the King. Understand that they were always ready to be used for him in the war, when so ever they should for that end and purpose be commanded by him] besides those, whom the Kings had put in the fenced cities thorough out all Juda.
\c 18
\s Josaaphat being joined in affinity with Achab, consenteth to go to war with him against Ramoth in Gilead, vers. 2, etc. but desireth that the word of the LORD should be heard concerning it, 4. Achab’s Prophets give advice for it, 5. Micha a Prophet of the Lord is likewise sent for about it, 6. Achab’s prophets abide by their opinion, 10. Micha on the contrary disswadeth that war, 12. Is therefore smitten by Zedekia, 23. Cast into prison by Achab, 25. Josaphat is holpen by God, 31. Achab is shot, 33.
\p
\v 1 Now Josaphat had riches and honor in abundance: and he joined affinity with Achab. [Having suffered his son to marry with Athalia the daughter of Achab and Izebel, 2 Kings 8 18.]
\p
\v 2 . And at the end of (certain) years [So the word days being put alone, is taken for ceratin days, Gen.4.3. See the Annotations there] he went down to Achab to Samaria; [it’s conceived that this was about the seventeenth year of Josaphat’s reign, as may be gathered from 1 Kings 22.52.] and Achab killed sheep, and oxen for him in abundance, [that is, honored and entertained him with a great feast. He made a great feast for him. See Gen.31.on vers.54.] and for the people that were with him, and he put him on to go up to Ramoth [a city of the Tribe of Gad, given to the Levites, 1 Chron.6.8.See of the same likewise, 1 Kings 4.13,etc.] in Gilead [that is, lying in the land of Gilead: of which see Gen.31.on vers.21. Wherefore this city is also called Ramoth in Gilead, Deut.4 43. 1 Chron.6.8. to distinguish it from another Ramoth lying is Issaschar, 1 Chron.6 73.]
\p
\v 3 . For Achab King Israel said unto Jehosaphat the King of Juda; Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth in Gilead? And he said unto him; I will be so, as thou art, and as thy people is, shall my people be, [see the exposition hereof 1 Kings 22.on vers.4. in which chapter this history is almost word for word recorded; therefore also the greatest part of the exposition of this chapter is to be found there] and we will be with thee in this war.
\p
\v 4 . Moreover, Josaphat said unto the King of Israel; Inquire, I pray, after the word of the LORD, to day.
\p
\v 5 . Then the King of Israel gathered together the Prophets, four hundred men, [They are called the prophets Achab, below vers.21. which are opposed to the Prophets of the Lord, which Josaphat desired to hear in the next verse] and he said unto them; Shall we go to battle against Ramoth in Gilead, or shall I for bear? And they said; Go up, for God will deliver it into the Kings hand.
\p
\v 6 . But Josaphat said; Is here not yet a Prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of him?
\p
\v 7 . Then the King of Israel said unto Josaphat; There is yet one man, by whom we may inquire of the LORD; but I hate him; for he Prophesieth no good thing concerning me; but always [Heb. all his days: that is, as long, and as often, as he hath prophesied anything unto me in all his life-time] evil; [so 1 Kings 22.8. Hebr.not for good, but for evil. Which is as much as if he had said: He prophesieth nothing unto me, that may tend to mine honor, pleasure, or profit, but all that tends to my disgrace, displeasure, and damage. Thus doth this Idolater Judge of all that the Prophet had here propounded unto him, for the leaving of his false worship and sinful life] this is Micha, the son of Jimla: and Josaphat said; Let not the King say so.
\p
\v 8 . Then the King of Israel called a Groom of the Chamber, and he said; Fetch quickly Micha the son of Jimla.
\p
\v 9 . Now the King of Israel, and Josaphat the King of Juda, sate each on his throne, arrayed with (their) robes, [Which excelled their ordinary and usual apparel, and represented their royal majesty. See 1 King.22.on v.10.] and they sate on the plain at the door of the gate of Samaria: and all the Prophets prophesied in their presence. [Hebr. Before their faces.]
\p
\v 10 . And Zedekia the son of Kenana had made him iron horns: and he said; Thus saith the LORD, with these thou shalt push the Syrians, until thou shalt have destroy them. [It is as much, as if had said, I declared and testify by these horns, that thou shalt so push, smite, and drive away the Syrians, and the horned beasts are able to do those beasts that want horns. He seeks to imitate the true Prophets, who were wont to add some kind of tokens to their words: as appeareth 1 Kings 11.30. 2 Kings 13.15,16, etc.]
\p
\v 11 . And all the Prophets Prophesied so, saying; Go up, to Ramoth in Gilead, and thou shalt be prosperous; [See 1 Kings 22. On verse.12.] for the LORD shall deliver them into the Kings hand.
\p
\v 12 . Now the Messenger that was gone to call Micha, spake unto him, saying; Behold, the words of the Prophets are out of one mouth, good to the King: [See 1 Kings 1.on vers.42. and above on vers.7.] let now, I pray, thy word, be, according as (the word) of one of them, and speak (the thing which is) good.
\p
\v 13 . But Micha said; (as true as) the LORD liveth that which my God shall say, that will I speak.
\p
\v 14 . When he was come to the King, then the King said unto him; Micha, shall we go to Ramoth in Gilead to battle, or shall I for bear? And he said, go up, and ye shall be prosperous; [See 1 Kings 22.on vers.15.] for they [namely, the Syrians] shall be delivered [to wit, by the Lord, 1 Kings 22.15.] into your hand.
\p
\v 15 . And the King said unto him; Unto how many times shall I adjure thee, that thou speak nothing to me but the truth in the Name of the LORD? [These are the words of an angry man, who breaketh so out into sudden anger, the he uttereth falsehood and untruth: for he had not adjured Micha, but had barely asked him the question, what he should do, or not do in the war, which he intended to make against the Syrians, vers.14.]
\p
\v 16 . And he said; I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no sherpherd: [See 1 Kings 22.on vers.17.] and the LORD said; These have no Lord; let every one return to his house in peace.
\p
\v 17 . Then said the King of Israel unto Josaphat; said I not unto thee; He will not prophesy any good thing concerning me, but evil? [Hebr. To or for evil. 1 Kings 22.18. the word evil alone is mentioned. See above on vers.7.]
\p
\v 18 . Moreover, he [Namely, Micha] said; Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the heavenly host standing on his right hand, and on his left.
\p
\v 19 . And the LORD said; Who shall persuade Achab King of Israel to go up and fall at Ramoth in Gilead? Then he said; [To wit, the LORD, whose words are also those that go before in this verse. Others, And he said, to wit, Micha] This saith thus, and that saith so. [If these words were spoken by Micha, then they should be translated thus; the one said thus, and the other said so.]
\p
\v 20 . Then (there) came forth a spirit, [Meaning, a wicked spirit, who in the next verse calleth himself a lying spirit, as he is also called a Liar, and the father of lis, John.8.44.] and stood before the face of the LORD and said; I will persuade him: And the LORD said unto him; Wherewith?
\p
\v 21 . And he said; I will go forth, and be a lying spirit [Hebr. a spirit of falsehood, or, of lying; that is, which inspireth falsehood or lying into man. So it is called the spirit of whoredom, that seduceth a man unto spiritual whoredom, that is, unto idolatry, Ho.4.12. the spirit of uncleanness, that provoketh unto spiritual uncleanness, Zach.13.2. the spirit of error, that produceth or bringeth forth error, 1 John 4.6.] in the mouth of all his Prophets: and he said; Thou shalt persuade, and shalt also prevail; go forth, and do so. [See 1 Kings 22.on vers.22.]
\p
\v 22 . Now then, behold, the LORD hath given a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy Prophets, [Meaning all, LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.
\p
\v 23 . Then Zedekia the son of Kenana came near, and smote Micha upon the cheek; and he said; Which way went the spirit of the Lord from me, to speak unto thee?
\p
\v 24 . And Micha said; Behold, thou shalt see it on that day, when thou shalt go from chamber into chamber, to hide thy self. [Compare 1 Kings 20 30. And the Annotat.]
\p
\v 25 . Now the King of Israel said; Take Micha, and carry him back to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joab the kings son:
\p
\v 26 . And ye shall say; Thus saith the King; Put this (fellow) in the prison-house, and feed him with bread of affliction, and with water of affliction, until I return in peace. [Hebr. until my returning in peace.]
\p
\v 27 . And Micha said; If thou return at all [Hebr. returning return] in peace, then the LORD hath not spoken by me: moreover he said; hearken all ye people. [He speaketh (doubtless) to the standers by, who were there met together out of many tribes, to call them as witnesses of that which he had spoken there immediately before.]
\p
\v 28 . So the king of Israel, and Josaphat the King of Juda went up to Ramoth in Gilead.
\p
\v 29 . And the King of Israel said unto Jehosaphat; when I have disguised my self, I enter into the battle, [Others, I will disguise my self, enter into the battle; or, when he disguised himself, or, changed his apparel, and would enter into the battle. See the exposition of these words, 1 Kings 22.on vers.30.] but put thou on thy robes: so the King of Israel disguished himself, and they entered into the battle.
\p
\v 30 . Now the King of Syria had commanded the captains of the charets, which he had, [To wit, two and thirty in number, 1 Kings 22.31,] saying; ye shall not fight against small nor great, but onely against the King of Israel.
\p
\v 31 . It came to pass then, when the captains of the charets saw Josaphat, that they said; That is the King of Israel, and they compassed about him, to fight: but Josaphat cried: [To wit, unto the LORD, for aid, as may be gathered from the following words] and the LORD helped him, and God turned them away from him.
\p
\v 32 . For it came to pass, when the captains of the charets saw, that it was not the King of Israel, that they turned away from behind him.
\p
\v 33 . Then a man drew a be in his simplicity, [See 1 Kings 22.on vers.34.] and shot [Hebr. smote. SeeGen.8.on verse.21.] between the buckles, and between the coats of mail: then he [Namely, King Achab] said to the driver (of his charets) Turn thine hand, [Compare 2 Kings 9.23.] and carry me out of the cam; For I am wounded.
\p
\v 34 . And the battle increased the same day, and the King of Israel caused himself to be stayed with the charet over against the Syrians, until the evening, and he died at time, when the sun went down. [So 1 Kings 22.35. it is said, that he died in the evening.]
\c 19
\s Josaphat is reproved by the Prophet Jehu, vers.1 etc.1 etc. He remaineth at Jerusalem, and afterward appointeth Judges throughout his land, whom he exhorteth to the faithfully executing of their office, 4. Also Ecclesiastiacal and Political Judges in Jerusalem, 8.
\p
\v 1 And Josaphat the King of Juda returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 2 . And Jehu [See of this Prophet 1 Kings 16.on vers.1.] the son of Hanani [see of this man also above chap.16.2.] the Seer [that is, the Prophet. See 1 Sam.9. on vers.9. and above chap.9. on vers.29.] went out to meet him, and said to king Josaphat; Shouldst thou help the ungodly, [namely, Achab, whom he had helped against the Syrians, above chap.18.3, etc.] and love those that hate the LORD? Therefore now wrath is upon thee [which Josaphat had already felt in some measure, above chap.18 31. And afterward yet more, below chap.20.1.] from the face of the LORD. [Hebr. from before the face of the Lord.]
\p
\v 3 . Nevertheless (there) are good things found with thee: [To wit, not which were by or through his own nature, but by or through the grace of regeneration, for God preserveth and rewardeth his own gifts out of free grace: so Nehem.9.8. Luke 12.43. Acts 13.22.] for thou hast removed [the Hebrew word signifieth also to kindle, to set on fire, to burn, Exod.35.3. Levit.6.12. above chap.4.20. It is taken for putting away, or, removing, 2 Sam.4.11. 1 Kings 21.21. 2 Kings 23.24.] the groves out of the land, and hast disposed thine heart, to seek God. [To wit, by the power of Gods grace, which had prevented him for the doing of this work, giving him understanding, will, and ability to perform it. Ephes.2.10. Phil.2.13. Compare above chap.12. the Annotation on vers.14.]
\p
\v 4 . Now Josaphat dwelt at Jerusalem; and he went out again [Hebr. he came again, and went out. Others, being converted, (to wit, by the Prophets admonition) he went out] thorough the people, from Berseba to mount Ephraim, [That is, from the South-end of his Kingdom, which was the city of Ber-Seba, to the North-end, which was mount Ephraim] and caused them to return [to wit, from Ephraim] and caused them to return [to wit, from their idolatry, false worship, and wickedness of life] unto the LORD God of their fathers.
\p
\v 5 . And he set Judges in the land, in all the fenced cities of Juda, from city to city. [Hebr. for city, and city: that is, in every city]
\p
\v 6 . And he said unto the Judges, See what ye do; For ye keep not judgment for men for men, but for the LORD, [that is, ye do not properly execute the office of a judge, in the name, and by the command and authority of a man, but in the name, and by the command and authority of God, to whom the judgment belongeth, and who hath placed you therein, to supply his room] and he is with you in the matter of Judgement. [That is, in law-businesses, and suits, that may before you. See Psalm 82.1.]
\p
\v 7 . Now then, let the terror of the LORD be upon you: take heed, and do it: [Take heed, to wit, to your office, to the end that ye may daily execute it] for (there) is no iniquity with the LORD our God, [compare Deut.32.4. Rom.9.14.] nor acceptation of persons. [Compare Deut.10.17. Job.34.19. Acts 10.34. Rom.2.11. Gal.2.6. Ephes.6.9. Colos.3.20. 1 Peter 1.17. Hebr. taking up of the face. See Lev.19.15. and Deut.1.17. with the Annotations] nor taking of gifts. [Hebr. gift, that is, any gift, or gifts.]
\p
\v 8 . Moreover, at Jerusalem Josaphat did also set (certain) of the Levites, and of the Priests, and of the heads of the Fathers [That is, of the fathers houses, that were under Josaphts, command] of Israel over the Judgement of the LORD, and over the differences [understand by the judgement of the LORD, and differences, the Ecclesiastical, and Political matters, and compare herewith vers.11.] when they were returned to Jerusalem. [Hebr. properly, and they returned, or, were returned to Jerusalem: that is, when they were returned; namely, Josaphat, and those that went along with him thorough the whole land, to bring every where in the ordinances of God both in Ecclesiastical and Civil affairs. Others translate this thus; Over judgement matters, or law businesses, when they returned to Jerusalem, to wit, when they were brought thither by appeal: with this meaning, that these judges were placed at Jerusalem to dispatch causes, when by the parties they were brought by appeal to Jerusalem: Or, when the inferior judges did appear at Jerusalem in some dark and doubtful case, to ask advice there, and to have the interpretation given them of that which they did not understand.]
\p
\v 9 . And he charged them, saying; Do thus in the fear of the LORD with faithfulness, and with a perfect heart. [That is, with an upright, unfeigned, and unrebukeable mind. Compare 1 Kings 8.on vers.67.]
\p
\v 10 . And (in) all (or every) cause, that shall come to you of your brethren, that dwell in their cities, between bloud and bloud, [That is, concerning the difference about some murder, or wound. See Deut.17. vers.8.] between law and commandement, [that is, touching the judgement about the keeping or transgressing of the laws and commandments, and that which dependeth thereon. See of the difference of these two words, Genes.26.on vers.5. item Deut.5.on vers.31. and 1 Kings 2.on vers.3.] and statutes, and judgments, then execute them, that they be not guilty before the LORD, and a great wrath [that is, judgment, or punishment from the Lord. Compare below chap.28.13. and the Annotations] be upon you, and upon your brethren: do thus, and ye shall not be guilty.
\p
\v 11 . And behold, Amaria the chief Priests is over you in all (or, every) matter of the LORD, and Zebadia the son of Ismael, the Prince of the house of Juda, in all (or, every) matter of the king; [Hence may be gathered, that there were two distinct superior Courts at Jerusalem: the one that was to Judge of spiritual matters, and the other that was to Judge of civil controversies, to which they might appeal from all other Courts throughout the land. Compare Deut.17.8, etc. item Exod.18.26. Deut.1.15.] also the officers, the Levites [See 1 Chron.26.29. and the following verse with the Annotations] are before your face: [that is, for your good, ready to wait upon you. See the like phrase, Gen.13.on vers.9.] be strong, and do it, and the LORD will be with the good. [To wit, with the men, or persons, that intend the thing that is good, and endeavour to maintain it; or, with the good cause.]
\c 20
\s Jsaphat being I distress by reason f multitude of enemies that came against him prolaimeth a Fat, vers.1. etc.himelf maketh a payer to God, 5. He is courted by the roped Jahazie, promise of Gods aid and assistance, 14. Which he obatineth miraculously, 20. Getteth great spoil, and cometh to Jerusalem, with praise and thanksgiving to God, 25. His government, 31. His navy miscarrieth, 34.
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass after this, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them (others) [Namely, the Syrians, vers.2. and the Edomites, that dwelt on mount Seir, vers.10.] nigh to the Ammonites, [or, without, apart from the Ammorites. Others, over, or, beside. Others, for with them, namely, the Moabites, were (to wit, certain) of the Ammonites. Others conceive that Ammonim here, and chap.26.8. are a peculiar people, distinct from the children of Ammon] came against Josaphat to battle.
\p
\v 2 . Then cometh a great multitude against thee from the other side of the sea, [Meaning the Salt sea, or the dead sea, which was the Fast border of the land of Jury, Josh.15.5. See of this sea Gen.14.on vers.3.] out of Syria; and behold, they are at Hazezon Tamar, [See Gen.14.on vers.7.] which is Engedi.
\p
\v 3 . Now feared, and set his face, [That is, had a firm resolution in his heart. AS we turn the face of our body towards the place, where we would be: so we turn and fix the thoughts of the our mind upon the work which we intend to do. See 2 Kings 12.on vers.17.] to seek the LORD: [Others, to seek (help) of the Lord. To seek the Lord, is in this place as much as earnestly or zealously to call upon him. So Psalm 34.5. and 78.34, etc. This phrase is elsewhere taken more generally. See above chap.11.on vers.16.] and he proclaimed a Fast in all Juda. [To wit, that every one might be the fitter, to pray unto God for the welfare and prosperity of the land, and the removal or turning away of the enemies, and to give a public testimony of humility and repentance for former sins, and of n upright resolution and purpose to amend ones ways for time to come. Compare Judges 20.26. 1 Sam.7.6. and 31.13. 2 Sam.1.12. 1 Kings 21.9. and the Annotations. Nehem.9.11. Esther 4.16. Joel 2.15.]
\p
\v 4 . And Juda was gathered together, to seek (help) [Or, (answer)] of the LORD: also they came out of all the cities of Juda to seek the LORD.
\p
\v 5 . And Josaphat stood [To wit, in the outer, and great Court, called the peoples court, on the Royal Scaffold, of which see above chap.6.on v.13.] in the congregation of Juda, and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new Court. [Meaning the inner Court, which was the Priests Court, called here the new Court, because (as is thought) Asa caused the same to be renewed, when he renewed the altar of burnt-offering, above chap.15.8.]
\p
\v 6 . And he said; O LORD God of our fathers, art not thou that God in heaven; yea thou art the ruler over all the Kingdoms of the heathen; and in thine hand is power, and strength [Compare 1 Chron.29.12. Matth.6.13.] so that no man is able to set himself against thee. [Or, so that no man is with, or, by, or, against thee, to set himself; that is, so that no man is to be compared with thee in might, that were able to withstand thee.]
\p
\v 7 . Hast thou not, our God, driven out the inhabitants of this land from before the face of thy people Israel, and given that to the seed [That is, the posterity, see Gen.9.on vers.9.] of Abraham thy lover forever? [That is, to the coming of the Messiah, and the fulfilling of the to the coming of the Messiah, and the fulfilling of the Law, see Gen.13.on vers.15.]
\p
\v 8 . Now they have dwelt therein, and they have built thee a Sanctuary [That is, a Temple; so the Temple is called, Psalm 74.7. Ezech.45.5. item the Tabernacle of Moses, Exod.25.8. Lev.20.3.] therein for thy Name, [that is, for thee. See 1 Kings 5.3. so in the sequel] saying;
\p
\v 9 . If (any) evil come upon us, [Compare 1 Kings 8.33,34,35, etc. above chap.6.28. and 7.13.] the sword of judgement, [meaning war, whereby God is wont to execute his just Judgements and punishments upon men. The word sword is put or used for war; see Lev.26.on vers.6. and Judgement for punishment, or, vengeance, Exod.7.4. Jer.48.47. Ezech.14.21. 1 Peter.4.17, etc. therefore this sword of war is also called a revenging sword, Lev.26.25.] or pestilence, or famine, we shall stand before this house, and before thy face, because thy Name [That is, thou, O Lord, by the tokens of thy presence, and the working of thy grace] is in this house; and we shall cry unto thee out of our distress; and thou shalt hear, and deliver.
\p
\v 10 . And now, behold, the children of Ammon, and Moab, and those of mount Seir, [Hebr. the mount, or, mountains of Seir, that is, the inhabitants of those mountains, which were the Edomites, Deut.2.5.] thorough which thou didst not suffer Israel to pass, [to wit, as enemies to hurt and annoy the people, or to take possession of their land; but they might have passed thorough as friends, if the Edomites had not denied them passage, Numb.20.17,20,21. Deut.2.4,8,18.] when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not.
\p
\v 11 . Behold then, they reward us; [To wit, the good, which we have done to them, they reward with evil, which they now intend to do to us. The Hebrew word is taken here for evil reward, so 2 Chron.32.25. Psalm 7.5, etc. also elsewhere for good reward, Judges 9.16. 2 Sam.19.36. for both, 1 Sam.24.18. Prov.31.12.] coming to drive us out away out of thine inheritance, which thou hast given us to inherit.
\p
\v 12 . O our God, wilt thou not exercise Judgement against them? [That is, wilt thou not punish them? So Judging is put for punishing, 1 Sam.3.13. Psalm 51.6. Ezech.24.14. Compare Gen.15.on vers.14. Thus by way of demand, he prayeth God to punish] for there is no might in us against this great multitude, that cometh against us: and we know not what to do, but our eyes are upon thee. [That is, we trust in thee, and expect thy help. So Psalm 25.15. and 123.2. and 141.8. and compare 1 Kings 1 20.]
\p
\v 13 . And all Juda stood before the face of the LORD: [To wit, in the great Court, before the Court of the Priests, and the Temple. Compare Lev.1.on vers.3.] also their little children, their wives, and their sons.
\p
\v 14 . Then the spirit of the LORD [Understand this of the spirit of Prophesy. So Numb.24.2. below chap.24.20.] came upon [Hebr. was upon. So Judges 11.29. and see the Annotations] Jahaziel the son of Zecharia, the son of Benaia, the son of Jehiel, the son of Matthania, the Levite, of the sons of Asaph: [by this description this Jahaziel is distinguished from others of the same name, 1 Chron.12.4. and 16.6. and 23 19.]
\p
\v 15 . And he said; Attend, all Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Josaphat; Thus saith the LORD unto you: Be ye not afraid, nor be dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours but Gods. [That is, ye shall not fight against this company, but God, whom they fight against, when they marched up against you.]
\p
\v 16 . March down [This is so affirmed, in regard of the situation of the city of Jerusalem, which lay in an high place. See Gen.46.on vers.4.] tomorrow to ward them: behold, they come up by the ascent of Ziz; [the name of a place having the wilderness of Engedi East-ward, and the wilderness of Jeruel (whereof is spoken in the end of this verse) Westward] and ye shall find them in the end of the valley [others, brook] before the wilderness of Jeruel.
\p
\v 17 . Ye shall not have (need) to fight in this (battle:) set your selves, stand (still,) and see the salvation of the LORD with you, [That is, which the Lord will send you] O Juda, and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed, tomorrow go out against them; for the LORD shall be with you. [See Numb.14.on vers.9.]
\p
\v 18 . Then Josaphat bowed himself with his face to the ground: [To wit, declaring thereby, that he believed the promise of God, and thanked him for it] and all Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the face of the LORD, worshipping the LORD.
\p
\v 19 . And the Levites, of the children of the Kahathites, [Descended from Kahath by Korah. They came indeed from Kahath, 1 Chron.6.22. but were not of the priests family; but were Singers in the temple] and of the children of the Korahites, stood up, to praise the LORD the God of Israel with a loud [Hebr. great] voice in the highest (manner.) [So is the Hebrew word taken, 1 Chron.14.2. and 23.17. and 29.25. and 2 Chron.1.1. Others, upward on, or in the heighth.]
\p
\v 20 . And they gat them up betimes in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa [Lying South-east of Jerusalem in the Tribe of Juda] and when they went forth, josaphat stood, and said; Hear me, O Juda, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his Prophets, [that is, the promises of God, published by the Prophets in general, and by theProphet Jahaziel in particular. See Exod.14.31.] and ye shall be prosperous.
\p
\v 21 . Now he [Namely, Josaphat] consulted with the people, and he appointed Singers unto the LORD, which should praise the holy Majesty [Hebr. the Majesty, or, the glory of Holiness: that is, the holy and the glorious God, the holy divine Majesty. It is a periphrasis, or circumlocution of the most high God] before the ready marching forth, [That is, before the men of war, which marched forth with their arms in aray] saying; praise the LORD, for his kindness is for ever. [this is the beginning of the 136. Psalm, which perhaps they sung quite out.]
\p
\v 22 . Now at the time when they began with a joyfull acclamation, and song of praise; the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and those of mount Seir, which were come against Juda, [The Hebrew word rendered here ambushments, signifieth some hidden men secretly, lurking to surprise the Enemies. Note here that God sent a spirit of confusion among them, so that they holding each other for Enemies, did he in ambush one against another, and destroyed one another, as followeth. Some understand here the holy Angels, whose ministery God useth for his people against their Enemies, 2 Kings 6.17. and 19.35.] and they were smitten. [to wit, in manner, as in the foregoing annotate. Was said, whereby Jahaziels prophecy was fulfilled, above v.15.17. Oth. They smote themselves: that is, one another.]
\p
\v 23 . For the children of Ammon and Moab, stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir, to ban, and to detroy (them): and when they had made an end of destroying the inhabitants of mount Seir, they helped one another [Hebr. the man his neighbor, or, companion] to destruction. [see an example of the like confusion, Judg.7.22.]
\p
\v 24 . Now when Juda was come to the watch-tower [Standing upon the high place of Ziz, of which place see above on v.6. Oth. Mizpa] in the wilderness, they turned themselves towards the multitude; and behold they were dead bodies, lying on the ground, and no man had escaped. [Hebr. there had been no escapeing: that is, no man had escaped.]
\p
\v 25 . Now Josaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, and they found among them, as well substance dead bodies, [Oth, and garments] as precious furniture, [Hebr. vessels, or, furniture of desires; that is, things that are much desired by reason of their preciousness and beauty] and took for themselves until they could carry no more: [Hebr. unto no carrying, or, taking up] and they were three days taking away the spoil; for (there) was much of it.
\p
\v 26 . And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracha, [That is, of blessing, or, of praise. This valley lay between the wilderness of Jeruel, and the wilderness of Tekoa, in the tribe of Juda] for there they praised the LORD: Therefore they called the name of that place the valley of Beracha unto this day. [that mis, the name continueth still to the very day, when this book was written.]
\p
\v 27 . Then all the men of Juda and Jerusalem returned, and Josaphat in the fore front of them [Hebr. in their head: that is, the van or front of all the army] to go again to Jerusalem with Joy: For the LORD Had made them to rejoice over their Enemies.
\p
\v 28 . And they came to Jerusalem with Lutes, and with Harps, and with Trumpets, unto the house of the LORD: [That is, into the great court; to praise God therewith for the victory obtained.]
\p
\v 29 . And there was a terror of God [That is, which was sent by God, and was very great. See above chap.14.on v.14. and Gen.35.on v.5.] upon all the kingdoms of those lands, when they heard that the LORD had fought against the Enemies of Israel.
\p
\v 30 . So the kingdom of Josaphat was quiet; and his God gave him rest round about.
\p
\v 31 . So Josaphat reigned over Juda: He was five and thirty years old, [Heb. a son of five and thirty years] when he became king, and he reigned five and twenty years at Jerusalem: And his mothers names was Azuba, a daughter of Silhi.
\p
\v 32 . And he walked in the way of Asa his father, [That is, he followed his Fathers footsteps, in maintaining the pure worship of God, and in governing the kingdom. See 1 Kings 15.on v.26.] and departed not from it, doing that which was right in eyes of the LORD.
\p
\v 33 . Howbeit, the high places were not taken away: [To wit, not quite, nor every where: Yet they had taken away a great part of them, above ch.17 6.] For as yet the people had not framed their heart unto the God of their Fathers. [See above chap.12.on v.14. and 19.on vers.3.]
\p
\v 34 . Now the rest of the acts of Josaphat; of the first, and of the last, behold, they are written in the history of Jehu [Se of this Prophet, 1 Kings 16.on v.1.] the son of Hanani, [See likewise of this Prophet above ch.16.7.] which they caused him to record in the book of the Kings of Israel. [Which contained the histories, acts, and monuments of the kings of Israel. Hebr. was made to cause them to go up upon the brook, etc.]
\p
\v 35 . But after this Josaphat king of Juda did associate himself with Ahazia the King of Israel, who dealt wickedly in (his) actions.
\p
\v 36 . And he did associate himself with him, to make ships to go to Tarsis: [See 1 Kings 10.on v.22.] And they made the ships at Ezeon-Geber. [see of this city and haven, 1 Kings 9.on v.26.]
\p
\v 37 . But Eliezer the son of Didava of Maresa, prophesied against Josaphat, saying; because thou hast associated thy self with Ahazia, the LORD hath rent thy works: So the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarsis.
\c 21
\s Josaphat dieth, and Joram his son reigneth, v.1.&c. who murdereth his brethren, 2. His wicked reign, 5. The Edomites and Libna revolt from him, 8. And according to a writing of Elia, 12 he is vexed by the Philistines and Arabians, who plunder his house, and carry away his sons and his wives, 16. Moreover he is plague with an incurable disease, whereof he dieth, 18. And is buried without the usual solemnity, 19.
\p
\v 1 After that Josaphat fell asleep with his Fathers, [That is, died. A further explication of this phrase, see Deut.31.on v.16. and 1 Kings 1.on v.21.] and was buried by his Fathers in the city of David: [see 1 Kings 2.on v.10.] and Joram his son became king in his stead.
\p
\v 2 . And he had brethren, the sons of Josaphat, Azaria, and Jehiel, and Zecharia, and Azariahu, and Michael, and Sephatia: All these were sons of Josaphat king of Israel. [That is, of the two tribes of Israel, Juda, and Benjamin, and of the cities which pertaining to the kingdom of Israel did join themselves to Juda. See above chap.13.19. and 15.9. and 19.4. Thus Josaphats Rulers are called Princes of Israel, below v.4. see also above chap.15.on v.17. and below chap.23.on v.2.]
\p
\v 3 . And their Father had given them many gifts silver, and of gold, and of choice costlinesses, [See of the Hebrew word, Gen.24.on v.53.] with fenced cities in Juda: but the Kingdom he gave to Joram, because he was the first-born. [for to the right of the first-born belonged also the dominion over his brethren. See Gen.25.on v.31. And hence may gathered, that Josaphat in making choice of his successor had more respect to the law of God, Deut.22.15. then to the sitness of the person, who was wicked by reason of a wicked wife that he had married, below v.6. and was not so good as his brethren, v.13.]
\p
\v 4 . When Joram was come up to the Kingdom of his Father, and had strengthened himself, then he slew all his brethren with the sword; as also (certain) of the Princes of Israel. [See above on v.2.]
\p
\v 5 . Joram was two and thirty years old, [Hebr. a son of two and thirty years] when he became king; and he reigned eight years at Jerusalem. [to wit, counting therein the years that he reigned with his Father: For he supplied his fathers place a while. See 1 Kings 22.on vers.42. and 2 Kings 8.on v.16.]
\p
\v 6 . And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, [That is, he imitated them in their idolatry and wickedness. So 2 Kings 16.3. and below chap.28.2, etc.] according as the house of Achab did; for he had the daughter of Achab [called Athalia, below ch.22.2. of whose idolatrous ungodliness, wickedness, and tyranny see in the same chapter, viz. chap 22.v,3,10. And chap.24.7.] to wife: And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD. [understand especially idolatry and tyranny. See 1 Kings 11.on v.6.]
\p
\v 7 . Yet the LORD would not destroy the house of David, [That is, the family and posterity of David. See 1 King.14.on v.10.] for the covenants sake, which he had made with David; [see 2 Sam.7.12. 1 Kings 11.36. Psa.132.11, 17.] and according as he had said; to give a lamp to him, and to his sons [see 1 Kings 11.on v.36.] at all days (or for ever.) [see 2 Sam.7.on v.13.]
\p
\v 8 . In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion [Heb. hand; that is, power, command, dominion] of Juda, [Under which power David had brought them, 2 Sam.8.14. and thus Isaacs prophecy came to be fulfilled, Gen.27.40.] and they made a king over them.
\p
\v 9 . Therefore Joram marched forth with his Princes, [To wit, to Sair, a place lying in Idumea, 2 Kings 8.21.] and all the charets with him: And he gat him up [Heb. he was getting him up, or, he was rising up] by night, and smote the Edomites that were round about him, and the Captains of the Charets.
\p
\v 10 . Not with standing the Edomites revolted from under the command of Juda unto this day; [That is, which revolting continueth unto this day. Understand the time of the Babylonish captivity. So 1 Chron.4.v41.] then, at the same time, Libna revolted from under his command: [see 2 Kings 8.on v.22.] for he had forsaken the LORD the God of his Fathers. [to wit, by abominable idolatry, which he not only practice himself, but whereunto he also publicilly and violently compelled his subjects. See the next verse.]
\p
\v 11 . Also he made high places [See Lev.26.on v.30.] on the mountains of Juda: And he caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, [that is, to commit idolatry, which is spiritual whoredome: so below v.13. See Lev.17.on v.7. and 20.on v.5.] yea he compelled Juda (thereto.)
\p
\v 12 . Then there came a writing to him from Elia the Prophet, [Meaning a written by Elia the Prophet, while Josaphat was yet alive, before whose death Elia was taken up into heaven, as may be gathered from 2 Kings 3.11. In this writing Elia had prophesied of the state and condition of the kingdom of Juda under Joram; as the man of God that came to Bethel, had prophesied a long while before of king Josia, 1 Kings 13.2. and Isaias of Cyrus, chapters 44. And 45. And Daniel of the Monarchies and kingdoms of the earth, Dan.2. and 7. Etc. unless it be conceived that this was another Elias then the Tisbite] saying; Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy Father, because thou hast not walked in the ways of Josaphat thy Father, and in the ways of Asa king of Juda: [see 1 Kings 15.on v.26.]
\p
\v 13 . But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, according to the whoring of the house of Achab: [Or, as the house of Achab hath caused (Israel) to go a whoring] and hast slain thy brethren of thy Fathers house, which were better then thou:
\p
\v 14 . Behold, the LORD will plague (thee) with a great plague in thy people, and in thy children, and in thy wives, and in all thy substance. [This phrase is found full and entire, and without insertion, below v.18. Oth. The LORD will plague thy people, and thy children, &c. with a great plagued. See the fulfilling of this threatening below v.16, etc.]
\p
\v 15 . Thou shalt also be in great [Or, many] diseases, by the disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the disease, year by year. [Hebr. days upon days; that is, year by year, to wit, two years. For this was the set time of this sickness or disease, below v.19. The word days is sometimes taken for full year, having all its days; So below v.19. See Lev.25.on v.29. Others understand this thus, that he should be daily troubled with this disease.]
\p
\v 16 . Then the LORD stirred up against Joram the spirit [That is, the Judgement, will, intent, mind. See 2 Kings 19.on vers.7.] of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, [meaning the inhabitants of the stony and high Arabia] which are at the side [Heb. at the hand. The word hand signifieth sometimes the side of any thing, as Job 1.14.] of the Moors.
\p
\v 17 . They marched up into Juda, and brake into it, [To wit, by force of arms, overrunning all, and breaking although all, to the very city of Jerusalem, yea also possessing themselves of the city, and plundering it, as appeareth by the words following] and carried away all the substance that was found in the kings house; even his sons also, and his wives: So that (there) was never a son left him, save Joahaz [called also Ahazia, below ch.22.1. and Azaria, below chap.22.6.] the least of his sons.
\p
\v 18 . And after all this the LORD plagued him in his bowels with a disease, which was not to be healed. [To wit, wherewith Elia had threatened him, above verse 15.]
\p
\v 19 . This came pass from year to year, [That is from the first year to the second] so that when the time of the end of the two years expired, [which Elia had determined in that writing] his bowels fell out by reason of the disease; (so) that he died of evil diseases: And his people made no burning for him, [to wit, of sweet-smelling, or precious spices. See above chap.16.on v.14.] like the burning of his Fathers.
\p
\v 20 . He was two and thirty (years) old when he became king, and reigned eight years at Jerusalem: And he departed, [That is, he went the way of all the Earth, as is said, Jos.23.14. 1 Kings 2.2. that is, he died] without being desired, [that is, he lived without honor, without delight, and in pain] and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the Sepulchres of the kings.
\c 22
\s Ahazia becometh king in his Fathers stead, v.1. &c. He followeth the sins of the house of Achab,3. Visiteth Joram king of Israel that was sick, 6. By this occasion he comes to be slain by Jehu, 8. Athalia having murdered all the Royal seed of the house of Juda, except in Joas, whom Josabath his Aunt had hid, usurpeth the government, 10.
\p
\v 1 And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahazia [see above chap.21.on ver.17.] his least [that is, the youngest in years. Compare Gen.19.on vers.31.] son king in his stead: For a hand that were come with the Arabians into the camp, [see hereof above ch.21.16,17.] had slain all the first: [that is, the eldest sons of Joram. Above cha.21.17. it’s only said that these souldiers had carried away the sons of Joram: But here it is now added that they also slew them] Ahazia then the son of Joram king of Juda reigned.
\p
\v 2 . Two and fourty years old [Hebr. a son of two and fourty years] was Ahazia when he became king, and he reigned one year at Jerusalem; [to wit, alone, as some do gather from 2 Kings 8.on v.26. Conceiving that a long time before he was held and acknowledged to be king, while his Father was unfit to govern. But how these two places are to be reconciled, is very obscure] and his mothers name was Athalia, a daughter of Omri. [she is likewise so called, 2 Kings 8.v.26. Meaning the daughter of Omri’s son, namely, Achab. See the annotate. On the forementioned place. Grand-children are in scripture called the sons and daughters of their Grand-fathers. See Gen.36.on v.2. yea also of all their Ancestors counted in a straignt or direct line upward, as appeareth Math.1.1 Luke 3.16.]
\p
\v 3 . He also walked in the ways of the house of Achab:[To wit, as his Father Joram had done, above ch.21.6.] For his mother was his Councellor, to deal wickedly.
\p
\v 4 . And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, like the house of Achab: [To wit, those that were of Achabs house] For they were his Counsellors, after the death of his Father, to his destruction. [so is the Hebrew word taken, Exod.12.13. Ezek.25.15. Dan.10.8.]
\p
\v 5 . He walked also in their counsel, [That is, he did not only hear their idolatrous counsel, but he did also walk after it] and went with Joram the son of Achab the king of Israel to battle, against Hazael king of Syria, by Ramoth [called also Rama, in the next verse, and 2 King.8.29. See likewise of this city, 1 Kings 4.13.] in Gilead: And the Syrians smotes Joram.
\p
\v 6 . And he returned to cause himself to be healed at Jizreel, [A city in the tribe of Issaschar, of which see Jos.19.18. and 1 Kings 4.12, etc.] for (he had) wounds, which they had given him by Rama, [or, there had been smitters, that had smitten him by Rama. Understand by these the Syrians, 2 Kings 9.15.] when he fought against Hazael the King of Syria: And Azaria [otherwise called Ahazia, above v.1. and 2. Item Joahaz, above chap.21.17.] the son of Joram King of Juda came down, to see Joram the son of Achab at Jizreel: For he was sick.
\p
\v 7 . Now the treading underfoot of Ahazia [Or, trampling, that is, the destruction of Ahazia, whereby he was subdued, and as it were tramped upon: Whereof see below vers.9.] was of God, [to wit, as of and from a righteous Judge, who is wont to punish the sins of men freely, and not by constrait, committed. Compare herewith 1 Kings 12.15. and the annotate. Thereon] that he came to Joram: [That is, which treading underfoot, or destruction was occasioned thereby, that Ahazia came to Joram, and tarried not at Home] for when he was come, he went out with Joram toward Jehu the son of Nimsi, whom the LORD had anointed, [to wit, by the command which he had given to the Prophet Elia, 1 King.19.16. and which Elia executed by the hand of Elisa, 2 Kings 9 6.] to detroy the house of Achab.
\p
\v 8 . So it came to pass when Jehu executed judgement against the house of Achab, [That is, punishment, which God had commanded Jehu to execute upon the house of Achab. So above chap.20.v.9. See the annotate.] that he found the Princes of Juda, and the sons of the brethren of Ahazia, [2 Kings 10.13. they are called the brethren of Ahazia. See the annotate. There] that ministred to Ahazia, and slew them. [compare 2 Kings 10.14.]
\p
\v 9 After that he sought Ahazia, and they caught him, (For he was hid in Samaria) and they brought him to Jehu, and they slew him, [See the exposition of this verse, 2 Kings 9.on v.27.] and buried him; [That is, they suffered him to be carried to Jerusalem, to be buried there] for they said, he is the son of Josaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart: [compare above chap.15.12.] So the house of Ahazia had none that kept power for the Kingdom. [perhaps because they were too young, to whom the kingdom by way of succession did belong, or because Athalia’s power was too great.]
\p
\v 10 . When Athalia the mother of Ahazia saw that her son was dead, [See the exposition of this and the following verses, 2 Kings 11.v,1,2,3.] then she gat her up, and destroyed all the royal seed [Hebr. the seed of the kingdom] of the house of Juda.
\p
\v 11 . But Josaphat [Hebr. Jehoschabath: Oth. Also called Ichoscheba, 2 Kings 11.2.] the daughter of the king, [namely, of Joram the son of Josaphat, and consequently the sister of Ahazia, 2 Kings 11.2.] took Joas [oth. Called Jehoasch, 2 Kings 12.2.] the son of Ahazia, and stole him from the midst of the Kings sons that were slain; and put him and his nurse [that had given him suck, or as yet gave him suck: For he was but a year old. Compare below chap.23. the annotate. On v.2.] in a bed-chamber: [Hebr. a chamber of beds. See 2 Kings 11 the annotate.on v.2.] So Josaphat the daughter of king Joram, the wise of Jojada [Hebr. Jehojada. See of this man, 2 Kings 11.on v.4.] the Priests; (for she was the sister of Ahazia) hid him from Athalia, (so) that she slew him not.
\p
\v 12 . And he was with them hid in the house of God six years; [The meaning is, that Joas with his nurse had secretly been kept, and bred up the high Priest and his wife, in one of the chambers that were at the Temple] and Athalia reigned over the land. [namely, of Juda.]
\c 23
\s Joas at the ages of seven years is made king by Jojada’s direction, ver.1,&c. Athalia is put to death, 12. The covenant between the LORD and the King with his people is renewed, 16. Idolatry removed, 17. Ecclesiastical order re-established, 18. And the King brought home to his house with Joy. 20.
\p
\v 1 But in the seventh year, [To wit, after that Joas the kings son had been hid by Josabath his Aunt, left he should be murdered by Athalia his grand-mother. For he was hid six years in the temple, above chap.22.12. and this happened the year following: at which time also Joas was seven years old, below chap.24.1.] Jojada strengthened himself, and took the Captains of the hundreds, Azaria the son of Jeroham, and Ismael the so of Hadaja, and Elisaphat the son of Sichri, into a covenant with him. [See likewise this history with some expositions, 2 Kings 11.4, etc. where the same is first set down.]
\p
\v 2 . They went about in Juda, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Juda, and the heads of the fathers [Observe, that two sorts of persons were gathered, 1. The Levites, which were in the Church-office. 2. The heads of the Fathers, that is, of the fatherly Houses, or Families: meaning the chiefest and eldest of the congregation] of Israel: [that is, of Juda and Benjamin, together with the cities of Israel that joined themselves to them. Compare herewith, above chap.15.17. and 21.2. and the Annotations] and they came to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 3 . And all that congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God: and be [Namely, Jojada the High Priest] said unto them; Behold, the kings son shall be king, according as the LORD had spoken of the sons of David. [See 2 Sam.7.13. 2 Chron.21.7.]
\p
\v 4 . This is the thing, that ye shall do: A third part of you, that enter in on the Sabbath, of the Priests, and of the Levites, shall be porters of the thresholds. [Others, Sippim: holding it be the name of a gate. See 2 Kings 11.on vers.6.]
\p
\v 5 . And a third part shall be at the kings house; and a third part at the foundation-gate: [The chiefest gate of the Temple, standing East-ward, and called the gate of the foundation, because it was the lowermost, standing upon the foundation of the temple, at the greatest, and lowermost Court. It is also called the gate of Sur, 2 kings.11.6. and the high gate, 2King.15.35. Item the beautiful gate, Acts 3.2.] and all the people [meaning, the other Levites, which had not then the ordinary guard, together with the common people] shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD. [That is, in the outermost, and great Court, called the peoples court, because the congregation met there; and it’s put here in the Plural Number, viz. Courts, because of the diversity of parts, the several partitions that were in it. So likewise the Temple is called Sanctuaries, because it consisted of divers partitions, Lev.26.31.]
\p
\v 6 . But let none come into the house of the LORD, [Understand the foremost part of the house of the Lord, called the holy place, 1 Kings 8.10.] save the Priests, and the levites, that minister; they shall go in, for they are holy; [Hebr. holiness, that is, separated to an holy service. So Numb.16.5. and Ezra 8.28.] but all the people shall keep the watch of the Lord. [To wit, to keep them out by force, that would violently break in. Or, shall keep the watch of the LORD, that is, the command of the LORD, tarrying in the Court, without entering into the holy place.]
\p
\v 7 . Now the Levites shall compass the King round about, every man with his weapons in his hand, [Namely, those Levites that went out on the Sabbath: that is, those that had discharge their duty, and had finished their function in course, 2 Kings 11.7.] and he that cometh into the house, [that is, unto the Temple, between the ranks and files of the guard that was set, 2 Kings 11.8.] shall be to death: but be ye with the king, when he cometh in, [to wit, in the Temple, below vers.11.] and goeth out. [To wit, out of the Temple, below vers.20.]
\p
\v 8 . And the Levites, and all Juda, did according to all, that Jojada the Priest had commanded; and they [Namely, the Captains of hundreds, of whom see above vers.1. and compare 2 Kings 11.9.] took every man his men, [to wit, that were designed them of the Levites by Jojada the Priest had not given the divisions [of these divisions, or, courses, see 1 Chron.23,24,25,26. Chap.] leave (to depart) [Out of these courses or divisions no man might step away, unless he had leave given him to depart: which for the present Jojada would not grant even to those that came off from the guard, to the end that there might be a double watch, to dispatch this business.]
\p
\v 9 . Moreover, Jojada the Priest delivered to the captains of hundreds, the spears, and the buckers, and the shields, that had been king Davids, [See 2 Kings 11.on vers.10.] which were in the house of God.
\p
\v 10 . And he set all the people, and every man with his weapon [The word in the original signifieth properly such kind of weapon, as a man throweth out of his hand at another to hurt him therewith] in his hand, [to wit, that no man might violently break into the Priests Court, or into the holy place. Compare herewith above the end of vers.6.] from the right side of the house, to the left side of the house, toward the Altar, [meaning, the Altar of burnt-offering, which stood in the Priests Court] and toward the house, [to wit, the Sanctuary] by the King round about.
\p
\v 11 . Then they brought forth the Kings son, [To wit, out of his chamber, in which he had been hidden six years, above chap.22.11.] and put upon him the crown, [an head-ornament pertaining to Kings, 2 Sam.1.10. Psalm 89.40. and 132.8.] and (gave him) the testimony, [see 2 Kings 11.on vers.12.] and they made him king: and Jojada, and his sons anointed him, and said; Let the King live. [Compare 1 Sam.10.4. 1 Kings 1.39.]
\p
\v 12 . Now when Athalia heard the voice of the people, that ran together, and praised the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 13 . And she looked on, and behold, the king stood by his pillar, [Where the royal scaffold was; of which see also 1 Kings 11.on vers.14. and above chap 6.on vers.13.] at the entering; [to wit, of the inner court called the Priests court, above chap.4.9. Item, the new court, above chap.20.5. See of it further 1 Kings 6.on vers.36.] and the rulers [to wit, of the people of the Jews] and the trumpets [that is, the Trumpeters] were by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets; [to wit, by the Priests, to whom that work properly belonged, as appeareth by the Law, Numb.10.8. and by examples, and the Singers were there [or, (rejoiced) which word goeth before, and may now again anew be fitly inserted] with musical instruments, and signified, that praise ought to be sung: [namely, unto the Lord] then Athalia rent her clothes, and she cried; Treason, Treason.
\p
\v 14 . But Jojada the Priest brought the captains of the hundreds, that were set over the host, and said unto them; Bring her forth without the ranks, [See 2 Kings 11.on vers.8.] and whoso followeth her, shall be slain with the sword: for the Priest had said, Ye shall not slay her in the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 15 . And they laid hands on her, [Others, they made room for her: or, they placed a side-guard upon her, or, they gave her room, to wit, to go forth out of the Temple] and she went towards the entering of the horse-gate, [see 2 Kings 11.on vers.16.] towards the Kings house, and they slew her there.
\p
\v 16 . And Jojada made a covenant between him, [Namely, the LORD, as may be gathered from 2 Kings 11.17. and here from the end of this verse] and between all the people, and between the King; that they should be a people unto the LORD. [Others, between himself, and between all the people, etc. meaning, that Jojada, the people, and the king had bound themselves together in a firm league and covenant, to be the LORDS people, or to be a people unto the LORD. See the like example, Jos.24.25.]
\p
\v 17 . After that all the people went into the house of Baal, and brake that down, and they brake his altars, and his images in pieces: and they slew Matthan the Priests of Baal before the Altars.
\p
\v 18 . Now Jojada appointed the officers in the house of the LORD, under the hand of the Levitical Priests; whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt-offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the Law of Moseh, with rejoicing, and with singing; according to Davids institution. [Hebr. according to Davids hands: that is, as David by the instinct of Gods spirit had ordained, and had delivered, and left to the Church of God. So below chap.29.27. and Ezra 3.10.]
\p
\v 19 . And he set the porters at the gate of the house of the LORD: that none being unclean in any thing, might enter in.
\p
\v 20 . And he took the captains of the hundreds, and the mighty (one.) [Or, the honorable, respectful, most excellent (ones)] and those that had the dominion among the people; and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and (they) came thorough the midst of the high gate, [some do understand hereby the greatest, and the chiefest gate of the kings house, at which the kings guards kept watch and ward, and is therefore called the Guards gate, 2 Kings 11.19.] in this sense this gate is to be distinguished from the gate of the Temple, whereof above vers.5. See the Annotations there] into the Kings house: and they set the King upon throne of the Kingdom.
\p
\v 21 . And all the people of the land rejoiced, and all the city was quiet; after they had slain Athalia with the sword.
\c 24
\s Joas is religious, as long as Jojada liveth, vers.1, etc. He marrieth two wives, 3. Causeth the Temple to be repaired, 4. Jojada dieth, 15. Is very honorably buried, 16. Joas becometh an idolater, 17. Causeth Zacharia the son of Jojada to be put to death, for reproving idolatry, 20. He is preyed upon and smitten by the Syrians, 23. Murdered by his own servants, 25. Amazia his becometh King, 27.
\p
\v 1 Joas was seven years old, [Hebr. a son of seven years. See above chap.23.on vers.1.] when he became king, and he reigned fourty years at Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Zibia, of Ber-Seba.
\p
\v 2 . And Joas did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, all the days of Jojada the Priest. [That is, as long as Jojada was alive, who ceased not to instruct as him in the ways of the Lord, 2 Kings 12.2.]
\p
\v 3 . And Jojada took for him two wives, [That is, he chose two wives for him, whom he sought out in due manner, and joined them to him in wedlock] and he begat sons and daughters.
\p
\v 4 . Now it came to pass after this, that it was in the heart of Joas, [That is, that Joas was minded, or had an intent. So 1 Kings 8.17,18. See the Annotations] to renew the house of the LORD. [That is, to repair, or to mend, that which was broken, and decayed in it.]
\p
\v 5 . So he gathered together the Priests and the Levites, and said unto them; Go out into the cities of Juda, gather money of all Israel, [Meaning the Israelites, that were under the jurisdiction of Juda. See above chap.15.on vers.17. and 21.on vers.2.] to repair [Hebr. strengthen, that is, to renew, as vers.4. So 2 Kings 12.5,6. And below vers.12.] the house of your God, from year to year; [because it could not be repaired in one year, or, for that it was to be repair every year] and make ye haste for this matter, [Hebr. for this word] but the Levites made no haste.
\p
\v 6 . And the King called Jojada, the chief, [To wit, of the priests; that is, the chief Priest. The word Priest, is added thereto, below vers.11. See also Neh.12.on v.7.] and said unto him; Why hast thou not made search, [Or, not enquired] among the Levites, to bring in out of Juda, and out of Jerusalem, the tax [Or, levy, collection, charge] of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the Congregation of Israel, for the Tent of the Testimony? [meaning such a tax, levy, or collection, as Moseh had commanded for the making of the Tabernacle in the wilderness, Exod.30.12,13. And 38.24.25. which happened not yearly, but as necessity required. Compare the Annotations on Exod.30.12. Others conceive that this collection was ordained, and was made duly every year, for the maintaining of the worship of God, and its appurtenances. See of the Tent of witness, or, testimony, Numb.1.on vers.50.]
\p
\v 7 . For when Athalia dealt wickedly, her sons [Namely, Ahazia with some of his next kinsmen. See above chap.21.16,17. For the rest of her sons were carried away captive in the life-time of Joram her husband. Otherwise the Plural Number is here used for the Singular; as Gen.21.7. unless we should say, that Athalia’s sons had done the thing here mentioned, before their captivity] had broken up the house of God, [Others, the sons of Athalia, that wicked woman, had, etc. Hebr. For Athalia dealing wickedly, her sons had, etc.] yea even bestowed all [that is, all manner, or, the greatest part] the hallowed thing [see Lev.16.on vers.4.] of the house of the LORD upon Baalim. [That is, Idols. See Judges 2.on vers.11.]
\p
\v 8 . And the King commanded, [Hebr. said; that is here, commanded; to wit, by the advice of Jojada the High Priest, as may be gathered from 2 Kings 12.2.] and they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD. [To wit, of the peoples Court; on the right hand, as they entered into the Temple of the Lord. See 2 Kings 12.9. and the Annotations thereon.]
\p
\v 9 . And they made proclamation in Juda, and in Jerusalem, [Hebr. and they gave a voice in Juda. Etc. that is, they caused proclamation to be made. Of the word voice for proclamation, see Exod.36.6. and the Annotat. Item Ezra 1.1.] to bring in to the LORD the tax [see above on vers.6.] of Moseh the servant of the LORD over Israel [that is, charged upon Israel by God, and imposed upon them by Moseh] in the wilderness.
\p
\v 10 . Then all the Princes, and all the people rejoiced: and they brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end. [To wit, of repairing the house of the Lord. See vers.14. Others, until it became full.]
\p
\v 11 . Now it came to pass, at the time when he [Namely, Jojada the High Priest] brought in the chest [to wit, out of the place where it stood, into one of the chambers that were in the Temple, for to take out the money there, to pursue it, and to tell it out. Compare 2 Kings 12.10. and the Annotations] at the Kings command by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money; that the Kings Scribe came, and the chief Priests and officers, [that is, those that were appointed for this work by the High Priest. In their room the High Priest himself is mentioned, 2 Kings 12 10. For a man may be said to do that himself, which he doth by another. See Gen.40.on vers.22.] and emptied the chest, and took it up, and carried it to his place again: [see of this place above on vers.8.] thus they did from day to day, and gathered money in abundance;
\p
\v 12 . Which the King, and Jojada gave to those, that had the care of the work of the service of the house of the LORD; [Hebr. that did the work, etc. That is, that provided it, or had the care of it. And understand thereby the Chiefest over-seers over the work, that it mighty by them be given to the workmen, or labourers: for there was more than one over-seer. See 2 Kings 12.on vers.11.] and they hired hewers, [the Hebrew word signifieth as well hewers stone, as hewers of wood. See 1 Kings 5.on vers.15.] and carpenters, [the word that is used in the original, is indeed ascribed to sundry artificers or handy-crafts-men, as appeareth, Exod.35 35. And 38. 23. 2 Chron.22.15. Isai 45.16, etc. and here in the following words of this verse; but that it is to be understood here of Carpenters, may be here truly gathered from the foregoing and following words] to renew the house of the LORD: together with workmen also in iron, and copper, to mend the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 13 . So the providers of the work caused the repairing [Hebr. health] of the work to go on by their hand: [the meaning is, that the work of Building by the diligent care of the over-seers came to good perfection. The Hebrew word is likewise so taken, 1 Kings 18.30. Nehem.4.7.] and they restored the house of God in his shape, [The Hebrew word signifieth here a well-ordered form, or a right-fashioned, or, regular structure, having its due proportion, shape, and dimension] and made it strong.
\p
\v 14 . Now when they had finished (its,) [To wit, the repairing and mending of the Temple] they brought the rest of the money before the King and Jojada, [to wit, the providers, and over-seers of the work did so, who were intrusted by the king and Jojada to lay out this money aright, above vers.12.] whereof he [to wit, the king] made vessels for the house of the LORD, vessels to minister, and to offer (withal,) [Others, monitors] and incense-bowels, and gold, and silver vessels; and they offered burnt-offerings continually in the house of the LORD all the days of Jojada. [That is, as long as Jojda lived. So above vers.2.]
\p
\v 15 . And Jojada waxed old, and full of days, [See Gen.25.8. and the Annotat. Item Gen.35.29. 1 Chron.23.1. and 29.28.] and died, he was an hundred and thirty years old, [Hebr. a son of an hundred and thirty years] when he died.
\p
\v 16 . And they buried him in the city of David, by the kings: for he had done good [To wit, kept the young king from the cruel and murderous Athalia, brought him well up, and instructed him, set him upon the royal throne, put to death wicked Athalia, repaired the Temple, and restored the pure worship of God] in Israel, [that ,is, in the land of Juda, and that which appertained thereto, which was a part of Israel, this name being taken generally. See above chap.21.on vers.2.] both towards God [in restoring his worship, above chap 23.18. and here vers.14.] and (towards) his house. [Meaning, his Temple, which was repaired by the advice and managing of Jojada.
\p
\v 17 . But after the death of Jojada, came the Princes of Juda, and bowed themselves down before the King: [To wit, suing unto him, for the bringing in of idolatry again into the land, as probably may be gathered from the following verse] then the king hearkened unto them. [That is, he granted their suit, or, request.]
\p
\v 18 . So they left the house of the LORD the God of their fathers and served the groves, and the idols: [Hebr. sorrows. See 1 Sam.31.on vers.9.] then great wrath [namely, of God. See below chap.28.on vers.13.] was upon Juda, and Jerusalem, for this their trespass.
\p
\v 19 . Yet he sent Prophets among them, to cause them to return unto the LORD: they testified against them, [That is, called heaven and earth to witness against them] but they inclined not (their) ears.
\p
\v 20 . And the spirit of God put Zecharia [Or, clothed; that is, the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and arrayed him as a garment. See Judges 6.on vers.34.] the son of Jojada the Priest, who stood above the people, [that is, in a place that was higher than the place wherein the people were assembled; from which place Zachariah spake, that he might be the better heard] and he said unto them; Thus saith God; Why trangress ye the commandments of the Lord? Therefore ye shall not be prosperous; [compare 2 Chron.15 2.] because ye have foesaken the LORD, therefore he will forsake you.
\p
\v 21 . And they made a conspiracy against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the King, [See Matth.23.35.] in the court of the house of the LORD. [To wit, in the peoples court, as some conceive. Others understand this of the priests court, so that this murder should have been commited. Between the Altar and the Porch of the Temple; to wit, as it were before the face of the Lord. The opinion of many is, that the Lord Jesus Christ hath respect to this passage, Matth.23.34. and that Jojada is called there Baracha.]
\p
\v 22 . Thus king Joas remembered not the kindness, which Jojada his father had done to him, [Of which see above chap.23.] but slew his son: who when he died, said; The LORD will look upon it, and require (it.) [Namely, my bloud at the hands of these murderers, and at the hand of him that commanded the murder to be done. That is, God will punish and avenge it. See Gen.9.5. and 42.23. and the Annotations. Others, the LORD seeth it, and will require it: or, the Lord look upon it, and require it.]
\p
\v 23 . Therefore it came to pass with the circuit of the year, that the forces of Syria marched up against him, and they came to Juda, and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the Princes of the people from among the people: and they sent all the spoil of them unto the King of Damascus. [Hebr. Syria. See Gen.14.on vers.15.]
\p
\v 24 . Albeit that the army of the Syrians came with few men; yet not with standing the LORD delivered an army of great multitude into their hand, because they had forsake the LORD the God of their fathers: [Compare above chap.12. the annotations on vers.2.] so they [namely, the Syrians] executed the judgements against Joas. [That is, the punishments of God, which he had deserved of Zacharia. For it seemeth likewise by the following verse, that the Syrians had wounded him.]
\p
\v 25 . And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases) his servants made a conspiracy against him, [see 1 Kings 15. The Annotations on vers.27.] for the blouds; that is, for the murder commited on Zacharia. See 1 Kings 2.on vers.33.] of the sons of Jojada the Priests, [That is, of Zacharia the son of Jojada the priest; the plural number being here put for the Singular. See above v.7. and the Annotations: unless we should say that Jojada had more sons, that were put to death: or at least by sons are here to be meant the sons of Zacharia, because children seem to have been sometimes destroyed with their fathers. Compare 2 Kings 9.vers.26. and above chap.24 4.] and they slew him on his bed, that he died, and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the Sepulchres of the Kings.
\p
\v 26 . Now these are they, that made a covenant against him, Zahad, [Called also Jozachar, 2 Kings 12.21.] the son of Simath the Ammonitess, and Jozahad the son of Simrith [otherwise called Somer, 2 Kings 12.21.] the Moabitess.
\p
\v 27 . Now concerning his sons, [Which he had, or also left behind] and the greatness of the burden (laid) upon him, [That is, of the taxation, wherewith he was changed, or burdened, to redeem the plundering and spoiling of Jerusalem of Hazael, 2 Kings 12.18. Others understand this of the collections or taxes, which he laid upon the people, toward the building and repairing of the Temple] and the building of the house of God, [Hebr. the ground-work, or, foundation, etc. that is, the building on the house of God] behold, they are written in the History of the book of the kings: [the Hebrew word Midruseh hath its name from seeking, because therein the acts and deeds of Kings were diligently sought out, gathered together, and recorded. So above chap.13.22.] and Amazia his son became king in his stead.
\c 25
\s Amazia reigneth well in the beginning, vers.1, etc. He avengeth his Fathers death, 3. He prepareth to fight against Edom, not onely with his own people, but also with hired Israelites, 5. He dishandeth those hired Souldiers, by the Prophets advice, 7. With his own men he conquereth the Edomites, 11. Is damnified by the disbanded Israelites, 13. Falleth to idolatry, 14. Challengeth the king of Israel presumptouosly into the field, 17. Is smitten by him, 22. Is driven away, and murdered by his own people, 27.
\p
\v 1 Amazia being five and twenty years old, [Hebr. a son of five and twenty years] became king, and reigned nine and twenty years at Jerusalem: and his mothers name was Joadan of Jerusalem.
\p
\v 2 . And he did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: but not with a perfect heart. [He had, it’s true, restored the pure worship of God, which in his fathers time, after the death of Jojada, was decayed, but afterward he became an idolater, and a rejector of prophetical admonition, as also a rash, bold, presumptuous, and unlucky warrior.]
\p
\v 3 . Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him; that he slew his servants, [Of which see above chap.24. vers.26.] that had smitten the king his father. [That is, had killed him, above chap.24.25. Of the word smiting, see Gen.8.on vers.22.]
\p
\v 4 . But he slew not their children, [which indeed seemeth to have been done sometimes. See above ch.24. the Annotation on vers.25.] but he (did) as it is written in the Law, in the book of Moseh, where the LORD commanded, saying; The fathers shall not thy for the children, neither shall the children thy for the fathers; but every man shall day for his (own) sin. [This Law doth properly concern Magistrates and Governors, or the higher powers among men. See Deut.24.16. 2 Kings 14 6. Jer.31.30. Ezech.18.20.]
\p
\v 5 . And Amazia gathered Juda together, and made them captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, according the houses of the fathers, [That is, the families of the chiefest. Compare Exod.6.12.] thorough out all Juda, and Benjamin: and he mustered them, from twenty years old, [Hebr. from the son of twenty years] and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice (men), going forth to war, handling spear, and buckler. [See above chap.11.on vers.12.]
\p
\v 6 . Moreover, he hired an hundred thousand valiant champions out of Israel, [That is, out of the ten Tribes] for an hundred talents of silver. [Of the value of these see Exod.25.on vers.39.]
\p
\v 7 . But there came a man of God [That is, a Prophet. See Judges 13.on vers.6.] unto him, saying; O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee, for the LORD is not with Israel, [to wit, because they are turned aside from the LORD unto Idols] with all the children of Ephraim. [Understand by these Israel, as goeth before; that is, the ten Tribes, which are so called, because Ephraim was indeed the chiefest of those Tribes, and Jerobeam their first King descended of the Tribe of Ephraim. Thus Ephraim is used for Israel, Isai.17.3. and 28.1,etc.]
\p
\v 8 . But if thou goest, do it, be strong for the battle: [He speaketh ironically, thereby intimating, that if he would needs make use of the Israelites that he had lifted, that it should not prosper with him. Such kind of commands given in an ironical and jearing way, serve to reprove and threaten men. See 1 Kings 22.on vers.15.] God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for in God is power to help, and to cause to fall.
\p
\v 9 . And Amazia said unto the man of God; But what shall we do with the hundred talents, [whereof mention is made above vers.6.] which I have given to the hands of Israel? [With those hundred talents he had lifted and admitted into his service an hundred thousand Souldiers out of Israel] and the man of God said; The LORD hath more than this to give thee.
\p
\v 10 . Then Amazia separated them, to wit, the hands that were come to him out of Ephraim [That is, out of Israel, or the ten Tribes, as above vers.7.] to go to their place: therefore their anger kindled greatly against Juda, and they returned to their place in heat of anger.
\p
\v 11 . Noe Amazia strengthened himself, and led forth his people, [To wit, those that he had lifted out of his own subjects] and marched into the valley of Salt, [See 2 Sam.8.on vers.13. and 2 Kings 14.on vers.7.] and smote of the children of Seir, [that is, of the Edomites, 2 Kings 14 7. That dwelt in the country of Seir, Gen.36.on vers.8. Deut.2.3.] ten thousand.
\p
\v 12 . Besides the children of Juda took ten thousand alive, [As they had slain ten thousand; in the former verse] and brought them up to the top of the rock, [to wit, whereupon the city of Selah lay; of which see 2 Kings 14.on vers.7.] and thrust them down from the top of the rock, that they all burst (in pieces.)
\p
\v 13 . But the men of the hands, [Hebr. the sons of the hand: that is, the hundred thousand Israelites, which Amazia had lifted, to use them in the war against the Edomites, above vers.6.] which Amazia caused to turn back, that they should not go with him into the battle, they made an inrode into the cities of Juda, [that is, pertaining to the Kingdom of Juda; which cities were the frontier Towns of the Kingdom of Juda, bordering all along in the breadth thereof upon the Kingdom of Israel] from Samaria unto Beth-Horon, [see of a two-fold Beth-Horon, viz. the lower and the upper Beth-Horon, 1 Kings 9. On vers 17. Here seemeth to be spoken of the lower, which lay in the Tribe of Benjamin] And smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.
\p
\v 14 . Now it came to pass, after that Amazia was come from smitting the Edomites, and that he had brought with him the gods of the children of Seir; [Meaning, the Images of the Edomites Idols] that he set them up to himself for gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.
\p
\v 15 . Then the anger LORD Kindled against Amazia: and he sent unto him a Prophet, which said unto him; Why hast thou sought the gods of that people, which have not delivered their (own) people out of thine hand? [This question reproveth the King, and threateneth him, that he should be no more helped by those Idols, than the Edomites had been helped by them.]
\p
\v 16 . And it came to pass, when he spake unto him, that he said unto him; Have they made thee the kings counselors? Forbear [Hebr. forbear for thy self; that is, for thine own good, or, that shall be best for thee. See Gen.12.on vers.1.] why should they [meaning his guard, that were there present] smite thee? [He threateneth the Prophet, that if he forbear not to reprove him, he would give his guard charge to kill him, or least to hurt and mischief him] then the Prophet forbore, and said; I perceive that God hath determined [Hebr. advised, took counsel, or, determined in his counsel] to destroy thee, because thou hast done that, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.
\p
\v 17 . And Amazia King of Juda was advised, to send [To wit, messengers, or, ambassadors, 2 Kings 14.] to Joas the son of Joahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, to say; Come, let us see one anothers face. [That is, march out into the field against one another, to fight together, and to encounter each other with armed power, and so to look one another in the face. See 2 Kings.14.on v.8.]
\p
\v 18 . But Joas the king of Israel sent to Amazia the King of Juda, to say to him, the Thistle that is on Libanon, sent to the Cedar that is on Libanon, to say; give thy daughter to my son to wife: but the beast of the field that is on Libanon, passed by, and trod down the thistle. [See the exposition of this parable, 2 Kings 14.on v.9.]
\p
\v 19 . Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; [Yea, smitting smitten, as it is said, 2 King.14.10. that is, smitten them stoutly and mightly] therefore thine heart hast lift thee up to boast: Abide now at home: Why shouldest thou mingled thy self in evil, that thou shouldest fall, thou, and Juda with thee.
\p
\v 20 . But Amazia hearkened not; for it was of God [See 1 King.12.15. and the annotate. Thereon] that he might deliver them into (their) hand; because they had sought the Gods of the Edomites.
\p
\v 21 . So Joas the King of Israel marched up, and he, and Amazia the King of Juda saw one anothers face, [See above on vers.17.] at Beth-Semes, which is in Juda. [and is therefore to be distinguished from another of this name lying in Naphtali, Josh.19.38. Judg.1.33.]
\p
\v 22 . And Juda was smitten before the face of Israel: And they fled, every man into his tents.
\p
\v 23 . And Joas the king of Israel took Amazia the King of Juda, the son of Joas, the son of Joahaz [Otherwise called Ahazia, and Azaria. See above chap.21.17. and 22.1,6. With the annotate.] at Beth-Semes: And he brought him to Jerusalem, and he brake off the wall of Jerusalem, from the gate of Ephraim [See 2 king.14. on v.13.] to the corner-gate, [Hebr. which was looking out, or, to the gate looking out: It is so called, because it stuck out at a corner of the city; wherefore it is also called the corner-gate, both here, and 2 King.14.13.] four hundred ells (or cubits.)
\p
\v 24 . Moreover, he (took) all the gold, and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God, with Obed-Edom, [that is, with the posterity of Obed-Edom, who were porters, and keepers of the treasures in the house of God, 1 Chron.26.15.] and the treasures of the kings house, together with the hostages: [Hebr. sons of pledges, or, of pawns. See 2 Kings 14. On vers.14. and he returned to Samaria.
\p
\v 25 . Now Amazia, the son of Joahaz, the king of Israel, fifteen years.
\p
\v 26 . The rest of acts of Amazia, the first, and the last, behold, are they not written in the book of the Kings of Juda and Israel?
\p
\v 27 . Now from the time that Amazia had turned away from after the LORD, [That is, from following the Lord] they made a conspiracy against him [see 1 Kings 15.on vers.27.] in Jerusalem, but he fled to Lachis: [see of this city, 1 Kings 14.on vers.19.] Then they sent after him to Lachis, and slew him there.
\p
\v 28 . And they brought him upon horses, and buried him by his Fathers in the city of Juda. [That is, in Jerusalem; which city, although it lay partly in the borders of Benjamin, and party in Juda; yet not with standing it is chiefly called a city of Juda, because it was the chief city, where the Kings of Juda kept their court. See 2 Kings 14.20.]
\c 26
\s Uzzia succeedeth in the room of his Father Amazia, vers. 1, &c. reigneth well in the days of Zacharia, 4. Obtaineth great victories over his Enemies, 6. Furnisheth the city of Jerusalem, and his own house, 9. Strengtheneth his kingdom with souldiers, arms and artificial Engines forward, 11. He transgresseth in attempting to burn incense before the LORD, 16. For which he is punished with Leprosy, 19. He dieth, and Jotham his son reigneth, 23.
\p
\v 1 Then all the people of Juda took Uzzia, [Called also Azaria, 2 Kings 14.21.] (who was now sixteen years old) [Hebr. a son of sixteen years; and so in the sequel] and made him king in the room of his Father Amazia. [to wit, when his Father Amazia fled to Lachis. See 2 Kings 14on vers.21.]
\p
\v 2 . The same built Eloth, [Called also Elath, 2 Kings 14.22. See of this city, 1 Kings 9.on vers.26.] and brought it again to Juda, after that the king was fallen asleep with his Fathers. [see 2 kings 14.22.]
\p
\v 3 . Uzzia was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned two and fifty years at Jerusalem: And his mothers name was Jecholia of Jerusalem. [Compare 2 Kings 15.2.]
\p
\v 4 . And he did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, [that is, he set up, and maintained the pure worship of God, which was fallen to decay about the end of Amazia’s reign] according to all that his Father Amazia had done. [in the government of his kingdom he did not only follow the footsteps of his Father, but was also become like unto him in the last. But as his Father Amazia, after that he had overcome the Edomites, fell to idolatry, above chap.25.14. so likewise did Uzzia, after that he became mighty and succesfull, fall into his presumption, that he would entrench upon the Priests office, bel.vers.16.]
\p
\v 5 . For he gave himself to seek God, [Hebr. he was to seek God. What it is to seek God, see above chap.11.on v.16. Understand that he was busy of wholly taken up in seeking of God] in the days of Zacharia, who was understanding [oth. Who made (him) understanding: that is, who taught and instructed him: for the Hebrew word signifieth not only to have understanding, and to be understanding; but also sometimes to make another wise and understanding, by good doctrine and instruction] in the visions of God: [oth. In the fears of God. Understand by visions here, the whole doctrine of that which was to be believed, and practised unto salvation, revealed by Moseh, and the rest of the Prophets, and by them daily whetted upon the people, expounded and applied unto them] now in the days that he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper.
\p
\v 6 . For he marched forth, and warred against the Philistines, and brake (down) the wall of Gath, [See of this city, 1 Kings 2.on v.39.] and the wall of Jabne, [a city of Philistines by the midland sea] and the wall of Asdod: [also a city in the land of the Philistines: of which see Josh.11.22. and 15.46. 1 Sam.5.1.] moreover he built cities in Asdod, [understand the country belonging to the city of Asdod] and among the Philistines.
\p
\v 7 . And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians which dwelt at Garbaal, [A place lying south-ward of Judea, as the Philistines were west-ward of it, and the Ammonites East-ward] and (against) the mountains. [the name of a certain country and people.]
\p
\v 8 . And the Ammonites, [See above chap.20.on vers.1.] gave gifts to Uzzia, and his name went to the entering in of Egypt: [That is, he became very famous and renowned. Compare 1 Chron.14.17. and bel.vers.15. of this chapter, Ezek.16.14.] For he strengthened himself in the highest (degree.) [the word in the original is likewise so taken, 1 Chron.14.2. and 23.17. and 29.25. 2 Chron.1.1.]
\p
\v 9 . Moreover, Uzzia built towers at Jerusalem, [To wit, at the walls, which Joas the King of Israel in Amazia’s time had broken down, above chap.25.23.] at the corner gate, [Hebr. the gate of the corner. See 2 Kin.14.on vers.13.] and at the valley-gate. [Hebr. the gate of the valley. See of this gate, Nehem.2.13. and 3.13.] and at the corners: [or, turnings; to wit, of the wall. Others keep the word Mikzoa, as the proper name of a tower or strong hold standing in the highest part of the city of David. See hereof also, Neh.3.vers.19.24.] and he fortified them.
\p
\v 10 . Also he built towers in the wilderness, [Namely, of Arabia, to prevent and hinder the inrodes from thence, which were made in the days of Joram, above chap 21.16.] and digged many well, [wherein they gathered and kept water for the use both of man and beast] because he had much cattle, both in the low grounds and in the plains; Husband-men, and vine-dressers on the mountains, and on the fruitful fields: [oth. Carmel; that is, in the Region or country belonging to the city of Carmel, lying by the wilderness of Moan, in the tribe of Juda, very fruitfull, and abounding with great store of fruits ands vineyards. Elsewhere Carmel is a mountain lying in the tribe of Issaschar, exceeding well planted, sowen, and very fruitfull. See 1 Kings.18.on vers.19. from whence in ariseth that fruitfull countries are called a Carmel. See 2 Kings 19.on ver.23.] for he was a lover of husbandry.
\p
\v 11 . Moreover, Uzzia had an host of trained (men) for war [Understand some ordinary bands of souldiers, which the King had in readiness for any urgent occasion that might happen. Compare 1 Chron.27. and above cha.17.14.] marching out to war by hands, according to thye number of their mustering, by the hand of Jeiel the Scribe, and Mahaseja the Ruler. [that is, which mustering was performed by means of Jeiel etc.] under the hand [that is, under the conduct. So vers.13.] of Hanania (one) of the kings Princes.
\p
\v 12 . The whole number of the heads of the Fathers, [So above chap.23.2.] of the warlike champions, was two thousand and six hundred.
\p
\v 13 . And under their hand was an army of three hundred thousand, and seven thousand, and five hundred, that with warlike power exercised themselves for war, [Hebr. doing war; that is, which practiced war, were sit for war, and trained up in it. See 1 Kings 12.on v.21.] to help the King against the Enemy.
\p
\v 14 . And Uzzia prepared for them, for the whole host, shields, and spears, and helmes, and bows even unto the sling-stones. [that is, stones which they were to throw with the sling at the enemy. With such a sling-cast David hit the Giant Goliath in the forehead, that lie felled him down by it, 1 Sam.7.49. Compare Job 41.19.]
\p
\v 15 . He made also at Jerusalem cunning works, the invention of cunning craftsman, [Hebr. devices by the devices of the devision; that is, artificial and well devised works, contrived by the skilful invention of a cunning or skilful artist, or engineer] to be upon the towers and upon the corners, to shoot with arrows, and with great stones: So his name went far abroad: [see above on vers.8.] for he was name marvelously helped, [Hebr. he made it marvelously with, or, to be helped, to wit, of God, who is a shield to all those that trust in him, Psalm 18.31.] till he was strong. [or, strengthened; to wit, in his kingdom.]
\p
\v 16 . But when he was grown strong, his heart was lifted up into destruction: And he transgressed against the LORD his God: For he went into the temple of the LORD, [Meaning into the holy place, where the altar of incense stood, and into which no man might come, much less offer incense, save the Priests only. This place is below vers.18. called the Sanctuary] to burn incense upon the altar of incense.
\p
\v 17 . But Azaria the Priest [Meaning the high Priest. See 1 Chron.6.10. and below vers.20.] went after him: and with him fourscore Priests of the LORD, valiant men.
\p
\v 18 . And they with stood king Uzzia, and said unto him; It pertaineth not to thee, Uzzia, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the Priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense; [compare Exod.30.7, etc. go out of the sanctuary, [see above on vers.16. where this sanctuary is called the temple. Compare 1 Kings 8.10. and the annotate.] for thou hast transgressed; neither shall it be for thine honor from the LORD God. [to wit, because he will not approve of it, but will surely punish it.]
\p
\v 19 . Then Uzzia was wroth, [Of the Hebrew word see Gen.40.on vers.6.] and the incense was in his hand, to burn incense: Now when he was wroth against the Priests, the leprosy rose up in his forehead, before the face of the Priests, [some conceive that at that time the Earthquake happened: Of which see Amos.1.1. Zach.14.5. as a manifest proof of Gods anger against this King] in the house of the LORD, from above the altar of incense. [to wit, from the Lord, who seemeth to have shot something from above, or from beside this altar against the kings face, which caused or produced this leprosy.]
\p
\v 20 . Then Azaria the head Priests, [Hebr. the Priest the head, to wit, of the Priests, that is, the chief Priest] and all the Priests looked upon him, and behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him in hast from thence, yea he himself was also driven to go out, [compare Esth.6.vers.12.] because the LORD had plagued him.
\p
\v 21 . Thus Uzzia the king was leprous unto the day of his death, and being leprous, dwelt in a separated house, [Lev.13.46. Num.5.2. and 12.14. See further 2 King.15.on v.5.] for was cut off from the house of the LORD: [that is, he was declared unclean, and was to dwell alone, and not permitted to come into the peoples court, into the public congregation, and that according to the law, Lev.13 46.] now Jotham his sons was over the Kings house, Judging [that is, governing, and executing Judgment. See 2 Kings 15.on ver 5.] the people of the Land.
\p
\v 22 . Now the rest of the acts of Uzzia, the first, and the last, did Isaia the Prophet the son of Amoz write.
\p
\v 23 . And Uzzia fell asleep with his fathers, and they buried him by his Fathers, in the field of the burial, which belonged to the kings; for they said, he is a leper: [That is, they buried him in the field, wherein the sepulchers of the kings were; howbeit, they buried not his body, because of the leprosy, in, or among those sepulchers, but in a distinct and separated place] and Jotham his son became king in his stead.
\c 27
\s Jotham reigneth well, vers.1,&c. Causeth divers buildings to be made, 3. He maketh the Ammonites tributary to him, 5. He persevereth in goodness, dieth, and Achaz his son becometh King, 9.
\p
\v 1 Jotham was five and twenty years old, [Heb. a son of five and twenty years] when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years at Jerusalem, and his mothers name was Jerusa, a daughter of Zadok. [Compare 2 King.15.33. etc.]
\p
\v 2 . And he did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, [To wit, in maintaining the pure worship of God. Compare above chap.26.4. and see the annotate.] according to all that his Father Uzzia had done, saving that he entered not into the temple of the LORD: [to wit, (according to the opinion of some) there to attend the service of God in public with the rest of Gods people: which may thus be understood that he omitted it not through contempt of the Ordinance, but through humane frailty, because his father was smitten there with leprosy. Some conceive that this was spoken in praise of him, to wit, that he entered not into the Temple of the Lord to burn incense, as his Father had done. See above chap.26.16.] and the people did yet corrupt themselves. [to wit, by idolatry, in offering and burning incense on the high places, as is declared, 2 kin.15.35.]
\p
\v 3 . The same built [That is, renewed, repaired, fortified, mended. Compare above chap.11.5. and the annotate.] the high gate at the house of the LORD: [see 2 King.15.on v.35.] He also built much on the wall of Ophel: [meaning a part of the walls of Jerusalem, so called, because it stood on an hill, or high place. See below chap.33.14. and Nehem.3.6. and 11.21.]
\p
\v 4 . Moreover, he built cities on the mountains of Juda: And in the woods he built castles and towers. [Compare above chap.17.on v.12.]
\p
\v 5 . He warred also against the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them, so that the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, [see 1 Kings 16.on v.24.] and ten thousand Cors [see of this measure, Lev.27.on v.16. where it is called an Homer, 1 King.4.on v.22. where it is called a Cor, as here] of wheat, and ten thousand of barley: that the children of Ammon brought him again, both in the second and in the third year.
\p
\v 6 . So Jatham strengthened himself: For he disposed [See above chap.19.on v.3.] his ways [that is, resolutions, purposes, words, actions, course of life. See Gen.6.on v.12. and 1 King.2.on v.4. So here in the following verse] before the face of the LORD his God.
\p
\v 7 . Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, [To wit, which the King of Syria, and the King of Israel made against him] and his ways; lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Juda.
\p
\v 8 . He was five and twenty years old, [Hebr. a son of five and twenty years] when he became King; and he reigned sixteen years at Jerusalem.
\p
\v 9 . And Jotham fell asleep with his Fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: [See 1 Kings 2.on v.10.] and Achaz his son became king in his stead.
\c 28
\s Achaz is an abominable idolater, vers.1, &c. He is smitten by the Syrians, and by the Israelites, 5. The Israelites carry away many Jews captive with them, 8. Whom they bring again into their own border, by the advice of the Prophet Oded, 9. Achaz seeketh to the Assyrians for help, 16. War is made against him by the Edomites and Philistines, 17. He is not assisted by the King of Assyria, 20. Goeth on in his wickedness, 22. He dieth, and Hizkia his son reigneth, 27.
\p
\v 1 Achaz was twenty years old, [Hebr. a son of twenty years] when he became king, and reigned sixteen years at Jerusalem: And he did not that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, like David his Father. [compare 1 King.11.on v.9.]
\p
\v 2 . But he walked in the ways of the Kings of Israel: [See above chap.21.on v.6.] besides, he made also molten images for Baalim. [that is, to the honor of the idols, which they called Baalim, because they held them to be their Lord. See Judg.2.on v.11.]
\p
\v 3 . Also he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinmon; [See 2 Kings 23.on v.10.] and he burnt his sons in the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, [it is said, 2 Kings 16.3. that he made his son to pass thorough the fire. This King Achaz caused some of his sons to be burnt, as here affirmed, and it may be that he made one to pass only thorough the fire, as it is written, 2 King.16.3. See of this heathenish abomination, Lev.18.on v.21. Compare below chap.33. the annotate. On v.3.] whom the LORD had driven out of possession before the face of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 4 . He offered also, and burnt incense on the high places, [See Lev.26.on v.30.] and on the hills; as also under all (or every) green tree. [see Deut.12.on verse 2.]
\p
\v 5 . Therefore the LORD his God [To wit, according to the covenant of grace, which God had made with Abraham and his posterity: or according to the hypocrical profession, which Achaz made, feigning himself to hold the Lord God of his Fathers, to be his God also; as idolaters do commonly halt on both sides, 1 Kin.18.21.] delivered him into the hand of the King of Syria, [called Rezin, 2 Kings 16.5.] (so) that they smote him, and carried away captive from him a great multitude of prisoners, whom they brought to Damascus: [Heb. Damesek. So above chap.16.2.] And he was also delivered into the hand of the King of Israel [called Pekah in the following verse, and 2 kin.16.5.] who smote him with a great smitting. [compare above chap.13.on vers.17.]
\p
\v 6 . For Pekah, the son of Remalia smote dead in Juda an hundred and twenty thousand one day, all war like men, [Hebr. sons of battle, army, strength. Of the significations of the Hebrew word hail, see Gen.47.on vers.6.] because they had forsaken the LORD God of their Fathers. [compare 1 Kings 15. The annotate. On v.29.]
\p
\v 7 . And Zichri a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maalseia the kings [Namely, Achaz his] son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, [or the Leader of the house, who as high Steward had the chief or supream command over the Kings household. So the Ruler over the treasures, is put for the chief or supream treasurer, 1 Chron.26.24.] as also Elkana, the second after the king.
\p
\v 8 . And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren, [That is, of the Jews, who with the Israelites were descended from one father Jacob. See ab. Chap.11.on v.4. also below v.11. and 15.] two hundred thousand, women, sons and daughters, and plundered also much prey from them: and they brought the prey to Samaria.
\p
\v 9 . Now (there) was a Prophet of the LORD there, whose name was Oded; [A Prophet, to be distinguished from another of this name, who lived in the time of king Asa, ab.ch.15.v.1.] be went out to meet the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them; behold, by reason of the wrath of the LORD the God of your Fathers against Juda, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in wrath, which reacheth up unto heaven. [an hyperbole, or phrase signifying a special exaggeration of the thing whereof mention is made, and importing with all a threatening and vengeance of God from heaven. Compare Gen.11.4. and Ezra 9.6.]
\p
\v 10 . Moreover, ye intend [Hebr. say, or, are saying. See Gen.20.on v.11. and 1 Kin.5.on v.5. so bel.v.17.] to subject the children of Juda and Jerusalem for bond-men, and bond-women unto you: Are ye not the only (men)? [to wit, that seek to enthrall your brethren, and to make them slaves and bondmen? Or are ye not besides that singly full of guilty] with you there are guiltinesses [that is, nothing but sins] against the Lord your God. [it is as much as if he had said; as for you that are the rod of Gods judgement against the Jews that have incensed him, are ye better then they? What is there else with you, but meer sins and transgressions, whereby ye have continually hitherto provoked the Lord to anger, so that ye can expect nothing else but plagues and judgments. Oth. Are they not with you, yea concerning you, guiltinesses, etc.]
\p
\v 11 . Now then, hearken to me, and bring the captives again, [Hebr. Prison, captivity. See Numb.31.on vers.12. so below vers.13,14,15,17.] which ye have carried away captive of your brethren: for the heat of the LORD’s anger is upon you.
\p
\v 12 . Then (certain) men of the head of the children of Ephraim, [Meaning, the chiefest of Samaria. They are called below vers.14. Rulers, or, Princes] Azaria the son of Johanan, Berechia the son of Mesillemoth, and Jehizkia the son of Sallum, and Amaza the son of Hadlai, rose up against those that came from the war:
\p
\v 13 . And they said unto them; Ye shall not bring in the captives hither; [To wit, into Samaria] for a guilt upon us against the LORD, [Hebr. guilt of the Lord: that is, against the LORD, as Vers.10.] ye intend. [Hebr.ye are saying; that is, purposing in your heart. See above on vers.10.] to add unto our sins, and to our guiltinesses, although we have much guilt, [it is as much as if they had said; that which ye intend, is a new sin, whereby ye would aggravate our former sins, whereas we have already but too many of them] and the heat of wrath [namely, of the Lord, whereby he is incensed against our sins. The word wrath is, without addition of the word God, often understood of the wrath of God, because it may properly, in respect of its greatness, be called wrath. So Numb.1.53. and 18.5. Josua 22.0. 1 Chron.27.24. above 24.18.] is upon Israel.
\p
\v 14 . Then the ready prepared [That is, the armed men, or, the souldiers] left the captives, and the spoil, before the face of the Princes, and of all the congregation.
\p
\v 15 . Now the men, which are expressed by name, [To wit, above vers.12. Understand, those that were ordered for this work, viz. to conduct the captives, and to furnish them with necessaries] gat them up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all their naked (ones;) and they arrayed them, and shod them, and fed them, and gave them to drink, and anointed them, [to wit, to revive, and refresh these captives, according to the custom of those Eastern countrys. See Ruth 3.on vers.3.] and carried them upon asses, all that were feeble, [Hebr. (or, every) stumbling (one) that is, those that by reason of old age, or youth, or wounds, or weariness, were not well able to go, and to keep pace with the multitude] and brought them to Jericho the palm-city, [see Deut. 34.on vers.3.] to their brethren: after that they returned to Samaria.
\p
\v 16 . At that time [To wit, when Rezin the King of Syria, and Pekah the King of Israel made war against him. See above vers.5. and 2 Kings 16. 5,7.] did king Achaz send unto the Kings of Assyria, [that is, to the famous and great King of Assyria, called Tiglath-Pileser, 2 Kings 16.7. Or the Plural Number is put here for the Singular. See Gen.19.on vers.29.] to help him.
\p
\v 17 . Moreover, the Edomites were also come; and had smitten Juda, and carried away captives.
\p
\v 18 . Furthermore the Philistines had invaded the cities of the low country, and the South of Juda, and had taken Beth-Semes, [See 2 Kings 14.on vers.11.] and Ajalon, [see above chap.11.on vers.10.] and Gederoth, [a city in the Tribe of Juda, Jos.15.41.] and Socho, [see above chap.11.on vers.6,7.] and her dependant places, [Hebr. daughters. That is, place belonging thereunto. See Numb.21.on vers.25.] and Timna, [a city lying in Juda, Jos.15.10.] and her dependant places, and Gimoz, and her dependant places: and they dwelt there.
\p
\v 19 . For the LORD humbled Juda, because of Achaz the King of Israel: for he had drawn away Juda, [To wit, from the true God unto Idols, from the pure worship of God, to false and superstitious idolatiries. The like signification hath the Hebrew word, Exod.5.4. Others, for he made Juda naked, to wit, of the help and protection of God, causing them to sin] (so) that they transgressed exceedingly [Hebr. transgressed transgression] against the LORD.
\p
\v 20 . And Tillegath-Pilneser [Called also Tiglath-Pilneser, 2 Kings 15.vers.29, etc. See there the Annotations] the king of Assyria [whose help Achaz had sought, above vers.16.] came unto him: howbeit he distressed him, [or, put him to a great strait; causing him to purchase unto his side this hired Rasour, (as Isaias calleth him, chap.7.20.) with a great sum of money, and Achaz was put to very hard shift, to raise such a sum of money] and strengthened him not.
\p
\v 21 . For Achaz took a part of the house of the LORD and of the house of the King, and of the Princes: which he gave unto the King of Assyria; [That is, he took away the Silver, and the Gold that was in the Temple, and in the treasures of the Kings house, etc. and gave the same for a present to the King Assyria. See 2 Kings 16.8.] but he helped him not. [Hebr. He was no help unto him: namely, to King Achaz.]
\p
\v 22 . Yea in the time, when he was distressed, then he trespassed yet more against the LORD: this was king Achaz. [That is, such a one was King Achaz, to wit, always the same man, so that he grew no whit better, but waxed daily worse and worse, although the Lord plagued and punished him grievously.]
\p
\v 23 . For he offered unto the Gods of Damascus, [Hebr. Darmesek] that had smitten him; [some apply these words, that had smitten him, to the people of the city of Damascus; but others to the Gods of Damascus: so that Achaz his meaning should be, that they were the Gods of Damascus, that had smitten him] and said; Because the Gods of the Kings of Syria help them, I will offer unto them, that they may (also) help me: but they were to him for his fall, [Hebr. to cause him to fall] as also to all Israel.
\p
\v 24 . And Achaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD: [Namely, of the Porch, and of the holy place, below cha.29.7. whereby this wicked King caused the whole service of God to cease. Compare below chap.29.3.] moreover, he made him altars in all corners at Jerusalem.
\p
\v 25 . Also he made in every city [Hebr. in all (or every) city, and city] of due high places, to burn incense unto other Gods: [Meaning, other than the true God, that had revealed himself unto his people, and therefore are also called strange Gods. See Gen.35.2. and the Annotations thereon] he also provoked the LORD God of his fathers to anger.
\p
\v 26 . Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, [See above chap.27.on vers.6.] the first, and the last; behold, they are written in the book of the Kings of Juda, and Israel.
\p
\v 27 . And Achaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city at Jerusalem. See 1 Kings 16.20.] but they brought him not into the sepulchers of the Kings of Israel: [that is, Juda. See above chap.21.on vers.2.] and Jehizkia his son became king in his stead.
\c 29
\s Hizkia a pious King, applieth himself to repair the worship of God, vers.1. etc. gathered for that purpose the Priests, and the Levites together, 4. To whom for this very end he maketh an excellent exhortation, 5. Which they follow, 12. Which they acquait the King withal, 18. Who by way of thanksgiving, offereth many sacrifices, with songs of praise, 20. The congregation add thereunto their offerings, 31. To offer up these, the Priests are helped by the Levites, who had been more diligent to sanctify themselves, than the Priests, 34.
\p
\v 1 Ehizkia [Others, Hizkia, below vers.18,27.] became king, being five and twenty years old, [Hebr. a son of five and twenty years] and his mothers name was Abia, a daughter of Zacharia.
\p
\v 2 . And he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord; according to all that David his father had done.
\p
\v 3 . The same, in the first year of his reign, in the first months, [Yea on the first day of this first month, as appeareth below vers.17.] opened the doors of the house of the Lord [to wit, which Achas his father had shut up, that the Lord might not be worshipped in his Temple. See above chap.28.24. and below vers.7. and compare 2 Kings 16.14, etc.] and repaired them. [To wit, the doors. Others, and strengthened them; namely, the Priests, to wit, in their office.]
\p
\v 4 . And he brought in the Priests, and the Levites: and he gathered them together in the East-street. [Meaning the plain, which was at the East end of the Temple, before the gate of the people court, which gate was the chiefest gate.]
\p
\v 5 . And he said unto them; Hear me, O Levites, Sanctify now your selves, [That is, cleans your selves from all pollutions, which are against both the moral and ceremonial Law, and that according to the command and prescript given you by God in his Law. Compare Genes.35.2. Item Exod.19.10. and the Annotations] and sanctify the house of the LORD God your fathers, [that is, cleanse it. So below vers.17, and 19.] and bring forth the uncleanness called, because it must be separated, and put away. In like manner the time of the purity or uncleanness of a woman in child-bed, is called a time of separation; because, as long as that time lasted, she was to be separated from the society of men. See Levit.12.on vers.2. Understand here by uncleanness, or, pollution, what so ever had polluted or defiled the Temple by means, or by reason of idolaters, and idolatry] out of the Sacntuary. [Understand the holy places; that is, the fore-part of the Temple, below vers.16.or also the court of the Priests, which is likewise called a Saanctuary. See below vers.7. and the Annotations.]
\p
\v 6 . For our fathers have trespassed, [Namely, my father Achaz, and your fathers, that followed his idolatry] and done that which was civil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him: and they have turned away their faces from the tabernacle of the LORD, and have turned [Or, presented, offered, Hebr. given] the neck toward (it.) [That is, they have turned their backs (towards it, or, upon it,) refusing to give ear unto the LORD, and to worship him according to his Law.]
\p
\v 7 . Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burnt incense; neither have they offered burnt-offering in the Sanctuary [Meaning, the Priests court, wherein the altar of burnt-offering stood, 1 Kings 8.64. And the same is called an holy place, Lev.6.16. and 10.13. and 14.13. and the Sanctuary, as here, and Numb.28.7. and below chap.35.5. because it was hallowed or consecrated unto God] unto the God of Israel.
\p
\v 8 . Therefore a great wrath of the LORD hath been upon Juda and Jerusalem, and (he) hath delivered them up to trouble, [Or, scattering. See Deut.28.on vers.24.] to desolation, and to hissing on [see 1 Kings 9. On vers.8.] like as ye see with your eyes.
\p
\v 9 . For lo. Our fathers have fallen by the sword: [That is have been destroyed by war. See Lev.26.on vers.7.] besides our sons, and our daughters, and our wives have been in captivity for it. [See above chap.28. vers.5. and 8.]
\p
\v 10 . Now it is in mine heart [That is, I am minded and do intend. See 1 Kings 8.on vers.17.] to make a covenant with the LORD the God of Israel: that the heat of his anger may turn away from us.
\p
\v 11 . My sons, [He calleth the Priests, and the Levites, sons, not in respect of his great age, (for he had as yet attained but to the age of five and twenty years, above vers.1.) but because he bare a love and actions towards them, as if they had been his sons] be not now [to wit, as in time past, when ye neglected the time, and pure worship of God] slack: [or, be not still, negligent, quiet. Others, go not now astray, or, err not, to wit, that you should not quit your selves well in the office, or discharge the duty, whereunto God hath chosen, and called you] for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before his face, [See Deut.10.on vers.8.] to serve him, and that ye should be ministers and burners of incense unto him.
\p
\v 12 . Then the Levites gat them up, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azaria, of the children of the Kehatites; and of the children of Merari, Kis the son of Abdi, and Azaria the son of Jehallelel: and of the Gersomites, Joab the son of Zimma, and Eden the son of Joab.
\p
\v 13 . And of the children of Elizaphan, [This man in Moseh’s time had been a Ruler in the family of the Kahatites, Numb.3.30.] Simri, and Jeiel: and of the children of Asaph, [see of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, and of their children, 1 Chron.25.1.2, etc. and below chap.35.15. and the Annotations] Zacharia, and Mattania.
\p
\v 14 . And of the children of Heman, Jehiel, and Simei: and of the children of Jeduthun, Semaja, and Uzziel.
\p
\v 15 . And they gathered their brethren, and hallowed themselves, [See above on vers.5.] and came according to the command of the King, by the words of the LORD; [that is, which command the King had given, being moved by the words of the Law of God, which imported as much, whereby he warranted his action] to cleanse the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 16 . But the Priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, [For it was onely permitted to them, to enter into the holy place, and not to the Levites] to cleanse (it,) and they brought out into the court of the house of the LORD [meaning the Priests court, where the altar of burnt-offering stood] all the uncleanness, which they found in the Temple of the LORD: [that is, in the holy place, and also according to the opinion of some, in the most holy place] and the levites took it up to carry it cut abroad, into the brook Kidron. [See 1 Kings 2.on v.37.]
\p
\v 17 . Now they began to hallow [That is, to cleanse the house of the LORD] on the first [Hebr.one. See Gen.1.on v.5.] (day) of the first month, [Meaning the first month of the first year of King Hizkia’s reign, as above v.3. Others understand it of the first month of the year called Nisan] and on the eight day of the month they came into the porch of the LORD, and hallowed the house of the LORD in the eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.
\p
\v 18 . Then they went into King Hizkia, and said; We have cleansed all the house of the LORD: together with the altar of burnt-offering, with all the furniture thereof, and the table of disposition, [meaning, the holy Table over-laid with God, standing in the holy place, upon over-laid with Gold, standing in the holy place, upon which the shew-bread-loaves were to be disposed, that is, orderly set and laid in order, Exod.25.30. Levit.24.5,6, etc, which actions is called the disposing of the continual (bread,) above chap.2.4.] with all the furniture therefore.
\p
\v 19 . Also all the furniture, which King Achaz under his reign had cast away by his transgression, have we prepared, [To wit, for their lawful use, whereunto they were ordained] and hallowed, and behold, they are before the altar of the LORD.
\p
\v 20 . Then King Jehizkia gat him up early, and gathered the chief of the city: [Meaning the Magistrates, Council, and Officers of the City, who are also called the eldest of the city. See 1 Kings 21.8. and the Annotations] and he went up into the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 21 . And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats for a sin-offering for the Kingdom, and for the Sanctuary, and Juda: [Here are named all sorts of clean four-footed beasts, that were sit for sacrifice, and which were offered up, First, for the Kingdom; that is, for the King, his Counsellors, and Officers. Secondly, for the Sanctuary; that is, for the sins and uncleanness, that were committed in the Temple by idolatry, false worship, violence, and otherways. Thirdly, For Juda; that is, for the sins of all the congregation] and he said to the sons o Aaron, the Priests, that they should offer (them) upon the altar of the LORD.
\p
\v 22 . So they killed the bullocks, and the Priests received the bloud, and sprinkled it on the altar: they also killed the rams, and sprinkled the bloud upon the altar: likewise they killed the lambs, and sprinkled the bloud upon the altar.
\p
\v 23 . Then they brought forth the he-goats, for the sin-offering, before the face of the KING, and of the congregation; and they [Namely, the King, and the Congregation, or those that appeared there in the name, or in the behalf of the Congregaton] laid their hands upon them. [They declared by this ceremony, that they confessed their sins, and prayed to God for perdon, by virtue of the sacrifice, which should once be made by the Messiah, and was now typified by these offerings. See Levit.1.4. and 4 15,4. And 8.18. also the Annotations chap.1.on vers 4.]
\p
\v 24 . And the Priests killed them, and make expiation [To wit, for the Kingdom, the Sanctuary, and the Congregation, as above vers.21. that is, for all Israel, consisting of the King, his Court, and his Officers; of Ecclesiastical persons, and of all other inhabitants of the land] with their bloud upon the altar, to make atonement for all Israel: [see above chap.21.on vers.2.] for the king had commanded [Hebr. said. So below vers.7. Job 9 7.] that burnt-offering, and that sin-offering (to be made) for all Israel.
\p
\v 25 . And he put the Levites in the house of the LORD, with cymbals, with lutes, and harps, according to the command of David, and of God the Kings Seer, [That is, Prophet. See 1 Sam.9.9. and above chap.9.on vers.29.] and of Nathan the Prophet: for this command was from the hand of the LORD, by the hand of his Prophets.
\p
\v 26 . Now the Levites stood with the instruments [Meaninng musical instruments] of David, [that is, as David being taught and lead by the Spirit of God, had prescribed, and caused to be made] and the Priests with the trumpets.
\p
\v 27 . And Hizkia commanded to offer the burnt-offering upon the altar: now at the time when that burnt-offering began, the song of the Lord began (also) with the trumpets, [According to the command of the LORD, of which we read, Numb.10.10.] and with the instruments of David [Hebr. by the hands of the instruments of David. Others, according to the hands; that is, according to the institution, which David had ordained by Gods command. See above chap.23.on vers.18. and here vers.25.] the King of Israel.
\p
\v 28 . Now all the congregation bowed themselves down, [To wit, in token of reverence, supplication, and thanksgiving to God. Compare above chap.20.18. and here the following verses, vers.29,30.] when they sang the song, and founded with trumpets: all this (continued) until the burnt-offering was finished.
\p
\v 29 . Now when they had made an end of offering, [To wit, the burnt-offering, mentioned in the two former verses] the King and all that were found [or, were present at hand; as Gen.19.15.] with him, bended, and bowed themselves down.
\p
\v 30 . After that king Jehizkia, and the Princes said unto the Levites, that they should praise the LORD, with the words of David, and of Asaph the Seer: and they praised (even) unto gladness, and bowed their heads, and bowed themselves down.
\p
\v 31 . And Jehizkia answered, [That is, began again to speak. See Judges 18.on vers 14.] and said; Now ye have filled your hands [that is, consecrated your service. See of this phrase, Lev.7.on v.37. on the word Fill-offering] unto the LORD; come near, and bring slay-offerings, [meaning, all kind of sacrifice of beasts that were slain or killed, Ex.12.27. Lev.3.6. Deut.32.38.] and praise-offerings [whereby they acknowledged Gods mercies, and praised and thanked him for the same] into the house of the LORD: and the congregation brought slay-offering, and praise-offerings, and all (that were) free willing of heart, burnt-offerings. [See of these Gen.8.on vers.20.]
\p
\v 32 . And the numbered of the burnt-offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, two hundred lambs; all these (were) for a burnt-offering to the LORD.
\p
\v 33 . Moreover, of the consecrated things were [That is, over and above the fore-mentioned beasts consecrated to the Lord, are these yet to be added to them] six hundred bullocks, and three thousand sheep. [Or, small cattle; that is, sheep, and goats. See Gen.12.on vers.16.]
\p
\v 34 . But of the Priests (there were too few, neither could (they) flay all the burnt-offerings: therefore their brethren the Levites did help [Hebr. strengthen] them till the work was ended, [The Priests were too few, to wit, to prepared all these offering; that is, to kill them, wit, to prepare all these offerings; that is, to kill them, to slay them, and to divide them in pieces; which was properly the work of the Priests, lev.1.5,6. However the ministry of the Levites might be used therein, which were added for an help to the Priests] and until the (other) Priests had hallowed themselves; [see above on vers.5.] for the Levites were more right of heart, [see Psalm 7.on vers.11.] to sanctify themselves, than the Priests.
\p
\v 35 . And also the burnt-offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the thank-offerings, [See Lev.3.on v.1.] and with the drink-offerings, [See Gen.35.on vers.14. and Levit.23.on vers.13.] for the burnt-offerings: [others, of the burnt-offerings, or, to or, with the burnt-offerings: that is, which drink-offerings were added to the burnt-offerings, and belonged thereto. Compare Numb.28.7.] so the service of the house of the LORD was fitted.
\p
\v 36 . Now Jehizkia, and all the people, rejoiced at that which God had prepared for the people: [Meaning, the good affection and inclination, which GOD had put into the heart of the people, whereby they were very willing and exceedingly bent to this work of reformation, so that it went on very speedily and prosperously, according to desire, yea beyond all expectation. Others, because God had prepared the people] for this thing was done suddenly. [To wit, in the very first beginning of Hizkia’s reign, and without any opposition of the people; yea with their great bent and inclination thereunto, although immediately fallen to idolatry, and were turned aside from the pure and sincere worship of God.]
\c 30
\s Hizkia exhorteth all Israel, to come to Jerusalem, and to keep the lords Pass-over, vers.1. The exhortation is derided by many, accepted by others, who come to Jerusalem, 10. Where they destroy idolatry, 14. And keep the feast of Pass-over, 15. Hizkia prayeth unto God for those that had not before cleansed themselves, as they ought to have done, 17. The feast is prolonged, 23. The Priests, and Levites bless the people, 27.
\p
\v 1 After that Jehizkia sent [To wit, messengers, or ambassadors] to all Israel, [to wit, that were under his dominion. See above chap.15.on v.17. & 21.on v.2.] and Juda: and wrote letters also to Ephraim, and Manasseh, [and the rest of the ten Tribes, below vers.5. who yet were left in the land, and were rather in a loving and friendly way invited by him, than as the rest, by way of authority commanded to appear at this feast] that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem: to keep the Pass-over [see Levit.23.on vers.5.] unto the LORD the God of Israel.
\p
\v 2 . For the King had taken counsel with his Princes, [That is, Counsellors] and all the congregation at Jerusalem, [that is, those that represented all the congregation, as the Commissioners of the Priests, and the Fathers of the Families, that dwelt at Jerusalem. See above chap.19.8.] to keep the Pass-over, in the second month. [The ordinary time of the Feast of Pass-over was the fourteenth day of the first month, Exod.12.5. Numb.9 5. But when a lawful impendiment happened, whereby the Pass-over could not be kept that day, then it was to be kept in the month following, that is, on the fourteenth day of the second month, Numb.9.11. Now for as much as the Priests, and Levites, were the first month employed in cleansing the Temple, which they finished not till the sixteenth day of the same month, above chap.29.17. in that respect they could not keep the ordinary time for the celebration of the Pass-over, which was a month after.]
\p
\v 3 . For they could not keep it at that time, [To wit, when they were busied in cleansing the Temple; which time, was the ordinary time, to keep the Pass-over] because the Priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves at Jerusalem. [Two causes are here more added, wherefore the Passover could not be kept at the usual or ordinary time. First, because the priests even in the time of cleansing the Temple, had not hallowed all things, or, the hallowed things were not fully hallowed. Secondly, because at that time the people were not yet gathered together from all parts or places mentioned above vers.1.]
\p
\v 4 . And this thing was right in the eyes of the King, and in the eyes of all the congregation.
\p
\v 5 . So they appointed it, [Or, they decreed. Hebr. made the word, or, thing to stand] that a voice [to wit, of proclamation. So Exod.36.6. In stead of the word voice the word proclamation is put, 1 Kings 22.36.] should go thorough out all Israel from Ber-Seba to Dan, [that is, from the South-end of the land of Canaan to the North-end. See Judges 20.1. and 1 Kings 4.on vers.25.] that they should come, to keep the Pass-over unto the LORD the God of Israel in Jerusalem: for they had not kept it of a long (time,) as it was written. [Or, was mended the same in his Word. So below vers.18.]
\p
\v 6 . The runners [That is, the Posts, or, Messengers. So below vers.10.] then went away with the Letters from the hand of the King, and of his princes thorough out all Israel, and Juda, and according to the command of the King, saying; Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, then he will return to the escaped, [Hebr. escaping. So 2 Kings 19.30,31. See the Annotations, God is said to return unto men, when he is gracious unto them, coming to them with his favors and mercies, from whom he seemed to have departed by his Judgements. Psalm 90 13. Zach.1.3.] which are remaining to you from the hands of 1 Chron.5.26. and Tiglath-Pilezer, Kings 15.29. and above chap.28.20.]
\p
\v 7 . And be not like your fathers, and like your brethren, which transgressed against the LORD the God of their fathers: therefore he gave them up to desolation, [compare above chap.29.8.] according as you see.
\p
\v 8 . Now harden not you neck, [See of this phrase, Exod.32.on vers.9.] as your fathers (did:) give the hand unto the LORD, [that is, be ye obedient and faithful unto him: spoken by way of comparison, as the giving of the hand is so used among men: so 1 Chron.29.24. Ezra 10.19. Jerem.50.15. Some take it in this sense; give the hand unto the LORD; that is, give unto him the glory of his power] and enter into his Sanctuary, [that is, into his Temple, where they were to appear in the Court of the people] which he hath sanctified [see Levit.8.on vers.10.] for ever, [see Genes.13.on ver.15.] and serve the LORD your God; then shall the heat of his wrath turn away from you.
\p
\v 9 . For when ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren, and your children shall find mercy [Hebr. shall be for mercy. See above at the end of the sixeth verse] before the face of those that led them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God is gracious, and merciful, [see Exod.34 7.] and will not turn away (the) face from you, if ye return unto him.
\p
\v 10 . So the runners went on, from city to city, thorough the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, unto Zebulon: but they [Namely, the Israelites] laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.
\p
\v 11 . Never the less, some of Aser, and Manasseh, and of Zebulon [That is, of the Tribe of Aser, and of Manasseh, etc.] humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 12 . Also in Juda the hand of God [That is, the powerful working and operation of God] was, giving them one kind of heart, [that is, affection, inclination, will, purpose. Compare 1 Chron.22.17. Jer.32.39. Acts 4.32.] to do the command of the King, and of the Princes, [the meaning is, that God by his Spirit did effectually work a good affection or inclination in their hearts, to obey this pious command of the King] according to the word of the LORD. [viz. whereby it was commanded to keep the Feast of the Pass-over, Exod.12.6. Lev.23.5. Numb.9.5.]
\p
\v 13 . And (there) assembled at Jerusalem much people, to keep the feast of unleavened (bread) (loaves,) in the second month: [See above on vers.2.] a very great congregation. [Hebr. in, or, to multitude greatly.]
\p
\v 14 . And they gat them up, and took away the altars, that were at Jerusalem: [Meaning, the idolatrous altars, which Achaz, against the word of God, had here and there set up in the street at Jerusalem, to offer thereupon beasts unto Idols, 2 Chron.28.24.] moreover, they took away all incense-instruments, [as incense-vessels, pans, bowls. Others, incense-altars: or, incense-places] the which they cast into the brook Kidron.
\p
\v 15 . Then they killed the Pass-over, [That is, the Paschal Lamb. See Exod.12.on vers.21.] on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the Priests [namely, those that had not before cleansed themselves. See above chap.29.on vers.34. and here vers.3.] and the Levites were ashamed, [to wit, of their negligence when they saw that the zeal not onely of their companions and fellow-priests, was greater in this business, than their wars] and had sanctified themselves, [see above chap.29.on vers.5.] and had brought burnt-offerings into the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 16 . And they stood in their station, after their manner, according to the law of Moseh, the man of God: [That is, in their due places, which were appointed to them by God. Compare below chap.35.10.] the Priests sprinkled the bloud, (receiving it) of the hand of the Levites.
\p
\v 17 . For there was a multitude in that congregation, that had not hallowed themselves: therefore the Levites were over the killing of the Paschal lambs; [Hebr. Pesachim: that is, of the passings by, or, of the Pass-overs: meaning the Lambs, that were killed in remembererance of the Angels passing by, or passing over, Exod. 12. Vers.13.] for every one that was not clean, to hallow (them) unto the LORD. [The meaning is, in as much as every father of the Family was to kill his Paschal Lamb in his own house, Exod.12. vers.3. and that many had not hallowed themselves for it, that therefore the Levites were to do this work in their stead.]
\p
\v 18 . For a multitude of the people, many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issaschar, and Zebulon had not cleansed themselves, but did eat the Pass-over, not according as is written: [see above on vers.5.] but Jehizkia prayed for them, saying; The LORD, that is good, make atonement for (him.)
\p
\v 19 . (That) hath disposed his whole heart, [See above chap.19.on vers.3.] to seek the LORD God, the God of his fathers: although not according to the cleanness of the Sanctuary. [Meaning, the Ceremonial cleanness, which is here distinguished from that which is Moral, consisting in a firm and settled resolution of heart to seek God. Hizkia prayeth here, that the LORD would be pleased to forgive them their uncleanness, and that he would likewise be pleased to work in them spiritual sanctification by his holy spirit. Others, expiate for ever every one that prepareth his heart, etc.]
\p
\v 20 . And the LORD hearkened to Jehizkia, and healed the people. [That is, he forgave them their sins, and sanctified them by his spirit, and punished them not for their Ceremonial uncleanness. Others understand this of the curing of some bodily disease, which God sent upon the people, because they had not cleansed themselves. Compare 1 Cor.11.30.]
\p
\v 21 . So the children of Israel, that were found at Jerusalem, [That is, were present there, and were come to this Feast] kept the feast of unleavened (bread) (loaves,) seven days with great gladness: now the Levites, and the Priests praised the LORD day by day, [that is, as long as the Feast lasted. So below chap.31.1.] with loud sounding instruments of the LORD. [Hebr. with instruments of strength: that is, which gave great sound: such as is the sound of Trumpets. Others, (praising) with instruments the power of the LORD.]
\p
\v 22 . and Jehizkia spake according to the heart of all the Levites, [That is, that which was acceptable unto them, and most delightful to hear. See Genes.34.on vers.3.] that had understanding in the good knowledge of the LORD: [that is, of the things that belonged to the service of the Lord. Others, that taught the good knowledge of the LORD, or, that gave heed to the good knowledge of the LORD] and they [to wit, those that kept the Feast of the Pass-over] did eat (the offerings) of the set feast seven days: [Hebr. they did eat the set feast: that is, the (sacrifices) that were to be eaten on the feast day. So 2 Kings 18.31. every man to eat his (own) vine, and his (own) fig-tree; is, to eat the fruit thereof] offering thank-offerings, and praising the LORD, the God of their fathers.
\p
\v 23 . Now when all the congregation had taken counsel to keep other seven days, they kept seven days more with gladness.
\p
\v 24 . For Jehizkia the king of Juda did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks, and seven thousand sheep, and the Princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks, and ten thousand sheep: [Hebr. lifted up for the congregation, and so in the sequel; that is, gave or presented to the congregation, to be offered: so Numb.31.28. 2 Chron. 35.v.7,8. The meaning is, that these beasts were given to the congregation by the King, and his Princes, for thank-offerings for them, whereof they then also had their share, to eat it with joicing before the LORD] now the Priests had hallowed themselves in multitude, (or in great quantity and abundance.) [To wit, that they might be sit for to offer the forementioned beasts unto the LORD.]
\p
\v 25 . And all the congregation of Juda, rejoiced, together with the Priests and the Levites, and all the congregation of those, that were come out of Israel: [Out of the ten Tribes. See above vers.11. and 18.] also the strangers, that were come out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Juda. [Who were no Israelites, nor Jews, by descent; but notwithstanding were converted to the true God, and were circumcised, and so ingrafted into the people of God: Otherwise they might not have eaten of the Pass-over, Exod.12.48.]
\p
\v 26 . So there was great joy at Jerusalem; for from the days of Salomon the son of David the King of Israel, the like had not been in Israel. [The meaning is, those days being excepted: that is, since the time of Rehabeam, wherein Israel had rent themselves from Juda, they never kept such a Pass-over-feast with them.]
\p
\v 27 . Then the Levitical Priests [That is, those that came of Levi] stood up, and blessed the people; [according to that charge given to the Priests, Num.6.23.] and their voice was heard: [to wit, of God, and that according to his promise, Numb.6.27.] for their prayer came (up) to his holy dwelling place [Hebr. to the dwelling place of his holiness: to wit, the Lords, that is, to his holy dwelling place] into heaven.
\c 31
\s Hizkia causeth all idolatry works to be broken down, ver. 1,etc. He putteth the Priests, and the Levites in their office, 2. He also taketh order for their maintenance, 4. He causeth chambers to be made, to gather in their revenues, and of the Levites appointeth certain persons to be receivers, and treasurers, 11. Hizkia continueth pious, and blessed, 20.
\p
\v 1 Now when they had finshed all this, [To wit, that concerned the keeping of the great and high feast of Pass-over, recorded in the former Chapter] all the Israelites, that were there found, went out, to the cities of Juda, and brake (in pieces) the images that were set up, [see Lev.26.on vers.30.] and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places, [see of the groves, and high places, made to the honor and service of Idols, Levit.26.on vers.30.] and the altars, out of all Juda, and Benjamin, also in Ephraim, and Manasseh, [to wit, in the cities, which those of Juda had taken away from the Kingdom of Israel. See above chap.13.19. and 15.8.] until they had utterly brought nothing: [Others, until they had made an end] then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession into their (own) cities.
\p
\v 2 . And Hizkia appointed the divisions of the Priests, and of the Levites [See above chap.8.on vers.14.] after their divisions, every man according to his service, the Priests, and the Levites for the burnt-offering, and for the thank-offerings; to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise [to wit, the Lord] in the gate of the camps of the LORD. [to wit, of the Temple, where the Priests and the Levites, in their order and division, were every one to heed and observe their ministery and service, as in a camp. Compare herewith the annotate. Num.4.on vers.3.]
\p
\v 3 . Also [To wit, HIzki9a appointed] the kings portion of his substance for the burnt-offerings; for the morning and evening burnt-offerings, [see of these, Exod.29.38,39, etc. & Num.28.v.3,4, etc.] and the burnt-offerings of the Sabbaths, [see Num.28.9,10.] and of the new moons, [see Num.28.11,12, etc.] and of the set feasts: [see Lev.23. The meaning of all these words hitherto is this; ‘Tis as if he had said; the King hath so disposed of services and offices of the temple, &c. set the same in order, to the end that every one should heed and mind his own charge, as that he also hath not left himself herein uncharged, ordaining and appointing, that the offerings mentioned here in the text, should betaken out of his own revenues. Whence it seemeth that they were formerly had and found at the charge of the treasures of the Temple; whereof see 1 Chron.26.28.] as it is written in the law of the LORD. [see Num.28.& 29.]
\p
\v 4 . And he said unto the people, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that they should give the portion of the Priests and Levites; [To wit, that belonged to them by Gods appointment for their maintenance, Numb.18.8, etc.] that they might be strengthened, [That is, might have time and a mind to heed their business close, and to wait upon their office, without being drawn from it, to get their livelihood some other way] in the law of the LORD. [that is, in searching, meditating, and expounding the law of the LORD, and in performing the service of God commanded in the law.]
\p
\v 5 . When now the word brake forth, [That is, when now that commandment of the King came abraod] the children of Israel brought in many [Hebr. Multiplied] First-fruits [see of these the laws and ordinances of God, Exod.23.19. and 34.26. Levit 11.14,etc.Num.15.17,18,19, etc. Deut.26,1,2, etc.] of corn, new wine, and oil, and honey, [oth. Days. The Hebrew word signifieth honey, but is taken here by the Hebrews for days, or fruits of trees that bear sweet fruits, which in respect of their sweetness are like unto honey. For God had no where commanded in his Law, to give the first fruits of honey, but of fruits of trees, of the Earth, and of beasts] and of all the increase of the field: Also they brought in the tithes of all things, [see of these Lev.27.on v.30.] in abundance.
\p
\v 6 . And the children of Israel and Juda, that dwelt in the cities of Juda; they also brought (in) the tithes of oxen, and of sheep, and the tithes of holy things, which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and made many heaps. [Hebr. heaps, heaps. See Gen.14.on vers. 10.]
\p
\v 7 . In the third month [To wit, of the holy or Ecclesiastical year. See above chap.15.on ver.10. and Exod.12.on vers.2. In this month harvest begun in Canaan] they began to lay the foundation of those heaps: [that is, to make the first beginning of those heaps] and they finished (them) in the seveneth month. [see of this month, Lev.23.on vers.14. It did much agree with our September, when the fruits that land were carried into the barnes.]
\p
\v 8 . Now when Jehizkia and the Princes came, and saw those heaps; they blessed the LORD, [that is, thanked and praised the Lord, for giving the people an heart, to bring in his gift so freely and willingly. See Genes.14.20. and the annotate.] and his people Israel: [to bless men, is to wish all good and happiness unto them. Compare Gen.31.35. and the annotate.]
\p
\v 9 . And Jehizkia enquired of the Priests and the Levites concerning those heaps.
\p
\v 10 . And Azaria the chief Priest [Hebr. the Priest the head, or, that was the head. So 2 Kings 25.18. below chap.24.6. He is only called the head, namely, of the Priests] of the house of zadok, spake unto him, and said; since they began to bring this heaving [That is, these gifts and offerings. For the word heaving is here taken in a general signification. See Num.5.on vers.9.] unto the house of the LORD, there hath been to eat and to be satisfied, yea to leave (even) unto abundance; for the LORD hath blessed his people, [that is, done them good. See Gen.12.on v.2.] so that this great store is left. [or, so that which is here present, and which ye see.]
\p
\v 11 . Then Jehizkia said that they should prepared [that is, make ready] chambers at the house of the LORD, [see of these chambers, 1 Kings 6.5. and the annotate.] and they prepared them.
\p
\v 12 . Into them they brought the heaving, and the tithes, and the hallowed things in faithfulness, and over them Chonania the Levite was chief, and Simei his brother was the second. [That is, Chonania was the chiefest treasurer, who was set over these treasures of the Temple; and next to him was Simei his brother, as an under commissioner; and under him were the other receivers that are named in the following verse. See the ordinance for this, 1 Chron.26.20,21.]
\p
\v 13 . But Jehiel, and Azaia, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Jismachia, and Mahath, and Benaja, were Overseers, under the hand of Chonania, and Simei his brother, by the command of the king Jehizkia, and of Azaria the Ruler, [Or, Leader, that is, the chief Priest, above vers.10.] of the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 14 . And Kore the son of Jimna the Levite, the porter toward the East, [That is, at the East-gate of the temple. See of this gate above chap. 23. On vers.5.] was over the free will gifts of God, to distributed [Hebr. to give] the heave offering of the LORD, and the most holy things. [Hebr. the holinesses of holinesses. Meaning the remainder of the free-will meat-offering, Levit.2.3. and 10. And the sin-offerings, Lev.6. vers.18 22. The trespass-offerings, Lev.7.1. the shew-bread-(loaves), and Lev.24.9. See also Numb.18 9.]
\p
\v 15 . And at his hand [Meaning his adjoined fellow-helpers, which were under his oversight, care and ordering] were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jesua, and Semaia, Amaria, and Sechania, in the cities of the Priests, in faithfulness, to distributed to their brethren in (their) divisions, as well to the small as to the great: [according to the law, Deut.18.8.]
\p
\v 16 . (Besides those that were put in the genealogy of males, (from) three years old and upward) [Hebr. beside their reckoning, or their account of Families, &c. that is together with those that were set down in their generalogies of all that were males. The meaning is, that they gave not only to the Priests, that did service in the Temple, their portion, but also to their sons] unto all that entered into the house of the LORD, [That is, that were used in the service of the Temple, and consequently were to have their maintenance out of hallowed goods] for the daily work upon every day [Hebr. for the things of the day upon his day. That is, for to do there, that which was to be done every day. See the like phrase, Exod.5.13. Oth. Their daily portion for their service] for their service in their watches, according to their divisions.
\p
\v 17 . And with those that were put in the genealogy of the Priests, according to the house of their Fathers; also the Levites from twenty years old and above, in their watches, according to their divisions: [That is, those that were written in the genealogies of the Priests, to whom not only their maintenance was given, but to the Levites likewise.]
\p
\v 18 . Also to the genealogy with all their little ones, their wives and their sons, and their daughters, thorough all the congregation: [Meaning the Congregation of the Priests and Levites, who were to perform the worship of God in The Temple; so that they were not only maintained in their own particular persons, but also care was taken for their wives and children] For in their office [see of the Hebrew word, 1 Chron.9.o vers.22. Oth. In, or, according to their faithfulness, or, upon their fidelity: That is, trusting upon the faithfulness of the distributers (whereof mention is made vers.15.) that their temporal maintainance should be allowed them by them] they had sanctified themselves (in) holiness. [that is, sanctified themselves very carefully and diligently. Other. Hallowed themselves to the holy things.]
\p
\v 19 . Also among all the children of Aaron, the Priests were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every city [Hebr. in all (or every) city and city] men that were expressed by name, [as above ver.15.] to give portions to all the males among the Priests, and to all that were put in the genealogies [Hebr. all numbering, or, reckoning by Families] among the Levites.
\p
\v 20 . And thus did Jehizkia in all Juda: And he did that which was good, and right, and true [Hebr. truth, or, faithfulness] before the face of the LORD his God.
\p
\v 21 . And in all (or every) work, that he begun in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandements, to seek his God; he did (it) [See above chap.14.on vers.4.] with all his heart, and prospered.
\c 32
\s Sanherib the King of Assyria invading Juda, Hizkia fortifieth the city of Jerusalem, vers.1, &c. Comforteth and exhorteth the people, 7. Sanherib defieth Hizkia, and blasphemeth God, 9. Hizkia and Isai the Prophet call unto the LORD, 20. The Assyrians are smitten by an Angel, 21. Hizkia falleth sick, 24. Being recovered, he provoketh God, but is afterward grieved for it, and repenteth, 25. He continueth blessed, 27. Offendeth, by dealing with the Ambassadors of Babel, 31. He dieth, and Manasseh his son becometh king, 33.
\p
\v 1 After these acts, [Of which see also 2 Kings 18.13. and Isa.38.1, etc.] and the establishment thereof [or truth, fidelity, firmness, stability, assurance. That is, after that the worship of God was, according to the word of God, faithfully established and assured] Sanherib the king of Assyria came, and entered into Juda, and camped himself against the fenced cities, and thought [Hebr. said; that is, thought, and had an intention. See 2 King.5.on vers.5.] to rent them off for himself. [that is, to take them away from King Hizkia, and to bring them under his own dominion and Jurisdiction.]
\p
\v 2 . Now Jehizkia seeing that Sanherib came, and (that) his face was to the war against Jerusalem: [that is, that he had a firm resolution to fight against Jerusalem: [That is, that he had a firm resolution to fight against Jerusalem. Compare 2 Kings 12.17. and see the Annotat. Thereon.]
\p
\v 3 . He took counsel with his Princes, and his Champions, to stop the Fountain-waiters which were without the city: And they did help him.
\p
\v 4 . For much people was gathered together, who stopped all the Fountains, together with the brook [Called Gihon, below vers.30. See also of this brook, 1 Kings 1.33. and the annotate.] that ran thorough the midst of the land, saying; why should the kings of Assyria [meaning Sanherib king of Assyria, with the Princes that were with him, of which see below vers.21. whereof it may be also that some were Kings that were under the command and dominion of Sanherib] come, and find much water?
\p
\v 5 . So he strengthened himself, [That is, he took counsel rage, when he saw the unfaithefulness of the King of Assyria, whose favour he but a little before had purchased, (though in vain) with a great sum of money, 2 Kings 18.14, etc.] and built up all the wall that was broken, [namely, by Joas the King of Israel, when he had smitten Amazia the King of Juda, and taken Jerusalem. See above chap.25.23.] which he raised up to the towers, [which seem to have been upon the corner-gate, and upon the gate of Ephraim: Of which gates see above chap.25.23.] with another wall without, [see of this wall below chap.33.14.] and he fortified Millo, [see 2 Kings 9.on vers.15.] (in) the city of David: And he made weapons and shields in abundance.
\p
\v 6 . And he set Captains of war over the people, and he gathered them together to him in the street of the city-gate, [That is, which was by the city-gate] and spake according to their heart, [Hebr. upon their heart: that is, friendly and comfortably, and that which was pleasing and delightful for them to hear. See Gen.34.on v.3.] saying;
\p
\v 7 . Be strong, and of good courage, be not afraid, nor dismayed for the face of the king of Assyria, nor for the face of all the multitude that is with him: For there are more with us, then with him.
\p
\v 8 . With him is a fleshly arm [Hebr. arm of flesh: that is, a fleshly and weak power, on which a man cannot rely. See Jerem.17.3. Thus the word arm is put for strength, Psa.10 15. And 44.4. Jerem.48.25. Ezek. Chap.30.22. and flesh for that which is weak, brittle, and mortal, Psa.78.39. Isa.31.5.] but with us is the LORD our God, to help us, and to war our wars: [that is, to wage our wars. So 1 Sam.8.20.] and they rested themselves upon Jehizkia the King of Juda. [that is, held themselves contended, being comforted, and relying on the power and help of God, of which the King had assured them in his aforesaid words.]
\p
\v 9 . After this Sanherib the king of Assyria sent his servants, [Meaning Lords, Princes, Officers, that were under his command. See Gen.20.on vers.8.] to Jerusalem, (but he himself was before Lanchis, and all his dominion [that is, power. Understand all the Princes and Rulers, accompanied with their people that were under the power and command of the King of Assyria] with him) unto Jehizkia the King of Juda, and unto all Juda, that were at Jerusalem, saying;
\p
\v 10 . Thus saith Sanherib the King of Assyria; whereon do ye trust, that ye bide [Hebr. are sitting. Sitting is put for tarrying or abiding, Gen.49.24. Josh.1.14. 2 Sam.2.13, etc.] at Jerusalem in the fort? [or, strong hold, castle, etc. Oth. Siege.]
\p
\v 11 . Doth not Jehizkia invite you, that he might give you over, to die by hunger, and by thirst, saying; The LORD our God shall redeem [Or, rescue, pluck out, deliver] us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
\p
\v 12 . Hath not the same Jehizkia taken away his high places, and his altar, [He meant the high places and altars of the LORD the true God, as if the images of idols could not be broken down, otherwise then with the subversion and destruction of true Religion] and spoken to Juda and Jerusalem, saying; ye shall worship before one altar of the true God, and not before the altars idols. Compare 2 Kings 18.22. and the annotate.] and burn incense upon it?
\p
\v 13 . Know ye not what I and my Fathers [Meaning, his predecessors in the Assyrian Monarchy, as Salmanasser, whom they write to be his Father; also Tiglath-Pileser, Phul, Belochus, etc. So in the two following verses] have done to all the nations of the lands? [see of some of these nations, 2 Kings 18.34. and 19.12,13.] were the Gods of the nations of those lands any ways able: That is, able in any wise, or by any means to deliver] their land out of mine hand?
\p
\v 14 . Who is there among all the Gods of those nations, which my Fathers banned, [See of this word, Duet.2.on v.34.] that could delivered his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand.
\p
\v 15 . Now then, let not Hizkia deceive you, neither let him incite you on this manner, nor believe him; for no God of any nation and Kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and (out of) the hand of my Fathers: How much less shall your God [Oth. Your Gods] be able to deliver you out of mine hand? [Heb. how much more shall your Gods not able to deliver you out of mine hand?]
\p
\v 16 . Moreover, his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and against his servant Jehizkia. [For they were twice sent by him, to blaspheme God, and to scoff at Hizkia. First, when he lay with his camp before Lachis, 2 King.18.17. Secondly, when he lay before Libna, and made preparation for to meet the King of the Moors, 2 Kings 19. vers.8.9.]
\p
\v 17 . He wrote also letter: [Which he gave his Ambassadors to carry along with them at the second time of his sending them. See 2 Kin.19.14.] to defy the LORD the God o Israel, and to speak against him, saying: As the Gods of the nations of the lands, that have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Jehizkia deliver his people out of mine hand.
\p
\v 18 . And they cryed with a loud voice in the Jewish language, against the people of Jerusalem that were upon the wall, to make them afraid, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.
\p
\v 19 . And (they) spake of [Oth. Against: So in the following words] the God of Jerusalem, [that is, the true God, that had chosen and adopted the Israelites out of singular grace and favor to be his own peculiar people, and had promised to dwell among them, but especially at Jerusalem in the Temple, where the Ark was, a token of his presence] as of the gods of the nations of the Earth, a work of the hands of man.
\p
\v 20 But king Jehizkia, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed [See the prayer penned by Hizkia, 2 Kings 19 15,16.] against: [oth. for it] and they cried unto heaven.
\p
\v 21 . And the LORD sent an Angel, who destroyed all the warlike Champions, and Princes and Captains in the camp of the King of Assyria: [see 2 Kings 19.on v.35. and Isa.37.on vers.36.] So he returned with shame of face into his (own) land; and when he was entered [to wit, to worship. See 2 Kings 19.37.] into the house of his God; [called Niscroch, King.19.37.] then they that were come forth out of his (own) body, [Hebr. they that came out, or, the comings forth of his bowels, or, (some) of them that came forth of his bowels; meaning two of his sons, called Adramelech, and Sareser, 2 Kings 19 37. Compare the phrase with other phrases that have a like meaning, Gen.35.11. and 46.26.] felled him with the sword.
\p
\v 22 . Thus the LORD delivered Jehizkia, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of the hand of Sanherib the king of Assyria, and out of the hand of all: [That is, of all the Princes, Captains of war, and souldiers that were come with Sanherib] and he conducted them round about. [to wit, as a shepherd doth guide and lead his sheep; governing, preserving, and defending them on every side.]
\p
\v 23 . And many brought presents unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and choice costlinesses to Jehizkia the King of Juda; so that he was after that lifted up [Other. He lifted up himself [see v.25.] before the eyes of all the heathen.
\p
\v 24 . In those days Jehizkia was sick unto death? [See hereof further, with the exposition hereto belonging, 2 Kings 20.1. etc. item Isa.38.1.] and he prayed unto the LORD; [see his prayer, 2 Kings 20.3.] he spake unto him, [to wit, by the Prophet Isaia] and he gave him a wonderful token. [see hereof, 2 Kings 20 9.]
\p
\v 25 . But Jehizkia made no recompense, according to the benefit done unto him, for his heart was lifted up: [That is, he behaved not himself towards the Lord, so many mercies and favors upon him, to the end that should demean himself humbly and submissively under his hand, and not that he should swell up with pride and arrogance, as he did by shewing all his treasures and wealth unto the Ambassadors of the king of Babel] Therefore (there) was great wrath [to wit, of the Lord] upon him, and upon Juda and Jerusalem. [understand the taking of the city of Jerusalem, and the Babylonish captivity, which God in his just wrath brought upon the Jews, 2 King.20.17,18.]
\p
\v 26 . Howbeit, Jehizkia humbled himself for the lifting up of his heart, [See of this humliliation, 2 Kings 20.19.] he, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: So that the great wrath of the LORD came not upon him in the days of Jehizkia.
\p
\v 27 . Now Jehizkia had exceeding much riches and honor: And he made him treasure for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all desirable furniture: [Hebr. furniture, or vessels of desire, or precious vessels, or furniture; for precious things are wont to be desired with much delight and pleasure. So below chap.36.vers 10.19.]
\p
\v 28 . Store-houses also for the increase of corn, wine and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, [Hebr. for beasts and beasts] and coats for stocks, [as the stalls were for great beasts, so the coats were for small cattle. Oth. And stalls for stocks; to wit, of sheep and goats: Or, and flocks in the stalls.]
\p
\v 29 . Moreover he had made him cities, as also possession of sheep and oxen in abundance: For God gave him very great substance.
\p
\v 30 . The same Jehizkia also stopped the upper issue of the waters of Gihon, [Or, water-going, water-course, fountain-vein, or spring, of the water of Gihon] and brought it [to wit, those waters, or that water course] straight down to the west-(side) of the city of David. [see 1 Kings 2 on vers. 10.]
\p
\v 31 . But it is so, (that) when the Ambassadors of the Princes of Babel, [Meaning the king of Babels councellors, who with his approbation had sent away these Ambassador: For which cause it is said, that they were their Ambassadors, which 2 Kings 20.12. are called the Kings Ambassadors. The sending of the Ambassadors is done by the King and his Council. See Isa.37.14.] that had sent to enquire about that wonder that was done in the land, [namely, that miracle that was done in the sun for Hizkia’s sake, 2 Kings 20. Vers.10,11.] (were with him), God left him to try him, [understand here such a leaving or forsaking, whereby God leaveth those that are his, not for ever, nor wholly, but only for acertain time withholding from them some help and strengthening, not to cause them to perish, but to try them, to humbled them, and to stir them up to their duty, and to instruct others by their example. Of this tempting or trying of God, see Gen.22.on v.1.] to know all (that) was in his heart. [that is, that God might make known to Hizkia, and to all the church, what was in his heart. For God made trial of him for a while by the forementioned desertion, that he might know himself, and out of the sense and feeling of his own weakness and impotency might have cause to humbled himself; and that all believers beholding their own weakness and infirmity in him, might work out their own salvation with fear and trembling. Compare Deut.8.2. Gen.22.12. with the annotate.]
\p
\v 32 . Now the rest of the acts of Jehizkia, and his good deeds, [To wit, which he did unto the people of God, in taking away idolatry, in defending and maintaining the pure worship of God, etc. Compare below chap.35.26.] behold, they are written in the vision of Isaia the Prophet, [that is, in the Prophecy of Isaia: Meaning the Book of his Prophecy: And see there from the 36. Chap.to the 40.] the son of Amoz, (and) in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.
\p
\v 33 . And Jehizkia fell asleep with his Fathers, and they buried him in the highest of the sepulchers [Meaning a place that was raised higher, and therefore the worthiest among the rest] of the sons of David: Moreover, all Juda and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death; and Manasseh his son became King in his stead.
\c 33
\s Manasseh is an abominable idolater, vers.1, &c. wherefore the LORD threateneth, and punisheth him, so that he is carried away captive to Babel, 10. There he repenteth, so that he is restored to his Kingdom again, 12. What he did after that 20. His son Amon is wicked king after him, 21. Is murdered by his servants, 24. Josia his son succeedeth in his room, 26.
\p
\v 1 Manasseh was twelve years old [Hebr. a son of twelve years] when he became King, and reigned five and fifty years at Jerusalem, [See a further exposition pertaining to this chapter, 2 Kings 21. 1,2, etc. where this history is first recorded.]
\p
\v 2 . And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to the abominations of the heathen, [See of these Deut.18.9,10, etc.] whom the LORD had driven out of possession before the face of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 3 . For he built the high places up again, [Hebr. he returned and built; that is, he built again. See Numb.11.on vers.4.] which Jehizkia his Father had broken down, [and that according to the express command of God, Exod.34.13. Numb.33.52. Deut.12.3.] and reared up altars for Baalim, [of Baalim, see Judg.2.on v.11.] and made groves, and bowed himself down before all the host of heaven, [see Deut.4.on vers.19. and 2 Kin.21.on vers.3. so below vers.5.] and served them. [in 2 Kings 21.3. he is compared to Achab in respect of idolatry; of whose abominable idolatry, see 1 Kings 16.v.31,32,33.]
\p
\v 4 . And built altars in the hours of the LORD, whereof the LORD had said; at Jerusalem shall my name be [See 1 Kings 8.on vers.16.] forever. [that is, during the time of the Law, or as long as the Law lasted. See Gen.13.on v.15.]
\p
\v 5 . Moreover, he built altars for all the host of heaven in both Courts of the house of the LORD. [Namely, in the Priests court, and in the peoples court. See of these two courts, 1 Kings 6.on v.36. and 7.on v.9.]
\p
\v 6 . And he made his sons to pass thorough the fire, [In 2 Kings 21.6. is spoken but of one son, whom he caused to pass thorough the fire. That is to be understood of one especially: Or this place is to be understood of one of his sons, as the plural number is thus often taken for the singular. See Gen.19.on ver.29.] in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and practisied Jugling, and gave heed to the cry of fowl, and used sorcery, and he set up sooth-sayers, and Necromancers, and he did (very) much evil [Hebr. he multiplied to do evil. So Exod.36.5. The people multiply to bring; that is, bring very much, 1 Sam.1.12. multiplied to pray; that is, prayed very much, 2 Chron.36.14. multiplied to transgress b transgression; that is, transgressed very much, Isa.55.7. he multiplyeth to forgive; that is, he forgiveth much, and often, Amos 4.4. multiply to transgress; that is, transgress much] in the eyes of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
\p
\v 7 . He did likewise set the likeness of a carved image which he had made, [This image was called the image of the grove, or the grove-god, 2 Kings 21.vers.7. because it had stood in an idolatrous grove, which Manasseh had made to the honor of Idols. See above vers 3.] in the house of God, [contrary to Gods command, Exod.20.4. Lev.26.1. Deut.5.8. and 16.22, etc.] of which God had said to David, and to Solomon his son; in this house, and at Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever. [See above on ver.4. See also Deut.12.5,11. 2 Sam.7.13. 1 Kin.8.29. and 9.2. 1 Chron.7.4. Psa.132.13,14. Jer.32.34.]
\p
\v 8 . And I will not cause the foot of Israel any more to remove out of the land which I have appointed for your Fathers: [That is, cause them to depart out of their land, and to be carried away captive, as was done to the ten tribes by Salmanasser King of Assyria, 2 Kings 18.11. Compare 2 Kin.21.8.] only if they take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law, and the statutes, and the Judgements, [understand by the word law, the moral law, by the statutes, the ceremonial law, and by the judgements the judicial or civil law. That is, all that God had commanded, as it is said, 2 King.21.8. Compare Gen.26. the annotate.on v.4. Deut.5.on v.31. 1 Kings 2.on v.3.] by the hand of Moseh. [that is, which I have given and commanded by the ministry of Moseh. Compare 2 King.27.8.]
\p
\v 9 . So Manasseh made Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to ere; (so0 that they did worse then the heathen, [See 2 Kings 21.on v.9.] whom the LORD had destroy before the face of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 10 . The LORD indeed spake to Manasseh, and to his people [To wit, by his servants the Prophets, 2 Kings 21.10.] but they heeded it not.
\p
\v 11 . Therefore the LORD brought upon them the Captains of war, which the King of Assyria had, which took Manasseh captive among the thrones: [Wherein he had hid himself, when in the field he was surprised by these robbers. Compare 1 Sam.13.v 6.] and they bound him with two copper chains, and carried him Babel.
\p
\v 12 . And when he [Namely, the LORD, or, king of Assyria] distressed him, [oth, when he was in distress] he earnestly besought the face of the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the face of the God of his Fathers: [to wit, testifying sorrow and repentance for his former course of life, and promising amendment for time to come.]
\p
\v 13 . And prayed unto him, [Namely unto the Lord] and he suffered himself to be interated of him, [see the like phrase, Gen.25.21.] and heard his supplication, and he brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD is God. [That is, perceived, and found indeed, and was convinced in his conscience, that the Lord alone was the true God, and not idols. Thus is the Hebrew word taken, Genes.3.7. and above chap.32.31.]
\p
\v 14 . And after this he built the outer-wall at the city of David, [That is, he finished the wall which Hizkia had begun to build, above chap.32.5. or he mended and repaired the wall, which perhaps had suffered some detriment] on the west-side of Gihon [See 1 Kings 1on vers,33. And above chap.32.on ver.4. and 30.] in the valley, and to the entering in of the fish-gate, [see Nehem. 3.3.] and compassed about Ophel, [see above chap.27.on vers.3.] and raised it [to wit, the wall] up very high: he also put captains of war in all the fenced cities in Juda.
\p
\v 15 . And he took away the strange gods, [See Gen.35.on vers.2.] and that likeness [of which was spoken above vers.7. See the Annotations thereon] out of the house of the LORD, together with all the altars, which he had built on the mount of the house of the LORD, [that is, the mount upon which the house of the lord stood, called Moria. See above chap.3.on vers.1.] and at Jerusalem: and he threw them out of the city.
\p
\v 16 . And he disposed the altar of the LORD, [Or, repaired the altar, to with, that it might be sit, to offer thereon] and offered thereon thank-offerings, and praise-offerings, and said unto Juda, that they should serve the LORD the God of Israel.
\p
\v 17 . But the people offered still on the high places, howbeit unto the LORD their God. [Compare 2 Kings 3.on vers.2, & 3.]
\p
\v 18 . Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, also the words of the Seers, [That is, of the Prophets. See above chap.9.on vers.29.] that spake to him, in the Name of the LORD the God of Israel; [That is, by command and authority from God. So Deut.18.19,20. And 2 Kings 2.24. See in this last place the Annotations] behold, they are (written) in the acts of the Kings of Israel: [That is, in the record, or memorial of the acts of the Kings of Israel.]
\p
\v 19 . And his Prayer, [Which some conceive to be that which is read in the Apocryphal books] and how (God) let himself to be intreated of him, also all his sin, and his transgression, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves, and carved images, before he was humbled, behold, they are written in the words of the Seers. [That is, of the Prophets, as above vers.18. So that here Hosai should be for Hosin. The Prophets then have for the most part set down & delivered out of the histories and records of things that were done, that they might serve for admonitions and warnings unto the Church. Others, in the acts of Hosai, conceiving this word to have been the name of Prophet, of whom we read no where else.]
\p
\v 20 . And Manasseh fell asleep with his Fathers, and they buried him in his (own) house: [That is, in the garden of his house, 2 Kings 21.18.] and Ammon his son became king in his stead.
\p
\v 21 . Amon was two and twenty years old, [Hebr. a son of two and twenty years] when he became king: and reigned two years at Jerusalem.
\p
\v 22 . And he did that which was evil in the of the LORD, according as Manasseh his Father had done: for Amon offered unto all the carved images, which Manasseh his Father had made, and served them.
\p
\v 23 . But he humbled not himself before the face of the LORD, as Manasseh his Father had humbled himself: but this Amon multiplied the guilt. [Or, increased the guilt. Compare above vers.6. and in the Annotations almost the like phrase.]
\p
\v 24 . And his servants made a combination against him, and slew him in his (own) house.
\p
\v 25 . But the people of the land smote all them [That is, put them to death. See Genes.8.on vers.21.] that had made the conspiracy against king Amon: and the people of the land made Josia his son king in his stead.

\s Josia is pious, vers.1, etc. destroyeth all idolatry, 4. Repaireth the Temple, 8. Hilkia the high Priests findeth the book of the law in the Temple, 14. The King sendeth to inquire of the LORD, by Hulda the prophetess about it, 20. She prophesieth that the Kingdom of Juda should be ruined, 23. But not in the lifetime of Josiah, 26. Who causeth the congregation to meet together about it, and the book of the law to be read, renewing the covenant with God, 29.
\p
\v 1 Josia was eight years old, [Hebr. a son of eight years. See Gen.5.on vers.32.] when he became king, and reigned one and thirty years at Jerusalem. [See a further exposition of this Chapter, 2 Kings chap.22. and 23. Where this history is first recorded.]
\p
\v 2 . And he did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his Father, [see 1 Kings 15.on vers.26.] and departed not to the right hand, not to the left. [That is, he forsook not the right way in any kind of manner. See Deut.5.on vers.32.]
\p
\v 3 . For in the eight year of his reign, when he was yet a youth, [To wit, of the age of sixteen years] he began to seek the God of David his father: [See above chap.15.on vers.2.] and in the twelfth year [to wit, of his reign, when he was twenty years old] he began to purge Juda, and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved, and molten images.
\p
\v 4 . And they brake down the altars of Baalim; [See Judges 2.on vers.11.] before his face, [that is, by his command, in his presence, he looking on] and the images of the Sun, [see of these Lev.26.on vers.30.] that were on high above them, [to wit, the altars, over the which they were set on high] he cut down also the groves, [that is, images of the groves. So vers.7.] and the carved, and molten images he brake in pieces, and stamped (them) small to dust, and strewed (it) upon the graves of them that had offered unto them. [See 2 Kings 23.on v.6.]
\p
\v 5 . And he burnt the bones of the Priests [Compare this with 2 Kings 23.20. and the Annotations thereon] upon their altars, [that is, upon the altars of the images, and that to the greater detestation, and defilement of their altars, those things being deemed unclean and defiled, which were touched by dead bodies, or bones. Compare 2 Kings 23.20.]
\p
\v 6 . Moreover, in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, yea unto Naphtali, in their desolate places [That is, in the land of Israel, which was laid waste and desolate, by the carrying away of the ten Tribes into Assyria. Others, with their axes, or, mattocks, or, hammers, or, spades, or, shovels, to wit, wherewith they destroyed, and demolished the idolatrous groves, images, altars, houses, high places, etc. The Hebrew word, that is here used, is found in Ezech.26.9. for instruments, whereby a thing is broken down, abolished, and destroyed] round about.
\p
\v 7 . He also brake down the altars, and the groves, and stamped the carved Images, grinding (them) small into powder, [That is, he beat and bruised them so small, as if they had been beaten to dust in mortae, or ground to powder in a mill. Comp. Deut.9.21.] and he cut down all the images of the Sun in all the land of Israel; after that he returned to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 8 . Now in the eighteeneth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, [To wit, of God; that is, the Temple. To wit, from the filthiness, and pollutions of idolatry] he sent Saphan the son of Azalia, and Maaseia the Governor of the city, [compare 1 Kings 22.26. and 2 Kings 23.8.] and Joha the son of JOahaz the Chancellor, to repair the house of the LORD. [Understand, that he sent these men to Hilkia the high Priests, that he might take up, and deliver out the collections, and cause them to be laid out and bestowed for the repairing and mending of the Temple. See 2 Kings 22.4. and a like example in Joas, above chap.24.4, etc.]
\p
\v 9 . And they came to Hilkia [To wit, to acquaint him with Kings command, touching the forementioned repairing of the temple, and the levying of the money, thereunto appertaining] the high Priest, [Hebr. the great Priest] and they [to wit, Hilkia and his companions] delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, [they delivered it into the hand of the over-seers, or those that were set over the workmen, below vers.17.] which the Levites, that kept the threshold, [namely, of the Temple. Others, the vessels] had gathered of the hand of Manasseh, and Ephraim, [that is, of the Manassites, and Ephraimites] and of all the remnant of Israel, [to wit, which were under the dominion of the King of Juda, or were addicted unto him. See above chap.21.on vers.2.] and all of Juda, and Benjamin, and were returned [namely, the Levites, that had gathered the money] to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 10 .l Now they [Namely, Hilkia, and his companions, as well shewed I the Annotations upon the beginning of the former verse. Compare likewise the end of the following sixteenth verse, and vers.17.] delivered it into the hand of the Surveyours of the work, [Meaning, the Disposers, Manager, Over-seers, Setters forward, that took care to see the work well done, being distinct from those that did the work themselves with their own hand See 2 Kings 22.on vers.5.] that were appointed over the house of the LORD: and (these) gave it to those, that did the work, that labored in the LORD, to repair, and mend the house. [Others, to search and examine, or, to view: to wit, to look, where it wanted mending, or repairing.]
\p
\v 11 . For they gave it to the artificers, and builders, to buy hewen stones, [see 2 Kings 22.on vers.6.] and wood for couplings: [meaning, the beams and rafters, whereby the walls and ceiling are coupled and fastened together] and to floor the houses, [Meaning, the chambers, that were in the Temple for the priests and Levites] which the Kings of Juda [to wit, the idolatrous Kings, as Achaz, Manasseh, and Amon] had destroyed.
\p
\v 12 . And those men dealt faithfully: [Hebr.in truth, or, faithfulness. So 2 Kings 12.15. and 2.7.] in this work: and those that were appointed over them [to wit, the Orderers or Disposers of the work, of whom is spoken vers.10.] were Jahath, and Obadja, the Levites, of the children of Merari, together with Zacharia, and Mesullam, of the children of the Kohathites, to set the work forward: and those Levites were all skilful (to play) upon instruments of music. [Or, together with every one of the Levites, that was skilful (to play) upon musical instruments.]
\p
\v 13 . They were also over the bearers of burdens, and the setters forward of all those that labored in any work: [Hebr. in service, and service: that is, in every service, or, work. See Genes.7.on vers.2.] for of the Levites (there) were Scribes, and Officers, [called above vers.10. surveyors, or, Over-seers. See the Annotations there.] and porters.
\p
\v 14 . And when they took out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkia the priest found the book of the law of the LORD, (given) by the hand of Moseh. [To wit, the original book of the Law, written, and left behind by Moseh himself. See 2 Kings 22.on vers.8.]
\p
\v 15 . And Hizkia answered, [That is, began to speak. See Judges 18.on vers.14.] and said to Saphan the Scribe: I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord: and Hilkia gave that book to Saphan.
\p
\v 16 . And Saphan carried that book to the king: moreover, he brought the King yet intelligence back again, [Hebr. word: that is, intelligence, news, report, answer of what the King had given in charge, above vers.8.] saying; All that was given into the hand of thy servants, [that is, all that was given in charge to the Levites, and commmited to their care and trust] that they do:
\p
\v 17 . And they have poured together [Hebr. cast, or, melted. See 2 Kings 2.on vers.9.] the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of them that were appointed, and into the hand of them that made [or, did] the work. [That is, to the labourers or workmen.]
\p
\v 18 . Furthermore, Saphan the Scribe told the King, saying; Hilkia the Priests hath given me a book: and Saphan read therein before the face of the King.
\p
\v 19 . Now it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the law, that he rent his cloaths. [See 2 Kings 22. The Annotations on vers.11.]
\p
\v 20 . And the King commanded Hilkia, and Ahikam the son of Saphan, and Abdon [Who is also called Achbor, 2 Kings 22.12.] the son of Micha, and Saphan the Scribe, and Hasia the kings servant, saying;
\p
\v 21 . Go your ways, inquire of the LORD for me, and for the remnant in Israel, and in Juda, [To wit, which had not been murdered by the enemies, carried away captive] concerning the words of this book, that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD, that is poured out upon us, [and that with vehement burning, and kindling; for 2 Kings 22.13. for poured out, is put the word kindled] because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do according to all that is written in that book.
\p
\v 22 . Then Hilkia went, and those that were the Kings, [To wit, ministers, whose names see above vers.20.] to Hulda the Prophetess the wife of Sallum, the son of Tokhar, the son of Hasia, [called also Tikva, the son of Harhas, 2 Kings 22. Vers.14.] the keeper of the wardrobe; [understand this of the cloaths, or, vestments of the Sanctuary, which were commited to the keeping of this same Sallum] now she dwelt at Jerusalem in the second part: [to wit, of the city. See 2 Kings 20.on vers.4. Others understand this place of a College of Prophets. See 2 Kings 22. The Annotat.on vers.14.] and they spake that [according to that: that is, according to that, which the King had commanded them] to her.
\p
\v 23 . And she said unto them; Thus saith the LORD the Good of Israel; Tell the man, that sent you unto me.
\p
\v 24 . Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof: [Meaning, the invasion of the Babylonians into the land of Juda, the besieging of the city of Jerusalem, the famine, the murdering of the inhabitants, the destruction of the temple, the captivity, and carrying away of the people to Babel, and lastly the ruine of the city, and destruction of the whole land] all the curses, that are written in this book, which hath been read before the face of the King of Juda. [Hebr. which they have read before the face of the King, etc. See Job 4.on v.19.]
\p
\v 25 . Because they have forsaken me, [See above chap.12.on vers.1.] and burnt incense unto other Gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; [that is, idols and images. See 2 Kings 22.on vers.17.] therefore my wrath shall be poured out against this place, and (shall) not be quenched.
\p
\v 26 . But until the King of Juda, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, ye shall say thus unto him; Thus saith the LORD the God of Israel; Concerning the words, which thou hast heard: [By or from the reading of the Book of the Law, containing most grievous threatening against the transgressors of the Law. See 2 Kings 22.on vers.18.]
\p
\v 27 . Because thine heart is grown tender, [The Hebrew word being soft, or, weak; used of the heart of man, signifieth for most part a weakness, feebleness, faintless, and decaying of the heart, which ariseth from fear, as may be gathered from Deut.20.3,8. 2 Kings ch.22.19. 2 Chron.13.7. Isai 7.4. Jer.51.46.] and thou didst humbled thy self before the face of God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and didst humbled thy self before my face, and rend thy cloaths, and weep before my face; Therefore I have also heard thee, speaketh the LORD.
\p
\v 28 . Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave [Hebr. in thy graves: that is, I one of thy graves. See Gen.19.on vers.29. and compare below chap.35. vers.24.] in peace, [to wit, so, as that the evil, which shall come upon this city, and upon this land, shall not come to pass in thy lifetime; but in the lifetime of thy children. See Hereof further, 2 Kings 22.on vers.20. Moreover, he was also buried within the city of Jerusalem, and laid peaceably in his grave, accompanied with all funeral pomp and solemnity. Compare Jer.34.5.] neither shall thine eyes see all that evil, which I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof: and thy brought the King this answer back again.
\p
\v 29 . Then the King sent, and gathered all the eldest of Juda, [See 2 Kings 23.on v.1.] and Jerusalem.
\p
\v 30 . And the King went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, together with the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, from the gate to the small: and they read [Or, he read, namely, the King; but the meaning is, that he caused some body to read, as some one of the Priests, or Levites] before their ears all the words of the book of the covenant, that was found in the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 31 . And the King stood in his standing place, [That is, by the pillar, where the King had his seat, 2 Kings 23.3. See of this place further in the same book cha.11.on v.14.] and made a covenant before the face of the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandements, and his testimonies, [see 1 Kings 2.on vers.3.] and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, [See 1 kings 2. On vers.4.] doing the words of the covenant, that are written in that book.
\p
\v 32 . And caused all that were found at Jerusalem, and in Benjamin, to stand: [To wit, that so standing upright, they should promise with solemn oath, that they would keep and maintain the pure worship of God, which he had now set up. Or, he caused them to stand; that is, he established and confirmed them in the covenant made. Others, he established (it) ( To wit, the covenant) with all, etc.] and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers. [To wit, in respect of the outward worship.]
\p
\v 33 . Josia then put away all the abominations [That is, all idols, images, high places, altars, and idolatrous instruments] out of all the lands, that were the children of Israels, and made all, that were found in Israel, to serve the LORD their God; [the Hebrew word importeth, that he in a manner compelled them to the pure worship and service of God; as a servant is forced and compelled to his work. The meaning is, that he by his royal power and authority kept them in order, forbidding idolatry, and commanding them to serve God no otherwise, than according to his Word] all his days they departed not [to wit, from the outward pure worship of God. Never the less, that the heart of the greatest part of the people was not upright, both appeareth by the manifold reproofs of the Prophets, and by the heavy Judgements, and plagues of God, which after the death of Josia came upon the Jews] from following the LORD [Hebr. from after the LORD. See 1 Kings.9on vers.6.] the God of their fathers. [Compare Jos.24.31. Judges 2.7.]
\c 35
\s Josia setting the worship of God in order, keepeth the feast of the pass-over with great solemnity, v.1. etc undertaketh an unnecessary war against Pharao Necho, 20. Wherein he is mortally wounded, and dieth, 23. He is exceedingly lamented, 24. The close of his history, 26.
\p
\v 1 After that Josia kept the Pass-over [See of this feast, Exod.12.3. and 34,18. Levit.23.5. Numb.9.2. and 28.16.] unto the LORD at Jerusalem: and they killed the Pass-over [that is, the Lamb that was to be killed at the feast. See Numb.9.on vers.11.] on the fourteenth day of the first month. [According to the ordinance of the Law, Exod.12. vers.6. The first month here mentioned was the first month of the Holy, or Ecclesiastical year, and was called Nisan, or Abib. See Exod.12.on vers.2. and Numb.9.on vers.1.]
\p
\v 2 . And he set the Priests on their watches; and he strengthened them to the service of the house of the LORD. [That is, he exhorted them to their duty, and encouraged them.]
\p
\v 3 . And he said unto the Levites, that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the LORD: [See above chap.23.on vers.6.] Put the holy Ark [Hebr. the Ark of holiness. See Lev.16.on vers.4.] in the house, which Salomon the son of David the king of Israel did build; [hence may be gathered, that the Ark at this time was not in the Temple, or at least not in the Holy of Holies, where it ought to have been; being taken away from thence by some idolatrous King] ye have no burden upon (your) shouldiers: [to wit, to bear the Ark commonly, as their ancestors had done formerly in the wilderness, and as long as the Tabernacle stood, Numb.7.9.] serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel. [The meaning is, that for as they were eased of that former burden, and that which appertained thereunto, they ought therefore to have the more regard to the other parts of their office. See 1 Chron.23. on vers.27, 28, etc.]
\p
\v 4 . And prepared your selves according to the houses of your fathers, according to your divisions, according to the prescription of Salomon his son.
\p
\v 5 . And stand in the Sanctuary, [Others, in the holy place: that is, by the Temple in the Court of the Priests, there to receive the Paschal Lambs of those, that were not of the Tribe of Levi, and to kill them, seeing the Priests were other ways sufficiently employed about the offerings, and sprinkling of the bloud, etc. See of this place, Levit.6.on vers.16. and Numb.28.on vers.7. wherein it is also called the Sanctuary] according to the distinction of the fatherly houses, for your brethren, the people, [Hebr. the sons, or, children of the people; that is, the people. Understand those that were not of the Tribe of Levi, but belonged to the other tribes, and were not consecrated to the work of the service of God] and (according to) the division of the fatherly houses of the Levites.
\p
\v 6 . And slay the Pass-over, [That is, the Paschal Lambs. See of this phrase, Numb.9.on vers.11. So below vers.11.] and sanctify your selves, and prepare (that) for your brethren, doing according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moseh.
\p
\v 7 . And Josia gave [Or, heaved, or, gave an heaving: that is, an offering or gift. The Verb to heave is taken for to offer, or, o give, as above chap.30.24. See the Annotations. As the word heaving is taken for offering. See Numb.5.on vers.9. and above chap.30.24. with the Annotations. Item, here in the following verse] for the people, of small cattle, lambs, and young he-goats, [Hebr. so of goats. See Lev.1.on vers.15.] all them for the Passover-offerings, according to all that was found there, [that is, was a presentor at hand among the small cattle of the King, that was sit to be slain at this feast, according to the law, Exod.12.5. Oth. According to all those that were found there: that is, according to that which was enough for the people that were come to Jerusalem to the Passover feast] thirty thousand in number: but of Bullocks three thousand: [these served for burnt-offerings, and thank-offerings, which they were likewise to offer at this feast. See Num.28.19.] these were of the Kings substance.
\p
\v 8 . Also his Princes gave for a free-will-offering, [See Lev.7.on vers.14.] for the people, for the Priests, and for the Levites: Compare above chap.30.24. where it may be seen what they gave] Hilkia, and Zacharia, and Jehiel, Rulers of the house of God, [That is, the high Priests, and the two Priests of the second order, who were the high Priests fellow-helpers, yet were under him. See Num.3.on vers.32. and 2 Kings 23. On vers.4.] gave unto the Priests for the passovr-offerings, two thousand and six hundred (small cattle): [the sense is here perfected by this insertion taken out of the former verse: The same is also done in the next verse following] and three hundred oxen.
\p
\v 9 . Moreover, Conania, and Semaia, and Nethaneel, his brethren; together with Hasahis, and Jiel, and Josaphat, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for Passover-offerings, five thousand (small cattle:) and five hundred oxen.
\p
\v 10 . So the service was prepared, and the Priests stood in their station, and the Levites in their divisions, according to the commandment of the King.
\p
\v 11 . After that they slew the Passover, and the Priests sprinkled (the blood) [To wit, upon the altar. See above chap.29.22.] from their hands: [that is, which they received from the hand of the slayer or killer: For the word sprinkled comprehendeth here in it also the signification of the word taking, or, receiving. See Gen.12.on vers.15. and above chap.30. vers.16.] and the Levites slayed (them.)
\p
\v 12 . And they took away there [To wit, from the lambs or Kids which they had slain and slayed] the burnt-offering, [That is, that part which was to be offered unto the Lord for a burnt-offering; as the fat, (see ver.14.) the tail, the Kindney, the cawl, which were all to be burnt with fire, Lev.3.v.9.10,11. Some conceive that they separated or set apart some lambs, to give them unto the people according to the fatherly houses, for to be offered] that they might give them [to wit, the Passover-offerings, lambs, or kids, goats] to the people, [Hebr. to the sons, or children of the people, as above v.5,7. And below v.13.] according to the divisions of the fatherly houses, to offered unto the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moseh; and so [to wit, did they] with the oxen.
\p
\v 13 . And they dressed the Passover with fire, [That is, they rosted it at the fire, as appeareth by the opposition, which is there immediately added of those things which were sod in pots, etc. For God had commanded that they should roost the Paschal lamb, Exod.12.v.8,9. The Hebrew word is also taken for rosting, Deut.16.7.] [meaning the pieces & parts of the thank-offerings, which pertained to those that offered them] they dressed [that is, sod, boiled] in pots, and in kettles, and in pans: And they divided (them) speedily among all the people. [Heb.they caused (them) to run to all the children of the people. That is, they divided to every one among the people, with singular hast and nimbleness, their part portion of the offering.]
\p
\v 14 . After that they prepared also for themselves, and for the Priests: [To wit, the paschal lambs that pertained to them, and to the Priests] For the Priests the sons of Aaron were [to wit, busied] in offering of burnt-offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the Priests the sons of Aaron. [the meaning is, in regard the Levites were so much employed, and so full of business, in and about the burnt –offerings, (whereof is spoken above vers.12.) that they could not make ready for themselves the paschal lambs which belonged to them, that therefore the Levites did it for them.]
\p
\v 15 . And the singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their station, according to the commandement of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun [See of this order, which David had made according to the text, had renewed, and inculcated or whetted upon their sons, 1 Chron.25. and 26.] the kings Seer, [that is, Prophet. See 1 Sam.9.9. and the an.] together with the porters at every gate: [Hebr. at gate and gate] they needed not to depart from their service, because their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
\p
\v 16 . So all the service of the LORD was ordered the same day, to keep the Passover, and to offer burnt-offerings [See above on v.12.] upon the altar of the LORD according to the commandment of the King Josia.
\p
\v 17 . And the children of Israel that were found there, kept the Passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread-(loaves) seven days.
\p
\v 18 . Also there was no Passover like to that kept in Israel, from the days of Samuel the Prophet: [See the exposition hereof, 2 Kings 23.on v.22.] and no Kings of Israel had kept such a Passover, like to that which Josia kept with the Priests, and the Levites, and all Juda, and Israel that were found there, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\p
\v 19 . In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josia was this Passover kept.
\p
\v 20 . After all this, when Josiah d prepared the house, [To wit, of God; that is, the Temple, and consequently the whole worship of God] Necho [See hereof, and of Carchemis (mentioned in the following words) 2 Kings 23.on vers.29.] the king of Egypt marched up, to war against Carchemis by the Phrath; and Josia marched forth to meet him.
\p
\v 21 . Then (he) [To wit, Necho the King of Egypt] sent messengers unto him, saying; what have I to do with thee; [Hebr. what is it to me and thee. Compare 2 Sam.16.10. and the an.] thou king of Juda? As for thee, I am not against thee this day, but against an house that wageth war against me, [Hebr. an house of my war. That is, which against me, [Hebr. an house of my war. That is, which maketh war against me, or with whom I have war: He meaneth the Assyrians that had taken Carchemis, of which their King boasteth, Isa.10.v.9. See 2 Kings 23.on v.29. Compare also 2 Sam.8.on v.10. and 23. The an.] and God hath said that I should make haste: For hear from God, who is with me, [That is, from coming against him, and from desiring to hinder his purpose, which he intendeth and desireth to executed by me ] left he destroy thee.
\p
\v 22 . But Josia turned not his face from him, but he disguished himself, [That is, he changed his apparel, that he might not known, as Achab had formerly done, 2 Kings 22.vers.30.] to fight against him, and hearkened not to the words of Necho from the mouth of God: But he came to fight in the valley of Megiddo. [see 1 Kings 9.on .15. Zach.12.11.]
\p
\v 23 . And the Arches shot King Josia; then the King said to his servants, carrying me away, for I am sore wounded [Heb. grown sick: that is, so wounded, that I am grown very sick and faint of it. See the same phrase, 1 Kings 22.34.]
\p
\v 24 . And his servants took him away from the charet, and carried him in the second charet that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchers of his fathers, [That is, in one of them. See Gen. 19.on vers.29. Or, among these pulchres of his Fathers] and all Juda and Jerusalem mourned for Josia. Compare Genes.23. vers.2. and the annotate.
\p
\v 25 . And Jeremia made a lamentation over Josia; [Which was written to the end, that men reading the same, might ensure themselves, to ponder on the most sad doleful condition of that kingdom, and to lament the cause thereof, to repent of their sins, and to pray unto God of mercy and pardon] likewise all the singing men, and singing women spake to Josia in their lamentations unto this day: [that is, which continue unto this day, wherein this was written] for they gave them (to be) an ordinance in Israel: [to wit, to be sung every year] and behold, they are written in the lamentations. [some understand this of the lamentations of Jeremy, wherein not only the final destruction of Jerusalem is lamented, but also all the miseries and calamities that came upon the city, and upon the land: The beginning whereof was the death of this godly King.]
\p
\v 26 . Now the rest of the acts of Josia, and his good deeds, [Understand the works of his piety, in destroying all idolatry, and reforming Religion, and maintaining the ordinances of God. The Hebrew word is likewise so taken, above chap.32. vers.32. Nehem. 13.v.14.] according to that which was written in the law of the lord.
\p
\v 27 . His acts then the first, and the last; behold, they are written in the book of the Kings of Israel and Juda.
\c 36
\s Johaz becometh king in his Fathers stead, vers.1,&c. is deposed by the King of Egypt, and carried thither captive, 3. Who putteth Eliakim his brother in his room, and nameth him Jojakim, 4. He is wicked, and is carried away captive unto Babel by Nebuchadnezer, 5. Jojakim his son succeedeth him in his kingdom, wickedness and captivity. 9. Zedekia, who succeedeth him, is like unto him, 11. For his and the peoples sins Jerusalem is destroyed, and the Jews carried away captive to Babel by the Chaldeans, 14. Where they remain until the reign of Cyrus, who giveth them deliverance and freedom, 22.
\p
\v 1 Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz [Called also (according to the opinion of some) Johanan, 1 Chron.3.13. and Sallum, Jerem.22.11. and Joahaz, here, and in the next verse following] the son of Josia, and made him king in his Fathers stead at Jerusalem. [for which end they also anointed him, 2 Kings 23.30. Of the reason hereof, see there in the annotate. See also 2 Kings 11.on vers.12.]
\p
\v 2 . Joahaz was three and twenty years old, [Hebr. a son of three and twenty years] when he became King, and he reigned three months at Jerusalem.
\p
\v 3 . For the King of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem: [And carried him away captive to Ribla. See 2 Kings 23.33. and the an. Thereon] and he set a fine upon the land of an hundred talents of silver, and a talents of gold. [see of this tax or amerciament likewise, 2 Kings 23.on v.33.]
\p
\v 4 . And the Kings of Egypt made Eliakim his brother [The brother of Joahaz, as straight way followeth in this verse] king over Juda and Jerusalem, and changed [Hebr. turned, or, converted] his name unto Jehojakim: [He shewed hereby the power and command, which he declared to have over him. See 2 King.23.on vers.34.] but Necho took Joahaz his brother, and brought him into Egypt. [and there he also died, 2 Kings 23.34. as was foretold by Jeremy, chap.22. vers.12. where (according to the opinion of some) he was named Sallum.]
\p
\v 5 . Jehokim was five and twenty years old, [Heb. a son of five and twenty years] when he became king, and eigned eleven years at Jerusalem: And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD his God. [See the exposition of this verse, 2 Kings 23.on v.36.]
\p
\v 6 . Nebuchadnezer king of Babel marched up against him, and bound him with two copper chains, to carry him to Babel. [But, (according to the opinion of some) he never vame to Babel, but died by the way, according to the Prophesy of Jeremy, chap.22.vers.18.19.]
\p
\v 7 . Nebuchadnezer carried also of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babel: and put them in his temple at Babel.
\p
\v 8 . Now the rest of the acts of Jehojakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, [Meaning his order abominable, both public and secret sins: Or understand his revolting and rebellion against King Nebuchadnezer, which he secretly had intended and plotted, and for which Nebuchadnezer had sent his men of war against him; 2 Kings 24.1,2.] behold, the same is written in the book of the King of Israel and Juda: and Jehojachin [otherwise called Jechonia, 1 Chron.3.16. and by way of contempt Conia, Jerem.22.14.] his son became king in his stead.
\p
\v 9 . Jehojachin was eight years old, [Hebr. a son of eight years] when he became king, [in 2 Kings 24.8. it is said, that he was eighteen years old when he became King: which is to be understood of the time, wherein he reigned alone, and with full and absolute power: but that which is said here, is to be understood of the time, wherein he was in the government with, and under his Father. See of this reconciling also, 2 Kings 24.on v.8.] and reigned three months and ten days at Jerusalem, and did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.
\p
\v 10 . And with the return of the year, [Not of his reign, for he reigned not year, but only three winter-months, and ten days: But of the year that ran on, which was now expired, when the spring began, and days and nights were of an equal length. Compare 2 Sam.11.1. and the annotate.] king Nebuchadnezer sent, and caused him to be brought to Babel, with the most costly vessels [Hebr. vessels of desire: For costly things are much desired. So below ver.19. and above chap.32.vers.27.] of the house of the LORD: And he made Zedekia [Hebr. Tsidkia, called also Mathania, 2 Kin.24.17.] his brother [that is, his kinsman; to wit, his uncle, his fathers brother, the son of Josia, 2 Kings 24.17. 1 Chron.3.15. Jer.1.3. Compare Gen.3.8. and the annotate.] king over Juda and Jerusalem.
\p
\v 11 . Zedekia was one and twenty years old, [Hebr. a son of one and twenty years] when h became king, and reigned eleven years at Jerusalem.
\p
\v 12 . And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD his God; he humbled not himself before the face of the Prophet Jeremia, (speaking) from the mouth of the LORD. [That is, from the command which he had received of God, Jer.7, etc.]
\p
\v 13 . Moreover, he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezer, who had made him swear by God: [That is, had required of him an oath of loyalty] and hardened his neck, and stupefied [see of this word, Deut.2.30.] his neck, (so) that he turned not unto the LORD the God of Israel.
\p
\v 14 . Also all the chief of the Priests, and the people transgressed very much, [Hebr. multiplied to transgress, transgression, or, to transgress by transgression: that is here to transgress exceedingly. So to serve service, is to serve with great care and pains, Gen.20.26. So likewise to lust, or, to lust with lust, or, to be taken with lust, is to lust exceedingly, Numb.11.4. also to be jealous with jealousy, or, to be zealous with zeal, is to be very zealous, Numb.25.11. to desire with desire, is to desire greatly, Luke 22.15, etc.] according to all the abominations of the heathen: And they polluted the house of the LORD, which he had hallowed [that is, set apart and ordained, that the token of his holy presence, and the exercise of his holy worship might have place in it. Compare Lev.8.10. and the annotate.] t Jerusalem.
\p
\v 15 . And the LORD the God of their Fathers sent to them by the hand of his messengers, [That is, of his Prophets that lived in the time of the history of this book; the chiefest whereof were, Ahia the Silonite, Semaia, Jeddo, otherwise Oded, Azaria, Jehu, Elias, Micha, Eliseous, Jonas, Hoseas, Amos, Jesaias, Micha the Morasite, Joel, Nahum, Habakuk, Jeremias, Hulda the Prophetess, Zephanias, Abdias, Ezechiel] being early up, to send (them): [Hebr. rising early, and sending: That is, sending with all carefulness, diligence and perserverance, yea at the very first, as soon as they begun to decline to idolatry] for he had compassion o his people, and his dwelling-place. [That is, he would not hasten his judgement, belong long-suffering and slow to wrath, and therefore sending his Prophets continually to them, that they might repent, and so escaped the threatened punishment.]
\p
\v 16 . But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, they seduced themselves against his Prophets: [That is, so that they oppressed and resisted the Prophets, and persecuted them: Or, against the Prophets, that is, against the admonition and warning of the Prophets. Oth. Thy counted themselves (to be) seduced by the Prophets: That is, they persuaded themselves and pretended that the Prophets used deceit and falsehood. Or, they would be seduced by his Prophets; that is, they would not have the Prophets to threaten and reprove them; but they would have them to speak nothing but good things unto them, and to promised all happiness unto them, as the Prophets do often complain of this. Or, they abused the Prophets; That is, they jeared and mocked them, and let them go, not caring what they said, to give heed thereunto] until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, (so) that there was no healing. [that is, no help, or remedy, and that because on the one side the people repented not, and on the other side Gods justice required that their impenitency should be punished. It is a similitude taken from sick bodies that are incurable. Compare above chap.21.18.]
\p
\v 17 . For he caused the king of the Chaldeans, [Namely, Nebuchadnezer. See of the word Chaldeans, 2 Kin.24.on vers.2.] who slew the young men with the sword in the house of their Sanctuary, [namely, the Temple, which they had polluted, above vers.14.] and he had no compassion [that is, the king of Babel, or also indeed the Lord had no compassion, as he had threatened in his law. See a summary hereof, Deut.32. vers.22, 23,24.] upon the young men, or maidens, the old (men), or decrepit: [in the Hebrew these words are put in the singular number, young man, maiden, etc.] he [namely, the Lord] gave them all into his hand. [namely, into the hand of the king of Babel.]
\p
\v 18 . And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the King, and of his Princes; all these he [Namely, king Nebuchadnezer] carried to Babel.
\p
\v 19 . And they [Namely, the Chaldeans] burnt the house of God, and they brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and they burnt all the places thereof [to wit, of the city of Jerusalem] with fire; destyroying also all the costly vessels [or, costly furniture. Heb. vessels of desire; as above vers.19.] thereof.
\p
\v 20 . And him that remained of the sword, [Hebr. that which remained, or, the remnant of the sword; that is, those that were not destroy by the sword; that is, carried away to Babel, and they were servants to him and his sons, [namely, Nebuchadnezers sons: Meaning his son Evilmerodach, and Belsazer the son of Evilmerodach, Jer.27.7.] until the reign of the Kingdom of Persia: [that is, until Cyrus had taken Babel, and so had brought the Monarchy of the Chaldeans to the Persians; which was done, according to the account of some, about the year of the creation 34 34.]
\p
\v 21 . That the word of the LORD might be fulfilled by the mouth of Jeremia, [See chap.35.11, etc. in his Prophecy] until the land had a delight in the Sabaths: [See Levit.26.34,35. And the annotate.] it rested all the days of desolution, until the seventy years were fulfilled. [That is, all the time that the Jews were kept prisoners in Babylon, namely threescore and ten years, as Jeremia had foretold, Jerem.25.11,12. And 29.10.]
\p
\v 22 . But in the first year of Cores King of Persia, [To wit, of his Monarchy. See Ezra 1.on vers.1.] that the word of the LORD, by the mouth of Jeremia, might be accomplished; the LORD stirred up the spirit [see 2 Kings 19.on vers.7.] of Cores King of Persia, that he caused a voice [that is proclamation. So Exod.36.6. Ezra 1.1.] to pass thorough all his Kingdom, even also in writing, saying: [this verse, and the next following, are even word by word repeated in the beginning of the book of Ezra. Whence some conclude, that it was Ezra, that by inspiration of the holy Ghost wrote these two books of the Chronicles.]
\p
\v 23 . This saith Cores king of Persia: The LORD the God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the Earth; and he hath commanded me [See Ezra 1.on ver.2.] to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Juda: who is there among you of all his people? The LORD his God be with him, and let him go up.
