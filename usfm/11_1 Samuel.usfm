\mt2 THE FIRST BOOK OF
\mt SAMUEL
\s The Argument of this Book
\p First, in this Book is related and described the birth of Samuel, and how his Mother dedicated him to the Ministery of God: likewise the hymne or song of praise made by his Mother: as also the obstinate and willfull wickednesse of the sons of Eli, who is reproved for it by a man of God, and foretold of the ruine of this house: which is also declared unto him by Samuel, who is ordained of God to be a Prophet, and acknowlwdged and taken for such by the people. Afterward in this Book is declared, how Israel was plagued by the Philistines, and how the Ark of God was taken, and carried away by the Philistines, which Eli hearing, falleth down backwards, and breaketh his neck. The Philistines bring the Ark of the Lord into the Temple of their Idol Dagon, who falleth down before the Ark, and is broken to pieces, and the Philistines are grievously plagued of God in their privities. Wherefore they send back the Ark of the Covenant with Presents: It cometh to Beth-Semes in the land of Juda: from thence it is carried unto Kiriath-Jearim, where Samuel setteth up a Reformation of Worship, and service of God: And he assembleth the people together at Mizpa, where the Philistines intended to fall upon them, but God affrighted them by a great and mighty thunder, and they were beaten of the Israelites, desire a King for to rule over them, which displeaseth the Lord, who advertiseth them by Samuel, how they should be dealt withal by the King; But the people notwithstanding persevering in this request, at length the same is condescended unto both by God, and Samuel: and he telleth Saul, who was come unto him at Mizpa, that he was the man that should be created King over Israel: and he anointeth him for that very purpose: who in the beginning of his reign smiteth the Ammonites. Samuel leaveth his office of Judge, and having declared how sincerely and uncorruptly he had behaved himself therein, is dismissed and thanked with a glorious testimony and applause of all people. Saul and Jonathan make war against the Philistines, and others, and smite them. Sauel telleth Saul that the Lord would take away the Kingdom from him, and he anointeth David King over Israel. Who encountreth with the Giant Goliath, and conquereth him. Saul waxing jealous against David, because of the honour and reverence shewed to him, seeketh his life: Who thereupon fleeth from the Court, and cometh unto Samuel at Najoth, and he maketh a League of Amity with Jonathan, the Son of Saul. He fleeth and cometh for shelter unto Achis King of the Philistines, where he behaveth himself like a madman. He goeth to Adullam, where his friends and others are gathered to him: But he strayeth from the one to the other: and Saul causeth Achimelech the High-Priest, and all his Fathers house to be put to death, as also fourscore and five Priests, and the Citizens of Nob, because they had entertained and nourished David and his men. David fleeth into the Wilderness of Siph, from thence into the Wilderness of Maon, whither he pursueth close after him, until newes was brought him, that the Philistines had invaded the Land; Whom having quelled, he proceedeth in his pursuit after David. But at length, acknowledging his offence unto him, entreateth david to favour his Posterity, when he should come to the Crown. Afterwards is related the death of Samuel, and Davids dealing with Nabal, and with Abigal: Item, how Saul persisted in pursuing after David: insomuch that he at length fled unto Achis, King of Gath, who gave him the City Zizlag, from whence marching forth with his men of war, he plundereth and slayeth certain of the neighbouring people thereabouts. And when the Phmlistines went forth with great strength, to battel against Israel, Seul asketh counsel of the Lord; but when he answered himnot, he addresseth himself unto a witch for counsel. David being willing and ready to`go forth with King Achis to battel`against saul, is sent back. In iis absence, Ziglag is plundered by the Amalekites, but he tursueth after them, and recovereth the prey. Lastly, in this book is described the death and ruine of Saul, and his sons.
\p In this first Book of Samuel are described the Histories of fourscore years; namely, forty yeas under government of Eli the Priest, chap.4.18. And other`fourty years under the government`of Samuel and Saul, Act.13.25 .
\p This Book (as also the next following) is called the Book of Samuel, because therein are described`and mentioned, the Parents, Birthl and Education; also the Touch, Life, aod Government of Semuel, as Judge over Isreel: Likewise the Life of two Kings- who, by the command of God, were by him anointed Kings over Israel. the Greek and ancient Latine Translators have joined the two Books of Samuel, and the two next following Books together, and have called all four the Bookes of the Kings, because in these four Bookes are recorded the Lives, and the special acts or Deeds of all the Kings, that have reigned over the people of God, from the first to the last, untill the Kingly Government, by the just judgement of God, received a period and determination among them.

\s Elkana goeth yearly up unto the Feast at Silo, with both his wivesm ver.1.,&c. Wherefore the one, named Hanna, was barren, 5. The otjer, namely Peninna, upbraideth Hanna with her barrenness, 6. Wherefore Hannah prayeth fervently unto the Lord for a Son, whom she promiseth to give unto the Lord to minister unto him`10. Eli the Priest, thinking that she`was drunk, rebuketh her, 12. But being better informed by her,15 comferteth her, 17. She returneth homeward with Elkana, q8. She conceiveth, 19n and beareth Samuel, 20. When she had bred him up, she dedicateth him wholly unto the ministery of the Lord, as she had promised, 24.
\p
\v 1 There was a man of Ramathain [This word in the Hebrew is put in the dual number, as if one should say, twofold Rama, because this city (as it is thought) was divided into two parts, Matth.27.27. it is called Arimathea] Zophin, [i.e. of the Zophites, or of the inhabitants of the land of Zuph, whereof mention is made below, chap.9.5.] of the mountain of Ephraim, [hereby this city is distinguished from Rama in Benjamin, and from Rama in the tribe of Naphtali, and other cities more, that are called Rama] whose name was Elkana, a son of Jerocham, the son of Elibu, the son of Tochu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite. [Otherwise, an Ephraimite, as Judg.12.5. i.e. one that is born in the land of Ephraim: but he was by descent of the tribe of Levi, I Chron.6.27.]
\p
\v 2 . And he had two wives, the name of the one was Hanna, and the name of the other was Peninna, but Hanna had no children.
\p
\v 3 . Now this man went up out of his city from year to year [Heb. From dayes to dayes. The Hebrew word Jamin is often used in the holy Scripture for years: and here is mention made of the three Annual Feasts of the Jews: see Levit.25.29.] to worship, and to offer unto the LORD of Hosts at Silo, [where the Tabernacle was, Jos.18.1.] and there were the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Pinebas, the Priests of the LORD [viz. under their Father Eli, who was the High-Priest.]
\p
\v 4 . And it came to pass on that day when Elakana offere, [viz. Thank-offering, whereof he that offered, had his part or portion, which he might eat with his family] that he gave to Peninna his wife, and all her sons, and all her daughters, portions. [viz. of the offering or sacrifice: see Deut.11.12. & 16.11.]
\p
\v 5 . But unto Hanna he gave an honourable portion, [i.e. Which was glorious to behold. Heb. a piece of two faces. This courtesie Elkana shewed to his wife Hanna, to recreate her therewith] for he loved Hanna [i.e. he loved her exceedingly more then he did Peninna: see the like example, Gen .29.30.] but the LORD had shut up her womb. [See Gen.20.18.]
\p
\v 6 . And her adversary [viz. Peninna, who envied her, or grudged her: see Levit.18.18.] vexed her also with vexing, to incense her, [otherwise, while she thundered; i.e. brake out into words of passion] because the LORD had shut up her womb.
\p
\v 7 . And so [viz. As ver.4, 5. is mentioned] he [viz. Elkana] did year to year; from that time she [viz. Hanna] went up to the house of the LORD, she vexed her so: [The meaning of these words is, that Peninna vexed, disquieted, and provoked Hanna to wrath] therefore she wept, and did not eat. [i.e. she did eat very little.]
\p
\v 8 . Then said Elkana her husband; Hanna, why weepest thou? Why eatest thou not? [oth. Why is thy heart ill-disposed (or, grieved)] am not I better then ten sons?
\p
\v 9 . Then Hanna arose after that (he) [i.e. Elkana, for it seemeth that she did eat either nothing at all, or but very little] had eaten, and after that (he) had drank at Silo; (and Eli the Priest sat upon a stool by a post of the Temple [i.e. of the Tabernacle, for at this time the Temple was not yet built] of the LORD).
\p
\v 10 . She then being bitterly grieved in soul, [Heb. Bitter of soul. Compare Judg.18. on v.25.] prayed unto the LORD, and she wept sore. [Heb. she wept weeping.]
\p
\v 11 . And she vowed a vow, [i.e. With the privity and consent of her husband: for otherwise the womans vow was of no force: see Numb.30.8.] and said; LORD of hosts, if thou once lookest on [Heb. if thou seeing seest] the misery of thine hand-maid, [thus she calleth her barrenness, see Gen.29.32.] and remembrest me, and forgettest not thine hand-maid, but givest unto thine hand-maid a male-feed: [Heb. a seed of men; i.e. a son] then will I give it unto the LORD [i.e. dedicate it unto thy ministery] all the dayes of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head. [i.e. he shall be a Nazarite, see Numb.6.5.]
\p
\v 12 . Now it came to pass, when she continued praying very much [Heb. multiplied to pray] before the face of the LORD, that Eli heeded her mouth.
\p
\v 13 . For Hanna spake in her heart, her lips onely moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli held her to be drunk.
\p
\v 14 . And Eli said unto her: how long wilt thou demean thy self drunk? Put away thy wine from thee. [i.e. lay thy self to sleep, that thou mayest digest, and sleep away thy wine.]
\p
\v 15 . But Hanna answered and said; No, my Lord, I am a woman grieved in spirit [Heb, hard of spirit, or, mind] I have neither drunk wine nor strong drink; but I have powred out my soul [i.e. the trouble and anguish of my heart] before the face of the LORD.
\p
\v 16 . Count not, I pray thee, thine hand-maid for a daughter of Belial: [See Deut.13.ver.13. Heb. Put not thine hand-maid for a daughter of Belial] for I have hitherto spoken out of the abundance of my thoughts, and of my grief.
\p
\v 17 . Then Eli answered and said; Go thy ways in peace: and the God of Israel will grant thy petition, [Or, grant thee thy petition] that thou hast petitioned of him.
\p
\v 18 . And she said, Let thine hand-maid find favour in thine eyes: [In these words she requesteth, that Eli henceforward would pray unto the Lord for her] so the woman went her way, and she did eat, [for Elies, words had cheared her] and her countenance was not (such) to berary more. [Heb. her counterance was not any more to her, i.e. that sad counterance, which she had had before.]
\p
\v 19 . And they rose up early in the morning, and they worshipped [See Gen.24.on v.26. so below v.28.] before the face of the LORD, and they returned, and came to their house at Rama: [verse I. at Ramathain] and Elkana knew his wife Hanna, [i.e. lay with her, as Genes.4.1.] and the LORD remembred her. [That is, he made it appear indeed that he had heard her prayer.]
\p
\v 20 . And it came to pass after the expiration of dayes, that Hanna conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Samuel: for (she said) I have petitioned him of the LORD.
\p
\v 21 . And that man Elkana went up [viz. Unto Silo, as above ver.3.] with all his house, to offer unto the LORD. [viz. that which he had vowed to offer unto the Lord, for a token of thankfulness, that the Lord had given him a son by his wife Hanna, or to perform both his, and his wifes Vow, concerning the child] the yearly offering, [Heb. the offering of dayes; i.e. which was every year offered on the Feast-days,] and his Vow.
\p
\v 22 . But Hanna went not up [The women were not enjoyned to go up every year (although they might do it, and sometimes did use to do it) but onely the men, Exod.23.17.] but she said unto her husband, when the boy is weaned, then will I bring him, that be may appear before the face of the LORD, and there to continue for ever. [i.e. his life-time: see above v.11. and below v.28.]
\p
\v 23 . And Elkana her husband said unto her, Do that which is good in thine eyes, tarry until thou shalt have weaned him: onely the LORD establish his Word: so the woman tarried, and gave her son suck, until she weaned him.
\p
\v 24 . Afterward when she had weaned him, she brought him up with her, with three Bullocks, and one Epha, [See Exod.16.36.& Lev.5.11.] of meal, and a bottle of wine, and she brought him into the house of the LORD at Silo: and the boy was (very) young.
\p
\v 25 . And they slew a bullock: so they brought the child unto Eli.
\p
\v 26 . And she said, Oh my Lord, (as true as) thy soul liveth, [i.e. As true as thou livest] my Lord, I am that woman, that stood here by thee to pray unto the LORD.
\p
\v 27 . I prayed for this child, and the LORD hath granted me my petition, which I have petitioned of him.
\p
\v 28 . Therefore I have also given him over, [Otherwise, Lent, viz. to minister in the Tabernancle] unto the LORD all the days that he shall be, [oth. All the days that he shall be, he shall be given to the LORD] he is begged of the LORD: and he [viz. Samuel, or Eli, or also Elkana and Hanna] worshipped the LORD there.
\c 2
\s Hanna’s Song of Praise, wherein she proclaimeth the bountifulness of the Lord, both in general, and in speciall, ver.1,&c. Threatning the proud with utter ruine and destruction, 3. The obstinate wickedness of Elies sons is declared .12. And on the contrary is shewed, how well Samuel behaved himself in his Ministery, 18. Hanna beareth more children, 21. Eli rebuketh indeed his sons for their wicked deeds, but not with that severity, as he ought, 22. The Lord telleth Eli, by a Prophet, thathe and all his House should miserably perish, 21.
\p
\v 1 . Then Hanna prayed, and said: Mine heart leapeth up for joy in the LORD, [To wit, forasmuch as he hath shewed me this great mercy, tha he hath given me this son] mine horn is exalted in the LORD [i.e. I have as it were received new strength from the Lord, I am now courageous and undanted. It is a similitude taken from horned beasts, who have their greatest strength, and likewise their ornament in their hornes: see Psal.92.11.] my mouth is opened against mine enemies, [as if he had said, Seeing the Lord hath given me this son, now I dare speak with open mouth against mine enemies, especially against Peninna, her children and friends, that upbraided me with my barrenness] for I rejoice in thy salvation. [that is, in happiness which thou hast conferred upon me, O Lord. Oth. for thou hast made me joyful with thy salvation.]
\p
\v 2 . There is none holy like the LORD, for there is none beside thee, and there is no rock [The strong God is also called a Rock, Deut.32.15. and elsewhere] like our God. [i.e. there is none that a man may rely upon, but onely thou, O Lord God, Deut.32.4.]
\p
\v 3 . Make it not too much, that thou shouldest speak lostily, lostily, [Hanna speaketh here unto Peninna (see above chap.1. ver.6,7.) likewise unto all proud presumptuous persons] that any hard thing [or, that which is old; that is, as heretofore ye were wont to do] should go forth out at your mouth; for the Lord is a God of knowledges, [i.e. of all, or great knowledge. Compare v.1,20. with the annotate.] and his deeds are rightly done [compare chap.18.25. Oth. the deeds, or, works, are ordered, or, weighed by him. Others thus, are (not) his works made right?]
\p
\v 4 . The bowe of the strong is broken: [Heb, the bowes are broken. See the like change of number, Job 29.10. Oth. the strong (with) the bowe are broken] and they that stumbled [to wit, as well out of weakness of body, as out of pusillanimity] are girt about with strength.
\p
\v 5 . They that were satisfied, have hired out themselves for bread, [i.e. They are grown so poor, that they have been sain to hire out themselves, to get viciuals] and they that were hungry [compare Job 18. on verse 12.] are not so more, [Heb. have ceased; viz. to be, or to be hungry] until the burden hath born seven [i.e. many, as Ruth.4.15. see below v.21.] and she that had many children is wixen feeble. [viz. to conceive and hear children.]
\p
\v 6 . The LORD killeth, [i.e. He feedeth people great troubles and afflictions, which may be resembled to death] and maketh alive: [i.e. he delivereth again the afflicted and sorrowful out of their trouble and distress] he causeth to descend into hell, [i.e. he bringeth into the uttermist shame and disgrace, see Gen.3. on v.7.] and he causeth to ascend (again)
\p
\v 7 . The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich, he humbleth, he also exalteth.
\p
\v 8 . He lifteth up the mean (one) out of the dust, (and) him that is in need he exalteth from the mire, [Or, from the dunghill] to make (them) sit among the Princes, that he may make them inherit the seat of honour; for the foundations of the earth are the LORD’S and he hath set the world upon them.
\p
\v 9 . He will keep the feet of his favourites, but the wicked shall be silent in darkness: [Or, shall be destroyed, (and cast into darkness] for a man prevaileth not by strength.
\p
\v 10 . They that contend with the LORD, shall be broken to pieces; he shall thunder in heaven upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth, [i.e. Even those that are in the uttermost ends of the world] and shall give strength unto his King, [viz, unto Christ, whom he hath ordained, and whom at the time appointed he will send] and exalt the horn of his anointed. [i.e. Christ, see Psa.2.2.]
\p
\v 11 . Afterward Elkana went unto Rama into his house, but the youth did minister unto the LORD before the face of Eli the Priest.
\p
\v 12 . But the sons of Eli were children of Belial: [See Deut.13. v.13.] they knew not the LORd.
\p
\v 13 . For the manner [Heb Misphat, the right, which word signifieth sometimes a custome or use, not only a good and laudable, but also a bad and blameable use or custome] of those Priests with the people was, that (when) any man offered [i.e. brought to be offered or sacrificed. So vers.15.] an offering, the Priests boy came, while the flesh was boyling, with a three-toothed flesh-hook in his hand.
\p
\v 14 . And strook into the dish, or into the kettle, or into the pan, or into the pot, al that the flesh-hook drew up, [God had given the Priests for their food certain pieces, or parts of the beasts that were offered: viz. the brest and the right shoulder, Exod.29.27,28. and Levit.7.21,32,33. but they might not take what they pleased, or what the fork gave there: also the portion that belonged to the Priest must first be heaved up waved before the Lord, Lev.7.34.] that the Priest took for himself: [Or, therewith, viz. with the flesh-hook] so they did at Silo unto all the Israelities [Heb. all Israel] that came thither.
\p
\v 15 . Also before they burnt the fat, [See Levit.3.3,&c.] came the Priests boy, and said unto the man, that offered, give that flesh to rost for the Priest: for he will take no sodden flesh of thee, [yet the Priest took also sodden flesh, as appeareth, vers.13.] but raw. [Heb. alive, here is intimated that he rather had raw flesh, then boiled or sodden.]
\p
\v 16 . When now that man said unto him, they will as to day wholly burn [Heb. burning burn] that fat; therefore take for thy self, as thy soul shall desire: then he said unto him, Now shalt thou surely give it, and if not, I will take it by force.
\p
\v 17 . So the sin of these young men [viz. of the sons of Eli] was very great before the face of the LORD: for the people despised the meat-offering of the LORD. [Intimating that when the people saw how seriously the sons of Eli abused the Sacrifices to their own pleasure, and voluptuousness, they thereby got a loathing of the worship and service of God, so that they caught no more meat-offerings unto the Lord.]
\p
\v 18 . But Samuel ministred before the face of the LORD, being a young-man, girt about with a linen upper garment. [Heb. Ephod. Compare 2 Sam.6.14.]
\p
\v 19 . And his mother made him a little coat, and brought it him from year to year [Heb. from dayes to dayes] when she came up with her husband, to offer the yearly offering, [Heb. the offering of dayes.]
\p
\v 20 . And Eli blessed Elkana and his wife [that is, He as High Priest wished them much joy] saying, The LORD give thee seed [i.e. children] of this woman, for the petition [i.e. for the petitioned son, who is now also dedicated and given unto God] which she [Heb. he. See the like change of the feminine and masculine gender, Genes.6.1. Exod.31.14. Levit.2.8. I Sam.25.27. 2 Kings 3.26. Hos.14.7. Ruth 1.8,9,11,19,22.] hath petitioned of the LORD: [Oth. which hath been petitioned of the LORD, or, which hath been asked, or, desired before the LORD. It is as if he had said, She hath not begged or asked this son of the Lord for herself, or for her own benefit; but that she might dedicate him unto the Lord, ho his ministery] and they went unto his place, [viz. unto Elkana’s place]
\p
\v 21 . For the LORD visited Hanna, [Confirming the blessing of Eli, which they confided, that the Lord would accomplish] and she conceived, and bare three sons, and two daughters, [The meaning is, a several births] and the lad Samuel waxed great [Understand this of the increase or growth of the body in bigness and stature, and of the soul in wisdom and knowledge. See Luke 1.80. and 2.40,52.] by the LORD. [Oth. before, or, with the Lord.]
\p
\v 22 . But Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and that they lay with the women, that assembled in heaps; [See the annot. on Exod.38.8.] at the door of the Tent [i.e. before the Tent, for unto the Tent they might not come] of the congregation.
\p
\v 23 . And he said unto them, why do ye such things, that I hear (of) these your wicked deeds by all this people?
\p
\v 24 . Not my sons: [i.e. It becometh you not to deal so] for this is no good report, that I hear, ye make the LORDS people to transgresse, [viz. ye command concerning sacrifice. See above vers.17.]
\p
\v 25 . When a man sinneth against a man, then the gods [Oth. the Magistrate, the Judges. See Exod.21.6. and the annot. there] shall judge him, but when a man sinneth [viz. wilfully and presumptuously] against the LORD, who shall pray for him? But they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, for the LORD would slay them. [Therefore the Lord gave them not grace to repent, but he did more and more forsake them, and gave them in his justice over to a reprobate minde to their own ruin and destruction.]
\p
\v 26 . And the lad Samuel increased, [Heb. went. Compare Genes.26.13. with the annotate.] and grew great and acceptable [Heb. good] both with the LORD, and also with men.
\p
\v 27 . And there came a man of God [i.e. a Prophet of the Lord, as 2 Pet.1.21. I Tim.6.11. and 2 Tim.3.17. Who this Prophet was is unknown unto us. See the anno. Judg.13. on vers.6.] unto Eli, and said unto him, (thus saith the Lord) have I not clearly revealed myself [Or, am I not, &c. Heb. revealing revealed] unto the house of thy father, [viz. Aaron, of whom Eli descended by Ithamar] when they [viz. the children of Israel] were in Egypt, in the house of Pharao, [i.e. when they were yet under the Dominion and Tyannie of Pharao.]
\p
\v 28 . And I did chuse him [viz. Aaron] out of all the tribes of Israel to (be) Priest unto me, to offer upon mine Altar, to burn incense, to wear the Ephod before my face: and did give unto the house of thy father all the fire-offerings. [Meaning all the parts of the beasts, which in the Sacrifices were not to be burnt upon the Altar. See Levit.7.34. and Numb.18.18.] of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 29 . Why kick ye [viz. thou Eli, and thy sons] against my slay-offering, and my meat-offering, which I commanded in the habitation? [i.e. the Tabernacle, which was Gods habitation] and honourest thy sons more then me, [bearing more respect unto them, then unto me; for thou durst not provoke them, nor soundly reprove them, much lesse punish them as thou oughtest to do, or to remove them from the Priest-hood, as their wicked practises have justly deserved] that ye [viz. thou Eli, as well as thy sons] fallen your selves with the chiefest of all meat-offerings of my people Israel.
\p
\v 30 . Therefore speaketh the LORD the God of Israel, I had [To wit, when I instituted the Priestly office in thy fathers house] indeed clearly said, [Heb. I had saying said] Thy house and thy fathers house should walk before my face [i.e. execute the Priestly office,] for ever: [viz. if they should walk in my commandments] but now speaketh the LORD, Be far from me. [viz. by reason of your disobedience] for they that honour me, will I honour, and they that despise me, shall lightly be esteemed. [Heb. shall become light.]
\p
\v 31 . Behold the dayes come, that I will cut off thine arm, [That is, I will deprive thee of thy strength: to wit of thy children and the Priestly office: for when the High-Priest-hood was taken away from Eli, and his, they had no strength or power at all. See below vers.36. Psal.37.17. and in other places, more] and the Arm of thy fathers house: that there shall not be an old man in thine house.
\p
\v 32 . And thou shalt behold the distresse of the habitation (of God) [i.e. of the carrying away of the Ark out of the Tabernacle, or habitation, the slaughter of the Israelites, and the captivity of the Ark. See below chap.4. vers.11. Oth. Thou shalt see an adversary in the habitation. Thou, that is, thy posterity (for Eli continued Priest all his life-time) but afterward shall another (thine, as being excluded) be placed in their stead. See I Kings 2.27.] instead of all the good that he should have done unto Israel: [Oth. in all things wherein he should have done unto Israel] and there shall at no day be an old man in thine house.
\p
\v 33 . But the man [viz. he that shall continue in the service or ministery at the Altar] whom I shall not cut off unto thee [i.e. of thine] from mine Altar, should be to consume thine eyes, [i.e. if thou shouldst then yet live, and shouldst see all these things, thou wouldst weep out thine eyes. This may be understood of the miserable murdering of the Priests at Nob, I Sam.22.18. or also of the shameful deposing of Abiathar, I Kings 2.26. whereunto the first words of this verse do well agree] and to grieve thy soul: and all [i.e. almost all] the multitude of thine house shall die, being grown men. [i.e. in the flower of their age.]
\p
\v 34 . Now this shall be a token unto thee, which shall come upon both thy sons, upon Hophni and Pinehas: they shall both die in one day. [See the accomplishment hereof below chap 4.11.]
\p
\v 35 .And I will raise me up a faithful Pries, [viz. Zadok, who was of the family of Eleazar. See the accomplishment, I Chro.29.22.] who shall do according to that which shall be in mine heart, and in my soul: [i.e. as it pleaseth me] him will I build a stedfast-house, [Heb. a faithful house. In Zadoks family did the High-Priest-hood continue a long while, according to that which God promised unto Pinehas the son of Eleazar, Numb.25.13.] and be [Meaning, be, and his posterity] shall alwayes [Heb. all the dayes, to wit, of his life] walk [i.e. administer; or execute the Priestly office, as vers.30.] before the face of mine anointed. [i.e. before the King, whom I shall chuse, who also shall be a type of Christ, whom I have anointed King over Zion my mine holy mountain.]
\p
\v 36 . And it shall come to pass, that all that shall be left of thine house, shall come, [See the fulfilling I Kings 2.26. and 2 Kings 23.9. See also tokens or evidences hereof, Ezech.44.14.] to how down before him [viz. before Zadok, and his posterity] for a piece of money, and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Assure me, I pray thee, into a Priestly function, that I may eat a morset of bread.

\s Samuel was called thrice in one night by the Lord, and thought that it was Eli that called him, vers.1,&c. but being called the fourth time, he answereth the Lord, 10. Who revealeth to him, that he will destroy the house of Eli, 11. Which Samuel in the morning discorvereth to him, at his request, 15. Eli submitteth himself to the will of the Lord, 18. Samuel is acknowledged for a Prophet by all Israel, in regard the Lord often revealed himself unto him, 19.
\p
\v 1 . And the young man Samuel ministred unto the LORD, before the face of Eli: [See the annot. on chap.2.11.] and the word of the LORD was precious in those dayes, [intimating, that at that time there were but few Prophets and faithful Teachers in Israel: so that when there came a man of God, it was a most rare thing] there was no publick [Heb. broken thorow, broken out. Oth. manyfold] vision.
\p
\v 2 . And it came to passé that day, [viz. when the word of the Lord was so precious] when Eli lay down in his place (and his eyes began to grow dark, that he could not see:) [i.e. not very well. So Genes.48.10. it’s said of Jacob, that he did not see; i.e. he did not see very well; for vers.8. it’s said, that he saw the sons of Joseph.]
\p
\v 3 . And Samuel likewise had laid him down, before the Lamp of God was put out, [He speaketh of the Lamp that stood on the golden Candlestick, which was to burn all night long from the evening until morning, and then it was put out, Exod.27.21. Levit.24.3. and 2 Chron.13.11.] in the Temple of the LORD, [i.e. in one of the rooms or chambers near or about the Tabernacle, for the Temple was not yet built] where the Ark of God was:
\p
\v 4 . That the LORD called Samuel; and he said, Lo, (here) am I.
\p
\v 5 . And he run unto Eli, and said, Behold, (here) am I, for thou calledst me: but he said, I called not, return, lay thee down: and he went his way, and laid him down.
\p
\v 6 . Thou the LORD called Samuel again, and Samuel rose up, and went unto Eli, and said, Behold (here) am I, for thou calledst me: he then said, I called not, my son, return, lay thee down.
\p
\v 7 . But Samuel did not yet know the LORD, [i.e. he did not know the calling voice of the Lord, as being not accustomed to hear it: Or, he had as yet no apprehension of such kind of Revelations, whereby the Lord did appear unto men in a discoursive way,] and the word of the LORD was not yet revealed unto him.
\p
\v 8 . Then the LORD called Samuel again, the third time, and he roes up, and went unto Eli, and said, Behold, (here) am I, for thou calledst me: then Eli understood, that the LORD called the young man.
\p
\v 9 . Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, go thy wayes, lay thee down, and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak LORD, for thy servant heareth: then Samuel went his way, and lay him down in his place. [See above on v.2.]
\p
\v 10 . then came the LORD, and set himself there [Oth. and he continued standing, i.e. he went not again away, as he had done before,] and called as at other times, [Heb. as turn upon turn,] Samuel, Samuel: and Samuel said, speak LORD, for thy servant heareth.
\p
\v 11 . And the LORD said unto Samuel, Behold, I do a thing [Meaning the discomfiture of the Israelites, whereof mention is made below, chap.4.vers.2. and 10.] in Israel, that whosoever shall hear it (unto him) both his ears shall tingle. [Intimating, that those that should hear of the great discomfiture of the Israelites, they should as it were lose their fences through amazement or astonishment.]
\p
\v 12 . The same day I will bring upon Eli all that I have spoken [viz. by the man of God, chap.2.27,&c.] against his house, I will begin it, and make an end.
\p
\v 13 . For I have told him that I will judge his house [i.e. that I will execute my just judgment and vengeance upon him and his house,] forever: for the iniquity, which he hath known, for when his sons made themselves accused [Oth. light, contemptible: i.e. when by their wicked life and ungodly practises they made themselves to be cursed and despised, and to be counted vain light fellows, that were worthy no honour or esteem] he looked not once sour upon them [The Hebrew word signifieth properly to get wrinkles in the face, which is done by those, that being displeased do frown or look sour. Understand hereby also, much lesse did he punish them according to their demerit, which he ought to have done, as Father, as high Priest, and as Judge, who was ordered to stop and hinder wickedness, and to punish it, being committed.]
\p
\v 14 . Therefore then I have sworn unto the house of Eli; If the iniquity of the house of Eli, [Of this kind of oath, see Genes.14. vers.22,23.] shall be expiated by slay-offering, or meat-offering for ever. [To wit, so, as that I should keep book, and not execute the temporal judgements which I have pronounced against the house of Eli.]
\p
\v 15 . Now Samuel lay until the morning, then opened he the doors of the house of the LORD: but Samuel feared to declare this vision [i.e. those things, with the Lord had revealed to him in a vision, although this was not only a vision, but also an appearance: Samuel waking heard these words, and not in a trance, as visions were wont to be made. See Gen.15.1.] unto Eli.
\p
\v 16 . Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel my son: then he said, Behold, (here) am I.
\p
\v 17 . And he said, What is the word that he spake unto thee? conceal it not, I pray thee from me: Let God do so to thee, and so let him add thereunto, [See of this phrase, Ruth 1.17.] if thou conceal one word from me of all the words that he hath spoken unto thee.
\p
\v 18 . Then Samuel told him all those words, and concealed (them) not from him: and he said, he is the LORD, let him do what is good in his eyes.
\p
\v 19 . Now Samuel waxed great, and the LORD was with him, and let not one of all his words fall to the ground [i.e. the Lord performed effectually, whatsoever he had foretold by Samuel. To fall to the ground, is as much to say as to come to nothing, or, to come to shame, as Matth.10. vers.29. Compare I Kings 8.56.]
\p
\v 20 . And all Israel from Dan to Berseba, acknowledged, that Samuel was established [Oth. was esteemed, or, found faithful] to (be) a Prophet of the LORD.
\p
\v 21 . And the LORD proceeded to appear unto Samuel at Silo, for the LORD revealed himself unto Samuel at Silo by the word of the LORD. [Intimating, that the Lord revealed his word unto Samuel by dreams, visions, and discoursing or communing with him, which was seldom done before. See above v.1.]
\c 4
\s The Israelites are smitten by the Philistines, v.1, &c. Therefore they cause the Ark of the covenant to be brought from Silo into the camp, which is received with great shouting of the people, 5. Which astonisheth the Philistines, 6. Tet they take courage again, 9. The Philistines smite the Israelites the second time, 10. The Ark is taken, and the two sons of Eli are slain, 11. When this was told Eli, 12. the whole city was grieved, 13. And Eli hearing all, falleth backward from his seat, and breaketh his neck, and dieth, 14. And his Daughter in law dieth in travel, 19. having named her son Icabod, 21.
\p
\v 1 . And the word of Samuel came to all Israel: [i.e. The Prophecie which was revealed unto Samuel by the Lord, he revealed unto the people, and it was fulfilled. See chap.3.11, 21.] and Israel went out to meet the Philistines to battel, and camped themselves by Eben-haezer, [i.e. the stone of help, help-stone. This place got first afterward this name. See below chap.7.12. So is Laz, Gen.12. called Bethel, which name Jacob a long while after gave unto this place, Gen.28.19.] but the Philistines camped themselves by Aphek. [A city lying in the tribe of Juda, Jos.chap.15.53. but there is another Aphek in the tribe of Ascher, Jos.19.30. Judg.1. vers.31.]
\p
\v 2 . And the Philistines put themselves in battel-array to meet Israel: and when the battel [i.e. the souldiers that fought] spread it self out, [Intimating that when all the bands and companies were met together to fight, they smote, &c.] then was Israel smitten before the face of the Philistine: for they [to wit, the Philistines] slew in the battel-array in the field, [intimating, while the battel lasted, when both the camps yet stood in their battel-array] about four thousand man.
\p
\v 3 . When the people were (again) come into the camp, then the eldest of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD to day smitten us before the face of the Philistines? let us take unto us out of Silo the Ark of the covenant of the LORD, and let it come into the midst of us, that it may deliver us from our enemies. [This they did without asking counsel of God, thinking that this outward ceremony was able to protect and deliver them from the hands of their enemies.]
\p
\v 4 . Therefore the people sent to Silo, and they brought from thence the Ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who dwelleth between the Cherubims: [From between which God spake with Moseh, and others, Exod.25.22. Numb.7.89.] and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Pinehas, were there [viz. in the camp] with the Ark of the covenant of God.
\p
\v 5 . And it came to passé when the Ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, that all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth shook.
\p
\v 6 . Now when the Philistines heard the voice of the shout, then they said, what is [i.e. meaneth] the voice of this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews: then they understood that the Ark of the LORD was come into the camp.
\p
\v 7 . Therefore the Philistines feared; for they said God is come into the camp: and said, wo unto us, for the like hath not been done yesterday (nor) ere yesterday.
\p
\v 8 . Wo unto us, who shall deliver us out of the land of these glorious Gods? [Or, of this glorious God] these are the same Gods, which plagued the Egyptians with all plagues by the wilderness. [i.e. in the reed See, which lieth by the wilderness of Etham; see Exod.13.20. and chap.14.]
\p
\v 9 . Be strong, and be men, the Philistines, left ye perhaps serve the Hebrew, according as they have served you, therefore be men, and fight.
\p
\v 10 . Then the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and every one fled into his tent, [i.e. into his house, as below chap.13.2. and I Kings 12.16,&c.] and there was made a very great slaughter, [Heb. blow] so that there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
\p
\v 11 . And the Ark of God was taken: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Pinehas died.
\p
\v 12 . Then there ran a Benjamite out of the Battel-array, and came to Silo the same day: and his clothes were rent, [In token of grief, and that he brought bad tidings. Of this phrase, see the annotat. in Genes.37.29. and Jos.7.6,&c. and 2 Sam.1.2,11.] and there was earth upon his head. [See the like example, Jos.7.6. and 2 Sam.1.2.]
\p
\v 13 . And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a stool by the wayes side, looking out: for his heart trembled because of the Ark of God: when that man came, to tell (it) in the city, then all the city cried out. [i.e. the inhabitants of the city called and cried loud out of grief, when they heard that the Ark of the covenant was taken]
\p
\v 14 . And when Eli heard the voice of the cry, he said, what is the voice of this tumult? Then the man made haste, and he came and told it Eli.
\p
\v 15 . Now Eli was a man of four score and eighteen years, and his eyes stood stiff, [Heb. stood] (so to he could not see.)
\p
\v 16 . And that man said unto Eli: I am he, that come out of the battel-array, and I am fled to day out of the battel-array: then he said, what is there done, ny son?
\p
\v 17 . Then answered he, that brought the message, [Or, the messenger] and said, Israel is fled before the face of the Philistines, and there is likewise a great slaughter made among the people: besides thy two son s Hophni and Pinehas are dead, and the Ark of God is taken.
\p
\v 18 . And it came to passé, when he made mention of the Ark of God, that he fell backward from off the seat, at the side of the gate, [Understand this of the city-gate] and brake his neck, and died, for the man was old and heavy: and he judged Israel fourty years.
\p
\v 19 .And his daughter in law, Pinehas wife, was with child, ready to travel: when this (woman) heard the tidings, that the Ark of God was taken, and her father in law was dead, and her husband, then she bowed her self, [viz. through pain and anguish which she felt] and travelled, for her woes [Pains, sorrows, anxieties, need] fell upon her, [Heb. her needs turned themselves upon her.]
\p
\v 20 . And about the time of her dying, the woman that stood by her, [Or, over her] spake, fear not, for thou hast born a son: but she answered not, and took it not to heart. [Heb, she set not her heart (upon) it: i.e. she was not at all moved at such sayings. They comforted or revived not her heart.]
\p
\v 21 . And she named her child Icabod, [i.e. where is the glory? Oth. there is no honour] saying, The glory is carried away from Israel, because the Ark of God was carried away captive, [As if she had said, All the glory and excellency of Israel is now taken away from us, for as much as the ark is taken away from us, which brought great glory and renowne unto Israel: for it was a token of Gods gracious presence with his people. This phrase is also used, Psal.26.8. and 78.61.] and because of her father in law, and her husband.
\p
\v 22 . And she said, The glory is carried away captive from Israel, for the Ark of God is taken. [This woman lamenteth more, and is more grieved for the common damage, then for her own private losse. See also above verse.18.]
\c 5
\s The Philistines place the Ark of God at Asdod in the house of their Idol Dagon, verse 1, &c. Who falleth down before the same, 3. This is done again the next day, and his head and hands are broken off from his body, 4. The Philistines are grievously plagued with emerods in all the Cities, whither thy brought the Ark, 6. So that they take counsel together, how they may be rid of the Ark, 7. They send it into Ekron were much troubled, 10. At length they resolved to send it home again to the Israelites, 11.
\p
\v 1 . Now the Philistines took the Ark of God; and they brought it from Eben-hadzer [See above chap.4. vers.1.] into Asdod. [This City is, Act.8.40. called Azotus. It was one of the chiefest Cities of the Philistines, in which there dwelt giants in Josua’s time, Jos.11.22.]
\p
\v 2 . And the Philistines took the Ark of God, and they brought it into the house of Dagon, [i.e. Into the Temple of the Idol Dagon, See Judg.16.23. This the Philistines did for a token of victory, which they thought they had obtained by the help of this their God.]
\p
\v 3 . But when those of Asdod arose early the next day, behold Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth, before the Ark of the LORD: And they took Dagon, set him in his place again.
\p
\v 4 . Now when they arose early in the morning the next day, behold, Dagon lay fallen upon his face to the earth before the Ark of the LORD: but the head of Dagon, and both the palms of his hands were cut off, at the threshold, only Dagon [i.e. the stump, whereas the head with the hands were off] was left thereon.
\p
\v 5 . Therefore the Priests of Dagon, nor all that come into the house of Dagon, tread not upon the threshold of Dagon [i.e. on the threshold of the Temple of Dagon; so it is said, the Key of David; i.e. of the house of David] at Asdod unto this day. [Wherefore did they not tread onthethreshold? It seemeth that they accounted it holy, because Dagon had layen upon it.]
\p
\v 6 .But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon those of Asdod, [i.e. the Lord visited them of Asdod with grievous plagues] and made the desolate: [viz. by the mice, as is mentioned, I Sam.6.4.] and he smote them with emerods, [The Hebrew word properly signifieth an hill, and also the fundament, because this part of mans body is exalted, or lifted up. That this part of the body of the Philistines was plagued, is clearly expresied, Psa.78.66.] Asdod and her borders.
\p
\v 7 . Now when the men at Asdod saw, that it so (hapned,) they said, Let not the Ark of the God of Israel abide with us, for his hand is hard, upon us, and upon Dagon our God.
\p
\v 8 . Therefore they sent their wayes, and gathered unto them all the Princes of the Philistines, and they said, what shall we do with the Ark of God of Israel? And they [viz. the Princes of the Philistines] said, Let the Ark of the God of Israel go round about Gath. [This was also one of the chiefest Cities of the Philistines, lying upon a hill, or mountain called Amma, not far from the Sea. David took this City, 2 Sam.8.1. compared with I Chron.18.1. See further concerning this City, 2 Kings 12. Vers.17. and 2 Chron.11.8. and 26.6.] so they carried the Ark of the God of Israel round about.
\p
\v 9 . And it came to passé after thy had carried it round about, that the hand of the LORD was against that city with a very great vexation, [Or, disturbance] for he smote the men of the city from the small to the great, and they had emerods in the hidden places. [Heb. were hidden to them: that is, the swellings were not outward, but inward in the intrals, so that a man could not come at them, to let them blood when they festered, which is the painful sort of emerods.]
\p
\v 10 . Then they sent the Ark of God unto Ekron: [This was also one of the chiefest cities of the Philistines, and fell to the tribe of Juda for parcel of their inheritance, Jos.15.45. Judg.1.18. See further concerning this city, Judg.3.3. & 2 King.1.2. Jer.15.20. & Amos 1.8. Zeph.2.41. & Zach.9.5,7.] but it came to pass when the Ark of God came to Ekron, that they of Ekron cried, saying, They have brought the Ark of the God of Israel round about unto me, to slay me and my people. [the Ekronites having heard and seen the heavy plagues, wherewith the Lord had plagued their neighbours, because of the Ark, were exceedingly afraid, when they heard that they would bring the ark unto them]
\p
\v 11 . And they sent their wayes, and gathered together all the Princes of the Philistines, [viz. The Governours of the city, for there follows, to slay me and my people] and said: Send away the Ark of the God of Israel, that it may return to its place, left it slay me and my people; [Thus spake every one of the Princes of the Philistines] for there was a deadly vexation in all the city, (and) the hand of God was very heavy there. [Some are of opinion, that besides the emerods, there reigned yet another deadly disease amongst the Philistines: see the following verse.]
\p
\v 12 . And the men which died not, [viz. Of the deadly vexation, whereof mention is immediately before, vers.11.] were smitten with emerods: so that the cry of the city [i.e. of the inhabitants of the city] went up to heaven.
\c 6
\s After that the Ark had been seven moneths with the Philistines, ver.1. &c. they consult with the Priests, how they shall send it back, 2. They advise not to send it back empty, but with some Present, 3. Namely, with five golden Emerods and Mice, 4. On a new Cart, 7. The Philistines did so, 10. The Kine that were tied to the Carts, went the straight wat to Beth-Semes, 12. Where the Levites offer sacrifice for it, 14. What Princes and Cities offered golden emerods amd mice, 17. The Beth-Semites are grievously smitten of the Lord, for their curiosity in looking into the Ark, 19. They request them of Kiriath-Jearim, to fetch away the Ark from thence, and to bring in into their own city , 20.
\p
\v 1 . Now when the Ark of the LORD had been seven moneths in the land of the Philistines.
\p
\v 2 . Then the Philistines called the Princes and the Soothsayers, saying, What shall we do with the Ark of the LORD? Let us know wherewith [Oth. How} we shall send it to its place. [viz. into the land of Israel.]
\p
\v 3 . Then they said; If ye send away the Ark of the God of Israel, send it not away empty, [i.e. Without a Present or Gratuity] but in any wise render unto [Heb. rendering render unto] him [viz. the God of Israel] a trespasse-offering: then shall ye be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand [i.e. the plague or punishmet, which onely cometh from the power and providence of God] departeth not from you.
\p
\v 4 . Then said they, What is that trespasse-offering which we shall render unto him? And they said, five golden emerods, and five golden mice, [Of the mice no mention is made before] according to the number of the Princes of the Philistines: [see concerning these five Princes, vers.17.] for its one kind of plague [intimating, that the Princes, Rulers, and Commonalty of Ekron were plagued of God with one and the same plague or punishment] (that is) on you all [Heb. on them all, see above chap.5.v.11.] and on your Princes.
\p
\v 5 . Therefore make images of your emerods, and images of your mice, [i.e. Of the mice that have plagued and tormented you: as the emerods plagued and tormented the body of the Philistines, so the mice hurt and endamaged them in their land that was sowen, by gnawing and eating the seed] that mar the land, and give honour to the God of Israel: [by confessing, that ye are justly punished of God, for your trespass against the Ark of the Lord: so also speaketh Josua unto Achan, Jos. Chap.7.ver.19.] peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your God [viz. Dagon] and from off your land.
\p
\v 6 . Wherefore now should ye make your heart heavy, as the Egyptians, and Pharao made their heart heavy? [This kind of phrase, viz. that something is affirmed in general, and afterward the one or the other in particular, is often used in the holy Scripture; as Jos.2.1. & I Kin.11.1. & 2 Sam.2.1. & Psal.18.1. Mark 1.6,7.] did they not, when he had dealt (wonderfully) with them, [viz. the Egyptians. Others, when he was doing with them, or, when he exercised himself on them, or, after he had mocked them] let them [viz. the Israelites] go, that they departed? [viz. out of Egypt.]
\p
\v 7 . Now then, take and make a new cart, [The Heathenish Priests accounted it an unseemly thing, that the Ark of the Lord should be put and carried in a cart, that had been formerly used to husbandry, or other servile labour or work; see the like, 2 Sam.6.3. Others, make and take a new cart] and two milch Kine, on which there hath come no yoke, tie the Kine to the cart, and taking their calves [Heb. their sons, or, children; so also ver.10.] from after them again home. [This increaseth the miracle, that the Kine turned not back after their sucking calves.]
\p
\v 8 . Therefore take the Ark of the LORD, and put it on the cart, and lay the golden jewels [Heb. vessels, furniture, to wit, the golden emerods and mice] which ye shall return unto him. [viz.unto the God of Israel] for a trespass-offering, in a coffer by the side thereof: and send it away, that it may go away.
\p
\v 9 . Then consider, if it go up by the way of its own border toward Beth-Semes, then he hath done us this great evill: [i.e. we shall thereby know that the God of Israel hath sent us this plague] but if not, then we shall know, that his hand hath not touched us: it was a chance unto us. [i.e. somewhat whereof the natural, or the governing cause cannot be known.]
\p
\v 10 . And those men didi so, and took two mitch Kine that gave suck, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves, [Heb. their children, or, sons] in (the) house.
\p
\v 11 . And they laid the Ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the golden mice, and the images of their emerods.
\p
\v 12 . Now the Kine went straight in that way, upon the way toward Beth-Semes [See of this city, Jos.15.10. in the annotate. and Jos.21.16.] in a street, they went still on, [Heb. they went going] lowing, [viz. because they were deprived of their calves, for even the beasts do love their young ones] and turned neither to the right hand, nor to the left: [From hence may be gathered, that there were divers streets, or by-ways, but these Kine by the providence of God, went the right way to Beth-Semes] and the Princes of the Philistines went after the same unto the border of Beth-Semes.
\p
\v 13 . And they of Beth-Semes reaped the wheat-harvest [This was wont to be done in the land of Judea, about Pentecost, or Whitsuntide, Levit.23. that is, in the moneth of May or shortly after: Therefore the Ark was taken from the Philistines about the beginning of November,for it was Seven moneths in their countrey, ver.I.]in the vaIley, and when they lifted up theireyes,theysaw the Ark, and rejoiced when they saw,(it).
\p
\v 14 . And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-Semite,and stood there still,and there was a great stone: and they [viz.The Levitical Priests that dwelt at Beth-Semes as appeareth ver.15. for this city, was given to the Levites for an habitation, or dwelling place, See :Jos.21.16. it was their office to touch the Ark and to carry it, Numb.of.4.5.&c.] clave the wood of the cart, and offered the Kine unto the Lord for a burnt- offering.
\p
\v 15 . .And the Levites took down the Ark of the LORD, and the coffer that Was by it, wbereintbe golden jewels wire ,and put them upon tbe great stone : and those men of Beth-Semes offered burnt offerings, &c.]and slew slay-offerings unto the Lord, the same day.
\p
\v 16 . And when the five Princes of ~be Philistines had seen it, then they returned unto Ekron the same day.
\p
\v 17 . Now there are the golden emerods which the Phillistines rendered unto the LORD for a trespass- offering : for Asdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one:
\p
\v 18 . Also golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines, under the five Princes, from the fenced cities, onto the countrey villages : and unto Abel,[that is, complaint] the great (stone) [see of this stone above v.14, and 15.Why it was so, called, see verse 19.
\p Compare Gen 50.11]on which they had set down the Ark of the LORD, which [some do here understand the Ark; but others the stone, which is more credible] is in the field of Joshua the Beth-Semite unto this day.
\p
\v 19 . And the Lord smote among these men of Beth-Semes, because they had looked into the Ark of the Lord; [Against the command of God, Num 4.5,20. It seemeth indeed that the Beth-Semites were too curious, to see if the Phillistines had taken anything out of the Ark, or had out any thing into it, and it seemeth that like wise some bold comtempt or presumption was mixed therewith] yea he smote of the people [viz. of the Israelites, that lay there to keep watch that their borders might not be endammaged : also of all those that were come thither out of all the tribes to see the Ark, upon the report they had heard, that the same was come again] seventy men, (and) fifty thousand men : then the people mourned, because the Lord had smitten a great blow among the people.
\p
\v 20 . Then said the men of Beth-Semes, Who shall be able to stand before the face of the LORD, this holy God? [That is, before the LORD, who revealed himself above the Ark] and to whom shall he go up from us?
\p
\v 21 . Therefore they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-Jearim, saying: The Philistines have brought again the Ark of the Lord, come down, fetch it up to you.

\s The Ark is carried and placed in Kiriath-Jearim verse.1,&c. Samuel exhorteth the peple to repentance , and putting away of Idols, 3. The Israelites obey him, 4. A fast or day of humiliation, 6. The Philistines intend to set upon the Israelites: the Israelites are afraid, 7. Samuel offereth and prayeth unto the Lord for Israel : he, and the people are heard, 9. The lord terrifieth the Philistines with thunder, and they are smitten, 10. Samuel setteth up a stone at Mizpa,for a memorial of the victory 12. The hand of the Lord was against the Philistines, as long as Samuel lived, 13. The Israelites recover those cities, which the Philistines had taken from them, 14. Samuel passeth thorow, and visiteh all the cities of the land, 16, and returneth to Rama, 17.
\p
\v 1 . Then came the men of Kiruath-Jearim [see concerning this city the annotat. on.Judg. 18.12] and fetcht up the Ark of the LORD, and they brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill; [Oth at Gibea] and they hallowed his son Eleazar, [i.e consecrated, or ordained him to an holy ministery] that he might keep the Ark of the LORD.
\p
\v 2 . And it came to passe, from that day, that the Ark (of the Lord) abode at Kiriath-Jearim, and the dayes were multiplied, and they were twenty years : and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD. [Others, sighed unto the Lord, viz. when they were grievously oppressed by the Philistines, see below v.3.]
\p
\v 3 . Then spake Samuel unto all the house of Israel, saying : if ye do turn unto the Lord with all your heart, then put away the strange Gods [heb. The gods of strangers : he meaneth the idols of strange or out land is nations, that lay round, also about them] out of the midst of you, also the Astharots, [see judg.2.13.] and compose your heart unto the lord, and serve him onely, then he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.
\p
\v 4 . Now the children of Israel did put away the Baalims [see Judg chap 2.1.1] and the Astharots, [Baalim is a masculine name, but Asthroth is feminine name: so that here is spoken for the idols or Idolesses, or he- and the-idols of the heathen] and they served the Lord onely.
\p
\v 5 . Moreover Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpa: [ Here the Israelites were wont to keep their land meetings: See Judg.20.v.1. Samuel thought good to gather people here together, that he might unto the Lord for them, and thy likewise might join with him in prayer unto Lord] and I will pray unto the Lord for you.
\p
\v 6 . And they gathered together at Mizpa, and they drew water, and poured it out before the face of the LORD, [Which was a token that they poured out their hearts (being washed and cleansed from sinne) before the Lord, see the like 1Sam.11.15. The meaning is, they cried unto the Lord heartily for deliverance: where-unto likewise their fasting appertained] and they fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD: so Samuel judged the children of Israel at Mizpa. [ i.e. he governed them, and he brought them by his good counsel and exhortation unto repentance. See the Annotat. On Judg.2.15.]
\p
\v 7 . When the Philistines heard, that the children of Israel had gathered themselves together at Mizpa, then the Prince of the Philistines came up [viz, With armies, military forces, as appeareth ver.10.] against Israel: when the children of Israel heard (it), they feared before the face [i.e. by reason of the coming. See the annotat. on Gen.36.6] of the Philistines.
\p
\v 8 . And the children of Israel said unto Samuel, Be not silent in our behalf, [ Or, cease no, be not quite from us, from crying, See Job 13. On verse 13.] that thou shouldest not cry unto the LORD or God, that he may deliver us from the hand of the Philistines.
\p
\v 9 . Then took Samuel a milk-lamb, [i.e. A young lamb, that yet sucked its mothers or dams milk] and he [ viz he himself, or by a Priest] offered it whole unto the LORD for burnt offering: and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel, and the LORD heard him. [ Or answered him]
\p
\v 10 . And it came to pass, when Samuel offered that burnt offering, that the Philistines came on to battle against Israel, and the LORD thundered with a great thunder [ Heb voice] on that day upon the Philistines, and he affrighted them, so that they were smitten before the face of the Israel.
\p
\v 11 . And the men of Israel went out from Mizpa: and pursued the philistines: and they smote them till under Bethraz.
\p
\v 12 . Now Samuel took a stone, and set (it) between Mizpa, and between Sen, [i.e. The Tooth, and by similitude, a Rock, which sticketh out sharp like a Tooth, as 1Sam. 14. 4, 5 ] and he called the name thereof Ebenezer : [ i.e. help-stone, or, stone of help] and he said hitherto hath the Lord holpen us.
\p
\v 13 . So the Philistines were humbled, and came no more [Oth. Not again, Heb. They went on no more to come, viz. With Armies, to take any cities from Israel; but they had and kept still their garrisons and soldiers upon the frontiers, to keep and preserve the fame, as may be seen, 1 Sam 10.5. Or, no more, signifieth here in a long time not again. Or, no more, for so often, as Gen. 32.28. & 2 King.6.23, 24] into the borders of Israel: [i.e. into the land of the Israelites] for the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
\p
\v 14 . And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel, were restored to Israel, from Ekron unto Gath, also Israel delivered the border thereof out of the hand of the Philistines: and there was peace between Israel and Amorites. [ Understand under the name Amorites, also other nations of the land of Canaan, or of the Philistines. The meaning is, they made no public War one against another.]
\p
\v 15 . Now Samuel judged Israel [ See above verse 6.] all the days of his life. [viz. From that day ha was made Judge, until the day of his death, for although Saul reigned as King, yet Samuel continued likewise in the government, and they ruled both together 40 years, as appears Act 13.21.]
\p
\v 16 . And he went from year to year, and went about to bethel, [ This may be understood of the City Bethel, or of the house of God ( for that signifies Bethel,) and so should here be understood Kiriath-Jearim, where at that time the Ark of the Covenant was] and Gilgal, and Mizpa: and he judged Israel in all those places.
\p
\v 17 . But he returned to Rama, [This city is called, 1Sam.1.1Ramathaim, See thee annotate. there Heb. and his return was Rama.] there was his house, and he judged Israel [i.e. he had there his ordinary habitation: when he had gone round about, or walked throughout the land, he came thither again] and he built there an Altar unto the LORD.
\c 8
\s Samuel maketh his sons Judges over Israel, verse. 1, their names, 2, They are not sincere in administration of their office, 3 . Wherefore the people require a King. 4, This displeaseth Samuel, who presenteth the case unto the Lord , but he commandeth that he shall hearken to the people, 7. And that he shall present before them the hard and tyrannical government of Kings, 9. Which Samuel doth , 10, 11. But the people continue firm and sted fast in their former request, 19. God commandeth Samuel to consent to the peoples request, 22.
\p
\v 1 . Now it came to pass, when Samuel was grown old, that he made his sons Judges over Israel. [ Understand this so, that notwithstanding he himself yet continued to be the Supreme Judge, or Lord chief Justice, as the sequel doth demonstrate.]
\p
\v 2 . Now the name of his first-born son was Joel [Oth. Vaschin, 1Chron 6.28. whose son was a chief singer , or singing master, Herman by name, 1 Chron 6.33] and the anme of his second was Abia, they were Judges at Berseba [i.e. having their habitation at Berseba, and there exercising the office of a judge.]
\p
\v 3 . But his sons walked not in his ways, but they inclined themselves unto [Heb]. after, or toward] covetousness, and took bribes, and wrestled [ otherwise, perverted] judgement.
\p
\v 4 . Then all the Eldest of Israel gathered themselves, and they came unto Samuel at Rama;
\p
\v 5 . And they said unto him, Behold, thou art grown old, [ And therefore cannot travel thorough the lands and cities as thou hast done hitherto] and thy sons walk not in thy ways: therefore now constitute a King over us, to judge us, [i.e. almost all, for there were also some among the heathen nations that had no Kings , but Princes, or Rulers]
\p
\v 6 . But this word was evil in the eyes of Samuel, [For it pertained onely to God, to constitute or appoint such a form of government over his people, as pleased him: But it became not the people to do this out of pride, ambition, or diffidence, or other respects, without asking counsel of the Lord: see ver.7.] when they said, Give us a King, to judge us: and Samuel prayed unto the LORD.[ to know how he should behave himself in this matter, and whether he should consent unto the peoples request, or not]
\p
\v 7 . But the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of this people in all that they shall say unto thee: [ This is the Lord said in anger, as Hoseaswitnesseth, chap.13.11.] for they have not rejected thee, [i.e. not thee onely: for they also rejected Samuel, as may appear also verse 8. See the like phrase, Gen32.28.] but they have rejected me, [partly because they would acknowledge me no longer to be their onely King, but would have another to be under, or with me: see below, chap12.12& 19. Partly, because they did not leave it to my divine providence what form of government was best suitable for them] that I shall not be King over them, [Heb. From reigning over them.]
\p
\v 8 . According to all the works, which they have done: from that day when I led them out of Egypt unto this day, and have forsaken me, and served other gods: so do they also thee.
\p
\v 9 . Now therefore hearken unto their voice: yet when thou shalt in the highest (degree) have protested unto them, [Heb, Protesting, shall have protested] then shalt thou shew them the way of the King [Or, manner, as above chap.2.13. also below chap.27.11, I King 17.33, 34,40&c. That is, how the King that shall reign over them, shall entreat them: how Kings commonly use to deal with their subjects. The word Mischphat doth not here signify right: for if Kings might do all this that here followeth, then Achab sinned not, when he took away Naboths land by violence. Note this also on verse. 11. God giveth unto Kings another right then here is mentioned, Deut.13. 15 Samuel did afterward relate and describe the true rights of the Kings 1 Sam 10.26.] that shall reign over them.
\p
\v 10 . Now Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people, that asked a King of him.
\p
\v 11 . And said, this shall be the way of the King, that shall reign over you: he shall take [viz. violently] your sons, that he may appoint them for himself for his charets, and for his horsemen, that they run along before his charet.
\p
\v 12 . And that he may appoint them Chieftains of thousands, and Chieftains of fifties: and that they may plow his field, [ Heb. properly his plowing] and that they may harvest his harvest, and that they may make his warlike weapons, and also the instruments of his charets.
\p
\v 13 . And he will take your daughters for Apothecaries, and for Kitchen-maids, [Heb. she-slayers] and for she-bakers.
\p
\v 14 . And he will take your fields, and your vineyards and your olive - yards, which are the best, and give them unto his servants [ Meaning Counsellors, Officers, & c, not such servants as did servile works, as verse 16,17]
\p
\v 15 . And he will take tenth of your seed, [Heb of your seeds: that is, all your feed] and of your vineyards, and he will give them unto his Courtiours, [ See the signification of this word in the annotat. on Gen 27.v.36.] and unto his servants.
\p
\v 16 . And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your best young-men, and your asses, and he will do his work with them.
\p
\v 17 . He will take tenth of your flock, and ye shall be his servants.
\p
\v 18 . Ye shall indeed cry (out) in that day, because of your King, whom you shall have chosen you: but the LORD will not hear you in that day.
\p
\v 19 . But the people refused to hear the voice of Samuel: and they said, Nay, but there shall be a King over us [ As if they would say, your exhortation or admonition, shall not make us change our mind and purpose.]
\p
\v 20 . And we also shall be like all the Nations: and our King shall judge us, and he shall go out before our faces, and he shall mange our wars.
\p
\v 21 . When Samuel had heard all the words of the people, then he uttered the same before the ears of the LORD.
\p
\v 22 . Now the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and appoint them a King: then said Samuel unto the men of Israel, Go your ways, every one unto his city. [As if he had said, Depart hence for this time, I will take it into further consideration, and enquire of God, whom he will appoint to be your King.]
\c 9
\s The Genealogie of Kis is related, verse 1. Sauls person is described, 2. Kis sendeth Saul to seek the asses, 3. He travelleth thorough the country, but findeth not the she-asses, 4. By the advice of his servant he goeth unto Samuel to meet Saul, 14. God revealeth unto Samuel that Saul would come to him, 15. And commandeth him to make him King, 16. Samuel inviteth Saul to a feast,19. He telleth him that the she-asses were found, and that he should King, 20. Which seemeth most strange unto Saul, 21. Samuel placeth him in the highest room at the feast, 22. Andgraceth him with a special dish of meat, 23. Samuel talketh with Saul alone upon the roof, 25. And he revealeth to him that he should be King,26.
\p
\v 1 . Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kis, a son of Abiel, [Oth. Ner, 2 Chron.8.33. and 9.39.] the son of Zecor, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a man of Jemini, [Oth, a man that was a Benjamite] a mighty man of power.
\p
\v 2 . The same had a son whose name was Saul, a young man, and beautiful [Heb. Good, also, Gen.6.2.] Then there was not a more beautiful man then he among the children of Israel: from his shoulders and upward, he was taller than all the people.
\p
\v 3 . Now the she-asses of Kis Sauls father were lost: [ This came not to pass by chance, but by the providence of GOD, so to bring Saul unto Samuel, and to cause him to be anointed King] therefore said Kis unto his son Saul, Take now the lads with thee, and get thee up, go thy ways, seek the she-ashes.
\p
\v 4 . He then went through the mountain of Ephraim, and he went through the land of Salisa, [This is a plain country, as may be seen 2 King. 4.42.] but they found them not: therefore they passed thorough the land of Sahalim, [In this land, lying in tribe of Benjamin. Lay the city of Salan, whereof mention is made, Job .3.23. not far from Gilgal by Jordan] But they were not there: moreover he passed thorough the land of Jemini, [Or thorough the land of the Benjamites,] but they found them not.
\p
\v 5 . Then they came into the land of Zuph, [See above chap.1.1.] Sauk said unto his lad that was with him, Come and let us return: left perhaps my father cease (thinking) of the she-asses, and he careful for us.
\p
\v 6 . He on the contrary said unto him, Behold now, there is a man of God [i.e. Prophet, viz Samuel: see the annotat. Judg.13 on verse 6] in this city, and he is an honourable man, all that he speaketh what cometh surely ( to pass): [Heb. it cometh coming] Now let us go thither, per adventure he will show us our way that we should go. [i.e. which way we must go, for to find our she-asses, for which cause we have undertaken this journey.]
\p
\v 7 . The said Saul unto his lad, But behold, if we go, what shall we bring unto that man: [As if he had said, We know not this man of God, neither doth he know us: we shall be troublesome to him: and it is both suitable honesty and decency, that we should grace him with some present or other: see the like example, 1 King. 14.3. and 2 King 4.42.] for the bread [i.e. our store, or provision] is gone [i.e. all our provision is spent: so that we have nothing to present the man of God with] out of our vessels, [i.e. out of our knapsacks or budgets] and we have no man of gift [ see the annotations of Judge.13.17. and 1 king 14.3] to bring unto man of God, what have we?
\p
\v 8 . And the lad answered Saul further, and said, Behold, there is found in mine hand. [i.e. I have mine hand: see 1 Pet 2.22. It’s said, There was no guile found in his mouth: i.e. there was no guile in his mouth see Isa53. 9.] the fourth part of s shekel of silver. [ Of the value of the shekel, see the annotate. On Gen 20.16. The fourth part of a shekel of silver was not much more than three styvers, that is about three pence half penny of our English money: So that in this present, more was looked on the thankful mind, then on the worth or value of the gift] that will I give to the man of God that he may show us our way.
\p
\v 9 . (Before time everyone spake thus Israel, [The words of this verse are the words of the writer or Penman of this book, and hence some other man, wrote this book] when he went to enquire of God, [to wit, by a prophet] Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that this day, (is called) a Prophet, was before time called a seer.)[So were the prophets called , because God revealed that unto them in visions, which they made known unto people, see Numb. 12.6 and 24.4]
\p
\v 10 . Then said Saul unto his lad, thy word is good, [i.e Thou hast spoken well, or right] come let us go : and they went unto the City, [Viz. Unto Rama] where the man of God was.
\p
\v 11 . As they went up by the ascent of the city, they found maidens that went forth to draw water; and they said unto them, is the seer here? [Otherwise, is here a seer?]
\p
\v 12 Then answered they them, and said, behold, he is before your face : [ This doth not intimate, that Saul and his servant did at that very instant, see Samuel, or with the lifting up of their eyes could see him : They saw him not, till they came to him in the City. So that the words, before your face, signifie, hard by, or neer at hand] make haste now, for he came to day into the city, for as much as the people have to day into the city, for as much as the people have to day a sacrifice [Heb. a slaughtering. Oth. a feast, or, banquet, as Genesis 31.54 and I Sam.28.24, I Kings 19.21.] on the high place.
\p
\v 13 . When ye come into the city, so shall ye find him, before he go up to the high place to eat, for the people will not eat till he come, for he bleeseth [Viz. By prayer : and with thanksgiving, Deut.8.10.] the offering, [i.e the flesh that is offered, wherewith the feast or banquet is to be made] afterwards they eat that be hidden : therefore now go up, for him, as to day ye shall find him.
\p
\v 14 So they went up into the city : when they came into the midst of the City, behold, Samuel went out to meet them, [For he knew full well, that they should come to him at that time, as appeareth from verse 15. and 16] for to go up to the high place.
\p
\v 15 For the LORD had revealed it (before) Samuels ear, [i.e. the Lord plainly told Samuel. See the like phrase, Ruth.4.47 and I Sam.250.12,13. and 2 Sam.7.27. Job.33.16. Isai.22.14. and chap 48.8] a day before Saul came, saying, [here the cause is shewed, wherefore Samuel went forth to meet Saul, for whole sake he had caused that sumptuous feast to be made.]
\p
\v 16 Tomorrow about this time I will send unto thee [Viz. by a secret motion or instinct, for Saul thought not of this, but he was gone forth to seek the She-asses] a man out of the land of Benjamin, him shalt thou anoint to be a leader over my people of Israel, and he shall deliver my people out of the hand of the Philistines., for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.
\p
\v 17 . When Samuel beheld Saul, then the LORD answered, [viz. By a secret discourse, as below chap. 16. Verse 8,12.] Behold, this is the man of who I said unto thee, this (same) shall reign [Heb. keep back. ‘Tis as much as to say , as he shall by his authority, command, and punishment keep back, bridle, retrain wicked men from sinning, or from doing what they would] over my people.
\p
\v 18 . And Saul drew neer to Samuel in the midst of the gate [i. E. In the midst of city. See above verse. 14.] and said, shew me, I pray thee, where is here the Seers house?
\p
\v 19 . And Samuel answered Saul , and said, I am the seer, go up before my face unto the high place, that ye may eat with me today: and tomorrow betimes I will let thee go, and I will tell thee all that is in thine heart, [i.e. all that thou art troubled about, and all that thou wilt ask me.]
\p
\v 20 . For as touching the she-asses, today (being) the third day thou didst lose them, set not thy heart thereon, [i.e. take it not to heart] for they are found; and whose shall be all desirable that is in Israel? [i.e. the best and choicest that is in Israel. See above chap 8 verse 1. Others, unto whom is all the desire for their King rather than thee? Others take it in this sense, as if he had said, upon whom shall the choice of a King, which all Israel desireth, light, but upon thee?] is it not thine, and of all thy fathers house?
\p
\v 21 . Then answered Saul and said, Am I not a son of Jemini, [i.e. of a Benjamite] of the least of the tribes of Israel/ [ This tribe, to wit, the tribe of Benjamin, was almost quite destroyed, by reason of the Levites wise; so that but six hundred men were left, Judg. 20.47] and my family (is it not) the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speaketh thou to me with such words? [Heb. speakest thou to me according to this word.]
\p
\v 22 . Then Samuel took Saul, and his servant and he brought them into the chamber: and he gave them place in the uppermost (feat) of them that were hidden: [i. e. He placed them in the chiefest or uppermost feat of all. Hereby did Samuel, in some measure, intimate unto the guests that were there present, the dignity and excellency of the office, whereunto God had ordained Saul: As he likewise did so, by setting the cosiest and daintiest dish of meat before Saul. See the like, Gen.43.34. Yea for Sauls sake he also honoured his servant, and let him likewise at the upper end of the table] who were now about thirty man.
\p
\v 23 . Then said Samuel unto the cook, bring that piece, which I gave thee; whereof I said unto thee, set it away by thee. [From hence it approached sufficiently, that Samuel had caused this feast or banquet to be made chiefly for Sauls sake, whom he knew was coming up that way.]
\p
\v 24 . Now the cook brought up a shoulder, [The Hebrew word signifieth as well as a fore-joynt of meat, as an hinder joint] with that that was on it, and set them before Saul, and be [viz. Samuel] said; Behold, this is that which is left, set it before thee, eat, for it was kept in due time for thee, [As if he had said, when I caused this feast to be made for thy honourable entertainment, I gave charge that this choicest dish, or portion of meat should be reserved for thee] when I said [viz. unto the Cook, or, Steward, or, to the servants, ministers, folks that waited] I have invited the people: so Saul did eat with Samuel that day.
\p
\v 25 . Afterward they went down from the high place into the City: and he spake with Saul [i.e. he told him of the command of God, that he should be King] upon the roof [viz. upon his, to wit Samuels-roof. Heretofore among the Jews the roofs or house-tops were built flat, so that a man could go and walk upon them. See deut.22.8.]
\p
\v 26 . And they rose up early: and it came to passé about the rising of the morning, that Samuel called Saul up into the roof, [viz. there to commune with him alone about his calling to the Kingdom] saying, a rise, that I may let thee go: then Saul arose, and they both went out, he and Samuel abroad.
\p
\v 27 . When they were gone down to the end of the City, Samuel said unto Saul, say to the servant, that he passé on before our faces: [viz. that he may not hear what we speak] then he passed on: but stand thou now still, [Heb. as this day: i.e. at this time] and I will cause thee to hear the word of God, [Samuel indeed told Saul (when they were both together alone upon the house-top) of the will of the Lord concerning his election to the Kingly office; but afterward, at the parting, he did more fully inform him concerning the same, fore-calling him with all the signs, and tokens that he should meet with for his confirmation and assurance therein, whereof further mention is made in chapter 10.]
\c 10
\s Samuel anointeth Saul king over Israel, verse 1, &c. And he fore-telleth him, what should betide him in the way, 2. Saul prophesieth among the Prophets, 10. He cometh to his Uncle, 14. Whom he telleth what Samuel had said concerning the she-asses, but concealeth the matter to the Kingdom, 16. Samuel assembleth the people at Mizpa, 17. There he sets their ingratitude before their eyes, 18. Saul by lot is chosen King over Israel, but he hideth himself, 21. His stature, 23. Saul is presented before all the people, who receive him with shouting, 24. Samuel writeth right of a king in a book, 25. All this being accomplished, Saul goeth to his own house at Gibea, 26. Some vilisie and despise Saul, which he mindeth not, 27.
\p
\v 1 . Then Samuel took a vial [Or, bottle, vessel] of oil [Below chap.16.13. where is spoken of Davids anointing, there is mentioned a horn of oil. Saul, and Jehu, (2 Kings 9.1,3.) were anointed out of a vail of oil, but David out of an horn] and poured it out upon his head, [in the Old Testament three sorts of persons were instilled into their offices by anointing, high Priests, Kings, and Prophets] and kissed him: [in token of subjection, thereby acknowledging him to be his Lord, for asmuch as God had called him to the Kingly office. See the like example, I Kings 19.18. and compare Psal.2.12.] and said, Is it not (so) that the LORD hath anointed thee to be a Leader over his own inheritance? [i.e. over his people of Israel, whom the Lord hath chosen out of all nations for his own inheritance.]
\p
\v 2 . When thou departest from me to day, then thou shalt finde two men by Rachels sepulchre, [This sepulchre was near unto Bethlehem Juda, as appeareth, Gen.35 19,20. Benjamin] on the border of Benjamin at Zelzah: [This is the name of a place, no where else found but here, and signifieth as much as a fair shadow] they will say unto thee, The she-asses are found, which thou wentest to seek, and nehold, thy father hath left the matters of the she-asses, and he is solicitous for you saying, What shall I do for my son?
\p
\v 3 . When thou goest on forward from thence, and shalt come unto Elon-Thabor, [Oth. the plan field of Thabor, or, at the Oak of Thabor; there be divers places called Thabor] there three men shall finde thee, going up to God to Bethel; [Some translate it, unto the house of God, to wit, at Kiriath-Jeriam, as above chap.7.1,2,16. where the Ark was at that time] one carrying three Kids and one carrying three loaves of bread, and one carrying a bottle of wine.
\p
\v 4 . And they will ask thee of (thy) welfare; [See Gen.43.27.] and they shall give thee two (loaves) of bread, them thou shalt receive of their hand.
\p
\v 5 . After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, [This was an high place near the City of Gibea, where there was a school of young Prophets. In the City itself, the Philistines had their garrison, as immediately followeth. Oth. to Gibea of God] where are the forces of the Philistines: [i.e. Garrison,keeping watch, as below chap.13.3.] and it shall come to passé, when thou comest there into the City, that thou shalt meet an heap, [Heb. a cord, or, string; that is, a company of men, that march in rank and order, and as it were draw one line, or, cord: and so vers.10.] of Prophets coming down from the high place, and before their faces Lutes, and Tabrets, and Pipes, and Harps, [With these Musical instruments they revived themselves, and aroused up their Spirit to Prophesie. See the like example, 2 Kings 3.15.] In the Hebrew these words are put in the singular number] and they shall Prophesie. [i.e. Speak and sing of heavenly, Divine, holy edifying things.]
\p
\v 6 . And the Spirit of the LORD shall be ready upon thee, and thou shalt Prophesie with them, [i.e. thou shalt for some space of time have the gift of Prophesie. See num 11.25.] and thou shalt be changed into another man, [i.e. thou shall get a bold, courageous, wise, and understanding heart, fit for government and for managing war-like affairs, as it becometh a King to have.
\p
\v 7 . And it shall come to passé, when these signs shall come unto thee, do thou what time hand shall finde, [i.e. what-ever the necessity and occasion require to be done for the good of the Land, do it as a wise and courageous King. This did Saul do, when he went forth to fight against the ammonites; chap.11. and against the Philistines chap.13. Concerning the phrase, see Judg.9. on vers.33.] for God will be with thee.
\p
\v 8 . Now thou shalt go down before my face to Gilgal, [Yet understand first to Mizpa, as appeareth vers.17. and chap.11.14. Saul was by lot chosen King at Mizpa, but installed at Gilgal] and behold, I will come down to thee, to offer burnt-offerings, to offer sacrifice of thanksgiving: [See below chap.13.8.] seven dayes shall thou tarry (there) till I come unto thee, and tell thee what thou shalt do.
\p
\v 9 . Now it came to passé, when he turned his shoulder; [i.e. back] to go from Samuel; (that) God changed his heart (into) another: and all those tokens came (to passé) the same day.
\p
\v 10 . When they [viz. Saul and his servant] came thither to the hill, there (came) an heap of Prophets [Understand here by by the word Prop ets, the Disciples,or, Scholars of the Prophets, that exercised themselves in, and studied the Hebr: Scripture] to meet him: and the Spirit of the LORD waxed ready upon him; and he Prophesied in the midst of them.
\p
\v 11 . And it came to passé, when every one that had known him before of old time, [Heb. from yesterday, ere yesterday] saw, that he, behold, prophesied with the Prophets, that the people said, every one to his fellow, [i.e. the one to the other] what is this, that hath hapned to the Son of Kis? Is Saul also among the Prophets?
\p
\v 12 . Then answered a man of that place, [Perhaps one out of the number of those Prophets] and said, but who is their father? [As if he hd said, even the same God and Father, who hathh given to the rest the Spirit of Prophesie, he is also able to give the same unto Saul. Some do here take the word Father, for Teacher: as the Disciples, or, Scholars of the Prophets, are called sons of the Prophets. Some take it thus: who is their Father? i.e. the others have as mean fathers as Saul, bu this is a special work of God] therefore it’s become a Proverb, Is Saul also among the Prophets? [This Proverb is commonly used, when we speak of any one, that doeth act some great or special matter unawares, and unexpectedly.]
\p
\v 13 . Now which he had made an end of Prophecying, he came unto the high place, [viz. into the School or Synagogue, which was upon the Hill of God, vers.6.]
\p
\v 14 . And Sauls Uncle said unto him, and unto his servant, Whither went ye? now he said, To seek the she-asses: when we saw that they were not there, then we came to Samuel.
\p
\v 15 . Then said Sauls Uncle; Tell me I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you?
\p
\v 16 . Now Saul said unto his Uncle, he told us certainly; [Heb. telling told] that the she-asses were found: but the matter of the Kingdom, whereof Samuel had said, he told him not. [It seemeth that Samuel had forbidden him to do it: And that it might be kept the more close, Samuel had spoken to Saul. To bid his servant remove, or, go out of the way; when they two communed together, chap.9.27.]
\p
\v 17 . But Samuel called the people together unto the LORD at Mizpa. [viz. To appear, as before the LORD, in the assembly of Gods people, to the chusing and installing of a King: Or, according to the opinion of some, before the Ark of the Covenant, from whence the Lord gave answer. For this cause might the Ark be brought thither, but hereafter at Gilgal, as may be gathered below, chap.11.15.]
\p
\v 18 . And he said unto the Children of Israel, Thus hath the LORD the God of Israel spoken, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all Kingdoms, but oppressed you.
\p
\v 19 . But ye have this day rejected your God, who hath delivered you out of all your miseries, [Heb. evils] and your necessities, and have said unto him, [i.e. unto me, who am his Prophet; See above chap.8.19. and below chap.12.12.] Set a King over us: now then present your selves before the face of the LORD, according to your tribes, and according to your thousands. [The tribes of the Israelites were divided into certain companies, each company consisting of a thousand men, as mich.5.2. and else where appeareth.]
\p
\v 20 . Now when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come neer, [viz. to cast the lot. See the like example, Jos.7.14. Before they cast the lot, they prayed unto the Lord, vers.22. Act.1.24.] the tribe of Benjamin was touched. [viz. with the lot. Heb. hit, caught, taken: i.e. the lot fell upon the tribe of Benjamin, whereby the Lord would signifie, that it was one among the families of the tribes, whom he would appoint to be King.]
\p
\v 21 . When he made the tribe of Benjamin to come on according to their families, the family of Matri was troubled: and Saul the son of Kis was touched, and they sought him, but he was not found.
\p
\v 22 . Then they further enquired of the LORD, whether that man would ye come thither? then the LORD said, Behold, he hath hid himself among the vessels. [i.e. among the stuff, or, baggage of the people.]
\p
\v 23 . Now they ran, and took him from thence, and he set himself in the midst of the people: and he was taller then all the people, from his shoulder and upward.
\p
\v 24 . Then said Samuel unto all the people: Do ye see, whom the LORD hath chosen? for there is none like him among all the people: then all the people [i.e. the greatest part of the people: for there were some that despised him, as appeareth vers.27.] shouted, and said, Let the King live. [See I Kings 1. On v.25.]
\p
\v 25 . Now Samuel told the people the right of the Kingdom, [Understand this, not of the way, manner,or custome of acting, which Kings sometimes take up contrary to Law, (as the Hebrew word is taken above chap.8. verse.9,11.) but of the Laws which Samuel by Gods instinct mae or enacted, concerning the Government of Kings; see Deut.17.18. or of the Ordinances, for to instruct as well the King as the subjects, how thy ought to carry, and demean themselves toward each other] and wrote it in a book, [this Book is not extant] and laid it before the face of the LORD: [i.e. before the LORD who manifested his presence above the Ark.] Then Samuel let all the people go, every man to his house.
\p
\v 26 . And Saul went also to his (own) house at Gibea, and of the army went with him, whose heart God had touched.
\p
\v 27 . But the Children of Belial [See Deut.13.13.] said, What should this (man) deliver us? and they despised him, and brought him no present; [As subjects were wont to do to their Prince, in token of homage and fealty, and that they acknowledge him to be their King; see 2 Chron.17.5. and Matth.2.11.] but he was as deaf. [Or, as dumb, as silent.]
\c 11
\s Nahas besiegeth Jabes in Gilead, v.1,&c. He will not make peace with the besieged, but upon hard and grievous to consult thereof, 3. Which having obtained, they crave the assistance of their brethren, 4. Saul hearing of the unreasonable tearms, is extreamly provoked, 5. He adviseth with himself how to raise the siege, 6. With an army of three hundred and thirty thousand men, 8. He sendeth word to the men of Jabes, that he intended to raise their siege, 9. Who deceive their besiegers, 10. How Saul raised the siege at Jabes, 11. The people are ready to slay those, that refused to embrace Saul for their King, 12. But Saul will not suffer it, 13. He is invested in the Kingdom at Gilgal, 14.
\p
\v 1 . Then Nahas the Ammonite went up, and besieged Jabes in Gilead: [See Judg.21.8.] and all the men of Jabes said unto Nahas, make a covenant with us, so we will serve thee,
\p
\v 2 . But Nahas the Ammonite said unto them, on this (condition) [Heb. therein] will I make (a covenant) with you, that I may put out unto all (of) you the right eye: and that I may lay this shame [Oth. reproach] upon all Israel.
\p
\v 3 . Then said the Eldest of Jabes, [i.e. the Governours of the City of Jabes] unto him, cease from us seven dayes, [Or, let us be quiet seven dayes] that we may send messengers into all the borders of Israel: if then there be no man that delivereth us, we will go out unto thee. [viz. to deliver up our selves into thy hands.]
\p
\v 4 . When the messengers came to Gibea of Saul, [This City was first called Gibea of Benjamin, because it lay in the inheritance of the tribe of Benjamin. It was then first called Gibea of Saul, after that Saul (who was born there) was made King of Israel] they spake these words before the ears of the people: then all that people lift up their voice and wept.
\p
\v 5 . And behold, Saul came after the Oxen out of thd field, [For when he was in private anointed King over Israel, and Samuel, and accepted of the greatest part of the people, he did not as yet begin to execute that office in publick, but lived a retired life, untill, he was publickly installed by all the people] and Saul said, What aileth the people, that they weep? then they told him the words of the men of Jabes.
\p
\v 6 . Then the Spirit of the LORD waxed already upon Saul, [i.e. God immediately by the power of his Spirit gave unto Saul the gifts of strength and courage to oppose the Ammonites] when he heard these words: and his anger kindled exceedingly. [viz. against Nahas, because he had propounded such reproachful tearms of peace to the inhabitants of Jabes.]
\p
\v 7 . And he took a couple of Oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and he sent them [viz. the pieces of the Oxen, that the Israelites seeing them, might remember what damage would befall them, if they refused to follow Saul in this expedition] into all the borders of Israel by the hand of the messengers, [Either of the messengers of Jabesites, or of others, whom he had chosen for the purpose,] saying, he that goeth not out in person after Saul, and after Samuel, [Samuel is here adjoined, because he as Judge and Prophet went along with Saul, to raise this siege, as appeareth vers .12. Especially because Saul was not as yet publickly invested into the Kingdom] so shall it be done unto his Oxen: then the fear of the LORD [i.e. a fear, which the Lord sent upon them] fell on the people, and they went out as one man.
\p
\v 8 . And he numbered them, [Or, mustered them] at Bezek: [i.e. in the border near or about the City of Bezek, whereof mention is made, Judg.1.5.] and of the. Children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and of the men of Juda thirty thousand.
\p
\v 9 . Then they [viz. Samuel and Saul] said unto the messengers, that were come, Thus shall ye say unto the men at Jabes in Gilead, Tomorrow shall deliverance happen to you, when the Sun shall wax hot: When the messengers came, and told (that) unto the men at Jabes, they were glad.
\p
\v 10 . And the men of Jabes said, [Viz. unto the Ammonites; that besieged them] tomorrow we will go out unto you; and ye shall do to us according to all that is good in your eyes. [meaning, if no relief come, see ver.3. They conceal the relief that was promised them, that they might not be upon his guard, but might be surprised and set up on unawares.]
\p
\v 11 . Now it came to pass the next day, [It seemeth that this was the next day after that the messengers of Jabes were returned to the city, and it was the eighth day after the promise of surrendering the city, in case they were not relieved within seven dayes] that Saul put the people in three heaps, [Heb. heads: so also Judg.16.20.] and they came into the midst of the camp, [viz. of the Ammonites] in the morning watch [viz. when they were wont to break up the Courts of Guard, and to dissolve the Centinels] and they slew Ammon, untill the day grew hot: and it came to pass that they which remained were so scattered, that among them there continued not two together.
\p
\v 12 . Then the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Should Saul reign over us? Give hither those men, that we may put them to death.
\p
\v 13 . But Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: [See the like example, 2 sam.19.22.] for the LORD hath to day wrought a deliverance in Israel.
\p
\v 14 . Moreover, Samuel said unto the people, [viz. In the camp by Jabes, after they had smitten the Ammonites, and so relieved Jabes] Come, and let us return to Gilgal, and renew the Kingdom there. [i.e. settle, or invest Saul there in the Kingdome. There were certain men that would now accept of Saul for their King, chap.10.27. Samuel doubted not whether the malevolent or ill-willers would not accept of him, seeing they had seen his courage and fortitude in the battel, and that others would have put them to death, but that Saul hindered it.]
\p
\v 15 . Then all the people went to Gilgal, and made Saul there King before the face of the LORD at Gilgal, [See above chap.10.17. and below. chap.14.18.] and they offered there thank-offerings before the face of the LORD: and Saul rejoyced there exceedingly with all the men of Israel.
\c 12
\s After that Samuel had appointed a King unto the people, v.1, &c. he rehearseth how he himself had reigned, 2.and requireth witness thereof, 3. Which the people do give him, 4. Samuel seeteth before the eyes of the people the sinne they had committed in rejecting the Lord, and asking a King, 7. But he comforteth them again if they should obey the Lord, 14. And threatneth them, if they obey him not, 15. By an unexpected token he so terrifieth them, 16. That they acknowledging and confessing their offence, desire to be reconciled to the Lord, 19. Samuel comforteth the people, 20. Promising likewise to pray for them, 23. Exhorting them again to fear and serve the Lord, 24.
\p
\v 1 . Then Samuel said unto all Israel, [viz. At Gilgal, where he had installed the King] Behold, I have hearkened to your voice, in all that ye said unto me, and I have set a King over you.
\p
\v 2 . And now, behold, there the King goeth along before your face [i.e. He is invested in his office to go before you into the battel, and go govern you] and I am grown old and gray, and behold, my sons are with you; [i.e. They dwell and converse among you, no more as Governours, but as citizens and private persons, out of all office and place of the Government, make use of their further service it pleaseth you] and I have walked before your faces from my youth unto this day.
\p
\v 3 . Behold, (here) I am witness against me before the LORD, and before this Anointed, [viz. King Saul, whom I by the command of the Lord have anointed to be King over you; so also below ver.5. and below chap.24.7.] whose oxe I have taken, and whose asse I have taken, and whom I have wronged, whom I have oppressed, [viz. by false and slanderous speeches, or by ill managing of affairs] and of whose hand I have taken a bribe [Heb. An expiation; that is, a gift, whereby the offender reconcileth himself to the angry Judge, and purchaseth his favour] that I should not have seen his offence, to punish the same according to its demerit: Or, in this sense, that I must needs have blushed, and durst not look him in the face, when he should have witnessed me in the teeth, that I took bribes of him. Oth. Yea, I have bid mine eyes before, or, against it, or, therefore should have hidden.] and I will restore it unto you.
\p
\v 4 . Then they said: Thou hast not wronged us, neither hast thou oppressed us, nor hast thou taken anything of any mans hand.
\p
\v 5 . Then he said unto them, The LORD be a witnesse against you, and his Anointed be witnesse this day, that ye have not found (ought) in mine hand, [viz. That I have taken to wrest or pervert the law, or judgment: or, which might be reputed to me for shame and disgrace] and the people said, he be witness.
\p
\v 6 . Furthermore, Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that made Moseh and Aaron, [i.e. That made them great and honourable; viz. the one to be a Leader and Governour of his people, and the other to be an High-Priest] and that brought up your Fathers out of the Land of Egypt.
\p
\v 7 . And now set you selves (here), that I may reason with you before the face of the LORD, about all the righteousnesses [Understand by this word as well promises and mercies, as threatnings and judgments. Hereby intimating unto the people, that the Lord had in all his works manifested and declared himself to be a righteous God, as well in bestowing his mercies, as in inflicting Judgments upon them, when they departed from him. Compare Judg.5.11. Mich.6.5. with the annotate.] of the LORD, which he did to you, and to your Fathers.
\p
\v 8 . After that Jacob was come into Egypt: your Fathers cried unto the LORD, [Samuel conjoyneth here together, that which hapned or followed many years after. For the Israelites did not cry nor complain unto the Lord, when they at first came with Jacob into Egypt, but a good while after, when there arose a King that imposed hard and grievous bondage upon them: see Exod.1. vers.13,14. & 2.23,24, &c.] and the LORD sent Moseh and Aaron, and they led your Fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place. [viz. on this and the other side of Hordan, in the land of Canaan: Moseh placed them in the Kingdom of Amorites, but Josua in the land of Canaan]
\p
\v 9 . But they forgot the LORD their God; so he sold them into the hand of Sisera, the Captain of the Host at Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the King of the Moabites [Called Eglon, Judg.3.12.] who fought against them.
\p
\v 10 . And they cried unto the LORD, and said; We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and served the Baalims, and the Astharets: and now, rescue us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.
\p
\v 11 . And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, [i.e. Gideon; why he was named Jeribbaal, see Judg.6. verse 32.] and Bedan, [otherwise, called Jair, as some conceive, a Gileadire, Judg.10.3. It may be that Judge Jair was also called Bedan, to difference or distinguish him from another Jair, that lived in the time of Moseh, of whom we read, Numb.32. ver.41. The rather, because I Chron.7.17. mention is made of one Bedan among the children of Machir, the father of Gilead. Others take Bedan for Simson, because he was of the tribe of Dan. Others for Abdon, because the names seem to agree, Judg.12.13.] and Jephtah, and Samuel, and be rescued you out if the hand of your enemies round about, so that ye dwelled safe.
\p
\v 12 . Now when ye saw that Nahaz the King of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay, but a King shall reign over us: when as the LORD your God was your King.
\p
\v 13 . And now, behold there the King whom ye have chosen, [viz. After that the lot was drawn before the Lord above chap.10.10.] whom ye desired: and behold, the LORD hath set a King over you. [to wit, when he granted you your desire, although it was evil, and mixed with great unthankfulness.]
\p
\v 14 . If ye shall fear the LORD, and serve him, and hearken to his voice, and rebell not against the mouth of the LORD: then shall ye, as well ye, as the King that shall reign over you, be after the LORD your God. [As if he should say, the Lord shall go before you, he shall lead and direct you, defend and protect you. Oth. ye shall follow him.]
\p
\v 15 . But if ye shall not hearken to the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the mouth of the LORD: then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as against your Fathers. [Oth. and against your Fathers. i.e. Kings, or fatherly houses.]
\p
\v 16 . Now also set your selves (here), [i.e.Pause a while, have a little patience, that ye may see and hear what the Lord will do] and see the great thing which the LORD will do before your eyes.
\p
\v 17 . Is it not wheat harvest to day? [as if he should say, Is it not now a fair and bright day, as the days are wont to be in Wheat harvest? At which times no rain was wont to fall, Prov.26.1. Ye see now no sign of any approaching tempest, yet ye shall see me obtain both rain and thunder of God by my prayer] I will call unto the LORD, and he shall give thunder and rain: therefore know ye, and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done before the eyes of the LORD, (in) that ye have asked for you a King.
\p
\v 18 . When Samuel called on the LORD, the LORD gave thunder and rain that day: therefore all the people feared the LORD greatly, and Samuel.
\p
\v 19 . And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants [i.e. For us] unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for above all our sins, we have added thereunto this evil, that we have asked for us a King.
\p
\v 20 . Then said Samuel unto the people, Fear not ye have done all this wickedness; yet depart not from after the LORD, [i.e. From following after him; as if he should say, Although ye have committed so much wickedness, yet not withstanding he will be gracious unto you, if ye cease from sinning] but serve the LORD with all your heart.
\p
\v 21 . And back-slide not: [To wit, from the Lord] for then ye should (follow) after vanities, [i.e. Idols, which are called vanities, because the idol is nothing in the world; i.e. they have nothing divine in them, as Paul saith, I Cor.8.4. or because they are not profitable, as Samuel her affirmeth: or because they are nothing else but the work of mens hands, Lev.19.4. Psal.115.4. or because they stir up and incite men to vanities and lies] which are not profitable, neither do deliver, for they are vanities.
\p
\v 22 . For the LORD will not forsake his people, for his great Names sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you a people unto him.
\p
\v 23 . Also what concerneth me, far be it from me, that I should sinne against the LORD, that I should cease to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and right way. [To wit, as becometh a Prophet and Teacher called of God; see I Cor.9.16.]
\p
\v 24 . Only fear the LORD, and serve him faithfully with all your heart: for consider what great things he hath done among you.
\p
\v 25 . But if ye hence forward do evil, [Heb. Doing evil do evil] ye shall perish, as also your King.
\c 13
\s Saul choses three thousand souldiers to be with him, and Jonathan, verse I, &c. Jonathan smitteth the garrison of the Philistins at Gibea, 3. Saul summoneth all the people together, 4. The Philistines come with great strength to fight against Israel, 5. The Israelites for fear, hide themselves in caves, &c. 6. Saul offereth before Samuel cometh to him, 7. For which he is reproved by Samuel, 11. Who fore-telleth him that his Kingdome should not last long, 13. Saul with his people stay at Gibea, 16. The Philistines invade the land of Israel with three companies, 17. Where armes are wanting, 19. Onely Saul and Jonathan have arms, 22.
\p
\v 1 . Saul had been one year in his government [Heb. Saul being the son of one year in his governing] and the second year [Heb. Two years; i.e. the second year: see Judg.14. on ver.17.] he reigned over Israel.
\p
\v 2 . Then Saul chose him three thousand men out of Israel, [These three thousand men waited alwayes upon Saul’s service, where-ever or whereunto he would use them] and there were two thousand men with Saul at Michmas, [understand this, not of a city so called, but of a corner of the land in the border of Benjamin, by the mountain of Bethel: for as it is here said, that Saul was with his people at Michmas; so it is said below verse 5. that the Philistines also camped themselves at Michmas] and on the mountain of Bethel, and there were a thousand with Jonathan at Gibea of Benjamin, [see Judg.19.12.] and he let the rest of the people go, every one to his tent.
\p
\v 3 . But Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines, [viz. By Sauls’s command, as appeareth ver.4.] which was at Geba, [oth. on the hill; see above chap.10.5.] which the Philistines heard: [understand withal, and they prepared themselves to fight against the Israelites] where-fore Saul blew with the trumpet in all the land, saying: Let the Hebrews hear it. [viz. That they may beware they be not surprised by the Philistines, but arm themselves against them, or prepare to give the Philistines battle.]
\p
\v 4 . Then all Israel heard say, Saul hath smitten the garrison of the Philistines, [Not Saul, but Jonathan Saul’s command, or they thought that Saul had done it] and also Israel is become stinking among the Philistines: see Gen.34.30.] then the people were called together, after Saul, to Gilgal.
\p
\v 5 . And the Philistines were gathered together to fight against Israel, thirty thousand charets, [i.e. Thirty thousand men, who being in charets, fought out of them] and six thousand horsemen, and people in multitude, as the sand is on the sea-shore: [Heb.lip] & they marched up, & camped themselves at Michmas, [see above verse 2.] toward the cast of Beth-Aven. [There was a city so called, and also a wilderness, Jos.18.12.]
\p
\v 6 . When the men of Israel saw that they were in need (for the people were distressed), then the people [viz. The souldiers of the Israelites, that were with Saul] hid themselves in caves, and in thorn-bushes, and in rocks, and in strong holds, and in pits.
\p
\v 7 . Now the Hebrews [Understand her the common people, which were not souldiers, or military men] went over the Jordan into the land of God, and Gilead: When Saul himself was yet at Gilgal, then all the people came trembling after him. [Heb. Then all the people trembled after him. This seemeth to be understood of the people that had hid themselves, v.6.]
\p
\v 8 . And he tarried seven dayes, [I Sam.10.8.] till the time that Samuel had appointed: [See above chap.10. vers.8. to what end and purpose this day was appointed] when Samuel came not up to Gilgal, the people were scattered from him. [viz. The souldiers, or warlike people, that had been with him: they ran hither and thither, leaving Saul.]
\p
\v 9 . Then Saul said, [To wit, being vexed and wearied with tarrying any longer, and fearing the danger that was neer hand; see ver.11,12.] bring me hither a burnt-offering, and a thank-offering, and he offered burnt-offering. [viz. By a Priest; and understand withal, that Saul likewise prayed unto the Lord, as appeareth below verse 12. If Saul himself in his own person, had offered (as some conceive) then his sinne was yet so much the greater.]
\p
\v 10 . And it came to pass when he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, behold, then Samuel came, and Saul went out to meet him, to bless him. [i.e. to salute him, and to bid him welcome: see the annotate. on Gen.31.55.]
\p
\v 11 . Then Samuel said, What hast thou done? [This is no question of one that was ignorant, but rather a severe reproof; as Gen.3.13.] now Samuel said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and thou camest not at the appointed time of days, [Samuel came certainly on the seventh day to Saul, although he was not there at the very hour that Saul looked for him] and the Philistines were gathered together at Michmas:
\p
\v 12 . Therefore, said I, [viz. To my self, i.e. I thought] now will the Philistines come down to me at Gilgal, and I have not earnestly besought the face of the LORD: [With the offerings prayers were made unto God] I forced my self therefore, [Or, I offered violence to my self; i.e. I did it unwillingly, and with great regret and reluctancy of mind, yea, as it were, being through need compelled thereto] and offered burnt-offering.
\p
\v 13 . Then Samuel said unto Saul, Thou hast done foolishly, [To wit, in that thou hast not waited out the appointed time] thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee; for now would the LORD have established thy Kingdom, [viz. The Kingdom over which he hath set thee, to reign as King] over Israel for ever. [i.e. a long time, all thy life time, either upon thy self, or upon some of thy posterity, to wit, if thou hadst obeyed me: Yet according to the everlasting decree of God, the Kingdome must of necessity at length come to the tribe of Juda; see Deuteronomy 15.17. in the annotation]
\p
\v 14 . But now thy Kingdom shall not stand, the LORD hath sought him [Samuel could now know this but by the instinct and inspiration of God] a man according to his heart, [viz. David, of whom farther mention is made below ver.16. But at this time Samuel himself knew not this; as appeareth below chap.16.] and the Lord hath commanded him to be a Leader over his people, [from that very time that David was chosen of God to the King, did Saul govern illegally] because thou hast not kept that which the LORD had commanded thee.
\p
\v 15 . Then Samuel gat him up, and he went up from Gilgal, to Gibea of Benjamin: and Saul numbred the people that were found with him, about six hundred men. [Whereas he was wont to have two thousand, v.2. It seemeth that the rest were run away for fear: see above v.6. and 8.]
\p
\v 16 . And Saul and his son Jonathan, and the people that were found with them, abode at Geba of Benjamin: [Oth. Gibea of Benjamin, ver.15. and below, Gibea of Saul] but the Philistines were camped at michmas.
\p
\v 17 . And the destroyers, [Heb. The destroyer; i.e. the souldiers that were sent forth to fire and burn the country, and other ways to endamage it] went out of the camp of the Philistines in three heaps (or companies) one heap turned unto the way toward Ophra, [a city of the Benjamites, whereof also mention is made, Jos.18.23.] toward the land of Saul.
\p
\v 18 . And one heap turned toward the way of Beth-ho-ron: [Lying in the tribe of Ephraim, on the border of Benjamn, Jos.16.3. and 18.13.] and one heap turned toward the way of the border that looketh toward the valley of Zeboim [lying in the tribe of Benjamin, by the Wilderness of Jordan; whereof also mention is made, Neh.11.34.] toward the wilderness.
\p
\v 19 . And there was no Smith found in all the land of Israel; for the Philistines had said, Lest the Hebrews make either sword or spear. [Understand withal, it behoveth us to look to it; as Gen.3.22.]
\p
\v 20 . Therefore all Israel were fain to go down to the Philistines, every man to cause his plough share, or his spade, or his axe, or his mattock to be sharpened.
\p
\v 21 . But they had teethy files [Heb. Files (with) mouths; i.e. which had sharp teeth] for their mattocks, and for their spades, and for the three toothy forks [Or, hooks] and for the axes, and to set the goads. [The Hebrew word signifieth the sharp edge in a plough-staff, whereby they use to prick the beasts that are plowing, to drive them on the faster.]
\p
\v 22 . And it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword, nor spear found in the hand of all the people, that were with Saul, and with Jonathan: [In regard of the heavy and cruel dominion of the Philistines, v.19.] but with Saul and with Jonathan his son they were found.
\p
\v 23 . And the Philistines camp [Oth. Garrison] marched toward the passage of Michmas. [Which when once they had got, they had a free passage into the land of the Benjamites.]
\c 14
\s Jonathan with his Armour-bearer smite twenty men in the Philistines army, verse I, &c. Whereat the whole camp is dismayed, 15. Saul perceiving his, pursueth them, but the Philistines slay one another, 20. The Israelites that were with the Philistines, adjoyned themselves to saul, 21. As also all the Israelites that had hid themselves on the mount, 22. Saul adjureth the people, that no man should eat anything before evening, 24. So that no man durst eat of the flowing honey, 25. Jonathan eateth a little honey, and is thereby revived, 27. The people being hungry, eat the flesh with the blood, 32. which Saul forbiddeth them, 34. He buildeth an altar, 35. He pursueth his enemies, 36. Saul enquireth of the Lord, but obtaineth no answer, 37. Saul causeth the Lot to be cast, to know who had transgressed, 40. The Lot hitteth Jonathan, 43. Saul will put him o death, but he is hindered by the people, 44. Sauls wars, sons, daughters, wife, Generation, father, &c. 47.
\p
\v 1 . Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his Armour, Come, and let us go over unto the Garison of the Philistines, which is on the other side: but he told it not to his Father. [Perhaps because he feared his father would not have consented hereunto.]
\p
\v 2 . Now Saul sat [i.e Hadd pitched his tent] in the uttermost (part) of Gibea under the pome granate-tree; that was at Migron: [Of Migron is likewise spoken, Isa.10.28. It’s a portion of Land lying on the one side of the strait toward Gibea; here Saul with his six hundred men lay in the caves, watching to see what the Philistines would do, below vers.11.] and the people that were with him, they were about six hundred men.
\p
\v 3 . And Ahia the son of Achitub, the brother of Icabod, [See above chap.4.21.] the son of Pinehas, the son of Eli, was the LORDS Priests at Silo, [Or, pertained to the Lords Priests at Silo] wearing [Or, wore] the Ephod: [Understand withal likewise the brest-plate, and the Urim and Thummim, which the high Priset put on, when he asked counsel of the Lord] but the people knew not that Jonathan was gone away, [yea, neither did Saul nor the Priest know it.]
\p
\v 4 . Now between the passages where Jonathan sought to go over unto the garrison of the Philistines, there was a sharpness [Heb. Tooth, and so in the following words] of a rock on this side, and a sharpness of a rock on the other side: [So that the way lay between two rocks] and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other [Heb. Of the one] Sene.
\p
\v 5 . The one tooth lay toward the north, over against Michmas: and the other toward the south, over against Giba.
\p
\v 6 . Now Jonathan said to the young man, that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised, [As is he should say, These Philistines are strangers from the covenant of God, and therefore have full in his eyes: but we are circumcised, and bear the token of Gods covenant in our bodies] it may be [Jonathan speaketh thus, because he had no promise of victory from God] the LORD will work for us: [Or, do (somewhat) for us] for there is no hinderance with the LORD to deliver by many, or by few. [See an example hereof, Judg.7.7. and 2 Chron.14. See also Jos 14.12.]
\p
\v 7 . Then his armour-bearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart, [i.e. all that seemeth good unto thee] turn thee, behold, I am with thee, according to thine heart. [i.e. so as it pleaseth thee, or seemeth good unto thee.]
\p
\v 8 . Now Jonathan said, behold, we will passé over unto these men, and we will discover our selves unto them. [i.e. we will let our selves be seen of them, or, shew our selves to them.]
\p
\v 9 . If they say to us thus, [See the like, Genes.24.14.] Stand still, [Heb. Be silent. See Jos. 10.12,13.] till we come to you, then we will tarry in our place, and not go up unto them.
\p
\v 10 . But (if) they say thus, Come up to us, then we will go up, for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a token to us. [Compare Genes.24.14. with the annotate.]
\p
\v 11 . When they both discovered themselves into the garrison of the Philistines: then the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews are gone forth out of the holes, where they had hid themselves.
\p
\v 12 . Moreover the men of the garrison answered, [i.e. said, or spake; for there goeth no question before] Jonathan, and his armour-beared, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew it you. [As if they had said thus, we will teach you, and make you feel it, what it is for a man to jeopardy himself rashly] And Jonathan said unto his armour-bearer, Come up after me, for the LORD hath delivered them unto the hand of Israel.
\p
\v 13 .Then Jonathan climbed upon his hand, and upon his feet, and his armour bearer after him: and they [viz. His enemies, whom he slew] fell before Jonathans face, and his armour-bearer [viz. Having now gotten a sword, and arms of one of them that were slain: for before onely Saul and Jonathan had swords, as appeareth chap.13.22.] slew them after him,
\p
\v 14 . Now this first slaughter, wherewith Jonathan and his armour-bearer slew about twenty men, was made within about half an acre, being a yoke of Oxen going under the yoke are able to plow in one day. By these words is intimated, that this slaughter was made i a small plat or compasse of ground, so that Jonathan might easily have been surrounded and set upon his enemies, had not God wonderfully assisted him.]
\p
\v 15 . And there was a trembling in the camp, [viz. In the camp of the Philistines] on the field, and among all the people: the garrison and the spoilers [viz. Those Souldiers that were gone forth to spoil and destroy the Land, whereof mention is made chap.13.17.] themselves also trembled; yea the Land was troubled, for it was a trembling of God. [See the annotate. on Gen.30.8. Intimating that it was a terrour, that God sent upon them: or a trembling of God; i.e. a very great trembling.]
\p
\v 16 . Now when the watchmen of Saul at Gibea of Benjamin saw, that; behold the multitude [viz. Of the Philistines] melted away, and went on, and were beaten:
\p
\v 17 . Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see, who is gone away from us: and they numbered, and behold, Jonathan and his armour-bearer were not there.
\p
\v 18 . Then said Saul unto Ahia, [See above vers.3.] Bring hither the ark of God, [viz. To inquire of God by the Ark, whether I shall pursue the Philistines] (for the Ark of God was on that day with the Children of Israel) [viz. In the camp, whereas it was at other times, (as it’s thought) at Silo]
\p
\v 19 . And it came to passé while Saul yet talked unto the Priest, that the noise, that was in the Philistines camp, greatly increased, and multiplied: [Heb. Going went, and multiplied] then Saul said unto the Priest, Put in thine hand. [i.e. Let that alone, which I commanded thee ere-while concerning the Ark. Saul would not tarry so long, till he received answer from God.]
\p
\v 20 . Now Saul, and all the people that were with him, were called together, and they came to battle: and behold, the sword of the one was against the other, [Heb. The sword of the man against his neighbour: i.e. the Philistines slew one another. See the like example, Judg.7.22. and 2 Chron.20.23.] there was a very great noise.
\p
\v 21 . There were also Hebrews with the Philistines, [viz. That ministered to them as servants, or, were run away from their colours to them, who upon this occasion joined themselves to the Israelites] as formerly, [Heb. As yesterday ere-yesterday] which went up with them into the camp round about: now these also joined themselves with the Israelites, [Heb. They (were) to be with Israel] that were with Saul and Jonathan.
\p
\v 22 . When all the men of Israel, that had hid themselves [See above chap.13. vers.6.] in mount Ephraim, heard that the Philistines fled, then they also clave unto them behinde in the battle. [i.e. they likewise helped to pursue and slay the Philistines.]
\p
\v 23 . So the LORD delivered Israel that day: and the camp [Heb. The war, or, battle; i.e. the men of war, or Souldiers; understand it of the men of war, that pursued the Philistines] marched over unto Bethaven. [Lying far from Michmas, as appeareth above chap.13. not5.]
\p
\v 24 . And the men of Israel were tired [Or, distressed, pressed, oppressed, viz. by the famine, as followeth] that day. For Saul had adjured the people, [Saul forbade the people to eat, that he might the speedie pursue and vanquish his enemies, fearing they might escape his hands, if the people should give themselves to eating; but he useth ill means to accomplish his design] saying, cursed [and consequently worthy to lose his life. See vers.39.] be the man, that eateth meat [Heb. Bread, so in the following words here, it appeareth, that bread is taken for all manner of food, for even honey is comprehended under that name; so also below vers.28. and Genes.43.31.] until evening, that I may avenge me on mine enemies: therefore all that people tasted no food.
\p
\v 25 . And all the land [i.e. All the people, of the land; so also above vers.15. and below vers.29. and Genes.41.57.] came into a wood: and there was honey in the field.
\p
\v 26 . When the people came into the wood, behold, there was a honey-flood: but no man touched his mouth with his hand, [viz. After that he had dipt it into the honey, to put thereof into his mouth, and to eat; that is, no man did eat thereof] for the people feared the adjuration.
\p
\v 27 . But Jonathan had not heard it, [For he had not been in the camp after that he had smitten the Philistines] when his father had adjured the people, and he put forth the end of his staff that was in his hand, and he dipt the same in an honey-comb: now when he turned his hand to his mouth, [Understand withal, after that he had eaten of the honey, which might be perceived by his eyes] then his eyes were enlightened. [or, then his eyes saw, viz. clearly; i.e. he got as it were new strength and vigour.]
\p
\v 28 . Then answered [i.e. spake, or, said] one of the people, and said, Thy father hath straitly adjured [Heb. adjuring adjured] the people, saying, cursed be the man, that eateth bread this day: [viz. until evening, as vers.24. for among the Hebrews the day endeth at Sun-setting] therefore the people fainteth. [Or, is wearied, or, weary.]
\p
\v 29 . Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: [i.e. the inhabitants of the Land, or, the Souldiers that are in the camp] see, I pray, how mine eyes are enlightened, because I have tasted a little of this honey.
\p
\v 30 . How much more; [viz. would the people have been strong and lusty to pursue the enemie, if, &c.] if the people to day might have freely eaten [Heb. eating eaten] of the prey [viz. of the cattel, and other provision of food] of their enemies, which they found? but now that defeat of the Philistines was not great.
\p
\v 31 . Yet they smote the Philistines that day from Michmas to Ajalon. [there was an Ajolan in the tribe of Dan, Jos.19.42. given to the Priests, Jos 21.24. and I Chro.6.69. But here mention is made of another in the tribe of Juda. Rehabean strengthened or fenced the same, and i is accounted among the strongest or best fenced Cities of the Kingdom of Juda, 2 Chron.11.10.] and the people was very weary.
\p
\v 32 . Then the people got to them to the prey, [Oth.. the people turned themselves to the prey] and they took sheep, and oxen, and calves, [Heb. the sons of oxen] and they slew them to the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood. [viz. before the blood was quite severed from the flesh. This the people did by reason of the great hunger they sustained, being not able to tarry till the beasts had left bleeding. See Levit.3.17. and 17.10. Deut.12.16. and 23.]
\p
\v 33 . And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, eating with the blood: and he said, ye have dealt treacherously, [viz. against God] roll a great stone [viz. to slay the beasts thereon, that the blood may the sooner and in greater quantity run or issue out of them. Some conceive that the Altar, whereof mention is made vers.35. was made of that great stone] unto me this day. [i.e. forth with, before it grow late.]
\p
\v 34 . Moreover, Saul spake, Disperse your selves among the people, and say unto them, Bring unto me every man his Ox, and every man his Sheep, and slay them here, and eat, and sin not against the LORD, eating them with the blood: then all the people brought every man his Ox with his hand, by night, and slew then there.
\p
\v 35 . Then Saul built an Altar unto the LORD; that was the first Altar, which he buil unto the LORD. [heb. he began to build that Altar unto the Lord.]
\p
\v 36 . Afterwards Saul said, Lt us go down after the Philistines by night, and let us rob them until it grow morning light, and let us leave a man of them: they now said, Do all that is god in thine eyes. But the Priest said, Let us draw neer hither unto God, [i.e. unto the Ark of God; viz. to inquire of him, whether it be his will, that we should do this.]
\p
\v 37 . Then Saul enquired of God, [viz. by the high Priest] Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day. [This was a token that God was displeased with him: see the like example, I Sam.28.6. The Lord was angry, not with Jonathan, but with Saul, because he had made such a foolish and imprudent oath, and had charged the people therewith.]
\p
\v 38 . Then said Saul, Come hither (out of) all the corners of the people: [See Judg.20. on vers.2.] and enquire, [Oth. know, acknowledge] and see wherein this sin hath been acted this day.
\p
\v 39 . For (as true as) the LORD liveth, who delivereth Israel, though it were in my son Jonathan, he shall die the death: [Heb. he shall dying die,] and not a man among all the people answered him.
\p
\v 40 . Moreover, he said unto all Israel, Ye shall be on the one side, and I and my son Jonathan will be on the other side: Then said the people unto Saul, Do that which is good in thine eyes.
\p
\v 41 . Now Saul spake unto the LORD the God of Israel, Show the guiltless (person:) [Heb. give the perfect, or, upright one. Oth. Give an upright (lot,)] then Jonathan and Saul were hit, and the people escaped. [Heb. To be hit by the lot, and to escaped. [Heb. To be hit by the lot, and to escape or go scotfree are here opposed to each other.]
\p
\v 42 . Then said Saul, Cast (the lot) between me, and between my son Jonathan: then Jonathan was hit. [Saul prayeth, vers 47. Shew the guilt (person;) he would say, the guilty (person:) but God sheweth here him, which indeed and in truth was innocent, or guiltless, as Sauls words do import.]
\p
\v 43 . Then said Saul unto Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done: then Jonathan told him, and said, I tasted but [Heb. tasting tasted, &c.] a little honey with the uttermost part of the staff, which I had in mine hand, behold, (here) I am, must I die?
\p
\v 44 . And Saul said, God do so to (me) and let him so add thereto, [Of this manner of swearing, see Ruth.1.17. In that Saul here and elsewhere so often sweareth, it appeareth plainly, that he was bent and accustomed to cursing and swearing,] Jonathan thou must die the death.
\p
\v 45 . But the people said unto Saul, Should Jonathan die; that hath done this great deliverance in Israel? farre be it, (as true as) the LORD liveth, if there shall fall one hair of his head to the ground: [Understand withal, then let God punish us, or, somewhat the like. It is an abrupt king of oath in use among the Hebrews, and see further hereof, 2 Sam.14. on vers.11.] for he hath done (this) with God [i.e. by the Help and guidance of God; see above vers.6.] this day: Thus the people delivered Jonathan, that he died not:
\p
\v 46 . Now Saul went up from after the Philistines, [i.e. he ceased from pursuing the Philistines, partly because the night was past, partly because God had not answered him, vers.37.] and the Philistines went to their place.
\p
\v 47 . Then Saul took the Kingdom over Israel, and be fought against all his enemies round about, against Moab, [i.e. the Moabites] and against the Children of Ammon, and against Edom, [i.e. the Edomites] and against the Kings of Zeba, [Their Land lay from Batane unto the River Euphrates. See further on 2 Sam.10. vers.6.] and against the Philistines, and whither so-ever he turned himself, he exercised punishment. [i.e. God used him as an instrument to punish the enemies of his Church. Oth. he made it ill, or, he did hurt, he troubled them, he plagued them, viz. in hurting, or, indamaging the enemies]
\p
\v 48 . And he dealt valiantly, [Oth. he made, or, gathered an host] and he smote the Amalekites; [Of this is spoken more at large below chap.15.] and he delivered Israel out of the hand of him that spoiled him.
\p
\v 49 . Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Isai, [He is also called abinadah, below chap.31.2. likewise I Chron.8.33. and 10.2.] and Malchi-Sua, and the names of his two Daughters were (these,) the name of the first-born was Merab, and the name of the least [Or, youngest] Michal.
\p
\v 50 . And the name of Sauls wife was Ahinoam, a Daughter of Ahinaaz; and the name of his Captain General was Abiner, [Oth. Abner] a son of Ner, Sauls Uncle.
\p
\v 51 . And Kis was Sauls father, and Ner Abners father, was a son of Abiel. [He is called Ner, I Chron.8.33. see above chap.9.1.]
\p
\v 52 . And there was a strong war against the Philistines all the dayes of Saul: wherefore all Champions and all valiant men [Heb. every son of valour, or, strength] that Saul saw, them he gathered unto him.
\c 15
\s Samuel commandeth Saul to destroy the Amalekites, vers.2, &c. Saul mustereth his men, which are two hundred thousand and ten thousand strong, 4. He commandeth the Kenites to depart from Amalek, 6. Saul slayeth the Amalekites, but spareth the King, and the best of the goods, 7. This dipleaseth the Lord exceedingly, 11. Samuel reproveth Saul, and telleth him, (notwithstanding his excuses and acknowledgement of guilt) that God had taken away the kingdom from him, for his thankfulness and disobedience, 14. The rent of Samuels mantle, signifieth that the Kingdom was rent from saul, 27. God can-not lie, 29. Samuel heweth Agag the King of the Amalekites in pieces, 33. Goeth home, and mourneth for Saul,34.
\p
\v 1 . Then said Samuel unto Saul, the LORD sent me to anoint thee King over his people, over Israel; now therefore hear the voice of the words of the LORD.
\p
\v 2 . Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I have visited [i.e. examined, considered, observed. Oth. I will certainly visite. As if God spake of the future, as of that which was past] that which Amalek did unto Israel, how he set himself against him on the way, when he came up out of Egypt.
\p
\v 3 . Now go thy way, and smite Amalek, and ban all that he hath, [i.e. destroy utterly, and slay all that hath life, or every living thing] and spare him not: but slay from the man to the woman, from the children to the sucklings, from the Oxen to the Sheep, from the Camels to the Asses.
\p
\v 4 . This Saul told to the people, and numbered them at Telaim, [i.e. in the field by the City Telaim, lying in the tribe of Juda, which Jos.15.24. is called Thelem] two hundred thousand footmen: and ten thousand men of Juda.
\p
\v 5 . When Saul came to the City of Amalek, [Understand this either of the first City of the Amalekites, before with Saul came, or of the metropolis or chief City of the Amalekites, where peradventure the King dwelt, and kept his Souldiers: Or City may be taken for Cities, for the Amalekites inhabited more Cities then one] then he had an ambush in the valley.
\p
\v 6 . And Saul send word to the Kenites, (saying) Go away, depart, go down out of the midst of the Amalekites, [This short abrupt manner of speaking, signifieth that they were to make haste in breaking up. See the like phrase, Genes.18.6.] left I convey you away with them, [i.e. lest I deal by you, as I inted to deal by them] for ye shewed mercy unto all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt: [This is properly to be understood of Jethro the Kenite, Moseh his father in Law, from whom the Kenites descended] So the Kenites departed out of the midst of the Amalekites.
\p
\v 7 . Then smote Saul the Amalekites from Havila [A Land lying in Arabia. See Genes. Chap.2. vers.11.] until where thou comest to Sur, [this is the border of Arabia toward Egypt. See Genes.16.17. and 25.18. There is likewise mention made, Exod.15.22. of the wildernesse of Sur] which is over against Egypt.
\p
\v 8 . And he took Agag [It’s thought that this was a name common to all the Kings of the Amalekites, as Pharao to the Kings of Egypt, and Abimelech to the Kings at Gerar] the King of the Amalekites alive, but he handed all the people by the edge of the sword.
\p
\v 9 . But Saul and all the people spared Agag, and the best Sheep, and Oxen, and the next (to the best,) [i.e. the middle sort. Oth. the fatted, or, fatlings] and the Lambs, [Oth. Leaders of the cattel, Oth. Bell-weathers] and all that was best, [this God had forbidden, vers.3.] and they would not ban them: but every thing that was despicable, and that was perishing, [Heb. that melted; i.e. that in it self perished, and as it were melted away] that they banned.
\p
\v 10 . Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying:
\p
\v 11 . It repenteth me [This is spoken after the manner of men. See the annotat. On Genes.6.6. also below chap.16.1. So that that which is said below vers.29. is no way contrary or repugnant to this] that I have made Saul King, because he hath turned himself back away from after me, and hath not established my words: [i.e. he hath not suffered my command to prevail with him, that he should have faithfully excuted the same. Compare Deut.27.26.] then Samuel kindled, [viz. with grief and wrath. He kindled against Saul, because he had not performed Gods command] and he cried unto the LORD all night. [Samuel prayed unto the Lord for Saul, that he would not despose him from the Kingdom, but God heard not this prayer of Samuel, as may appear below vers.23.26. and 28.]
\p
\v 12 . Afterward Samuel gat him up early in the morning, to meet Saul: and it was told Samuel, [Oth. notice was given, &c. saying, Saul is come to Carmel, [a City and hill in the tribe of Juda, which lay on the way, as they passé out of the Amalekites Countrey into Juda, Jos.15.55. very fruitful in pasture and other fruits. There is another Carmel in the tribe of Issaschan, I Kings 18.19.] and behold, he hath set him (up) a pillar. [Heb. a hand; i.e. a memorial, perhaps in the fashion of a hand, in remembrance that he smote and consumed the enemies with the hand. See like, 2 Sam18.18. Oth. and had appointed a place, viz. to refresh and view his army, and to divide the prey] afterward he is gone about, and passed thorow, and come down to Gilgal.
\p
\v 13 . Now Samuel came unto Soul said unto him, Blessed art thou unto the LORD, I have established the word of the LORD. [See Above VII.]
\p
\v 14 . Then said Samuel, what meaneth then he voice of sheep in mine ears, and the voice of the oxen that I hear?
\p
\v 15 . Now Saul said, they have brought the Amalekites, for the people have spared the best sheep and oxen, [See above verse 9] to offer unto the LORD thy God: but the rest we have banned.
\p
\v 16 . Then said Samuel, cease, so will I tell thee, what the LORD spake to me this night: the he said speak (on).
\p
\v 17 . And Samuel said, Is it not (thus), when thou wast little in thine eyes, [I e. when thou esteemedst thy slf little and mean/; see above chapter 9.21] that thou art be come the head of tribes of Israeel? And that the LORD hath anointed thee [viz. by me] to be King over Isreal?
\p
\v 18 . And the LORD hath set thee on the way, [i. e. Upon this design and expectation against the Amalekites, to also ver. 20.] and said go thy way and ban the sinners ,overtopping others in sinnes and wickedness. Compare Gen 13.13.Psalm1.1.Matt.9.10& 11.19. Job 9. 24, 31] the Amalekites, and fight against them, until thou bring them nothing.
\p
\v 19 . Wherefore now didst thou not hearken to the voice of the LORD, but didst fly to the prey, [ See the annotate on 1 Sam 25.14] and didst that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD?
\p
\v 20 . Then said Saul unto Samuel, yes, I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD, and have walked on the way on which the LORD sent me: and I have brought (with me) Agag the King of the Amalekites, but I have banned the Amalekites.
\p
\v 21 . Now the people took of the spoil, [ As if he had said not I, but the people, whom I feared , verse 24. Took of the prey] Sheep and oxen the chiefest, [Heb. The firstlings] of the banned (thing) to offer unto the LORD thy God at Gilgal.
\p
\v 22 . But Samuel said, Hath the Lord delight in burnt-offerings, and slay-offerings, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? behold, to obey is better than slay-offerings, to attend then the fat of the ram.
\p
\v 23 . For rebellion is a sinne of witchcraft, [i.e. It’s as great a sinne as witchcraft is] and to oppose is Idolatry, [the Hebrew word signifieth Vanity, iniquity, and sometimes labour, pain, travel, also an idol, and idol-worship, or idolatry, so called, because Idolaters bestow much labour and pains in the performance of their idolatrous superstitions, which are all meer vanities, and have nothing of reality in them]and image- worship: [Heb. Teraphim. See the annotat on Gen.31.19] because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, therefore he hath rejected thee, that thou shalt not be King.
\p
\v 24 . Then said Saul unto Samuel, I have sinned, because I have transgressed the LORD’S command [Heb. mouth: i.e. That which God by thy mouth hath spoken] and thy words : for I feared the people, and hearkened to their voice.
\p
\v 25 . Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sinne: and turn again with me. That I may worship the LORD.
\p
\v 26 . But Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee; because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, therefore the LORD hath rejected thee, that thou shalt not be King over Israel.
\p
\v 27 . Then Samuel turned himself about to go away: then he [viz. Saul] took hold of a skirt [ Heb. a wing; i.e. skirt, or, gard, by which Saul would hold the Prophet Samuel fait] of his mantle, and it rent.
\p
\v 28 . Then said Samuel unto him, The LORD hath said this day rent off the Kingdome of Israel from thee, and hath given it to thy neighbour, that is better then thee.
\p
\v 29 . And also he that is the victory of Israel [i.e. The Lord who fighteth for Israel, and conquereth his enemy. Oth.the strength of Israel ] lieth not, and repenteth him not: [see the annotat. On Gen.6.6.] for he is not a man, that he should repent (of anything)
\p
\v 30 . Then he said, I have sinned, honour me now, I pray thee, before the Eldest [Or, in the preference of the Eldest] of my people, and before Israel: and turn again with me, that ye may worship the LORD thy God.
\p
\v 31 . Then Samuel turned again after Saul: [ viz. To honour the Kingly Dignity in the presence and repute of the people] and Saul worshipped the LORD.
\p
\v 32 . Then said Samuel, Bring hither to me Agag the King of Amalekites: now Agag went unto him delicately; [Or, flately, delicately, tenderely. This may be understood of his and costly garments, which ( it may be) he put on, to come thus before the Prophet with aflatelt countenance] and Agag said, [ i.e. thought with himself, or , he said this to his servants, or those that stood about him] Verily the bitterness of death is past. [ As if he had said, I perceive now plainly that I shall not be put to death, as I hitherto feared, because I am brought before a Prophet, having escaped the hands of an armed King]
\p
\v 33 . But Samuel said , According as thy sword berest women of their children, So shall thy mother be bereaved of her children among women: Then Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the face of the LORD at Gilgal. [ See the like example in the prophet Elias, 1 King. 18. 40 & 2 King . 1. 10,11 These Prophets were moved hereunto by an inward motion and instinct of God; so that this may not be followed by every one, whose calling properly is not to use the sword of Justice ]
\p
\v 34 . Afterward Samuel went to Rama, and Saul went up to his house at Gibea of Saul.
\p
\v 35 . And Samuel saw Saul no more [ Oth: Visited Saul no more. Viz to instruct him concerning the government of the kingdom, or to ask counsel of God for him otherwise Samuel saw Saul unawares at Najoth in Rama, below chap. 19.24. Seeing for visiting, is likewise used 2 King. 8.29. and in other places more] until the day of his death, [ the fame being likewise counted in with the rest; intimating that he never visited him again, or after that time] never the less Samuel mourned for Saul [ Samuel mourned not for Saul all his life-time, but so long, until he was forbidden by God to do it, and he was commanded by God to anoint David King over Israel; as appeareth below chap. 16.1] and it repented the LORD, that he had made Saul King over Israel.
\c 16
\s The Lord sendeth Samuel to Bethlehem unto Isai, to anoint one of his sons King: Samuel fearing Saul, is instructed how to manage the business with safety, over.2, Samuel was inclined to anoint Eliab, Isaia’s eldest son King, 6 But the Lord telleth him, that he had chosen David, Isai’s youngest son to be King, 12 Him: Samuel anointeth, and the spirit of God cometh upon him, 13.Butdepateth from Saul, 14. David is summoned to court by the advice of Sauls servants, to play before Saul, 16.Davids praise, 18 Saul loveth him greatly,andfmaketh him his Armour-bearer, 21. David playeth before Saul when the spirit vexed and disquieted him,23.
\p
\v 1 . Then said the LORD unto Samuel, How long dost thou mourn for Saul, whom I verilty have rejected, that he be noKing over Isreal? Fill thine bornwith oyl, [See above chapter 10.1] and go thy ways, I will send thee unto Isai the Bethlehemite, for I have provided me a King among his sons.
\p
\v 2 . But Samuel said, how should I go thither? [Samuel was here possessed with humane fear, and out of anxiety, and perplexity of mind he asketh counsel of the Lord, how he might conveniently perform his command, and avoid the apparent danger] for Saul will hear it [i. e. come to know it, or be advertised of it] and kill me: then said the LORD, Take a calf of the oxen with thee [Heb, in thine hand. As if he should say, get a calf ready, or at hand] and say, I am come to offer [Heb . to slay, viz. a thank-offering]unto the LORD.
\p
\v 3 . And thou shalt invite [Heb. call] Isai to the offering,[or, o the feast,or banquet, that was made after the offering was performed, of the meat that was offered unto God. And hence it appeareth, that this was not done in Isai’s house, for no man is invited to a feast or banquet in his own house] and I will acquaint thee what thou shalt do, and thou shalt anoint me(him)whom I shall say,(or name) unto thee.
\p
\v 4 . Now Samuel did that which the LORD had spoken, and he came to Bethlehem. Then the Eldest of the city trembling to meet him, [Heb. trembled to meet him. Compare above chap13.17. below chap 21.1, Hos 11.10] and said [Heb said in singular number, viz. one in the name of all] is thy coming (in) peace?[ Heb. Is thy coming peace? Peradventure they thought that Samuel fled from Saul, having (it may be) heard that Saul was provoked against him, because that he had told him that God rejected him from the Kingdome: or peradventure they were afraid they had committed some great sinne, which the Prophet came to discover unto them, and to denounce God’s judgment against them for the same.]
\p
\v 5 . He then said, in peace: I am come to offer unto the LORD, hallow your selves, [i. e. Prepare, and fit yourselves for it, as it becometh you so to do: see Exod.19. verse 10, 14,15.] and come with me to the offering: and he hallowed Isai, and his sons,[i. e. He commanded not onely Isai, but also his sons to hallow themselves. Doubtlesse Samuel like wife discovered to Isai, that he was sent of God to anoint one of his sons King in Sauls stead; as appeareth from the next following verses] and he invited them to the offering.
\p
\v 6 . And it came to pass when they came in, [viz.The sons of Isai, who successively, one after another, came into a certain room or chamber] that he looked on Eliah [otherwise called Elihu, 1Chron 27.18.] and thought, [Heb. said, viz in his heart; but not by the instinct or inspiration of God. Samuel looking on his beauty and tallness, thought that this was the right man whom the Lord had chosen] surely (this man) is before the LORD, his anointed. [i.e. he is the man, whom I must anoint King: but erred in this, as Nathan did, 2 Sam 7.3. speaking according to his own judgment and apprehension.]
\p
\v 7 . But the LORD said unto Samuel, [viz. In a secret, hidden manner, as below ver.12 and above, chap. 9.17] Look not on his countenance, nor on the height of his fixture, for I have rejected him: [i.e. not chosen him to be king; and so ver. 8,9, &c. for there is no mention made of the election to salvation] for it is no as man saith, for man looketh on that which is before the eyes, but the LORD looketh on the heart.
\p
\v 8 . Then Isai called Abinadab, and he made him pass before the face of Samuel: but he [viz Samuel] said neither hath the LORD chosen [viz. to the Kings honour or dignity] this.
\p
\v 9 . Afterward Isai made Samma [Oth. called Simea, 2 Sam 13.3. and 1 Chron. 2.13.] to pass by: but he said neither hath the LORD chosen this.
\p
\v 10 . Also Isai made his seven sons [Compare 1 Chron 2 on ver. 13,14.] to pass before the face of Samuel: but Samuel said unto Isai, the LORD hath not chosen these.
\p
\v 11 .Moreover, Samuel said unto Isai, Are there all the young men? [Heb..Are the young men ended?] and he said , the least is yet remaining, and behold, he feedeth sheep: now Samuel,for we will not sit down round about [ Heb. compass about environ,turn about] until he shall be come hither.
\p
\v 12 . Then sent he away, and brought him in (now he was ruddy withal of beautiful eyes, and of (as) beautiful countenance) and the LORD said, [viz. By a secret or inward motion, or instinct of the Holy Ghost] Arise, anoint him, for this is he.
\p
\v 13 . Then took Samuel the horn of oil, and he anointed him in the midst of his bretheren, [viz. After he had made his father, him, and all that were there present, acquainted with the will of the Lord touching this matter] and the spirit of the Lord waxed ready upon David [seethe like example, Judg.13.25. &1 Sam .11.6] from that day, and (so) forward: afterward Samuel rose up, and he went to Rama.
\p
\v 14 . And the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord [This was a certain madness, or trouble of min, which Satan stirred up in Saul, by Gods permission and providence, whereby he justly punished Saul] terrified him. [or, troubled him, disquieted him.]
\p
\v 15 . Then said Saul’s servants unto him: behold now, an evil spirit of God [Sent of God, to execute his righteous judgment] terrifieth thee.
\p
\v 16 .let our Lord now say to thy servants, [i.e. To us] which (stand) before thy face, [i.e. who stand ready and prepared to wait upon thee, or, to do thee service] that they seek out a man, that is skilful in playing the Harp : [See Gen.4. on v21] and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit of God [ see verse 15.] is upon thee.[ i.e. that thy heart and mind may be eased and quieted, the melancholy humour being dispelled, and asswaged by the Musick.]
\p
\v 17 . Then said Saul to his servants: provide me now a man that can play well, bring him to me.
\p
\v 18 . Then answered one of the young men, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Isai the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing in playing, and he is a valiant champion, and a man of war, and understanding in matters; [Or, words. Otherwise an eloquent man] and a beautiful man, and the LORD is with him.[i.e. he is blessed and prosperous in all his attempts.]
\p
\v 19 . Now Saul sent messengers unto Isai, and said send me David thy son, which is with the sheep.
\p
\v 20 . Then Isai took an ass with bread, [Heb. an ass of bread; i e. an ass loaden with bread] and a lethern sack with wine, and a kid of the goats, and sent them by the hand of his son David to Saul.
\p
\v 21 . So David came unto Saul, and he stood before his face:[i. e. he abode at Court in this Kings Service: so is the word to stand also taken, ver.22.see the annotat. Deut1.38.] and he became his Amour-bearer.
\p
\v 22 . Afterward Saul sent to Isai, saying: Let David I pray thee, Stand before my face, [As verse 21] for he hath found grace in mine eyes.[see the annotat on Gen 18.3.]
\p
\v 23 . .And it came to pass when the spirit of God [Undestand that evil spirit, where of mention is made, verse14,15.] was upon Saul, then David took the harp, and he played with his hand: that was a refreshing unto Saul, and it was better with him, and the evil spirit departed from him.[i.e. Those terrours and troubles of the evil spirits ceased, when David played. God by his providence so ruled and ordered this matter, that God might be advanced in the Kings Court, so to open the door, and to prepare the way for him to the Kingdome, whereunto he had chosen, and already anointed him.]
\c 17
\s The Philistines and Israelites camps lying on against another, ver.1c.the giant Goliath draweth neer, and affrighteth the Israelites with his huge statue, armour, and daring challenge,4. David being sent by his father into the camp unto his Bretheren, and seeing this, is troubled at the proud and lofty carriage of this uncircumcised Goliath, and encounter with him, 12. For which he is sorely reviled by his eldest brother, 28. Saul causeth David to be sent for, who abideth constant in his proper, and sheweth the ground or reason of his courage and confindence, 31.Goethunarmed, onely with his staff and a fling against the proud Philistine Goliath, 38.whodespiseth, curseth, him,42. But David, full of faith and confidence in God, felleth him down, and slayeth him, 45. Where upon the Philistines fleeing, are smitten and Plundered, 51.Saultaketh notice of David,55.
\p
\v 1 . And the Philistines gathered together their army to battle, [here, according to the opinion of some, is related that which was done before David came to the Court, which is described at the end of the 10. Chapter, but it’s here set down, to shew by what means, or upon what occasion David came into the Court of Saul] and gathered themselves together at Socho [ a city lying in the tribe if Juda, Jos 15.35. Rehabeam built and fortified the same, 2 Chron 11.8. But in the time of Achaz the Philistines took the same again, 2 Chron 28.18.] which is Juda: and they camped themselves between Socho, and between Azeka, [This city lay in the uttermost borders of the tribe of Juda towards the West, Jos.15.45, Rehabeam feared the lame,1Cron.11.9 and it was besieged by Nebuchadnezzar: see Jer 34.] at the end of Dammim. [Oth. called Ephes-Dammim, and Paul-Dammim, 1 Chron 11.13.]
\p
\v 2 . But Saul and the men of Israel gathered themselves together, and camped in the Oak-valley: and set the battle in array against the Philistines.
\p
\v 3 . Now the Philistines stood on a mount on that (side) and the Israelites stood on a mountain on this side: and the valley was between them.
\p
\v 4 . Then went there out a champion, [Heb. a man between two, or, between both, or, a treader between both. This Giant seemeth to be called thus, because he put himself between both the camps, and challenged to fight with any: or, a man between two; i e. that between them the two will fight a duel, or single- combate. Oth. a dueller] out of the camp of the Philistines, his name was Goliath of Gath: his height was fix ells (or cubits), and a span,) [containing about three hundred breaths, or twelve inches].
\p
\v 5 . .And he had a copper-helmet on his head, and he had a scaly coat of male on: and the weight of the coat of mil was five thousand shekel of copper: [Four common shekels make an ounce so that after that reckoning this harnass weighed 1 250ounces;i.e.78 pound, and two ounces.]
\p
\v 6 . And a copper leg-harnass upon his feet, and a copper target [Or, neck-piece, breast-plate, or, shoulder-harnass] between his shoulders.
\p
\v 7 . And the staff of his spear was as a Weavers beam, and the head of his spear was (made) of six hundred shekels of iron: and the target-bearer went before his face.
\p
\v 8 . Now this (man) stood ,and cried to the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why should you go forth to the battle in aray? am not I a Philistine, and the servant of Saul? Chuse a man among you, that may come down to me [viz. To fight singly with me alone; as if he should say, What need is there that the whole army be engaged in battle, the chusing one man out amongst you all that may enter the List with me, and fight with me hand to hand.]
\p
\v 9 . If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then we will be servants unto you: but if I conquer him, and smite him, then shall ye be servants unto us, and serve us.
\p
\v 10 . Moreover, the Philistine said, [viz. When he saw that no man came forth to fight with him] I have defied the armies of Israel this day,[viz. seeing I have challenged them, to send one man forth from among them, to fight a single combat with me, and there’s none of them all the dares attempt to do it: this will lie as a perpertual shame and reproach upon them; as concerning me I have 8zc.(saying) give me a man, that we may fight together.
\p
\v 11 . When Saul and Israel heard these word of the Philistine: they were then dismayed, and feared greatly.
\p
\v 12 . Now David was the son of the Ephraitish man of Bethlehem Juda, [Of whom mention is made above chap. 16.19.] whose name was Isai, and (he) had eight sons: [compare 1 Chron. 2.on ver. 13,14.] and in the days of Saul he was a man, old, decaying, among men.
\p
\v 13 . And the three greatest sons of Isai went their way they followed after Saul into the war: Now the names of the three sons, that went into war, were, Eliab the first-born, and his second Abinadab, and the third Samma.
\p
\v 14 . And David was the least: {viz. Among them, that properly are called sons; see above Chapter 16.12.] and the three greatest followed after Saul.
\p
\v 15 . But David went his ways, [Some do understand this thus, that David went often to and fro, being eftstoons sent by his Farther into the camp, to enquire how the café stood with his sons, and to furnish them with necessaries, ver. 17. Which when he had done, he then returned to the sheep] and returned from Saul,[i.e. according to the opinion of some, from his bretheren, which were with Saul in the camp, for this happened before David came to the Court] to feed his fathers sheep at Bethelehem.]
\p
\v 16 . Now the Philistines drew near early in the morning, and at evening: Thus he presented himself (there) fourty days together.
\p
\v 17 . And Isai said unto his son David, Take, I pray thee, [Oth. Now] for thy brethren an Epha [see of this measure, Exod16.36] of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and carry them speedily into the camp unto thy brethren.
\p
\v 18 . But carry these ten milk-cheeses [i.e. Fresh-cheeses, out of which the milk might be yet presled] unto the Captain over the thousand:/thou shalt visit thy brethren, (to know) if they be in good plight; and thou shalt take with thee (a) pledge from them. [viz. that I may thereby assurely know that thou hast done thy message well.]
\p
\v 19 . Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel were by the oak-valley fighting with he Philistines.
\p
\v 20 . Then David got up early in the morning, and he left the sheep with the keeper, and took it up (those things) and went its ways, according as Isai had commanded him, and he came to the wagon-Fort, [i. e. To the place where the Camp with the Baggage-Waggons was as it were hemmed in, or compassed about: so also below chapter26.5.] when the army marched forth in battle-aray, and they called to the battle. [Oth. and they made a field-cry to the war, or, they made a great noise in the camp as when there is an alarm.]
\p
\v 21 . And the Israelites and the Philistines put battle-aray against battle-aray.
\p
\v 22 . Now David left the vessels from him, under the hand of the keeper of the vessels, [Understand here, that David left his provision, or carriage, or sack, in which he carried the cheeses and the loaves (whereof mention is made v. 17.) with the keepers of the vessels or carriage, that he might the speedier go and view the camp] and he ran to the battle-aray: and he came and asked his brethren concerning (their) welfare. [Heb. concerning the peace]
\p
\v 23 . When he talked with them, behold, here came up [viz. Upward toward the mountain, where the camp of the Israelites lay, v.3.] the champion : his name was Goliath, the Philistine of Gath, out of the Philistine army, [or, battle-ray] and he spake according to these words: [viz. which are mentioned v.8.] and David heard them.
\p
\v 24 . But all the men in Israel, when they saw that man, then they fled before his face, and they feared greatly.
\p
\v 25 . And the men of Israel said: have ye indeed seen that man that is come up? For he is come up to deliver Israel: and it shall come to pass, that the king will enrich that man-that smiteth him, with great riches, and he will give him his daughter, and he will make his fathers house free in Israel. [i e. He will enable him and his family and give them those priviledges and immunities, which are wont to be given to the nobility, when they have done gallant service for their country, and for their Prince.]
\p
\v 26 . Then spake David unto the men that flood by him, saying, What shall they do to this man [Heb. What shall be done to that man?] that smiteth this Philistine, and turneth away the reproach from Israel: for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defie the Armies of the living God.
\p
\v 27 . Again the people spake unto him according to that word, saying : Thus shall they do to the man the smiteth him.
\p
\v 28 . When Eliab his Greatest brother heard him speak to those men; then Eliabs anger kindled against David, and he said, Why art thou now come down? And under whom hast thou left the few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy presumption, and the wickedness of thy heart well, for thou art come down, that thou mightiest see the battle.
\p
\v 29 . Then said David, What have I now done? [viz. Wherefore thou thus chidest me, and accusest me of pride] is there not a cause? as it he had said, my father indeed sent me unto you. Otherw. Is it not this word or cause? i.e. according to the opinion of some, is that word which was there spoke, the cause that thou art so angry with me, and so chidest me? Oth. Is not that the thing?]
\p
\v 30 . And he turned himself away from him towards another, and he said according to hat word: [David asked often divers persons, partly that he might fully know the certainty of the thing, partly to make known his proneness to encounter with this Philistine, that so the matter might come to the Kings ear] and the people answered him again according to the first words.
\p
\v 31 . When those words were heard which David had spoken, and were rehearsed in the presence of Saul, then he sent for him. [Heb. he took him.]
\p
\v 32 . And David said unto Saul, Let no mans heart fail because of him: thy servant [i.e. I that am thy servant; so also below v. 34.] will go his ways, and he will fight with this philistine.
\p
\v 33 . But Saul said unto David, Thou will not be able to go forth against this Philistine, to fight with him, [viz.With hope or appearance of getting the victory over him] for thou art a young man, [ and therefore yet inexperienced in War like affairs: or a child, viz. in comparison of this Giant] and he is a man of war from his youth.
\p
\v 34 . Then said David unto Saul, Thy servant fed his fathers sheep, [Heb. was feeding among the sheep] and there came a lion and a bear, and took away a sheep [or, lamb, or goat] out of the flock.
\p
\v 35 . And I went forth after him, and I smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: when he rose up against me, then I caught him by his beard, and smote him , and killed him.
\p
\v 36 . Thy servant smote both the lion and the bear: so shall this uncircumcised Philistine be as on of them, [As if he should say, he shall be smitten and killed by me, as I have killed the lion and the bear] because he hath defied the armies of the living God.
\p
\v 37 . Furthermore David said, the LORD, that delivered me from the hand [Or, paw, claw] of the lion, and out of the hand [or, paw. claw] of the bear, and he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine: the said Saul unto David, Go thy ways and the LORD be with thee.
\p
\v 38 . And Saul clothed David with his clothes [Understand this Sauls clothes ; i. e. armour, or which he was wont to put on, when he went to battle, or which he took out of his armoury or magazine, which fitted David] and put a copper helmet upon his head: and he clothed him with a coat of Mail.
\p
\v 39 . And David girded his sword upon his clothes, and would go, [Or, And began to go, [ Or, And began to go] for he had never tried it: then said David unto Saul, I cannot go in these,[viz. arms, or weapons, or harnesses] for I never tried it: and David put them off him.
\p
\v 40 . And he took his staff in his hand, and he chose him five smooth stones out of the brook ,and put them in shepherds bag,[Heb. vessel] which he had ,to wit, in the sack, and his fling in his hand: thus he drew near to the Philistine.
\p
\v 41 . The Philistine likewise went along, going and near unto David: and his shield-bearer [Heb. The man that have shield] (went) before his face.
\p
\v 42 . When the Philistines looked up, and saw David, then he despised him: for he was a youth, ruddy, likewise fair of countenance.
\p
\v 43 . Now the Philistine said unto David, Am I Dog that thou comest to me with sticks?[Oth.With a stick. David had but one stick, or shepherds staff, verse. 40.So that here the plural number seemeth to be put for the singular. : see Gen.21.7.] and the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
\p
\v 44 . Afterwards the Philistine said unto David: Come tome, so will I give thy flesh unto fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the field.
\p
\v 45 . On contrary, David said unto the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: [i.e. Thou reliest upon thy sword, & c .See above ver 5 and 6] but I come to thee in the name of the LORD., [see Prov 18.10.] of hosts, the god of armies of Israel, [i.e. by motion or instinct of God, and having first called upon his Name : and I rely upon his gracious help and assistance, which he hath promised to them that trust in him] whom [ or, which, viz. army] thou hast defied.
\p
\v 46 . And this day will the LORD shut thee up in mine hand, and will smite thee, and I will take off thine head from thee, and I will give the carcasses of the Philistines camp this day unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the field : And all the earth shall know that Israel hath a God.[viz .A God, that maketh it really appear, that he is Almighty.]
\p
\v 47 . And all this assembly shall know, that the LORD deliverth not by the sword, nor by the spear: for the war victory to whom he pleaseth. Oth for this war is the Lord: as if he had said: ye make wear against the Lord, but we for the Lord: he regardeth his own honour, and the deliverance of his people] he will give you into our hand.
\p
\v 48 . And it came to pass when the Philistines gat up, and forth, and drew near to meet David hasted and ran to the battle- array [viz. To the fighting place between both camps]to meet the Philistine.
\p
\v 49 . And David put his hand into the pouch, and took thence a stone, and he slang it, and bit [Heb. smote] the Philistine in his fore-head [i.e. So that the stone sunk into his fore-head. The Hebrew word signifieth properly to dip, or sink into the water. The meaning is, that the stone went so easily, and so deep into his forehead, and tarried there a while, as if it had been sunk in, and covered all over in it: and this by the power of God, which was with David] and he fell on his ace to the ground.
\p
\v 50 . So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and he smote the Philistine, and slew him: but David had no sword in (his0 hand.
\p
\v 51 . Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of its sheath, and he slew him, and he cut off his head therewith: When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, then they fled.
\p
\v 52 . Then the men of Israel and of Juda got up, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until there they come to the valley, [Whereof spoken ver.3.] and unto the gates of Ekron: and the wounded of the Philistines fell (down) on the way of Saaraim, [a city lying in the tribe of Juda, as appeareth Jos.15.36.] and unto Gath, and unto Ekron.
\p
\v 53 . After that the children of Israel returned from the hot pursuit after the Philistines: and they spoiled their camps. [He speaketh in the plural number, in respect of the divers quarters, and great number of souldiers, horses, and other beasts that carried burdens that were in this camp of the Philistines.]
\p
\v 54 . Afterward David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem: but he laid his armour [viz. Goliaths armour, which David had taken from him] in his tent. [but the sword of Goliath did David, before he was King, lay up in the Tent of the Congragation at Nob; see chap.21.9.]
\p
\v 55 . When Saul saw David go forth to meet the Philistine, he said unto Abner the Captain General of the army, whose son is this young man? [These things were acted before David came to the Court: see on v.I. Some think that Sauls mind and memory, in regard the evil spirit did so haunt and vex him, were distracted and hurt, so that he had forgotten whose son David was. Others affirm, that Saul indeed knew David as much as concerned his particular person, but thas he was desirous to know, of what stock and place he was descended] and Abner said, (as truly as) thy soul liveth, O King, I know not. [Some conceive that Abner was not at that Court at that time, when David was sent for by Saul to play before him, but that he was in some place or other present with the camp, as for the most part of time he was.]
\p
\v 56 . Now the King said, Inquire thou, whose son the young man is.
\p
\v 57 . When David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, then Abner took him, and he brought him before the face of Saul, and the head of the Philistine was in his hand.
\p
\v 58 . And Saul said unto him, Young man, whose son are thou? And David said, I am a son of thy servants Isai the Bethlehemite.
\c 18
\s Jonathan loveth David most dearly, and entereth into Covenant with him, ver. 1, &c. Giving him Presents, 4. Saul maketh him Commander over his souldiery and army, 5. The women extol David in their songs of praise above Saul, 6, Hereat Saul is incensed, 8. He assayed to thrust David thorow with a spear, 10. But David escaped, 11. Saul spareth David, 12, 13. David is prosperous in all his ways, 14. He is beloved of the people, 16. Saul promiseth david fraudulently his daughter Merab, 17. But she is given to Adriel, 19. Afterward Saul promiseth to david his daughter Michal, 20. But to be a snare, 21. The servants of Saul counsel David to take the Kings daughter to wife, 22. David accepteth thereof, 23. Saul demandeth a hundred fore-skins of the Philistines for a Dowry, 25. David promiseth to deliver the same, 26. And delivereth them in double number or quantity: then Saul gave him Michal, 27. She loveth David, 28. Saul feareth David, and becometh his enemy, 29. David prospereth, and is honoured, and becometh famous, 30.
\p
\v 1 . It came to pass when he [viz. David] had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was wed to the soul of David: [See the annotate. on Gen. 44.30.] and Jonathan loved him as his soul. [i.e. as himself.]
\p
\v 2 . And Saul took him that day, [Above chap.16.16. it is said, that Saul took David to him, that he might play before him on the harp, and then he was at liberty to go and come when he would, above chap.17.15. Now its said there that Saul took David to him, viz. to use him in the war, as one of his Commanders, or Field-officers, v.5. and in that respect he was continually to abide at Court] and he suffered him not to return to his fathers house.
\p
\v 3 . Now Jonathan and David made a Covenant, because he loved him as his (own) soul.
\p
\v 4 . And Jonathan put off his mantle which he had on, [Heb. Which was upon him] and gave it unto David; also his fathers, [understand this of his military clothes or armour] even to his sword, and to his bowe, and to his girdle.
\p
\v 5 . And David went forth whithersoever Saul sent him, he behaved himself prudently, and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted [Heb. Good] in the eys of all the people, and also in the eyes of Sauls servants.
\p
\v 6 . Now it came to pass , when they [viz. Saul with his souldiery] came, and David returned from the slaughter of the Philistines, [Heb. of the Philistine; whereby may be understood in the first place the giant Goliath; and secondly the camp of the Philistines in general] that the women went forth out of all the cities of Israel, with singing, dances, to meet King Saul; with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick. [The instrument that here is named in the Hebrew, is now adayes unknown to us, but it seemeth to have been an instrument with three strings: see the like examples, Exod.15.20, 21. Judg.11,34.]
\p
\v 7 . And the women playing answered (one another) and said: Saul hath slain his thousands [i.e. ten times as many as Saul.]
\p
\v 8 . Then Saul kindled greatly, and that word was evil in his eyes, and he said, They have given David ten thousand, but me (but) a thousand; and assuredly the Kingdome will be for him:
\p
\v 9 . And Saul had the eye on David, [Heb. Eyed David, i.e. he laid wait for him, and watched all opportunity, to put him to death: or, he looked on him from that very time with an evil eye, and he was his enemy, v.29.] from that day, and forward.
\p
\v 10 . And it came to pass the next day, that the evil spirit of God [See above chap. 16. On ver.15.] waxed ready upon Saul, and he prophesied [the meaning is, that Saul being vexed of the evil spirit, fell into an extasie or trance, and bewrayed strange kind of gestures and behaviour. Compare I King.18.29. with the annotate.] in the midst of the house, and David played with his hand on a stringed instrument, as from day to day: [viz. to ease Saul of the disquietness and vexation of the evil spirit, and to cheer him in his melancholy fit: for this purpose was David at first summoned to Court, above chap.16.16.] (now Saul had a spear in the hand.)
\p
\v 11 . And Saul shot the spear, and said, [i.e. He thought with himself: for it’s not to be imagined, that he spake this aloud: see the like below ver.17. and 21.] I will smite into David, and into the wall.] but David turned himself twice away from his face.
\p
\v 12 . And Saul was afraid of David, [Saul feared that the souldiers that loved David would chuse David to be their King, v.8.] for the LORD was with him, and he was departed from Saul.
\p
\v 13 . Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his Commander of a thousand: [Not advancing him to his state and degree of honour out of favour and affection he bare to him, but out of hopes that he should fall into his enemies hands and be slain: see ver.17, and 25.] and he went out, and he went in before the face of the people. [i.e. he brought the people on upon the enemy, and led them off from the enemy, as it besitteth such a valiant Commander to do: see also below v.16.]
\p
\v 14 . And David behaved himself prudently in all his ways: and the LORD was with him.
\p
\v 15 . Now when Saul saw that he behaved himself very prudently, he feared before his face. [See the cause hereof above v.8.]
\p
\v 16 . But all Israel [Understand the eleven tribes] and Juda [i.e. the tribe of Juda] loved David, for he went out, and he went in before their face.
\p
\v 17 . Therefore Saul said unto David, Behold, my greatest daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife, [Because Saul durst not put David to death openly, and God preserved him in the war, therefore he seeketh to ensnare him, and to destroy him, under a shew and pretence of love and friendship] onely be thou a valiant son [Heb. a son of valour] unto me, and manage the LORDS war: [i.e. the wars of the people of Israel, which they wage to maintain the honour of God against the idolatrous heathen] (for Saul said, [viz. with himself in his heart] Let not mine hand be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.) [i.e. I will not slay him with mine own hands, but I will cause him to perish by the hand of the Philistines. This Saul thought with himself, that he might get the ill-will of the people. That were affected to David.]
\p
\v 18 . But David said unto Saul; who am I, and what is my life, (and) my fathers family in Israel? that I should be the Kings son in Law. [As if he should say, I am too too mean, that I should be son in Law to a King. Thus speaketh david likewise, 2 sam.7. vers.18.]
\p
\v 19 . Now it came to passé, at the time when Merab Sauls Daughter should be given to David; that she was given unto Adriel [He was the son of Brazillai the Ephraimite, 2 Sam.21.8. where it is said, that the five children, which he begat of Merab, were hanged by the Gibeonites] the Meholathite [i.e. who was born at Mehola. This City was called Abel-Mehola, I Judg.7.22.] to wise.
\p
\v 20 . But Michal Sauls Daughte loved David: when that was made known to Saul, then was that thing right in his eyes.
\p
\v 21 . And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, [See below vers.25.] and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him: therefore Saul said unto David, Thou shalt this day [i.e. within a short time; or, on that day, meaning a certain prefixed day, that Saul had appointed for that purpose, within which time David was to bring in his dowry of a hundred foreskins of the Philistines. See here below, vers.26. But Sauls hope and expectation was, that David disposing himself for this, should at one time or other be destroyed] by my son in law by the other. [heb. two: i.e. the sword. See above chap.13. on vers.1.]
\p
\v 22 . And Saul commanded his servants, (saying) commune with David secretly, [As iof he should say, let it not appear that you do it by my command but as if you did it of your own accord, without my privity,] saying, Behold, the King hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now then be the Kings son in law.
\p
\v 23 . And Sauls servants spake these words before the ears of David: then said David, Is that (thing) light in your eyes, to be the Kings son in law? whereas I am a poor and contemptible man. [As if he should say, I being but a poor and mean fellow in comparison of the King, am not able to give such a large drowry, as becometh a Kings Daughter to receive: for in those times the men did not receive dowries or portions with their wives, but they gave dowries or marriage-portions. See Genes.34.12. Exod.22.16,17. This dowry was at least 50 shekels of silver, Deut.22.25. that is, somewhat more then 12 ounces and an half, which is 12 Rixdollerd and an half, which makes about 12 crowns and an half of our English mony.]
\p
\v 24 . And Sauls servants told him, saying, such words [Heb. according to these words] hath David spoken.
\p
\v 25 . Then said Saul, Thus shall ye say unto David, The King delighteth not in the dowry, but in a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged on the kings enemies; for Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. [i.e. Saul imagined that David would sooner die in the war, then kill a hundred Philistines.]
\p
\v 26 . Now his servants told David those words, and that thing was right in the eyes of David, that he should be the Kings son in law: but the days, [viz. those days that were appointed for the solemnizing of the marriage, or for the delivering in of the foreskins] were not yet expired.
\p
\v 27 . Then David gat up, and he and his men went forth, and they slew among the Philistines two hundred men, and David brought their foreskins, and they delivered them fully [i.e. in full tale, or number] to the King, that he might be the Kings son in Law: then Saul gave him his Daughter Michal to wife.
\p
\v 28 . And Saul saw, and perceived, that the LORD was with David: and Michal Sauls Daughter loved him.
\p
\v 29 . Then Saul was yet the more afraid of David: and Saul was Davids enemy all (his) days, [i.e. as long as Saul lived.]
\p
\v 30 . When the Princes of the Philistines marched forth, [viz. To make war against the Israelites] then it came to pass, that when they marched forth, that David was valianter then all the servants of Saul, so that his name was greatly esteemed.
\c 19
\s Saul seeketh to kill David, ver.1, &c. Jonathan giveth David notice, 2. And speaketh in his behalf unto Saul, 4. Who seeketh that he will not put David to death, 6. David returneth to Court, 7. He marcheth into the field, and smiteth the Philistines, 8. Wherefore he fleeth, 12. Michal deceiveth her father, 13. David cometh to Rama unto Samuel, 18. Saul sendeth messengers to Najoh, to apprehend David: they prophesie, 20. He sendeth other messengers that prophesie likewise, 21. He goeth himself thither, 22. And he prophesieth likewise, 23.
\p
\v 1 . Therefore Saul spake unto his son Jonathan, and to all his servants, to kill David: but Jonathan; Sauls son, took great delight in David.
\p
\v 2 . And Jonathan told David, saying, my father Saul seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thy self in the morning, [For Sauls’s Life-guard intended to kill him in the morning, ver.11. Oth. until morning; for in the mean while Jonathan had undertaken to speak unto Saul in David’s behalf, and to sift it out, whether Saul yet persisted in his wicked intent] and abide in (a) secret (place), and hide thy self.
\p
\v 3 . But I will go forth, and stand at my fathers hand on the field, [Oth. In the field] where thou shalt be, and I will speak of thee unto my father: and will see: [or, hearken, or, perceive] what it is, that I will tell thee.
\p
\v 4 . So then Jonathan spake good of David unto his Father Saul: and he said unto him, Let not the King sinne against his servant David, [viz. Doing him wrong, and pursuing him thus in a deadly manner] because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his actions are very good before thee.
\p
\v 5 . For he hath put his soul into his hand, [as if he should say, he hath adventured his life, and put himself in danger of death: see the like phrase chap.28.21. Judg.12.3.] and he hath smitten the Philistine, [Oth. the Philistines; see above chap.18.6.] and the LORD wrought great salvation (for) all Israel, thou sawest it, and thou didst rejoice: wherefore shouldest thou then sinne against innocent blood, killing David without a cause?
\p
\v 6 . Now Saul hearkened to the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, (as true as) the Lord liveth, he shall not be killed. [i.e. by my command: so that Saul here desisteth from his intention, ver.1. Heb. If he be killed: see the annotate. on Gen.14.23.]
\p
\v 7 . And Jonathan called David, and acquinted him with all these words: and Jonathan brought David unto Saul, and he was before his face as yesterday (and) ere yesterday. [i.e. He came to Court, and did his office, as he had done a foretime.]
\p
\v 8 . And there was war again: and David went forth, and fought against the Philistines, and he smote them with a great slaughter, and they fled before his face.
\p
\v 9 . But the evil spirit of the LORD was upon Saul, and he sat in his house, and his spear was in his hand: and David played with the hand upon a stringed instrument.
\p
\v 10 . Now Saul sought to thrust David thorow to the wall, [See above chap.18.11.] Bu he escaped from the face of Saul, that smote with the spear into the wall: then David fled, and escaped the same night.
\p
\v 11 . But Saul sent away messengers to Davids house, to watch him, and to kill him in the morning: [See above ver.2.] this Michal his wife made known to David, saying, If thou save not thy soul [i.e. thyself, thy person, thy life] this night, then thou shalt be killed in the morning.
\p
\v 12 . And Michal let David down thorow a window: [For the doors were beset with Sauls servants] and he fled, and went away, and escaped.
\p
\v 13 . And Michal took an image, [Heb. Teraphin; as below ver.16.] and she laid it in the bed, and she laid a goats skin at his head-pillow, [as if so be it had been David’s hair] and covered it close with a cloth.
\p
\v 14 . Now Saul sent messengers to fetch, [Otherwise, To apprehend. Heb. to take] David; she then said, he is sick.
\p
\v 15 . Then Saul sent messengers to see David, [i.e. To visit him; as if so be they out of love came to visit him, or see how he did, in his sickness. But they came chiefly to see if he were sick indeed, or whether he onely feigned himself sick, and in whatever condition he was, to take him along with them,] saying: Bring him up to me in the bed, that they may kill him.
\p
\v 16 . When the messengers came, then behold, there was an image in the bed, and there was a goat-skin at his head pillow.
\p
\v 17 . Then Saul said unto Michal, [viz. After Sauls messengers had told him, what had befallen them] Why hast thou deceived me? And hast let mine enemy go, that he is escaped? Now Michal said unto Saul, he said unto me, Let me go, why should I kill thee? [Inimating, that David had threatened to kill her, if she would not have let him go. See the like phrase, 2 Samuel 2.22.]
\p
\v 18 . So David fled, and escaped, and he came to Samuel at Rama, [viz. To ask counsel what he should do, and also because he thought he should be there more safe and secure then elsewhere, to wit, in the company of Samuel, and the other Prophets, who were safe & secure eating at Gibea, notwithstanding the Philistines had their garrison there, I Sam.10.10.] and he made known to him all that Saul had done to him; and he and Samuel went their ways, and they abode at Najoth. [This is a place where the Prophets had a Colledge or school, lying by Rama, where Samuel dwelt.]
\p
\v 19 . And it was told Saul, saying: Behold, David is at Najoth by Rama, [Thus is the Hebrew letter Beth plainly taken, Jos.5.13, &c.]
\p
\v 20 . Then Saul sent forth messengers to fetch David, [See above vers.14.] who saw [Heb. Saw, in the singular number; i.e. every one of them saw] an assembly of Prophets prophesying, [i.e. praising God, and magnifying his Name with prayers and hymnes] and Samuel standing, appointed over them: and the spirit of God was upon Sauls messengers, and they prophesied likewise; [i.e. they behaved themselves as the Prophets did when they prophesie. See above chap.18.10. It seemeth that these messengers of Saul were so altered in their mind and opinion. That putting off their armour, they thought no more of seizing Davids person, whereas they were sent out for that very intent.]
\p
\v 21 . When it was told Saul, then he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise: then Saul went on, and sent the third messengers, and they prophesied likewise.
\p
\v 22 . Afterward he himself also went to Rama, and he came to the great Well, which was at Socha, [see concerning this city the annotations on I Sam.17.1.] and he asked, and said, Where is Samuel and David? Then it was told him, Behold, they are at Najoth by Rama.
\p
\v 23 . Then went he hither to Najoth by Rama: and the same spirit of God was upon him also, and he going on prophecied, until he came to Najoth in Rama.
\p
\v 24 . And he himself stript off his cloaths also, [i.e. He put off his Royal Robe, or souldiers upper garment wherewith he was come to apprehend David] and he himself prophesied also before the face of Samuel, and he fell down [understand, that he fell as it were into an extasie, as it sometimes befell the Prophets: see Numb.24.4. or, he fell down as the other, stretching themselves thus together before the Lord] bare [or, naked. Understand this thus, that he stript himself of his Royal Robe, or upper garment, or of his souldiers coat: see the like, Isa.20.2. Mich.1.8.] that same whole day, and all the night: wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the Prophets? [see above chap. 10. on vers.12. Here this Proverb is applicable to those, who are wonderfully disappointed of God in their intention, as it befell Saul here. See the like History, Numb.23. and 24. in Bileam, and Act.9. in Saul]
\c 20
\s David complaineth to Jonathan of Saul, ver.1, &c. Jonathan comferteth David, and can hardly believe that Saul sought to kill him, 2. But David affirmeth it for a truth, 3. David desireth Jonathan to excuse his absence unto Saul, 5. Jonathan promiseth to give David notice, 9. Yea, he certifieth it with an oath, 13. He requireth the like kindness of David, 14. They renew the Covenant of friendship one with another, 16. Which David ratifieth with an oath, 17. They agree together, how Jonathan should discover to him his Fathers mind and purpose, 19. Saul asked for David at the feast of the new moon, 27. Jonathan excuseth David, 28. Saul incensed here at, revileth Jonathan, and endevoureth to kill him, 30. Jonathan advertiseth David, by shooting the arrows, 35. They part with much grief and teares one from another, 41.
\p
\v 1 . Then David fled from Najoth by Rama: [viz. When Saul being thus ravished in his spirit, prophesied, and abode a day and a night at Najoth] and he came, [Viz. to Gibea of Saul, where Jonathan then kept Court, being his Fathers Deputy] and said before the face of Jonathan, What have I done? What is mine offence, and what is my sinne before the face of thy father, that he seeketh my soul? [i.e. that he seeketh my life; as Mat.2.20]
\p
\v 2 . On the contrary he said unto him: God forbid, thou shalt not die, behold, ny father doth no great thing, nor small thing, which he revealeth not before mine ear. [See the annotate on Ruth chap 4.v.4. Good Jonathan was deceived in his opinion, having too good a conceit of his Father, who discovered not to him his will and intent against David] why then should my father hide this thing from me? [or, before me] that’s not (so).
\p
\v 3 . Then sware David further, and said, Thy Father knoweth very well, [Heb. Knowing knoweth] that I have found grace in thine eyes, therefore he said, [viz. with himself in his own heart; i.e. he thought] Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be troubled (at it): [Or, lest it grieve him} and surely (as true as) the LORD liveth, and thy soul liveth, there is but as it were a step between me, and between death. [i.e. I am assuredly in danger of death.]
\p
\v 4 . Now Jonathan said unto David: What thy soul [i.e. Desire; see Gen.34.ver.3.] saith, that I will do unto thee.
\p
\v 5 . And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, [On which day they were wont to feast; and to make merry together, after they had offered thank-offerings] that I should surely sit down. [Heb. that I sitting should sit; to wit, after the slay-offering that is kept; see Numb.10.10.] to eat with the King: therefore let me go, that I may hide me in the field unto the third evening. [i.e. give me leave to stay until the evening of the third day of the new Moon, then will I be in the field: but I will first go to Bethlehem, to keep there the Feast of the new Moon with my kindred: see v.19.35.]
\p
\v 6 . If thy father do certainly misse me; then thou shalt say, David had greatly desired [Heb. Desiring desired] of me, that he might run to his City Bethlehem, [i.e. to Bethlehem where he was born; as Job.7.42. see Genes.23.v.0. and chap.34.ver.10.] for there is a yearly offering [Heb. an offering of days; i.e. of a full and compleat year: see Lev.25.ver.29. namely, thank-offering, wherewith a feast was then kept: see the annotate. Above chap 9.v.2.] for the whole family.
\p
\v 7 . If he saith thus, It is good, then thy servant [i.e. I] hath peace: but if he be at all kindled, [Heb. being kindled, be kindled] then know that evil is fully determined by him.
\p
\v 8 . Shew then mercy to thy servant, [i.e. Do me this favour and kindness, that thou advertise, or give me notice betimes] for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thy self: but if there be an offence in me, then do thou kill me, why shouldest thou now bring me to thy father? [viz. to be put to death by him: as if he had said Thou thyself hast power to put me to death, if I have deserved it, without bringing me to thy father, to be put to death by him.]
\p
\v 9 . Then said Jonathan, Far be it from me, [viz. That thou shouldest be put to death] but if I knew certainly, that this evil were fully determined by my father, that it should come upon thee, would I not then make it known unto thee?
\p
\v 10 . Now then David said unto Jonathan, Who shall make it known to me, if thy father answer thee some hard thing? [viz. that he threatened to slay me, or the like. Oth. Who shall make (the good thing) known to me, or, if, &c.]
\p
\v 11 . Then said Jonathan unto David, Come, let us go forth into the field: and they went both forth into the field.
\p
\v 12 . And Jonathan said unto David, The LORD, the God of Israel, [Others, O Lord, God of Israel: and thus did Jonathan call upon God, to be witnesse of his sincerity] if I shall have sounded my father tomorrow about this time, (or) the day after tomorrow, [This was the second day after the new moon; for this communication of Jonathan with David, happened the day before the new moon, ver.5.] and behold, it is good for David, and I then send not unto thee, and reveal it before thine ear.
\p
\v 13 . Let the LORD do so unto Jonathan, and let him so adde thereunto! [See of this phrase, Ruth 1.17.] When evil towards thee pleaseth my father, [i.e. If I perceive that my father hath an intention to hurt thee] then will I discover it to thine ear, and I will let thee depart, that thou mayest go thy ways in peace: and th e LORD be with thee, [viz. when thou shalt be King after my Fathers decease. Hence may be gathered, that Jonathan well knew that David should be King, as being already anointed by Samuel. Jonathan was ready and willing to yield obedience to the Ordinance of God, although he was Sauls eldest son, and the next heir apparent to the Crown] according as he was with my father. [viz. when he blessed him, and gave him victory.]
\p
\v 14 . And wilt thou not, if I then yet live, [viz. When thou art King] yea wilt thou not shew me the kindnesse of the LORD, [i.e. a kindnesse that is acceptable and well-pleasing to the Lord: or, he meaneth the amity and servency which they had sworn one to another before the Lord] that I die not? [i.e. that thou put me not to death, suffering me to smart for the evil and mischief that my father intendeth towards thee]
\p
\v 15 . Also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from mine house [i.e. family, kindered, kinsmen,] for ever: neither, when the LORD shall have cut off from the earth, every one of the enemies of David.
\p
\v 16 . So Jonathan made (a covenant) with the house of David, [i.e. he renewed and ratified the covenant, formerly entred into with David, I Sam.18.3.] (saying) Let the LORD require it at the hand of Davids enemies of which number he should be accounted one, if he came to break the covenant. Some take it thus, that Jonathan here adjureth David, that God will require it at Davids hand if on his part he should break the covenant, naming Davids enemies, instead of David himself. Compare below chap.25.22. with the annotate. Some translate it thus: (But the Lord required it at the hand of Davids enemies) intimating that David indeed kept this covenant, as much as in him lay, but that God notwithstanding executed his just judgement upon Sauls house.]
\p
\v 17 . And Jonathan proceeded, in causing David to swear, [First Jonathan sware unto David, and vowed to protect him, vers.13. Now Jonathan requireth, that David would promise him, and satisfy his promise with an oath, that he will shew mercy and kindness both to him and his, when he should come to the King,] because he loved him: for he loved him with the love of his (own) soul. [i.e. he loved him so, as he did his own soul: i.e. he loved him so entirely as he did himself.]
\p
\v 18 . Afterward Jonathan said unto him, To morrow is the new Moon: then they will misse thee, for thy seat will be found empty.
\p
\v 19 . And when thou shall have tarried out the three days, come down quickly, [viz. from Bethlehem] and go to that place, where thou didst hide thy self in the day of this transaction; [viz. when I should speak to my father in thy befall. See above chap.19.2.] and tarry by the stone Ezel. Oth. by the stone that sheweth the way; i.e. a stone that standeth by the way-side, and sheweth the Traveller which way he must go: or, by the stone of going, i.e. whither thou and I are wont to go, when we have occasion to talk together in private.]
\p
\v 20 . Then will I shoot three arrows on the side (thereof,) as if I shot at a mark. [Oth. at the but]
\p
\v 21 . And behold, I will send the youth, (saying) Go thy ways, seek the arrows: [Heb. finde the arrows: i.e. seek the arrows till thou hast found them] if I say expressely [Heb. saying say] to the youth, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take him, [viz. the youth. Oth. take them, viz. the arrows] and come thou, for there is peace for thee, and there is nothing, [viz. in thy way, to hinder thee, or, that thou needest to be afraid] (as truly as) the LORD liveth.
\p
\v 22 . But if I say thus to the youth, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee: go thy ways, for the LORD set thee to go. [As if he should say, by these words, or by this token thou mayest know and gather, that it’s Gods will that thou shouldst for a while keep out of the way, and not come to Court.]
\p
\v 23 . And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of: behold, the LORD be [Viz: witness] between me, and between thee for ever.
\p
\v 24 . Now David hid himself in the field [viz. Till the appointed time, whereof mention is made above vers.5. and 10. During which time was affected that, which is related in the eleven following verses] and when it was new moon, the King sat at meat, [Heb. at the bread, as vers.27.] to eat.
\p
\v 25 . When the King had set him (down) his seat, at this time, as at other times, [Heb. as time in time, as Num.24.1. and Judg.6.20.] on the place by the wall, then Jonathan rose up, [viz. to give place to Abner, to let him sit above him, for Abner was Sauls Uncle, and besides Captain General] and Abner sat by Sauls side: And Davids place was found empty.
\p
\v 26 . And Saul spake nothing that day, [viz. of David; i.e. he asked not why David was not come to meal] for he said, [viz. with himself; i.e. he thought] Something hath be fallen him, [Heb. it is an accident] that he is not clean, [Many things are recorded in the Law, that made men unclean: See Levit.11.24. and 15.16. Now the unclean persons were forbidden to eat of the flesh which was offered up unto the Lord, Levit.7.19,20,21. Yea they were to obtain from the society of other men, that others by means of them might not be made unclean] surely he is not clean. [Understand withal, and therefore he is not come.]
\p
\v 27 . Now it came to passé the next day, the second (day) of the new moon, when Davids place was found empty, that Saul said unto his son Jonathan, Wherefore is the son of Isai [Thus he calleth David in a scornful and contemptible manner, not once thinking, that he himself was the son of Kiss] not come to meat, [Heb. to the bread, or, at meat, as above vers.24.] neither yesterday, nor to day. [Saul might well think, that David had great cause to tarry out of his sight, seeing Saul had sought to take away his life: But he thought that David would ascribe it to his madness or phrensie, and would not be afraid of him, seeing he was now come to his right senses again]
\p
\v 28 . And Jonathan answered Saul: David desired earnestly of me, that he might go to Bethlehem.
\p
\v 29 . And he said, Let me go, I pray thee, for our family hath an offering in the City, and my brother himself hath commanded me [viz. in my fathers name, whom I am bound to obey] (to do) it; now if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me I pray thee get away, that I may see my brethren, for this cause is he not come to the Kings table.
\p
\v 30 . Then Sauls anger kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse in Rebellion: [i.e. of a preserve Rebellious mother] do not I know, that thou hast chosen the son of Isai to thy shame, and to the shame of thy mothers nakedness? [As if Saul should say, doing thus, thou wilt not be held to be my legitimate son, but a bastard, whom thy mother hath conceived and brought forth out of wedlock or marriage estate.]
\p
\v 31 . For all the days that the son of Isai shall live on the earth, neither thou, nor thy Kingdom shall be established: now therefore send away, and fetch him unto me, for he is a child of death. [As if he should say, he is a dead man; i.e. he is worthy of death, he shall surely die. So it’s said, Ephes.2.2. children of wrath. See 2 Sam.12.5.]
\p
\v 32 . Then Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, wherefore shall he put to death? What hath he done?
\p
\v 33 . Then Saul shot the spear on him, [Oth. at, toward him,] to smite him: [even as he meant to have done to David] Thus Jonathan perceived, that this was fully determined by his father, to slay David.
\p
\v 34 . Wherefore Jonathan arose from the table inheat of anger: and he did eat no bread on the second day of the new moon, for he was troubled for David, because his father had done him shame.
\p
\v 35 . And it came to passé in the morning, [viz. On the third day of the new moon] that Jonathan went into the field, at the time which was appointed to David: [see above vers.19.] and there was a little youth with him.
\p
\v 36 . And he said unto his youth, Run, seek, [Heb. finde. See vers.21.] now the arrows, which I shall shoot: the youth ran his ways, and he [viz. Jonathan] shot one arrow, which he made to fly over him.
\p
\v 37 . When the youth was come to the place of the arrow, which Jonathan had shot: then Jonathan called after the youth, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?
\p
\v 38 . Again Jonathan called after the youth, haste thee, make speed, stand not still: now Jonathan youth took up the arrow, and he came to his Lord.
\p
\v 39 . But the youth, knew nothing of it: only Jonathan and David knew of the matter.
\p
\v 40 . Then Jonathan gave his furniture [Oth. artillery, armour: Heb. vessels; i.e. his bow, quiver, and arrows. With these Jonathan sent his youth to the City, that being alone, he might the more freely talk with David] to the youth that he had: and he said unto him, Go thy ways, carry them into the City.
\p
\v 41 . When the youth was gone away, then David arose from the south-side; [Understand here the South side of the field, wherein they were: or, the South-side of the stone, by which David had hid himself] and he fell on his face to the ground, and he bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, [Heb. the man his neighbour] and wept one with another, until David made it exceeding much. [Heb. until David made it great, viz.. with weeping.]
\p
\v 42 . Then said Jonathan unto David, Go in peace: that which we both have sworn in the Name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between thy seed, be for ever.
\p
\v 43 . Afterward he [viz. David] arose, and went his way: and Jonathan came into the City. [viz. at Gibea of Saul, where his house was, as may be gathered below, chap.23.18,19.]
\c 21
\s David seeing from Saul, cometh to Nob to Achimelech the Priest, vers. I, &c. He feigneth as if he had been sent by Saul to dispatch some secret business, 2. He asketh bread, 3. Achimelech giveth him the shew-bread loaves, 4. Doeg seeth this, 7. David asketh armes, 8. Achimelech giveth him Goliaths sword, 9. David fleeth and cometh to Achis, 10. He is not welcome to the Princes of Achis, 11. David is in great fear, 12. He changeth his behaviour, and meaneth himself, as if he were a fool, 13. Achis taketh it in ill part, that they had brought a fool to him, 14.
\p
\v 1 . Then came David to Nob [This was a City, pertaining to the Priests, not far from Anathoth, in the tribe of Benjamin, I Kings 2.26. Nehem.11.32. where at this time the Ark of the covenant was. Hence it came to passé that so many Priests were all together, as is related, chap.22.18.] to Achimelech the Priest: and Achimelech came trembling to meet David. [Heb. trembled to meet David. Compare above c.13.17. & 16.4.] and he said unto him, Why art thou alone, [Matth.12.3,4/ is mention made of David, and them that were with him: of whom it is said here, that David had made known to them some certain place: so that it seemeth that David came alone to the Priest] and no man with thee?
\p
\v 2 . And David said unto Achimelech the Priest, The King hath commanded me a business, and said unto me, Let no man know any thing, of the business where about I have sent thee, and which i have commanded thee: [This is a lie, proceeding from humane frailty, to conceal and hide the right cause of this flight. See Exod.1.19.] now I have made known to the young men, [i.e. the men, which were added to me by the King] the place of such a one. [Heb. Peloni Almoni. See Ruth.4.11. Oth. on the place of one so and so called.]
\p
\v 3 . And now what, [viz. of eatable ware, or of things fit to be eaten] is there under thine hand, give me five loaves in mine hand, or what there is found.
\p
\v 4 . And the Priest answered David, and said, There is no common [The word common is both here and elsewhere opposed to the word holy, or, hallowed] bread under mine hand: but there is holy bread, [Heb. bread of holinesse; i.e. holy bread: and so below vers.5. He speaketh here of the shew-bread loaves, here set before the Lord, and so hallowed unto the Lord, whereof no man might eat, but the Priests onely. See Exod. 25.30. and Levit. 24.5.] when the young men have at least kept themselves from women. Understand it from their lawful wives; for although marriage be honourable in all, and an undefiled bed, Heb. 13.4. yet by reason of mens weakness, is sin easily mixed therewith, therefore the Lord requireth that at certain and occasional times and seasons people should abstain from marriage-copulation or coming together. See Exod. 19.15. I Cor. 7.5. Understand withal, then I will give thee that.]
\p
\v 5 . Now David answered the Priest, and said unto him, Yea of a truth verily, the women have been kept from us yesterday, and ere yesterday, when I went forth; [As if David should say, we have been three days on the journey, and consequently so long time separated from our wives] and the vessels of the young men [i.e. their bodies, garments, and whatsoever they have taken along with the on the journey] are holy: [Holy signifieth in this place, not defiled, or polluted by touching any unclean thing] and it is in some manner common (bread,) should say, Thou needest not be so scrupulous, or make so great ado, to give me, and those that are with me, to eat of those loaves: for though they be holy as long as they stand upon the table before the Lord, yet seeing thou must now change them, and take them away, (or all must be taken away, and changed) and put new loaves in the room thereof (or, new be put in already:) therefore their holiness will not now be such as it was before, they lying before the face of the Lord, might be eaten of no man. Therefore according to the rule and Law of charity, (which is more then the ceremonies) others may also in time of need, and through want of other food, eat threof: as Christ hath expounded this Law, Matth. 12.4,7.] the rather because (other) will be hallowed in the vessels. [Of these vessels, see Exod. 25.29.]
\p
\v 6 . Then the Priest gave him that holy (bread,) because there was no bread, but the shew-bread (loaves,) which were taken away from before the face of the LORD, that they might lay warm bread [i.e. fresh, new-baked bread] there, in the day [viz. when the Sabbath-day came, as is there commanded, Levit. 24.8.] when that is taken away.
\p
\v 7 . Now there was that same day a man of the servants of Saul deteined [Or, having shut-up himself: Be it either in respect of the Sabbath, whereon he would rest there; or, because he would tarry there a while, for to worship; or, because he would perform some vow that he had made] before the face of the LORD, [viz. in the Tabernacle] and his name was Doeg, an Edomite: [viz. by birth, but by receiving and embracing the Jewish Religion, become a Proselyte. Oth. an Adomite; i.e. of the City Adama, lying in the tribe of Naphthali; Jos. 19.36.] the mightiest among the Shepheards, that Saul had.
\p
\v 8 . And David said unto Achimelech, Is (there) under thy hand no spear, or sword, for I have neither taken my sword in mine hand, nor also my weapons, because the Kings business required haste.
\p
\v 9 . Then said the Priest, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou smotest in the oak-valley, behold, that is (here) wrapt in a cloth, behind the Ephod, [So that it is kept and lockt up by, or with the Ephod in the Tent. Oth. after that the priest (Achimelech) had put on the Ephod, and had asked counsel of the Lord. See chap. 22.10, 13, 15. See the like phrase, Genes. 24.67. and Deut. 24.20,21.] if thou will take that for thy self, take it, for here is no other but that: Then said David, There is none like it, give it me.
\p
\v 10 . And David gat him up, and fled that day from the face of Saul: and he came to Achis [This King is, Psal. 34.1. called Abimelech. Achis wsa his proper name, but abimelecch a name common to all the Kings of the Philistines. See Genes. 20. vers. 21.26.] the King of Gath. [Lying in the Philistines Land; see I Sam. 5.8. and 17.1.]
\p
\v 11 . But the servants of Achis said unto him; Is not this David the King of the Land? [i.e. Governour or Ruler of the Israelitish Land, who hath married the Daughter of King Saul, and who is likely to be King after him] did they not sing of this (man) in the dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, but David his ten thousands?
\p
\v 12 . And David laid (up) these words in his heart, and he was much afraid before the face of Achis, the King of Gath: [See Psal. 34.]
\p
\v 13 . Wherefore he changed his behaviour [Heb. his Savour. As we perceive by the taste, whether the meat be good or bad, sweet or sower: So may we perceive by the behaviour or gestures, whether a man be wise or foolish, or good] before their eyes, and he feigned himself foolish among them: [i.e. when they had taken him, and led him to the King. See Psal. 34.and 36.1.] and he rabled on the doors of the gates. [Oth. he marked on the doors of the gates: i.e. he pictured, or made little scrawling on the doors, as if he had been simple or sottish] and he let his spittle run down into his beard.
\p
\v 14 . Then said Achis unto his servants: Behold, ye see that the man is frantick, wherefore have ye brought him to me?
\p
\v 15 . Have I need of mad (men;) that ye have brought this (man) to play the mad-man before me? [i.e. in my presence] shall this (fellow) come into my house?
\c 22
\s David being fled from the Philistines, cometh to Adullam: where his kindred and other oppressed people come to him, vers.1, &c. from thence he goeth to Mizpa in the Land of the Moabites, 3. Where with the leave of the King of the Moabites, they remain for a while, 4. But by the exhortation of the Prophet Gad, he returneth to the Land of Juda, 5. Which Saul coming to hear of, 6. He accuseth his servants, yea even Jonathan of secret compact with David, 7. Doeg revealeth to the King what he had heard and seen at Nob, 9. Wherefore Saul sentenceth the High Priest Achimelech, and all the rest of the Priests to be put to death, 17. Which Doeg performed, slaying fourscore and five Priests, 18. Saul causeth the City of Nob, with all that is in it, to be laid waste, 19. Only Abiathar the Priest remaineth alive, who fled unto David, 20. Who telleth him what had passed at Nob, 21. David confesseth, that himself was the cause of this murder and cabarnity, 22. And he taketh Abiathar into his protection, 23.
\p
\v 1 . Then David departed thence, and escaped into the cave of Adullam: [See the annotate. on Jos.12.15.] And his brethren heard it, and all his fathers house, and came down thither to him.
\p
\v 2 . And (there) assembled to him, every man that was distressed, [viz. by reason of poverty, or any other misery. Heb. every man to distresse] and every man that had a Creditor, [viz. that vexed him sore, and daily urged payment, contrary to the Law, Exod.22.25.] and every man whose Soul was bitterly grieved, [Heb. to whom the Soul was bitter. See the like phrase, I Sam.1.10. and 2 Kings 4.27.] and he became a Commander over them: so (there) were with him about four hundred men.
\p
\v 3 . And David went thence to Mizpa of the Moabites: [See of this City the annotate. on Judg.11.1.] and he said unto the King of the Moabites, [This King was Sauls enemy, as appeareth, I Sam. 14.48. Wherefore he the rather granted unto David a place of residence in his Land: As the Philistines also did, below chap.27. Others conceive, that David fled thither, because his grand fathers wife, viz. Obeds mother, was a Moabitish woman, hoping in that respect to finde more favour with the Moabites, then with other nations] Let I pray thee, my father, and my mother go out among you, [i.e. go out and in under your protection: dwell and converse among you for a while. Oth. go out you] till I know what God will do for me.
\p
\v 4 .And he brought them before the face of the King of the Moabites: and they remained with him all the days that David was in the hold. [Understand this of Mizpa of the Moabites, as v.3.]
\p
\v 5 . But the Prophet Gad, [This Prophet was much with David, as appeareth, 2 Sam. 24.11. and I Chro.21.9. and 2 Chron. 29.25. and elsewhere] said unto David, Abide not in the hold, go thy way, and go into the Land of Juda: then David departed, and he came into the forest of Chereth.
\p
\v 6 . And Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him: now Saul sat upon an hill, [Oth. in Gibea. Oth. in an high place] under the trees at Rama, and he had his spear in his hand, and all his servants stood by him.
\p
\v 7 . Then said Saul unto his servants that stood by him; Hear now, ye sons of Jemini: [See Judg.19. on vers.16.] will also the Son of Isa, [See above chap.20.27. As also below, vers.9.] give to you all fields and vineyards? will he make you all Commanders of thousands, and Commanders of hundreds?
\p
\v 8 . That ye have all combined against me, and no man revealeth (before) mine ear, [i.e. discovereth to me, or, maketh known: see Ruth 4.4.] that my son hath made a covenant with the son of Isai, [Saul speaketh this, either by guesse, because Jonathan spake in Davids behalf: or it was told him by some body, that Jonathan and David had entred into a covenant one with another, whereof mention is made above chap.18.3.] and there is none among you that is grieved for my sake, and that revealeth it (before) mine ear: for my son hath stirred up mu servant against me to (be) a lier in wait, as it is at this day. [This Saulspeaketh out of jealousie, the rather because David was come into the Land of Juda, with four hundred men, conceiving that he had secret intelligence with Jonathan]
\p
\v 9 . Then answered Doeg the Edomite, [Oth. Adomite. See above chap.21.7.] which stood by the servants of Saul, [Oth. and which was set over set over the servants of Saul] and said, I saw the son of Isai, [This courtlier flatterer speaketh just in the same language or stile as his Master Saul doth, vers.7. See likewise of Doeg, I Sam.21.7. and Psal.52. 1, 2, &c.] running to Nob, to Achimelech the son of Achitub: [Of Achitub mention is made above chap.14.3.]
\p
\v 10 . Who enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victual: he gave him also the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
\p
\v 11 . Then the King sent forth, to call Achimelech the Priest the son of Ahitub, [This Ahitub was the son of Pinehas the son of Eli: he had two sons; viz. Ahija, of whom mention is mae above chap.14.3. and Achimelech, of whom mention is made in this place] and all his fathers house, the Priests that were at Nob: and they came all to the King.
\p
\v 12 . And Saul said, hear now, thou son of Ahitub; and he said, Behold, (here) am I, my Lord:
\p
\v 13 . Then said Saul unto him, Why have ye combined together against me, thou, and the son of Isai? In that thou hast given him bread, and the sword, and enquired of God for him, that he should rise up against me, to be a lier in wait, as it is at this day.
\p
\v 14 . And Achimelech answered the King, and said; Who is now among all thy servants, (so) faithful as David, and the Kings son in Law, and going on in obedience of thee, [i.e. He goeth wither soever thou appointest, or sendest him. See above chap. 21.2. Achimelech knew no otherwise, then he speaketh here, when he gave David the shew bread and Goliaths sword] and is honourable in thine house?
\p
\v 15 . Did I today begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: [viz. That I should have conspired with David against thee: as Saul upbraided him, vers.13.] let not the King impute any thing [viz. any matter of conspiracy or rebellion against the King] unto thy servant, [i.e. unto me] (nor) to all the house of my father, for thy servant knew nothing of all these things, [viz. of any conspiracy or combining against the King, whereof mention is made, vers.8.] little nor great.
\p
\v 16 . But the King said: Achimelech, thou must die the death; [Heb. dying thou shalt die; as if he should say, I will straight-way command thee to be put to death] thou and all thy fathers house.
\p
\v 17 . And the King said unto the Guard, that stood by him, Turn your selves, and slay the Priests of the LORD, [Saul indeed passed wrong sentence against these Priests, and through his own wilfulness caused them to be put to death: Nevertheless, doing this, he fulfilleth that which the Lord in his just judgment had determined against the house of Eli. See above chap, 2.30.] because their hand is also with David, [i.e. Because they hold intelligence with David, and are co-partners with him in his disloyalty against me] and because they knew that he fled, and have not revealed it before mine ears: but the servants of the King would not put forth their hand, to fall upon the Priests of the LORD.
\p
\v 18 . Then said the King unto Doeg, Turn thou thy self, and fall upon the Priests: then Doeg the Edomite turned himself, and he fell upon the Priests, and slew that day fourscore and five men, that wore the linen Ephod. [i.e. that performed the service of God in the Tent: for when they performed that they were to put on linen garments. See Exod.28.42.]
\p
\v 19 . He smote also Nob the City of these Priests with the edge [Heb. mouth] of the sword, from the man to the woman, from the children to the suckling’s: even the oxen, and asses, and the sheep (he smote) with the edge of the sword.
\p
\v 20 . But one of the sons of Achimelech the son of Ahitub escaped, whose name was Abiathar: he fled after David. [He came to him at Kehila. I Sam.23.6.]
\p
\v 21 . And Abiathar reported to David, [viz. when he was come to David at Kehila] that Saul had slain the Priests of the LORD.
\p
\v 22 . Then said David to Abiathar, I knew well that day when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would assuredly make it known [Heb. relating would relate] to Saul. I have given cause against all the Souls [i.e. men, as Gen.14.21.] of thy fathers house. [As if David had said, I am the occasion of what hath come upon all the persons of thy fathers house: it was for my sake, but without my intent and purpose]
\p
\v 23 . Abide with me, fear not, for whosoever shall seek my Soul, the same shall seek thy Soul: but thou shalt be with me inn custody [i.e. God will preserve and keep us both: Or, I take thee unto my custody, (or, guard) with me: i.e. thou shall be with me, to keep the guard over the service and worship of God, and I will enquire of the Lord by thee in all concurrences: See I Sam.30.7.]
\c 23
\s David hearing that Kehila was besieged, vers. 1, &c. Relieveth it, and smiteth the Philistines, by Gods command, 2. Abiathar cometh thither unto David, bringing the Ephod with him, 6. Saul intended to enclose David there, and to take him, 7. Wherefore he assyeth to besiege Kehila, 8. David not confiding in those of Kehila, asketh counsel of the Lord by Abiathar, 9. The Lord acquinteth David, that those of Kehila were minded to deliver him up into the hands of Saul, 11. Wherefore he fleeth thence to the wilderness of Ziph, with those six hundred men that were with him, 13. Where Jonathan cometh to him, and reneweth the covenant of friendship with him, 16. And comforteth him, 17. Those of Ziph betray David unto Saul, 19. For which Saul thanketh them, 21. And exhorteth them diligently to heed all things, 22. He pursueth David with his camp in the wilderness of Maon, 25. Where he environeth him, 26. Saul receiveth tidings, that the Philistines had invaded his Land, 27. Whereby he is constrained to leave off from pursuing after David, 28.
\p
\v 1 . And they told David, [viz. When he was in the land of Juda, in the forest of Chereth, above chap. 22.5. That which is here described, came to pass before Abiathar came and fled to David, and brought him the sad news of the murder of the Priests, below ver.6. wherefore some translate the first words of this verse thus: Now David was told] saying: Behold, the Philistines fight against Kehila, [this city lay in the tribe of Juda, as appeareth Jos.15.44.] and they spoil the barns. [or, threshing-floor; i.e. the provision of corn that was gathered and laid upon the barns.]
\p
\v 2 . And David inquired of the LORD, [Either by the Prophet Gad, (who was with him I Sam.22.5.) or, by Abiathar, who came to David, when he went to Kehila, ver.6.] saying, shall I go forth and smite these Philistines? and the LORD said unto David, Go forth, and thou shalt smite the Philistines, and deliver Kehila.
\p
\v 3 . But Davids men said unto him, Behold, we are afraid [viz. Of Saul, who pursueth us as enemies] here in Juda: [viz, here in the forest of Cherith, where they were at that time, lying in Juda, above chap.22.5. Kehila lay also in Juda] how much more, [understand withal shall we be afraid, viz. when we shall have the Philistines before us, and Saul behind us, and so shall have two enemies to encounter withal, instead of one] when we shall go to Kehila against the Philistines Battalids.
\p
\v 4 . Then David enquired of the LORD yet further, [Heb. And David went on to enquire of the LORD. Understand this thus, that David enquired of the Lord the second time, not so much in regard of himself, as in regard of his souldiers. Which were timorous and fearful to go to Kehila] and the LORD answered him, and said, Get thee up, go down to Kehila, for I will give the Philistines into thine hand. [viz. before Saul shall be able to assault thee]
\p
\v 5 . So David and his men marched to Kehila, and he fought against the Philistines, and drove away their cattle, and he smote a great slaughter among them: so David delivered the inhabitants of Kehila.
\p
\v 6 . And it came to pass [Otherwise, It was come to passé] when Abiathar the son of Achimelech fled to David to Kehila: that he came down with the Ephod in his hand. [i.e. when he hastily fled, he took the Ephod along with him in his hand, wherein the Urim and the Thummim were, whereby they enquired of the Lord, Exod 28.30. Oth. That the Ephod came to him in his hand.]
\p
\v 7 . When it was made known to Saul, that David was come to Kehila; then said Saul, God hath delivered up [Heb. Properly aliened, estranged: that which is delivered up, is aliened or estranged] into mine hand, foe he is shut up, entering into a city with gates and bars. [Heb. a city of gates and bars: as if he should say, David thinking to be safe and secure in a fenced city, hath as it were imprisoned himself, for when I do encompass and besiege the City with an Army, he can no ways escape.]
\p
\v 8 . Then Saul caused all the people to be called to the battle: to go down to Kehila, to besiege David and his men.
\p
\v 9 . Now when David understood that Saul secretly intended [Oth. Forged] this evil against him, [intimating, that Saul continually plotted, practised, and laboured with all his senses night and day to mischieve and kill David] he said unto Abiathar the Priest, Bring hither the Ephod. [viz. with Breast-plate, and put it on, and ask counsel of the Lord for me by Urim and Thummim. See Numb.27.21.]
\p
\v 10 . And David said, LORD God of Israel, thy servant [i.e. I] hath certainly heared [Heb. hearing hath heard] that Saul seeketh to come to Kehila, and to destroy the city for my sake.
\p
\v 11 . Will the Citizens [Oth. The Lords: see Judg.92. in the annotate.] of Kehila also deliver me into his hand? will Saul come down [understand withal, If I tarry here, as appeareth ver.14.] according as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, make it known unto thy servant I pray thee! now the LORD said, he will come down.
\p
\v 12 . Then David said, Will the Citizens of Kehila deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver (thee) up. [viz. If thou abidest in this City within the walss thereof.]
\p
\v 13 . Then David and his men gat them up, about six hundred men, and they went out of Kehila, and they went whither they could go; when it was told Saul that David was escaped out of Kehila, then he forbare to go forth. [Intimating that Saul dismissed his souldiers, not pursuing David further with military power.]
\p
\v 14 . Now David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and he remained on the mountain in the wilderness of Ziph: and Saul sought him every day, [i.e. Continually from time to time, at least as long as David remained in the hold; for when David went to the Philistines, then Saul gave over seeking him, I Sam.27.4.] but God delivered him not into his hand.
\p
\v 15 . Then David saw [i.e. Came to hear, viz. by his spies, which he sent forth: or, by his friends which he had in Juda] that Saul was gone forth to seek his soul: then was David in the wilderness of Ziph in a forest.
\p
\v 16 . Then Jonathan the son of Saul gat him up, and he went to David into the forest: and he strengthened his hand in God, [i.e. He strengthened and comforted him, putting him in mind of the promises of God, as appeareth, v.17.]
\p
\v 17 . And he said unto him: Fear not, for the hand of Saul my father shall not send thee, but thou shalt be King over Israel, and I shall be the second with thee; [It seemed that David had promised his friend Jonathan this, when they entered into Covenant one with another. Heb. I shall be a second to thee, or, let me be the second next to thee] also my father Saul knoweth it well. [Samuel had sufficiently acquainted Saul herewith, above chap.15.28.]
\p
\v 18 . And they both made a covenant [i.e. They renewed the covenant which they had formerly made one with another, chap.18.3. & 20.16.] before the face of the LORD, [i.e. a firm covenant in the presence of the Lord Priest: or, they made a covenant, which they ratified with an oath, and whereunto they called upon God to be witness] and David abode in the forest, but Jonathan went to his house,
\p
\v 19 . Then went up Ziphites, [i.e. The inhabitants of Ziph: there were two cities so called: the one lay on the uttermost border of Juda Southward, whereof mention is made, Jos.15.24. The other lay more inward in the land about the wilderness of Moan; whereof see Jos.15.55. That is the Ziph, of which mention is made in this place, lying on a mountain. Below chap. 26,1. its said, that the Ziphites attempted the second time to deliver up David unto Saul. Now how David in this distress went to God for refuge, see Psal.54. which he at that time made] to Saul to Gibea, saying, Hath not David hid himself with us in the strong holds in the woods, [as if they should say, David hath certainly hid himself from us: see of such questions, Gen.13. v.9.] on the hill of Hachila, which is on the right hand of the wilderness [Oth. Which is on the South of Jesimon.]
\p
\v 20 . Now then, O King, come down speedily, [Heb. Coming down come down] according to all the desire of thy soul; and it becometh us [See this phrase Mich.3.1. with the annotate.] to deliver him into the Kings hand.
\p
\v 21 . Then said Saul, Blessed be ye to the LORD, [Thus he abuseth the holy Name of God, to put them on to a filthy and abominable treachery] in that ye have pitcht on me. [as if he would say, ye be the men, that deliver me out of the hand of David, who seeketh my destruction.]
\p
\v 22 . Go your ways, I pray you, and prepare (the matter) yet more, [See that all things be cunningly carried, and well ordered, that he may not slip away from us] know and see his place where his haunt is, [Heb. foot. i.e. where he hides himself, or makes his abode, where he commonly hath his haunt, and dog him there close] who hath seen him there; for he [viz. David himself when he was yet with me, and I asked him how he came to be so successful in war] told me, that he was wont to deal very cunningly. [Heb. that he dealing cunningly, dealt cunningly, or, used crast and subtilty]
\p
\v 23 . Therefore look to (it), and enquire after all lurking places wherein he lurketh, then come to me again with sure notice, then will I go with you; and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Juda.
\p
\v 24 . Then they gat up, and they went to Ziph, before the face of Saul, now David and his men were in the wilderness of Moan, in the plain field, on the right hand of the wilderness.
\p
\v 25 . Saul and his men went also to seek: that was told David, who was gone down from that rock, [viz. From the hill of Hachila in the wilderness, where he had hid himself: from thence he went where he had more scope or room, namely into the wilderness of Moan, vers.19. where he could better get away, when Saul chased and pursued after him] and abode in the wilderness of Moan: [see the annotate. on Jos.15.55.] when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Moan.
\p
\v 26 . And Saul went on the other side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain: now it came to pass that David made haste to get away from the face of Saul, and Saul and his men encompassed David and his men round about, to take them.
\p
\v 27 . But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying: Make haste, and come, for the Philistines have invaded the land, [Or, Have spread themselves in the land.]
\p
\v 28 . Then Saul returned from pursuing after David, and he went to meet the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela Mach lekoth. [Or, Sela Hammach lekoth; i.e. Rock of divisions, which was so called, because Saul was constrained to divide his men, and to leave David, for to pursue after the Philistines, or to resist them.]
\c 24
\s Saul having heard that David was by Engedi, pursueth him there, ver. I, &c. Cometh into a cave, in which David was with his men, who cutteth off the skirt of Sauls mantle, but will not lay hand on him, 4. Evidenceth thereby his innocency and integrity towards Saul, after whom he goeth, and communeth with him, 9. Saul is moved thereat, confesseth his fault, and taketh an oath of David, 17.
\p
\v 1 . And David went up from thence, [viz. From the wilderness of Moan, where Saul thought to take him, as was said chap 23.25.] and he abode in the strong holds of En-geli. [Oth. called Hazazon-Thamar, Gen.14.7. & 2 Chron. 20.3. It’s a city lying in the tribe of Juda, at the salt or dead sea southward, between high mountains and rocks, in the midst whereof are many fair and pleasant valleys and fields, planted with manifold goodly trees, as palm-trees, and the like: also there growth much balsam, &c.]
\p
\v 2 . And it came to pass after that Saul was returned from after the Philistines: [i.e. From pursuing the Philistines that invaded his land while he pursued David, above chap.23.27.] that they told him, saying: Behold, David is in the wildernesse of Engedi.
\p
\v 3 . Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel: and he went his way, to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats. [i.e. In the high and steep rocks, upon which those goats, (or wild goats) do climbe and leap.]
\p
\v 4 . And he came to the sheep-coats [Oth. To Gidreth Zon] on the way, where was a cave: Saul went in thither, to cover his feet: [i.e. To ease nature: see of this phrase, Judg.3.24.] now David and his men sat at the sides of the cave.
\p
\v 5 . Then said Davids men unto him: Behold, the day (in) which the LORD saith to thee, Behold, I give thine enemy into thine hand, [i.e. The Lord giveth thee even now so fit an opportunity to slay thine enemy, a if he spake unto thee, Behold, I give thine enemy into thine hand. Oth. of which the Lord said unto thee] and thou shalt do to him according as it shall be good in thine eyes: and David arose, and cut softly [or, handsomely, neatly] a skirt of Sauls mantle.
\p
\v 6 . But it came to pass afterward, that Davids heart smote him: [Fearing, that he had offended God, in offering this design to the King. Compare 2 Sam.24.10.] because he had cut off Sauls skirt.
\p
\v 7 . And he said unto his men, The LORD be far from me, that I should do that thing [viz. That which ye advise me to do] to my Lord the LORDS anointed, [i.e. who by the command of the Lord is anointed King over Israel] that I should put forth, [or, stretch forth, lay hold on him] mine hang against him; for he is the LORDS anointed.
\p
\v 8 . And David parted his men [Heb. Clave, or, divided his men; i.e. David rent or divided his men; i.e. David rent or divided, and destroyed the combination of his souldiers that were ready to kill Saul: or when his men coming forth from both sides of the cave, intended to fall upon Saul, then he kept them on both sides asunder one from another] with words, and suffered them not to rise up against Saul: and Saul gat him up out of the cave, and went on the way. [or, went his way.]
\p
\v 9 . Afterward David also gat him up, and went out of the cave, and he cried after Saul, saying: My Lord (the) King: Then Saul looked behind him, and David bowed himself with his face to the ground, [In token of subjection] and loved himself.
\p
\v 10 . And David said unto Saul, Wherefore hearest thou the words of men, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt! [i.e. thy ruine and destruction.]
\p
\v 11 . Behold, this day thine eyes have seen, that the LORD hath given thee to day into mine hand in this cave, [See above ver.5.] and they said [i.e. some of those that were with me, counselled me, that, &c.] that I should kill thee, [Heb. to kill thee] but (mine hand) spared thee: [Heb. they spared thee, viz. mine hand, or my soul, or mine eye, or my sword,] for I said I will not put forth mine hand against my Lord, for he is the LORDS anointed.
\p
\v 12 . Behold, now my father, [He seeketh by this loving compellation to move Saul to desist from his wicked intent] yea behold the skirt of thy mantle in mine hand, for when I cut off the skirt of thy mantle, then I killed thee not; acknowledge and say there is no evil nor transgression on mine hand, [i.e. that I thought nor imagined no hurt or mischief in mine heart against thy person, nor purposed to do with mine hand against thee] and I have not sinned against thee: yet thou huntest (after) my soul, [viz. as huntsmen search after wild beasts, chasing the through woods, and in the plain field, over hedge and ditch, over mountains and dales: see above ver.3. and chap.26.20.] to take it away.
\p
\v 13 . The LORD shall judge between me and between thee, and the LORD shall avenge me on thee: but mine hand shall not be against thee.
\p
\v 14 . According s the Proverb of the Ancients saith, [Heb. According to the Proverb of the Ancient: i.e. of the Ancients who lived long before this time] Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be against thee. [as if he should say, Thou needest not to be afraid of me, I will not lay mine hands on thee: wicked men do perform such wicked actions: godly men do not avenge themselves, but they commit the vengeance unto God: so will I do in like manner, I will not defile mine hands with the Kings blood.]
\p
\v 15 . After whom is the King of Israel gone forth? after whom doest thou pursue? after a dead dog? after a dead flea? [As if David should say, ’tis not worth the labour, nor honour enough, that a King of Israel should take such pains, to pursue me with so many men, whereas I can neither bite nor hurt, having no more strength nor power then a dead dog or poor flea: see the like phrase below, chap.26.20.]
\p
\v 16 . But the LORD shall be Judge, and judge between me and between thee, and see therein, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.
\p
\v 17 . And it came to pass when David had made an end of speaking all these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? then Saul lift up his voice, and wept.
\p
\v 18 . And he said unto David, Thou art more righteous then I: for thou hast rewarded me good, and I have rewarded thee evil.
\p
\v 19 . And thou hast shewed me this gay, that thou hast done me good: for the LORD had shut me up in thine hand, and thou hast not killed me.
\p
\v 20 . Whensoever any man hath found his enemy, will be let him go upon a good way? [i.e. Will he let him go without doing him any hurt?] now the LORD reward thee good, for this day [in which thou hast saved my life. Compare the phrase with Psal.118.24.] which thou hast made me to day.
\p
\v 21 . And now, behold, I know that thou shalt surely be King, [Heb. Being King shalt be King] and that the Kingdome of Israelshall remain firm and stedfast, and be perpetual] in thine hand.
\p
\v 22 . So then swear unto me now by the LORD, If thou shalt root out my seed after me; and shalt destroy my name from my fathers house! [This is a kind of oath, or manner of swearing; see Gen.14.22,23.]
\p
\v 23 . Then David sware unto Saul; and Saul went to his house; but David and his men went up into the strong hold. [For he durst not yet trust Saul, because he had sufficiently experienced his inconstancy, in the reconciliation which herefore he had made with him, chap.19. also Saul after this returned to his former prosecution, or pursuing of David.]
\c 25
\s Samuel dieth: David goeth to the wilderness of Paran, v. 1 &c. Nahals riches, 2. His and his wife Abigails nature and condition, 3. David requesteth most courtesly of Nabal some relief for his camp, 4. But Nabal entreateth the messengers of David scornfully and disdainfully, 10. Which they tell David of, 12. Who was so moved thereat, that he threatened to destroy Nabal with all his family, 13. Abigail having heard this, goeth speedily to meet David, and pacifieth his anger by moving arguments and presents, 14. Nabal, hearing this, is troubled, and dieth, 37. David taketh Abigail, and Achinoam to wives, 39.
\p
\v 1 . And Samuel died, and all Israel gathered themselves together, and they mourned for him, and buried him in his house at Rama: and David gat him up, and went down to the wilderness of Paran. [As long as Samuel lived. David sought to him for comfort and counsel, therefore he abode as near to him as he could or might do: But when Samuel was dead, David departed to the wilderness of Paran, which lieth on the south side of Canaan. See concerning Paran the annotations on Genes.14.6.]
\p
\v 2 . And there was a man at Maon, [Concerning this place, lying in the tribe of Juda, see the annotate. on Jos.15.55.] and his occupation was at Carmel, [This mountain, with the city and country, is to be distinguished from the other lying in the tribe of Issaschar, renowned in respect of the Prophet Elia: see I King.18. on verse 19.and above chap.15. on ver.12.] and that man was very great, [i.e. rich, wealthy, great in power; as 2 Sam.19.32.] and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was at the shearing of his sheep at Carmel.
\p
\v 3 . And the name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife was Abigail; he the woman was good of understanding, and beautiful of countenance; but the man was churlish, and evil of doings, and he was a Calebite. [i.e. (as it is thought) of Calebs posterity. Compare below chap.30.14. with the annotat.]
\p
\v 4 . When David heard in the wilderness, that Nabal did shear his sheep;
\p
\v 5 . Then David sent ten young men; and David said to the young men, Go up to Carmel, and when ye come to Nabal then shall ye ask him in my name, touching the welfare. [Heb. Touching the peace; i.e. ask how he doeth, whether he be in good plight.]
\p
\v 6 . And shall say thus to that prosperous (man) [Heb. Living; i.e. that liveth merrily or prosperously. Compare the salutation used toward Kings: let the King live, I Sam.10.24, &c.] Peace be to thee [Heb. thou peace; i.e. to thee be peace; as 2 Sam. 17.3. & 20.9.] and peace be to thine house, and peace be to all that thou hast.
\p
\v 7 . And now, I have heard, that thou hast shearers: Now the shepherds which thou hast, were with us, we offered them no disgrace, [Or, Scorned them not, made them not ashamed] neither missed they any thing [i.e. in the tale and number of their sheep that were committed to their trust and keeping, there was not any one missing or wanting, which they needed to have sought after: so also below, vers. 15, and 21.] all the days that they were at Carmel.
\p
\v 8 . Ask thy young men, [i.e. Thy shepherds and servants that were with thy sheep] and they will tell thee; let then these young men find grace in thine eyes, [They relate Davids words, therefore they spake of themselves, as of a third person, as if they should say, Let us, who are the young men or servants of David, and sent by him to thee, find grace and favour with thee] for we are come on a good day; [i.e. on a merry day, because thou doest now receive and gather the wooll of thy sheep: it is therefore just and equal, that thou out of thy superfluity abd abundance shouldest communicate something to the distressed and persecuted ones, according to the law, Deut.12.12. & 14.26,29. & 15.7.] give, I pray thee, unto thy servants, and thy son David, [as if he should say, who honoureth thee, as a son doth his father] that which thine hand shall find. [i.e. any Present or gift, as much, and whatever thou art pleased to give us. See Judg.9. on ver.33.]
\p
\v 9 . When Davids young men were come, and in Davids name had spoken unto Nabal according to all those words, then they ceased, [Heb. they rested; i.e. they kept their peace, and were silent, to hear what Nabal should answer.]
\p
\v 10 . And Nabal answered Davids servants, and said, Who is David, and who is the son of Isai? There be to day many servants that rent themselves every one from his lord. [i.e. That ran away from, and forsook their lords or masters. Thus doth he upbraid David, as if he lifted himself up against his lord and master Saul.]
\p
\v 11 . Should I then take my bread, and my water, [In that country water was hard to come by, for that the land where Nabal dwelt was dry land; so that for and in respect of water, there often happened strife and contention in those parts. See Gen.21.25. & chap.26.15.] and my killed (flesh), which I have killed [Heb. my slaying which I have slain] for my shearers, and should I give it to the men whom I know not whence they be?
\p
\v 12 . Then Davids young men turned them to their way; and they returned, and came, and told him, [viz. David] according to all these words.
\p
\v 13 . Then David said unto his men, Every man gird on his sword, and David also girded on his sword: and they marched up after David, about four hundred men, and there remained two hundred by the stuff. [Heb. Vessels. i.e. stuff, baggage, loading, carriage; as above chap.17. vers.22.]
\p
\v 14 . But one young man of the young men [viz. One of Nabals servants] told Abigail, Nabals wife, of it, saying, Behold, David hath sent messengers out of the wilderness to bless [i.e. to salute, and to wish much happiness; as Gen. 31.55.] our lord, but he railed on them. [The Hebrew word that is here used, is by similitude taken from a bird of prey, that violently and swiftly falleth upon a carcase, to rent it in pieces: so, he would say, hat Nabal treated and sent away Davids messengers with biting and spiteful words, snarling at them, as if he would have bitten them in pieces.]
\p
\v 15 . Yet they were very good men to us, and we suffered no disgrace, and we missed nothing all the days (that) we conversed with them, when we were in the field.
\p
\v 16 . They were a wall about us, [As if he should say, They have not onely not hurt or mischieved us themselves, but they have likewise kept and protected us from others, both thieves and wild beasts, that might have done us hurt or mischief] both by night and by day, all the days, that we were with them, feeding the sheep.
\p
\v 17 . Now then know, and see what thou wilt do, for evil is fully determined against our Lord, and against all his house, and he is a son of Belial, [see Deut.13. on verse 13.] that a man cannot speak to him.
\p
\v 18 . Then Abigail made hast, and took two hundred loaves, and two lether sacks of wine, and five dressed [Heb. Made] sheep, and five measures [Heb. Seim. See Gen.18. on ver.6.] of parched corn, and a hundred pieces of raisins, and two hundred lumps of figs, and laid them on Asses.
\p
\v 19 . And she said to her young men, Go your wayes before my face, behold, I come after you; but she made it not known to her husband Nabal.
\p
\v 20 . Now it came to pass when she rode on the asse, and that she came down into the hidden (place) of the mountain, and behold, David and his men came down to meet her, and she met them. [The text intimateth, that David and Abigail met one another unawares, the one coming from this, and the other from that side of the hill or mountain.]
\p
\v 21 . Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this (fellow) [viz. Nabal. He counteth him not worthy to call him by his name, because of the great incivility and unthankfulnesse, which he used towards him.] hath in the wilderness, so that nothing is lacking of all that he hath: and he hath recompensed me evil for good.
\p
\v 22 . Let God do so to the enemies of David, and let him so adde thereunto, [i.e. God grant that all Davids enemies may fare so, as I intend to do to this Nabal: Although some conceive that David instead of saying, God do this or that to me, wished the evil to befall his enemies, which some are wont to wish to themselves, by rashly cursing themselves See the annotat. on Ruth I.17. concerning this phrase, and compare ch.2.on v.16.] if of all those that he hath [or, if of all that he hath] I leave until morning (him) that pisseth, against the wall? [a phrase, or manner of speaking, whereby is implied a total ruine and destruction of a house, so that no man be left, or escape, not so much as a dog that commonly pisseth against that wall: so also v.34. & I King.14.10. & 2 King.9.8.]
\p
\v 23 . Now when Abigail saw David, then she made hast, and lighted off the asse; and she fell on her face before the face of David, and she bowed her self to the ground,
\p
\v 24 . And she fell at his feet, [In token of humble reverence: see the like, 2 King.4.27.] and said, Ah my Lord, let the offence be mine, [as if she had said, punish me instead of mine husband, and all the rest, which thou didst intend to punish] and let, I pray thee, thine handmaid [i.e. me] speak before tine ears, and hear the words of thine hand-maid.
\p
\v 25 . Let not my Lord, I pray thee, set his heart on this man of Belial, on Nabal, for as his name is, so is he, he is Nabal, [i.e. Fool, sot; one that is void of wisdom and goodness] and folly is with him: and I thine had-maid have not seen the young men of my Lord, [i.e. thy] which thou didst send.
\p
\v 26 . And now, my LORD, (as true as) the LORD liveth, and thy soul liveth, [See 2 King 2 on v 2] it is the LORD that hath hindered thee [viz. When he sent me to meet thee, to pacify thine anger with courteous words and presents, and to stop and hinder thine evil intent and purpose ] from coming with blood-shed, [Heb. With bloods; as Gen. 4. 10. And here below ver. 33.] that thine hand should deliver thee: [viz. So that thou canst not avenge thy self with thine own hand against my wicked husband, and deliver thy self from the affront that he hath offered thee] and now let thine enemies may prevail as little, and may be as base and contemptible men as Nabal is, who is not worthy that thou shouldest thus vex thy self about him, much less that thou shouldest destroy me, and my whole family, for his sake. Others understand those words thus, I wish it may befall thine enemies as it would befall Nabal, if thou shouldest persevere in thine intent] and they that seek evil against my Lord.
\p
\v 27 . And now this is the blessing, [i.e. This is the gift or Present, which thou by thy servants sent by thee, didst ask for Nabal, above ver. 8.] which thine hand maid hath brought unto my Lord: let it be given to the young men, that walk after my Lords foot-steps. [Heb. That go by, or, at my Lord’s feet; i.e. that follow him].
\p
\v 28 . Forgive, I pray thee, thine hand-maid the transgression: [As if he should say, I take the punishment of my wicked husband upon my self, only pardon me, I pray thee] for the LORD will surely make my Lord a stedfast house, [i.e. that thou shalt dwell and reign quietly and peaceably, and shall no longer need to flee from one place to another, as thou art fain to do] because my Lord warreth the LORDS wars, [see the annotate above chap. 18 ver. 17] and no evil hath bee found with thee from thy days. [this is here properly to be meant of desire of self-revenge, or other great transgressions; as if she should say, in this respect I hope they will not begin now to do it.]
\p
\v 29 . When a man shall rise up to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul; then shall the soul of my lord be bound in the bundle of the living with the LORD thy God, [This is a phrase taken from men, who bid the thing which they count precious, and desire to keep safe , in a bundle, and lock it up. It is as if she had said, thy life shalt be in the Almighties keeping, Saul shall pursue thee in vain.] but the Soul of thine enemies he shall sling out of [or, in, viz. Being as if the soul, like a stone, lay in the sling] the midst of the hollowness of the sling. [on the contrary shall those wicked ones that pursue thee, be scattered and slung away, as if they were thrown out with a sling, and cast away.]
\p
\v 30 . And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall do to my Lord, according to all the good which he hath spoken concerning thee, and he shall command thee to be a Leader over Israel:
\p
\v 31 . Then shall this be no stumbling nor offence of heart unto thee, my Lord, to wit, that thou shouldest have shed blood causle sly, and that my Lord should have delivered himself. [As if she had said, then shalt thou neither have a gnawing conscience, or grief of mid, that thou hast avenged thyself with the shedding of innocent blood] and when the LORD shall do well unto my Lord, then thou shalt remember thine hand-maid. [as if he should say, When thou shalt hereafter think on this, that I have been the means or instrument to stop and hinder thee fro shedding innocent blood, then thou wilt yet thank me for it.]
\p
\v 32 . Then said David unto Abigail: Blessed be the LORD the God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me.
\p
\v 33 . And blessed be thy counsel, [viz. The counsel which thou halt taken, for to disswade and hinder me by this thy coming and courtesy from shedding innocent blood] and blessed be thou, that thou this day hast stopt and prevented me from coming with blood-shed, [as above verse 26.] that mine hand should have delivered me.
\p
\v 34 . For surely’tis (as true as) the LORD the God of Israel liveth, which hath hindered me doing thee harm: [Understand withal, and all thy family, as I rashly sware in mine wrath, v. 22.] that unless thou hadst made haste, and hadst come to me, there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any one that pisseth against the wall.
\p
\v 35 . Then David took from out of her hand that which she had brought him; ad he said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house, behold, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy face. [i.e. I have taken thee into favour, and will do what thou requires: See the annotate. On Gen. 19. 21. & 31. 20.]
\p
\v 36 . When Abigail now came to Nabal, behold, he had then a feast in house, like the feast of a King, [See the like, 2 Sam. 13. 23. Nabal did like that rich man, Luke 16. 19. Forgetting the poor and needy people,] and Nabals heart was merry [Heb. Good] at the same, [viz. Feast. Oth. In him] and he was very drunk: therefore she made not a word known to him, little nor great, until the morning light.
\p
\v 37 . Now it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone from Nabal, [When he had slept his drunkenness quite away. As long as he continued in his drunkness, her admonitions would have been as roses strowed before Hogs, or Pearls cast before Swine.] then hsi wife made those words [viz. Which she had spoken, what she had said unto David, what David had answered her again, etc] known to him: then his heart died in the innermost (parts) of him, [i.e. he was so affrighted, that he almost fell down dead] and he became as a stone. [Heb. He became a stone, i.e. he became senseless, was without feeling, his blood changed in his body, when he heard of the danger, into which he had brought himself.]
\p
\v 38 . And it to pass about ten days (after) that the LORD smote Nabal that he died.
\p
\v 39 . When David heard that Nabal was dead, then he said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath with held [oth. Kept back] his servant [i.e. me] from evil, [Or, from that evil dead, viz. That I should have shed innocent blood out of a desire of self-revenge] and (that) the LORD hath caused the wickedness of Nabal to return upon his own head: and David sent forth, and caused to commune [viz. By his messengers or ambassadors, and after that Nabal had been dead a good while] with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.
\p
\v 40 . Now when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel: there they spake unto her, saying, David hath sent us unto thee: to take thee to him to wife.
\p
\v 41 . Then she arose, and bowed her self with the ace to the ground: and she said, [viz. Unto David, though absent, desiring his messengers to relate these words of hors unto him, and to tell David in her name] Behold, let thine hand-maid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my Lord. [i.e. to do the meanest and lowest service.]
\p
\v 42 . Abigail now made haste, and gat up, and rode upon an Ass with her five young –maidens, that walked after her foot-steps: [Oth. That followed her feet, or, went after her] she then followed after Davids messengers, and she became his wife.
\p
\v 43 . David also took Achinoam of Jizreel :[ This was a City in the tribe of Juda , as appeareth, Jos. 15. 56.] thus were they both also his wives.
\p
\v 44 . For Saul had given Michal his Daughter, Davids wife to Palti [He is called Palthiel, 2 Sam. 3. 15.] the son of Lais, [In this act there sinned and did ill, Saul, Michl, ad Palti, breaking and violating the lawful marriage of Michal with David, ] who was of Gallim. [This seemeth to have layen in the tribe of Benjamin, not far from Gibea of Saul, see Isai. 10. 30.]
\c 26
\s Saul having intelligence, by means of the Ziphites, where David was, seeketh him, vers. 1, etc. David coming to hear of it, spieth out Sauls camping place, and taketh away his spear, and water cup, or bottle; but will not suffer him to be hurt, 4. After that upbraideth Abner with his negligence, 13. Admonisheth Saul, 18. Who acknowledgeth his own fault, and Davids innocence, 21. They part in friendship, 25.
\p
\v 1 . The Ziphites now came the second treachery of the first is described, chap. 23. 19.] Doth not David hide himself on the hill of Hachila, before the wilderness? [As if they should say, yea certainly he is come again to us, and hideth himself on, etc.]
\p
\v 2 . Then Saul gat up, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, and three thousand chosen men of Israel with him: to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
\p
\v 3 . And Saul camped himself on the hill of Hachila, which is before the wilderness by the way, but David abode in the wilderness, and saw that Saul came after him to the wilderness.
\p
\v 4 . For David had sent spies, and he understood that Saul came of a certain.
\p
\v 5 . And David gat up, and came to the place where Saul had camped himself, and David viewed the place where Saul lay, with Abner the so of Ner, the Commander of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, [See the annotate. Above chap. 17. 20.] and the people [Others the souldiers, men of war] were camped round about him.
\p
\v 6 . Then answered [i.e. spake, for there goeth no question before] David, and spake unto Achimeth the Hethite, [viz. By descent, but by Religion an Israelite or Proselite. They are properly called Hethites, that descended from Heth, the son of Canaan: See Genes. 10. 16. And 15. 20.] and to Abisai the son of Zeruja, [This was Davids sister, she had three sons, viz. Joab, Abisai, and Asahel, who from the mother are called the sons of Zeruja, here, and 1 Chron. 2. 16. In respect of David fame or renown: but no mention is made of their father] the brother of Joab, saying, who will go down with me to Saul into the Camp? Then said Abisai, I will go down with thee.
\p
\v 7 . Thus David ad Abisai came to the people [viz. In the camp of Saul] by night, and behold, Saul lay sleeping in the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his head-end, and Abner, and the people lay round about.
\p
\v 8 . Then said Abisai unto David: God hath shut up thine enemy in thine hand this day: let me now, I pray thee, smite him with the first] and I will not do it to him the second time. [As if he should say, I’le be sure so to hit him at the first blow, that I shall surely kill him out right, and shall not need to smite him the second time.]
\p
\v 9 . David on the contrary said unto Abisai: Destroy him not: [i.e. do not kill him] for who hath laid his hand on the LORDS anointed, [See above chap. 24. 7. In the anotat.] and remained guiltless? [i.e. unpunished]
\p
\v 10 . Moreover, David said, (As true as) the LORD liveth; [Understand withal, I will not suffer it] but the Lord do with him, what pleaseth him; as for me, I’le not lay my hand on him] or his day shall come, [i.e. the time that God hath limited and appointed him to die his natural death. See Job 15. On vers. 34.] or he shall into battle, that he may perish.
\p
\v 11 . The LORD let it be far from me, that I should lay mine hand [Heb. From laying mine hand.] on the LORDS anointed: take therefore now, I pray thee, the spear that is at his head-end, and the water bottle, and let us go.
\p
\v 12 . So David took the spear, and the water bottle from Saul’s head-end, and they went their way; and there was no man that saw it, and no man that heeded it, also no man that awaked, for they were all asleep, for there was a deep sleep of the LORD fallen upon them. [i.e. a deep sleep sent from God.]
\p
\v 13 . When David was come over on the other side, then he stood on the top [Heb. On the head] of the mountain afar off: (so) that there was a great place (or space) between them.
\p
\v 14 . And David cried to the people, [viz. To Saul’s soldiers] and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Wilt thou not answer, Abner? Then answered Abner, and said, Who art thou that criest to the King? [As if he should say, Who art thou, that thus criest, roarest, that thou even sparest not the King himself, but awakes him also out of his sleep?]
\p
\v 15 . Then said David unto Abner, Art thou not a man? [This question affirmeth, as elsewhere besides. As if he should say, Abner, thou art indeed a stout man, a champion, valiant and courageous] and who is like to thee in Israel? [As if he had said, no man is like to thee in strength, and valour] wherefore then hast thou kept guard over thy Lord the King? For there came one of the people to destroy thy Lord the King.
\p
\v 16 . This thing which thou hast done is not good, (as true as) the LORD liveth ye are children of death, [i.e. ye have deserved death] who have not kept a guard over your Lord the kind: and now behold, where the Kings spear is, and the water-bottle, which was at his head-ed.
\p
\v 17 . Now Saul knew Davids voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? David said, It is my voice, my Lord, (O) King.
\p
\v 18 . He said further, Wherefore doth my Lord thus pursue after his servant, [i.e. me] for what have I done ? what evil is there in mine hand? [i.e. what evil have I done. See the annotate. Above chap. 24. Vers. 12.]
\p
\v 19 . And now, my Lord the King, hearken, I pray thee to the words of thy servant: if the LORD stir thee up against me [viz. By his command, or special ordering] let him smell the meat-offering. Some do understand this thus: If God hath commanded thee to do this, then he will accept thy meat offering. Others thus: then will I appease the Lord with sacrifice for the sin, whereby I have deserved it] but if they be the children of men, then cursed be they before the face of the LORD, because they drive me out this day, that I cannot abide firmly fixed in the inheritance of the LORD, [i.e. with the people of the Lord, which are as Dear unto him, as an inheritance can be to any man whatsoever. The meaning of the words is this, so that I cannot constantly dwell where the service and worship of God is performed, but am constrained continually to serve about, and to flee from place to place] saying, Go thy way, serve other Gods. [i.e. they move me as much as in them lieth , to fall away, from the true worship of God to the Idolatry of the Gentiles]
\p
\v 20 . And now, let not my blood fall to the Earth [i.e. As if he had said, The Lord before whose face I walk the face of the LORD: [i.e. the Lord see it , and punish it. Oth. Before the face of the Lord] for he King of Israel is gone forth to seek an only flea; as they hunt after a partridge on the mountains.
\p
\v 21 . Then said Saul, I have sinned, return, my son David, for I will not hurt thee anymore, because my Soul was precious in thine eyes this day: [i.e. because thou hast spared me, and hast not take away my life, whereas indeed thou couldst have doe it] behold, I have done foolishly, and I have erred exceedingly.
\p
\v 22 . Then answered David, and said Behold, the Kings spear, therefore let one of the young men come over, and fetch it.
\p
\v 23 . The LORD then recompense to every one his righteousness and his faithfulness: [i.e. according as every one hath walked uprightly, and hath kept faith and truth] for the LORD had delivered thee into (mine) hand this day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORDS anointed. [i.e. against thee, who art the lords anointed]
\p
\v 24 . And behold, according as thy Soul was this day, esteemed great in mine eyes: so let my Soul be esteemed great in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all need.
\p
\v 25 . Then said Saul unto David, Blessed be thou my son David, thou Shalt assuredly do it, and thou shalt also certainly have the upper hand: [Heb. Doing thou shalt do it, and prevailing thou shalt prevail. i.e. Thou shalt be too potent, or too strong for thine enemies, and thou shalt over-power them. Others take it in this sense, Go on in like manner in all thy affairs with righteousness and faithfulness, as thou doest towards me, and doubt not but thou shalt prevail, get the upper-hand, and attain to the Kingly honour and dignity,] Then went David on his way, and Saul returned to his place.
\c 27
\s David not trusting Saul, determineth to leave the Land of Israel, vers. 1, etc. He goeth forth with six hundred men to King Achis, 2. Where he abideth a while withal his family, 3. Saul hearing of this, desireth a City to dwell in, 5. Achis giveth him Ziglag, 6. There he dwelt a year and four months, 7. David spoileth some of the neighbour nations, 8. And left no man there alive, 9. That no ma might complain of him to Achis, 11. Achis believeth and trusteth David too much, 12.
\p
\v 1 . David now said in his heart, [i.e. with himself] Now I shall one of the days, [i.e. at one time or another] perish by the hand of Saul: [This is a demonstration of the weakness of Davids faith and confidence in the excellent promises of God] nothing is better for me, then that I should speedily escape [Heb. Escaping escape] into the Land of the Philistines, [This was the counsel of weak flesh. See 1 Sam. 22. 5. There the Prophet God reproved David in a like matter] that Saul may lose the hope of me, to seek me (any) more in all the border of Israel, so shall I escape out of his hand.
\p
\v 2 . Then David gat up, and he passed thorow, he, and his six hundred men that were with him, unto Achis the son of Moach [Likely having first desired and obtained leave of Achis to come thither, and to tarry there: And that not for his own person alone, as he did at first, chap. 21. 10. But for all the men and women that were with him] the King of Gath. [Lying in the Philistines land, of which City Goliath was, above chap. 6. 17.]
\p
\v 3 . And David abode with Achis at Gath, he, and his men, every one with his house: David with both his wives, Abinoam the Jisraelitess, and Abigail wife of Nabal, [i.e. which had been the wife of Nabal. She is likewise so called below, chap. 30. 5.] the Carmelitess.
\p
\v 4 . When it was told Saul, that David was fled to Gath: the he proceeded not to seek him (any) more.
\p
\v 5 . And David said unto Achis, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in one of the Cities of the Land, that I may dwell there: [David sought to dwell somewhere apart by himself, with those that appertained to him, to escape the danger both of body ad soul, which might have befallen him form the Philistines] for why should thy servant dwell in the royal City with thee? [David knew full well how dangerous it was, for strangers (especially that were of any power) to dwell with a King in his own City: Therefore he was desirous to prevent this jealousy or suspicion; but he giveth it another name, as if he had said, This honour belongeth not to me, my Lord, O King.]
\p
\v 6 . Then Achis gave him Ziglag [this City belonged first to the tribe of Juda, in as much as God had give them those Cities of the Land, as appeareth, Jos. 15. 31. But the Philistines had take it from the Israelites, and had kept possession of it till now, and now Achis giveth it unto David] that day : Thereofore Ziklag was (or perstained to) the King of Juda unto this day.
\p
\v 7 . Now the number of the days that David dwelt in the Philistines Land, was a year, and four months. [Heb. Was days, and four months. The word days in the plural number, is often taken by the Hebrews for a year, See Levit. 25. 29. David abode at Ziklag until the death of Saul, then came he to Hebron, 2 Sam. 2. 1. Some take it thus: (Certain) days, and four months].
\p
\v 8 .David now went up with his men, and they fell upon the Gesurites, [See the annotat. On Jos. 12. 5. And 16. 3.] and the Girzites, [For Girzites. These were Canaanites, that dwelt before time at Gezer, or Gazer, in the Land of Ephraim. These being thence also expelled, went and dwelt on the South-side of the Land of Canaan.] and the Amalekites; [These were of Esau’s posterity whom the Lord commanded Saul utterly to destroy: but he left some remaining, against whom David here maketh war] (for these) [viz. The Gesurites, and the Girzites; these formerly inhabited the Land of Canaan] were of old the inhabitants of the Land) [viz. The Jewish Land, both on this and on the other side of Jordan] where thou goest to Sur, and unto the Land of Egypt.
\p
\v 9 . And David smote that Land, [viz. The inhabitants of the Land. This is now to be understood of all the Amalekites, which he found there, whom God had commanded to be destroyed, Exod. 17. 14. Deut. 25. 19. And Sam. 15. 3.] and left neither man nor woman alive. [This he did for this end, that they might not complain of him to the Philistines, whom he would make believe, that he had fallen into the Land of the Israelites] he took also the sheep, the Oxen, and the Asses, and Camels, and apparel, and returned and came to Achis.
\p
\v 10 . When Achis said, Whither fell ye in to day? Then David said, Against the South of Juda, [But not in the Land of Juda, as Achis meant, and also David seemed to say: But David fell into these Lands of the Amalekites, and of their neighbour nations and thus did David through human frailty deceive King Achis with ambigious and equivocal words, words that bear a double sense and meaning,] and against the South of the Jerahmeelites, [These were inhabitants of the Land of Juda, the Posterity of Hebron, 1 Chron. 2. 9, 25.] and against the South of the Keites. [These were the posterity of Jehu, the father in law of Moseh. See the annotate. On Judge 1. 16.]
\p
\v 11 . And David left neither man nor woman alive, [This did David do for this end, that no man might bring tidings to Achis, as immediately followeth. Besides Ziklag lay so far distant from Gath, that in this respect also tidings hereof could not straight way be brought to Achis. In the mean while David executed Gods vengeance against the banned nations] to brig (tiding) to Gath, saying, [i.e. thinking with himself left peradventure they should tell of us, [Understand withal, It behoveth me to look to it] saying, Thus hath David done: and thus was his manner, all the days that he dwelt in the philistines Land.
\p
\v 12 . And Achis believed David, saying, [viz. With himself] he hath made himself quite stinking [Heb. Making stinking made stinking; i.e. made himself so stinking, hateful, and compatible, that his own nation among his people, in Israel, therefore he shall be my servant for ever. [i.e. always, all his life-time.]
\c 28
\s Achis intending to march forth against Isrrael, relieth on David, vers. 1, & c. Samuel was dead and buried, and Saul had destroyed the wizards ad conjurers, 3. But now being afraid of the Philistines, and forsaken of God, he goeth to a witch for counsel, 5. Who being assured of Saul, that she should not be punished for it causeth a Samuel to come up, 9. Of whom Saul having understood his approaching destruction, fainteth, 16. Is by the advice and service of the witch, and his own servants cheared and revived with meat, 21.
\p
\v 1 . And it came to pass in those days, when the Philistines gathered their camps [Here mention is made of camps in the plural number, as also below chap. 29. 1. Whence may be gathered that the Philistines brought divers camps together into the field] together to battle, to fight against Israel: that Achis said unto David, Thou shalt surely know, [Heb. Knowing thou shall know] that thou shalt march forth with me into the camp, thou and thy men.
\p
\v 2 . Then David said unto Achis, Thus [Or, hereby,] thou shalt know what thy servant will do [This is again an ambiguous Phrase, as above chap. 27. 10.] and Achis said unto David, Therefore will I make thee a keeper of mine head all days. [As if he had said, Because I trust to thee, that thou wilt behave thy self valiantly in my service, therefore I will make thee a keeper of mine head, that is, of my body and life, as long as I shall live.]
\p
\v 3 . Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him, and had buried him at Rama, [This is mentioned here, to shew, why Saul did not ask counsel of Samuel, but gave order to seek out a witch] to wit, in his City: [viz. In the City where he was born and bred, and had lived the most part of his time] and Saul had put away the sooth-sayers [See Levit. 19. On vers. 31.] and the wizards [Or, black artists] out of the Land. [Understand the Land of Israel. See Levit. 19. 31.]
\p
\v 4 . And the Philistines came, and gathered themselves together, and they camped themselves at Sunem: [See the annotate. Jos. 19. 18.] and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they camped themselves upon Giboa. [This is a mountain lying not far from the valley of Jizreel, where the battle happened, in which Saul & his sons perished : See below chap. 31. 1. And 2 Sam. 1. 21.]
\p
\v 5 . When Saul saw the Philistines camp: then he feared, and his heart trembled greatly.
\p
\v 6 . And Saul required of the LORD, [viz. By some Prophet, for Abiathar was at this time with David, with the Ephod, wherein were the Urim and Thummim, whereby they enquired of the Lord: See above chap. 23. Vers. 6. And below chap. 30. Vers. 7.] but the LORD answered him not: neither [In the Hebrew, for neither, or nor is the word also thrice mentioned, whereby must also be understood, out of the foregoing words, the particle not, which together is as much as neither or not] by dreams , [See Numb. 12. 6.] nor by Urim, [See numb. 27. Vers. 21.] nor by Prophets. [i.e. nor by neither ordinary, or extraordinary means.]
\p
\v 7 . Then said Saul to his Servants, seek me a woman, that hath a sooth saying spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire by her: now his servants said unto him, Behold, (there) is a woman at Endor, [A City lying in the tribe Manasseh, on this side of Jordan. See the annotate. On Jos. 17. Vers. 11.] that hath a sooth saying spirit.
\p
\v 8 . And Saul disguised himself, [Or changed himself, made himself unknown, put on other apparel. Compare 1 King 22. On vers. 30. Viz. That this woman might not know him] and put on other apparel, and went his way, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, foretell unto me by the sooth saying spirit, and cause him to come up, [viz. Out of the grave, or selpuchre. This Saul asketh counsel of the dead for the living, which the Prophet Isaias reproveth chap. 8. Vers. 19.] unto me, whom I shall name unto thee.
\p
\v 9 . Then said the woman unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, [viz. As being an Israelitish woman, she might perceive by his speech and apparel: but when she spake this, she knew not yet that she communed with Saul himself] how he hath cut off the sooth-sayers and the wizards out of this Land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my soul, to put me to death? [As if she would say, to give Saul occasion, when he shall come to hear of it, to put me to death]
\p
\v 10 . Now Saul sware unto her by the LORD, saying, (As true as) the LORD liveth, if a punishment [Heb. Iniquity, or, trespass: i.e. punishment of iniquity. See Levit. 5. On vers. 1.] shall happen to thee for this thing? [Understand withal, then let God punish me, or some thing like to it. See the annotate. On Genes. 14. 23.]
\p
\v 11 . The said the woman, whom shall I cause to come up unto thee? And he said, and he said , make Samuel come up unto me.
\p
\v 12 . Now when the Woman saw Samuel, [i.e. an evil spirit in the shape and form of Samuel, whom she had raised by her Devilish art. Jesus Syrach is in a great error when he writeth, that Samuel after he was fallen asleep prophesied, and foretold Saul his end, chap. 46. 23.] then she cried with a loud voice: [viz. For fear of being imprisoned and put to death by Saul: for by the Devils instinct or otherwise she came to know that it was Saul himself: Or, she cried, when she saw Samuel come up] and the woman spake unto Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? For thou art Saul:
\p
\v 13 . And the King said unto her, Be not afraid [viz. That I will put thee to death, or cause the to be put to death ] but what seest thou? [viz. That thou art thus afraid and affrighted.] then said the woman unto Saul, I see Gods ascending out of the earth. [i.e. stately honourable person in the shape & form of Samuel. She speaketh thus, Elohim in the plural number, in a heathernish manner, and as a witch. Some understand here by Gods, the counterfeit Samuel, with a company of evil spirits waiting upon him]
\p
\v 14 . He then said unto her, how is his shape, and she said: There cometh up an old ma, and he is clothed with a mantle: when Saul perceived [viz. According to the judgement of his distracted senses, and the witches words: for he himself saw not this Samuel] that it was Samuel, then he bowed himself . [Saul being cozened by the Devil by this witches means, did honour the Devil in stead of Samuel]
\p
\v 15 . And Samuel [As above vers. 12.] said unto Saul, why hast thou disquieted me, causing me to come up [It was neither in the Devils nor in the witches power to raise up the true Samuel, and to make him appear there; ‘twas nothing but meer deceit and collusion of the devil, whom God sometimes permitteth to do some actions for the ruin ad destruction of those that give credit thereunto] then said Saul, I am greatly distressed, [Heb. Distress is greatly to me, that is, great distress] for the philistines war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by the ministry of the Prophets, [Heb. By the hand of the Prophets : i.e. by means of any Prophet. See further on ver. 6.] nor by dreams, therefore have I called thee, that thou mayest make known to me what I shall do.
\p
\v 16 . Then said Samuel, Wherefore doest thou now ask of me? Seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy.
\p
\v 17 . For the LORD hath done for himself, [viz. To his glory, according to his good pleasure. Oth. Him; viz. David. Or, simply, he hath done it] as he spake by my ministry: [Heb. By my hand. God had not spoken this by the evil spirit, but by the true Samuel, above chap. 15. 28.] and hath rent the Kingdom out of thine hand, and he hath given that to thy neighbours, to David.
\p
\v 18 . According as thou hast not hearkened to the voice of the LORD, and hast not executed [Heb. Done] the heat of his wrath against Amalek: therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day. [i.e. at this time]
\p
\v 19 . And the LORD will also deliver Israel [i.e. the camp of the Israelites] with thee, into the hand of Philistines, [The Devil might guess this in part, because he knew that the Lord was departed from Saul and that Saul was now thus dismayed and fearful, and also because there was but little courage and order among the Israelites to oppose and resist the Philistines] and tomorrow shalt thou, and thy sons be with me: [viz. Among the dead; i.e. thou shalt be dead. See the like phrase, 2 Sam 12. 23. For that this should be understood of being in hell, where the Devils are, cannot be applied to Jonathan , and to many of the Israelites, who indeed died in the battle, but went not (in respect of the soul) to the place of the damned] the LORD also shall deliver the camp of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.
\p
\v 20 . Then Saul fell hastily on the ground, [Heb. Then Saul hasted and fell on the ground] as long as he was, [Heb. (with) the fullness of his stature, or, length] and he was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel, there was also no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread [i.e. take no food] all the day, nor all the night.
\p
\v 21 . Now the Woman came to Saul, and saw that he was sore amazed: and she said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath hearkened to thy voice, [i.e. I have hearkened to thy voice] and I have put my soul in mine hand, [Heb. Palm. As if she would say, I have ventured my life: for she had to please Saul, done that which ought to have been punished with death, If Saul had persisted in his former intent whereof mention is made, vers.9. See the annotate. On Judg. 12. 3.] and I have hearkened unto thy words, which thou spakest unto me.
\p
\v 22 . Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine hand maid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee, and eat: so shall there be strength in thee, that thou mayest go on (thy) way.
\p
\v 23 . But he refused it, and said, I will not eat: but his servants, and also the woman were instant with him: then hearkened he to their voice: and he arose from the ground, and set himself on the bed,
\p
\v 24 . And the Woman had fatted Calf in the house, and she hasted, and killed it, and she took meal, and kneaded it, and baked thereof unleavened (cakes)
\p
\v 25 . And she brought them before Saul, and before his servants, and they did eat: after that they rose up, and went away the same night.
\c 29
\s The Princes of the Philistines will not suffer David to be in the camp, though Achis plead for him, ver. 3, & c. The Princes shew cause why they will not suffer David to be with them, 4. Achis causeth David to return, though sore against his will, 6. David would rather have stayed with Achis, 8. But he commandeth him the second time to depart, 10. Which David doeth, 11.
\p
\v 1 . Now the Philistines had gathered together all their camps to Aphek. [There were divers cities in the lad of Canaan called Aphek, First, one in the tribe of Juda, Jos. 15. 52. Secondly, another in the tribe o Issaschar, by mount Gibea, by the great field o Megiddo, of which this here may be understood] and the Israelites camped themselves by the fountain, which is by Jizreel. [This was a air city on the borders of the tribe of Issachar and Manasseh, Jos. 19. 18. Lying at the Fort of Gibea.]
\p
\v 2 . And the armies of the Philistines went thither by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men marched with Achis in the reward.
\p
\v 3 . Then said the Commanders of the Philistines, What shall these Hebrews? [Or, To what purpose are these Hebrews here? ] then said Achis to the chief of the Philistines, Is this not David, the servant of Saul the King of Israel, who hath been with me these days, or these years? [It was now about the second year, that David had dwelt in Ziklag, see chap. 27. 7. And before that time he had been also a while at Gath with Achis] and I have found nothing, [viz. No evil, or, no disloyalty] from that time that he fell off, [viz. From his Lord Saul, who is mine enemy. Otherwise, fell unto me] unto this day.
\p
\v 4 . But the chief of the Philistines were wroth with him, and the chief of the Philistines said unto him: Make the man return, [Oth.Turn about] that he may return to his place, where thou hast appointed him, and that he may not go down with us into the battle, left he be an adversary, [see the annotate on Job 1. 6.] to us in the battle: [viz. As many Hebrews heretofore have done; who fell off from us to Jonathan, above ch. 14. V, 21.] for wherewith should this (fellow) make himself acceptable unto his lord? [i.e. reconcile himself unto the Lord] is it not with the heads of these men? [viz. By delivering us up into the hands of Saul, revolting in the fight , and turning his sword upon our men]
\p
\v 5 . Is not this that David, of whom they answered (one another) in the dance, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, but David his ten thousands?
\p
\v 6 . Then Achis called David, and said unto him, (It is as true as) the LORD liveth, [Although Achis was an Idolater, yet he sweareth by Jehovah the true God: The Philistines indeed had experience of the power of the true God, when the Ark of the Covenant was among them, above chap.5. Its also possible, that Achis by conversing long with David, attained to some knowledge of the true God] that thou art upright , [i.e. I take thee to be a up coming in with me in the camp is good in mine eyes, [i.e. thy carriage and conversation, thy ordering and managing of affairs pleaseth me very well. See Numb. 27. 17.] or I have found no evil in thee from that day that thou camest unto me unto this day; but thou art not acceptable [Heb. Good] in the eyes o the Princes.
\p
\v 7 . Therefore now turn about, and go in peace; that thou do no evil in the eyes of the Princes of the Philistines.
\p
\v 8 . Then said David unto Achis, But what have I done? Or what hast thou found in thy servant, from that day that I have been before thy face unto this day, that I may not go and fight against enemies of my Lord the King? [David seemed to be very angry and foward to go and fight against the people of God, but what his intent and purpose was, was best know to the LORD]
\p
\v 9 . Now Achis answered, and said unto David, I know it, indeed thou art acceptable [Heb. Good] in mine eyes, as an Angel of God , [Achis, though an Heathen acknowledgeth that there be good Angels] : but the Rulers of the Philistines have said, Let him not go with us into this battle.
\p
\v 10 . Now then, get up early in the morning, [viz. Before the battle beginneth] with thy Lords servants , that are come with thee: and when ye shall have got up early in the morning, and the light appeareth to you, then depart.
\p
\v 11 . Then David got up early, he, and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines: on the contrary the Philistines marched up to Jizreel.
\c 30
\s David finding that the Amalekites in his absence had plundered and burnt Ziklag, et carried the people, and his two wives away captives, is exceedingly troubled thereat, and in great danger of his own people , ver. 1, & c. He asketh counsel of God, who biddeth him to pursue the Amalekites, 7. David doing so with apart of his Army, findeth a poor starved Egyptian that was left behind, who discovereth all things unto him, and bringeth him to the Amalekites, 9. David falleth upon them, smiteth them, and spoileth them again of all that they had, 17. Maketh an Ordinance for dividing the prey 22. Sendeth Presents to his friends, 26.
\p
\v 1 . And it came to pass when David and his men cam e to Ziklag on the third day: [viz. After that David was parted from the Philistines camp, for at so great a distance lay the Philistines camp (where David and his men had been) from the city of Ziklag, as may be gathered from 2 Sam 1. 2.] that the Amalekites [understand the remnant of the Amalekites that escaped, when Saul smote that people, 1 Sam. 5. 7. Or this may be understood of the Amalekites that lived in another part or corner of the land, then those did that were destroyed by Saul. These bewrayed their old inveterate hatred against the Israelites] were fallen into the South, ad Ziklag, and had smitten Ziklag, [i.e. ruined it, and ill intreated the inhabitants thereof: See Ezek. 33. On v. 22.] and burnt the same with fire.
\p
\v 2 . And had carried away the women captives, that were therein, (but) they had slaid none, from the least to the greatest: [Oth. Small or great] but had carried them away, and were gone their way.
\p
\v 3 . And David and his men came to the city, ad behold, it was burnt with fire ; and their women, and sons, and their daughters, were carried away captives.
\p
\v 4 . Then David and the people that were with him, lift up their voice, and wept: until there was no (more) power in them to weep.
\p
\v 5 . Both Davids wives also, carried away captives, Achioam the Jisreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal, [See the annotate. On chap. 27. 3.] the Carmelite.
\p
\v 6 . And David was sore distressed, for the people spake of stoning him, for the souls of all the people were embittered. [Heb. The soul of all the people was bitter; i.e. they were heartily grieved, besides possessed with bitterness and wrath against David, laying the blame on him, that they were bereft of their wives and children by the Amelekites, who were thereunto moved and provoked, because David had first set upon them in a n hostile manner, and smitten them, chap. 27. 8.] every one for [or, because of] his sons, and for [or, because of] his daughters: but David strengthened himself in the LORD his God. [Trusting and relying on the promises, that God had made to him, that he should be King: See the annotate. Above chap. 23. 16.]
\p
\v 7 . And David said to Abiathar the Priest, Achimelechs son, I pray thee, bring me hither the Ephod; [i.e. Put on the Ephod for my sake, that thou mayest thereby ask counsel of the Lord for me: See Numb. 27. 21. And above chap. 23. 9.] and Abiathar brought the Ephod to David.
\p
\v 8 . Then David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this hand? [He meaneth the Amelekites as also ver. 15.] shall I overtake them? And he said unto him, Pursue, for thou shalt certainly overtake, and thou shalt certainly deliver.
\p
\v 9 . Then David went his way, he, and the six hundred men that were with him, and when they came to the brook Besor, then the rest [viz. Two hundred men, which were so weary, that they could not follow , ver. 10.] Stayed.
\p
\v 10 . And David pursued them, he, and those four hundred men; and two hundred men stayed (behind), which were so weary, that they could not go over the brook Besor.
\p
\v 11 . They [viz. The men that were with David] found an Egyptian man in the field, and they brought him to David: [Heb. They took him to David; i.e. they took and brought: see the annotate. On Gen. 12. Ver. 15.] and they gave him bread, and he did eat, and they gave him water to drink.
\p
\v 12 . They gave him also a piece of a cake of figs, and two pieces of raisins, and he did eat; and his spirit came again into him. [Oth. To him; i.e. he that was faint, and almost dead with hunger, was cheared and revived by the meat or the food they gave him: so that the word spirit here signifieth breathing] for he had eaten no bread, [i.e. meat, food] nor drank any water (in) three days and three nights.
\p
\v 13 . After that David said unto him : Whose art thou? And whence art thou? Then said the Egyptian lad, [i.e. Youth, young man: See Gen. 22. On v. 5.] I am an Amalekitish man’s servant, and my Lord left me, because three days (ago) [Heb. This is the third day] I fell sick.
\p
\v 14 . We made a invasion upon the South of the Corethites, [i.e. Of the Philistines, as may be gathered from Zeph. 2. 5.] and upon that (part) which is of Juda, and against the South of Caleb, [i.e. Against the South part of the land, where Calebs Posterity dwell: See Jos. 14. 13 & 15. 13.] and we have burnt Ziklag with fire.
\p
\v 15 . Then said David unto him; Canst thou bring me thither down to this hand ? he then said: Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt not kill me, and that thou wilt not deliver me into the hand of my Lord! [ Heb. If thou shalt kill me, and thou shalt deliver me, etc. See of such kind of oath , Gen. 14. 23. The meaning is, that thou wilt not kill me, or that, & c. Compare above chap. 24. 22, & c] then will I bring thee down to this hand.
\p
\v 16 . And he led him down, and behold , they lay scattered upon all the earth, eating, and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great prey that they had take out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Juda. [Under which belonged to Ziklag, and the land of Caleb.]
\p
\v 17 . And David smote them from the twilight [The Hebrew word that is here used, as also the Dutch word Schemeringe, signifieth both the evening and morning glimmering, or twilight. Some conceive that David fell upon this people in the evening twilight, (for he found them eating, drinking, and dancing, which commonly is done in the evening, or at even-tide, not at break of day) they also conceive, that David having but four hundred men with him, rather chose the darkness of the night, to fall upon this great multitude in their drunkenness and jollity, then the glimmering of the morning, when the day began to dawn. Yet others take it here for the glimmering of the morning, conceiving that David and his men at even-tide were to weary to make an invasion upon their enemies] and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men which rode upon camels, and fled.
\p
\v 18 . Thus David rescued all that the Amalekites had taken: David also rescued his two wives.
\p
\v 19 . And there was nothing lacking among them from the least unto the greatest, and unto the sons and daughters: and of the prey also unto all that they had taken to them: David brought it all back again.
\p
\v 20 . David also took all the sheep, and the oxen: they [viz. Davids men] drave them on before that same cattle, [i.e. Before the cattle that had been taken from them by the Amalekites] and said : This is Davids prey. [i.e. which pertaineth to David, therefore he gave away thereof, where and to whom he pleased; see below verse 26.]
\p
\v 21 . When David came to the two hundred men, [See above v. 9, 10.] which were so weary, that they could not follow David, and whom they had let tarry at the brook Before, they went to meet David, and the people that were with him: and David went to the people, and asked them touching the welfare. [i.e. he kindly saluted them, asked them if they were well.]
\p
\v 22 . Then [viz. When they began to talk of dividing the prey] answered every wicked Belial among the men that went with David, and they said, Because they went not with us, [Heb. With me] we will not give them of the prey that we have rescued, but to every one his wife, and his children, let them lead them away, and depart.
\p
\v 23 . But David said, ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, [viz. With the prey which we have gotten, not by our own strength or power, but which the Lord hath given us] and hath delivered the band, that came against us, into our hand.
\p
\v 24 . Who I pray, should hearken to you in this matter? For as their part is that went along down into the battle, so shall also their part be that tarried by the stuff, they shall share alike. [i.e. The men that tarried behind, and abode by the baggage, shall have their share of the prey, as well as those that marched forth with me into the battle. Herein David followeth Gods Ordinance, Numb. 31. 27. And also the rule of right reason and equity, see Jos. 22. 8. And 2 Mach. 8. 28.]
\p
\v 25 . And this was (so) from that day, and (so) forward [Oth. Above, or, upwards, which some understand of the time past; so that it was here again revived, and brought in use again by David] for he made it a Statute, and an ordinance in Israel, unto this day. [The sentence will be perfected thus: which remaineth unto this day.]
\p
\v 26 . Now when David came to Ziklag, then he sent of the prey unto the Eldest of Juda, his friends, [i.e. Unto those that continued faithful to him in his grievous persecution] saying, Behold there is a blessing [i.e. a Present: see Gen. 33. 11.] for you, of the prey of the enemies of the LORD.
\p
\v 27 . (Namely) to them at Beth-El, [Oth. To them that were in the house of God, viz. At Kiriath Jearim, where the Ark of the covenant was, 1 Sam. 6. 21. & 7. 1.] and to them at Ramoth, toward the South, [This City lay in the inheritance of the tribe of Simeon, Jos. 19. 8. And it lay in the South quarter of the Land of Canaan, and is thus distinguished from other cities, which were also called Ramah; as Ramoth in Gilead, 1 King 22. 13.] and to them at father. [a city lying in the tribe of Juda on the mountains Jos. 15. 48.]
\p
\v 28 And to them at Aroer, [This city lay by the brook Arnon, given to the tribe of Reuben : See Deut. 3. 12. Jos. 13. 16.] and to them at Siphmoth, [oth. Called Sepham, Numb. 34. 10.] and to them at Esthemoa, [a city lying in the tribe of Juda, Jos. 15. 30. Oth. Called Eschlemo. It was given to the children of Aaron, 1 Chron. 6. 57.]
\p
\v 29 . And to them at Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the Jerah-meelites. [See the annotate. Above on chap. 27. V.10.] and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites. [see of these Judge 1. 16.]
\p
\v 30 . And to them at Horma, [Oth. Zephat: See Judg. 1. 17.] and to them at Chor-Asan, [this seemeth to be the same city, which Jos. 19. 7. Is onely called Asan, being in tribe of Simeon] and to them at Atach.
\p
\v 31 . And to them at Hebron, [See of this city, Gen. 23. 2. In the annotate.] and to all the places where David and his men abode for some space of time, when he was sain to flee from Saul, David was thankful to those who had entertained him and his, and done them good.]
\c 31
\s The Israelites are smitten of the Philisties v. 1. & c. Also Saul’s sons are slain, 2. Saul is wounded, 3. He falleth upon his own sword 4. So doth likewise his armour bearer, 5. Saul dieth, his three sons, his armour-bearer, and his people perish, 6. The rest flee, for saking the cities, 7. The Philistines cut off Saul’s head, 8. And they put his Armour in the house of Astareth, and hang his body on the wall at Bethsan, 10. Those of Jabes take down the bodies of Saul, and his sons, and burn them, 12. And bury their bones, 13.
\p
\v 1 . The Philistines then fought against Israel, [Here the Pen-man of this Book returneth to the History, which he had ;left in the 29. Chap. To relate in the interim what David had done the mean while against the Amalekites, who in his absence had plundered and burnt Ziklag. This chapter agreeth almost word for word with 1 Chron. 10] and the men of Israel fled before the face of Philistines, and fell (down) smitten. [Heb. Properly thrust through] on mount Jilboa,
\p
\v 2 . And the Philistines close upon Saul, and his sons, and the Philistines smote Jonathan, and Abinadab, [1 Sam. 14 49.] He is called Ischai] and Malchi-Sua, Saul’s sons.
\p
\v 3 . And the battle grew heavy against Saul , and the archers hit him, [Heb. Found him] and he was sore afraid of the archers. [oth. He was sore wounded of the archers.[
\p
\v 4 . Then said Saul to his armour-bearer: Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest peradventure those uncircumcised come, and thrust me through, and make a laughing-stock of me: [viz. When having taken me captive, they should offer meal shame and disgrace, and at last put me to a shameful and ignominious death. The Philistines being not able to get Saul alive, offered great abuse and disgrace to his dead body, Below v. 10.] but his armour-bearer would not, for he was sore afraid: then Saul took the sword, and fell upon it. [i.e. he stabbed himself: so also v. 5.]
\p
\v 5 . When his armour-bearer saw that Saul was dead: then he also fell upon his sword, and died with him.
\p
\v 6 . Thus Saul died, and his three sons, and his armour-bearer, and all his men that same day together. [Understand the greatest part of his Courtiers, and of his household, as also the generality or major part of the camp, though of both sorts some escaped. Compare 1 Chron. 10. On vers. 6.]
\p
\v 7 . When the men of Israel that were on this side of the valley, [understand here the valley, or the low grounds of the Jizreel] and that were on this side of Jordan, saw that the men of Israel were fled, and that Saul et his sons were dead: then they forsook the cities, and they fled: then came the Philistines, and dwelt in them. [see above chap. 27. 6.]
\p
\v 8 .Now it came to pass the next day [viz. After the battle] when the Philistines came to plunder that slain, then they found Saul and his three sons, lying on mount Gilboa.
\p
\v 9 . And they cut off his head, and they stripped off his armour, and they sent them [viz. Sauls head and armour ] into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish [viz. Their victory] in the house of their Idols. [The Hebrew word signifieth properly griefs, pains, and terrors. Thus are the Idols called, because they cause God to punish the Worshippers thereof with sorrow, pain, and terror] and among the people.
\p
\v 10 . And they put his armour in the house of Asthareth. [See Judg. 2. 13. In the annotate.] and they fastened his body to the wall, [viz. In the street which was by the city wall, as may be gathered from 2 Sam. 21. 12.] at Beth-Sam. [oth. Called Beth-Sean, Jos. 17. 11. & Judg. 1. 27. This city lay in the tribe of Manasseh, Jos. 17. 11. Which at this time was possessed by the Philistines.]
\p
\v 11 . When the inhabitants of Jabes in Gilead heard thereof, what the Philistines had done to Saul:
\p
\v 12 . Then all the warlike men gat up, and went all night, and they took the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, from the walk at Beth-san, and they came to Jabes, and burnt them there. [Forasmuch as these bodies had been certain days unburied, and had hung in the Sun, without all doubt they were become putrified and stinking, so that they could not be kept or preserved with Balsams, therefore they burnt the flesh, and buried the bones.]
\p
\v 13 . And they took their bones, and buried them under the tree [See 1 Chron. 10. 12.] at Jabes: and they fasted seven days. [Understand daily until the evening. See 1 Chron. 10. On v. 12. Thus testifying their grief for Saul and his sons.]
