\mt2 THE BOOK OF
\mt ECCLESIASTES
\mt2 OR
\mt2 OF THE PREACHER: CALLED IN HEBREW KOHELETH
\s The Arguments of this book
\p May among the Learned are of the opinion, that Solomon wrote this Book in his old age, after that he had for many years together turned away from the right path of true godliness; but was now again converted unto God. (See annotate. 2 Chron. 11 on v. 17.) Wherein he by inspiration of the Holy Ghost, before the whole congregation of God, testifieth his earnest sorrow and repentance for the former part of his life, loathing and abhorring it, as being vanity of vanities, whereby a man is not able to attain unto temporal rest, and satisfaction or contentment of mind, much less unto the highest or chiefest good, which is everlasting salvation. In like manner his intent purpose is, by his own example and pattern to lead all men to virtue and piety. To this end and purpose he doth in the in the first place make a short recital of the whole course of his life, and wherein he had chiefly taken his delight and recreation. Then in the second place he relateth also, that he heeded and observed the practice and course, about which men did most busy and trouble themselves in this life, being for the most part vanities, yea also wicked and ungodly devises, he testifying that the All-wise and Almighty God directeth and governeth all things according to his will and pleasure, and that things do not fall in the world by fortune or chance, s many men do imagine. Lastly, Solomon exhorteth all to men to fear and serve God uprightly, and to practice and perform all good works and duties, rejoicing in an honest and godly manner in the things which they enjoy, and have received in the bountiful hand of God, especially while they are young, strong and of perfect memory and understanding; having at all times the severe and righteous judgement of God before their eyes.
\p As for the Tittles of this Book Ecclesiastes, that is, the Preacher, the same must not be so understood here, as if Solomon did give his mind that way, namely, to preach constantly before the Congregation Gods people, ( this was properly the office and duty of Prophets, Priest and Levites) but in that respect it is called Ecclesiastes or the Preacher, because he doth as it were a Sermon here in this Book, full of good and profitable doctrines and instructions. And it may be very well be, that either he himself read the same, or caused and procured it to be read in full meeting or assembly of the Church and people of God. Others understand by the word Ecclesiastes, one that maketh a speech in the Congregation; as they are wont to do, who do publickly before the Congregation of the faithful openly confess the sins they have committed.
\c 1
\s Everything is vanity and disquietenesse, both in respect of men themselves, and in respect of things that are done in the world, being altogether inconstant, transitory and full of vexation; v.1,&c. This the preacher proveth by his own example, 12.
\p
\v 1 The words of the Preacher, the son of David the King, as Jerusalem, (at Jerusalem was the Royal seat: but Solomon was the King over the twelve tribes of the people of Israel, see below, v.12.]
\p
\v 2 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities, [That is, the greatest vanity; as we say, King of Kings, that is, the highest song. See the annotate. Gen. 9. On vers 25 and Levit.2 on v.3. And understand these words so, that Solomon thereby signifieth, that all earthly things can no way help or benefit us, for to attain unto true happiness or blessedness] it is all vanity. [to wit, all that is done under the Sun, verse 3. Compare Psal. 62. 9. And 144.4.]
\p
\v 3 What advantage [Or surplussage, remainder, profit, gain; to wit, to attain unto quietness of mind, every ones happiness constisteth] hath a man of all his labour, [or, troublesome labour; to wit, as well of the mind as of the body] which he laboureth under the Sun? [that is, about the transitory things of the of this world. As if he had said, none, no profit at all, so below chapter 2.22. and 3.9.]
\p
\v 4 One generation goeth, and another generation cometh, [ The meaning of these words is, the multitude of men or people that are now alive, they die and perish; so shall they likewise perish and die, that shall succeed and come after them from one age to another, and from one generation to another. See Psal 12.6. yea, all that is in the world, it is transitory and changeable; therefore can it not bring unto a man any true, real, substantial, or biding happiness]but the earth abideth forever. [Or, is abiding, it perisheth not so, as the things do perish that are alive and move in it. Otherwise, it is most certain, that the world shall also perish at last, see Psal.102.27. and 104.5 and 119.90. and 2 Pet. 3. On ver.10.]
\p
\v 5 The Sun also riseth, and the Sun goeth down, and he panteth after his place where he arose. [This is spoken by way of similitude, taken from a man that runneth apace ( so that he gapeth for breath) to come to the place where he would be. See Psal. 56. On vers.2. The meaning of this, and the next following verses seemeth to be this, All labour, both of the mind and body, in and about worldly affairs, maketh a man full of care and anxiety, so that he is in a continual motion, like the Sun, the air, and the rivers; therefore it cannot make a man happy.]
\p
\v 6 He goeth towards the South, [To wit, from such times as he entereth into the celestial sign of Cancer, until he entereth into the sign of Capricorn; to wit, in summer and Autumn] and goeth about unto the North, [to wit, the other half year, from that he entereth into Cancer, namely, in Winter and Spring] the windeth goeth continually compassing about, [Heb. Wheeling about, wheeling about] and the wind returneth again to his circuits, [blowing sometimes out of one, sometimes out of another Climate or part of the world.]
\p
\v 7 All the books [Understand under these, yea especially, the Rivers and water-streams] go unto the sea, yet the Sea waxeth not full; [to wit, so full, as that it should over-flow the earth, but it continueth all in one condition, see Job 38.10,11 Psal 104.9.] unto the place whither the brooks go, thither going do they return again. [to wit, by or through the veins that run under the earth, the Preacher doth intimidate hereby, that the rivers are in a continual flux and reflux, or in motion to and fro.]
\p
\v 8 All these things grow (so) weary, [Or, are, (so) full of labour, or, toil,] that no man is able to utter it, [yea, neither able to comprehend it with his mind or understanding. And consequently, cannot the things that are seen and heard in the world, bring any true contentment or quietness of the mind unto a man] the eye is not satisfied with seeing, neither is the ear filled with hearing.
\p
\v 9 That which hath been, the same shall be ; and that which is done, the same shall be done: [So below, chap.3.15.] So that there is no new thing under the Sun. [To wit, as touching those things that are done in the world according to the common course of nature: but the case is otherwise concerning the extraordinary works of God.]
\p
\v 10 is there anything, whereof it may be said, see that it is new? Is that hath been already in the ages which were before us. [The meaning is, there is nothing new (though it may seem to be new) but it hath been also heretofore at one time or another.]
\p
\v 11 There is no remembrance of former things; [As if he had said, if so be there any thing sound which men call a new thing, it is from hence, because they do not well know all that is past, and that happened in the former times and ages, because there is no remembrance of it] and of the following things which shall be, of there be neither any remembrance with those that shall be after.
\p
\v 12 I, the Preacher, was Kings over Israel at Jerusalem. [As if he had said, I, being a great and mighty King, have had leisure and fit opportunity to do that, which straightway followeth, much more that any man else, who have not had that ability, wealthy, opportunity, or knowledge to search and dive into all things, as I have had, see below, chap 2.5,6,7,8,&c.]
\p
\v 13 And I gave my heart to search and inquire with wisdom, into all things that are done under heaven: [As well those that came forth according to the order of nature, I Kings 3, and 4. As those that happened against the common course of nature] this business [Heb. Evil business, trouble, or anxiety, which is called evil or evilsome, because a man busieth himself therewith, enjoyeth not the right benefit thereof, because he can never attain to a full and perfect knowledge of all things, nor of the carries from whence they issue, as also the putting in practice of humane knowledge is very hard and difficult thing] hath God given to the children of men, to perplex themselves therewith. [or, to be busied therein, or to vex themselves therein, or to humble themselves thereby.]
\p
\v 14 I beheld all the works that are under the Sun, and behold, it was all vanity and vexation of spirit. [That is, not a flight head aching or head-bicaking, but a vexation, gnawing, bicking, or consumption of the heart or mind. Oth. Feeding or nourishing of the wind, that is, a thing whereby a man is no more comforted and strengthened
\p
\v 15 That which is crooked cannot be made straight; [To wit, by a mans own skill and understanding, or by humane industry, but God is able to do all things; therefore David prayeth, Lord, create in me a new spirit, see below, chapter 7.13.] and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. [that is, there be so many defects and imperfections in the things of this world, as they that in no wise can be numbered or told.]
\p
\v 16 I communed with mine (own) heart, saying, I have enlarged an increased wisdom, [Or, I am grown great and more abounding in wisdom; to wit, in the knowledge of natural things, and of the things that are done, and come to pass in the world, see 1 Kings 3.12 and 4.29. and 10.7,23. Ezek 2.9.] above all those that have been before me at Jerusalem : and mine heart hath seen[that is, experienced and found out, see Job 7. On v. 7.] much wisdom and knowledge.
\p
\v 17 . And i gave my heart to know wisdom and knowledge, madness and folly. [That is, I was diligent and industrious, to somewhat better, what the excellence of wisdom meant, by opposing thereunto, and as it were balancing against folly, which is contrary to wisdom, see Exod. 2.12.] I perceived that this also is a vexation of spirit, [see above, on v. 14.]
\p
\v 18 For i much wisdom is much grief: [Or anger, or anguish, or defection of mind; to wit, because those that excel in wisdom and understanding, do perceive many things which are repugnant and clean contrary to wisdom, and therefore do sore displease them: or also because the spirit of man (even of the wisest) cannot execute and accomplish his thoughts or intentions] and be that increaseth [Heb. Adjoyeth, addeth] knowledge, the same increaseth pain. [or painfulness, ache, grief, perplexity, that is, he that desueth to know much, he hath also much trouble and perplexity.]
\c 2
\s Solomon sheweth by his own example, that true happiness constisteth not in the things that are pleasing to the flesh, as stately buildings, planting of trees, vineyards, gardens, v. 1.2,&c. But in a quiet cheerful enjoyment of the mercies which God hath given unto man, verse 24,&c.
\p
\v 1 I said in me heart, Go to now, [Heb. Go now] I will prove thee with joy, therefore look on the thing that is good: [Heb. Look into the thing that is good, that is, satisfie thy self with the thing that is good, which in this place is as much as, satisfie thy self with bodily delights, compare Luke 12.19. Here Solomon speaketh to his own heart, as if he had said, I will once try, whether pleasures or worldly delights be true and highest; whether they are able to bring true contentment of mind, and true real happiness, unto those that battle themselves in them] but behold, that also was vanity. [to wit, as well as that which was related before, chapter 1. Namely, the searching out of worldly things.]
\p
\v 2 I said unto laughter, Thou art mad; and unto mirth, [Meaning, carnal and worldly mirth] what maketh this? The meaning is, what benefit or advantage doth this worldly mirth bring? However it is not profitable, or available to teach true happiness. Understand this thus, that much and immoderate laughing, singing, skipping or dancing, is more seemly, for a fool and a frantic person, then for a wise and understanding man, Prov.20.1. but to laugh moderately at sometimes, and for some causes, is a thing not to be reproved.]
\p
\v 3 i inquired [Or, searched, or sought, or advised] in mine heart, [that is, with my self] to sustain my flesh [that is, my body] in wine, [or to draw wine, that is, to accustom and inure my self to drink wine. Oth. To give my flesh over unto wine] (yet leading mine heart in wisdom) and to retain folly, [as if he should say, I have purposed so to keep the wisdom (which God hath given me) in my heart, as that notwithstanding I was also minded to give way into folly , (to wit, by feeding deliciously, and by living in pleasures and delights]laying thereon, and retaining it. The meaning is, I have striven and endeavoured to live both in bodily pleasures and delights, and also in wisdom, uniting both wisdom and pleasure together; for under the name of wine, all kind of dainty, food, meat, and drink, yea, all manner of pleasures and delights must be understood] till i should see what would be best for the children of men, which they should do under the heaven, (during the number of the daises of their life.]
\p
\v 4 I made great works, [That is, structures, buildings, as immediately followeth, and also verse 5,6. Heb. I made my works great; to wit, not onely for necessity, but also to shew my glory, and for delight] I builded my houses, I planted my vineyards. [to wit, in Baal, Hamon, Cant. 8.11.]
\p
\v 5 I made me gardens, [To wit, wherein all sorts of herbs and flowers grew] and gardens of pleasure, [Heb. Pardesim; that is, paradises, which signifieth not ordinary common gardens, but gardens of pleasure and delights, especially Orchards] and I planted trees in them, of all kinds of [Heb. Of all] fruit.
\p
\v 6 I made me pools of waters, [Understand such kind of pools, wherein there was always water, both raining water and spring water] to water therewith wood that flourished with trees.
\p
\v 7 I got [Or, I possessed, or gained, recovered] servants and maidens, and I had children of (my) house: [that is, children born in my house; to with, of my servants and maidens, compare, Gen. 12.5. and Gen. 14.14. and 15.3. and 17.2.] also I had a great possession of oxen and sheep, [under these kinds are also other beasts understood, both great and small] more than all that had been at Jerusalem before me.
\p
\v 8 I gather me also the silver and gold [See 1 Kings 9.28. and 10.14,21,22,26.] and the jewels of the Kings, and of the Provinces: [that is, which might be found with some Kings, and in strange Provinces: or, that which with Kings, and in every Provinces was esteemed to be most precious] and I appointed [Heb. I made] me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the children of men, music-instruments, [or, musical harmony, or divers tunes of musical instruments, or Caroches, or choices, very beautiful women taken captive in war; to wit, to minister unto me in all things whereunto women are fit. The Hebrew word is found no where else but here, therefore it is so variously rendered] yea, all sorts of Music-instruments.
\p
\v 9 And I became great, and increased more than any man, that had been before me at Jerusalem: also my wisdom [That is, the wisdom wherewith God had indued me above all others] remained withe me. [Heb. Stood, that is, consisted, or remained constant, or steadfast with me. The meaning is, although I had all the afore-mentioned richies and power, yet did i not therefore let wisdom go, but continued withstanding still in my wife and discreet government, compare above, v.3.]
\p
\v 10 And whatsoever mine eyes desired, I withdrew it not from them: I withheld not mine heart from any joy, but mine heart rejoiced because of all my labour: [That is, because of the goods or things which I had effected and produced by my labour] and this was my position of all my labour. [That is, all that i enjoyed of all my travel, was transitory, and mirth or joy soon gone, see below, chap.5. on v.17.]
\p
\v 11 Then I turned me to all my works, which mine hands, had made, and to the labour which I working had laboured: behold, it was all vanity and vexation of spirit, [see above, chapter 1.14.] and there was no advantage therein under the sun. [that is, in any visible and transitory things.]
\p
\v 12 After that I turned my self to behold [That is, exactly to observe] wisdom, also madness and folly: [that is, I gave my self to the consideration of wisdom and folly, which I had tried, and had had experience of, to judge with myself which was the most excellent] for how should a man that should come after the King, [that is, me] (do) do that which is already done? [as if he should say, How should he be able to do that, which I, who am a great and mighty King, have done? Oth. For what (should) the man (do,) that shall come after the King? (even) that which hath already been done. The meaning is, if there be any man that thinketh that i, who am so might and wise a King, have not understood or experienced all things aright, and that i that regard there may be another way and means to attain unto true happiness, he erreth greatly; he shall find nothing, else then what I have already delivered concerning it; everyone may herein safely rely upon the world.]
\p
\v 13 Then I saw, That wisdom hath excellency above folly, as light hath excellency above darkness. [The meaning is, though all that we do is meer vanity, yet wisdom is to be esteemed so much more then folly, as light is to be esteemed above darkness.]
\p
\v 14 The eyes of the wise man are in his head, but the fool worketh in darkness: [That is, he knoweth not, how he shall order his affairs. The meaning is, that a wise man is well advised, and goeth prudently about his business; but a foolish man is unadvised and unprudently in all his affairs, see Prov. 8.1. and 17.24.] then I perceived also that one kind of chance happeneth to them all. [That is, to them both, as well as the wise man, as to the fool; to wit, as much as concerned that which befalleth them in the present life; as there are divers calamities, sicknesses, diseases, and aches and pains of the body, as also death itself. Compare herewith Psal. 49.11.
\p
\v 15 Therefore said I in mine heart, [To wit, judging according to the nature and condition of things, which men see daily happen before their eyes] As it happens to the fool, (so) shall it also happen to my self: [That is, I am as well subject of all kind of miseries and calamities, shall as well die as the fool, yea as all other men] Why therefore do I seek more after wisdom? As if he should say, seeing death will seize upon me, as well as upon all others, what will humane wisdom avail me? What benefit shall I have by it? Then spake I in mine heart, that the same also is vanity.
\p
\v 16 For there will be no more remembrance of a wise man then a fool for ever. [Heb. There is no remembrance of a wise man with the fool for ever. This serveth to confirm that which was even now affected. The meaning is, As all men are mortal, so doth also, in time, the remembrance of one perish, as well as of another, yea of all men in general. Although the memory of those, whose names and acts are upon Records in the Word of God and in the Histories, still remaineth and abideth with many] seeing that which now is, in the days to come is quiet forgotten: and now dieth the wise man with the fool? [that is, as well as the fool, see Psal. 49.11,12. It is a question with admiration, as if he had said, It is a lamentable thing, that a brave wise man must die as well, and as soon, [and oftentimes (according to the judgement of the world) hath the like issue) as a fool. Oth. And how the wise dieth with the fool.]
\p
\v 17 Therefore I hated this life, [That is, it grieved me to live] for this work that is done under the Sun [that is, all the works and actions of man] seemed evil unto me: [Heb. Was evil in, by, with, or upon me] for it is all vanity and vexation of spirits.
\p
\v 18 I hate likewise all my labour, which i had laboured under the Sun, [That is, my wealth or estate which I had gotten or gathered together by my labour] that I should leave it behind to man that shall be after me. [that is, that shall succeed me in the Throne or kingdome. As if he should say, I loathed and abhorred it; to wit, considering the vanity of riches, and the gathering of goods, which are gotten with so much trouble and care. And especially, in respect of uncertainty, what heir a man shall have to inherit his goods after his death.]
\p
\v 19 For who knoweth, whether he shall be a wise man, or fool? Yet shall he have a rule over all my labour which I have laboured, and which i have managed wisely under the Sun. [That is, over all the goods, and excellent great commodities which I have purchased and gathered with much labour and travel. Rehobeam, the son and succeedor of Solomon, by his folly and imprudence lost the greatest part of his kingdom, 1 King;12. It may be in some measure be gathered from this verse, that Solomon perceived well, that Rehabeam would not behave himself wisely, managing the government of the Kingdom] That is also vanity.
\p
\v 20 Therefore I turned myself about, to cause mine heart to despair to all the labour, which I have laboured under the Sun. [as if he had said, I am in my thoughts at last comes to this, that I have not had in the least any contentment in all that I have gotten by my flow labour and travel, See v.18.]
\p
\v 21 For there is a man, whose labour is in wisdom and in knowledge, and in apiness: yet to a man that hath no laboured therein, shall he deliver in : [to wit, his labour that is, all the estate that he hath gotten and gained by his labour] for his portion: [the meaning is, it is no wonder, that this thing grieveth me, seeing there is no man of never so poor and mean an estate, but would be grieved to think that his means and estate should fall into the hands of the strangers] that is vanity, and a great evil. [that is, grief or vexation, as Matth. 6.34.]
\p
\v 22 What i pray, hath that man [To wit, of whom is spoken v.21.] now of his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, which is labouring under the Sun/ [compare above chap.1.3. and below chap.3.9.]
\p
\v 23 For all his dayes are sorrows, [That is, full of grief heaviness. See Job.14. the annotate. On v.1.] and his travel is grief: even in the night his heart resteth not: that is also vanity.
\p
\v 24 Is it not (then) good for a man [To wit, as much as concerneth the temporal good, and this transitory life] that he should it and drink, and that he should make his soul [that is, himself] enjoy good in his labour? [or if his labour; that is, if his goods or estate gotten by his labour. Hebr. That he should make his soul see good, See. That is, that he should fare well, and enjoy some good of his labour. The meaning is, the setting of superfluous and unprofitable care and anxiety aside, he should enjoy and make use of those things that God hath given him. Compare below chapter 3.12,22. And 5.18. and 18.15. oth. There is (then) nothing better for man, (then) that he should eat and drink, &c. Oth. It is not good for a man, that he should eat and drink, that is, that he should take his whole delight and contentment in eating and drink and the like] I have also seen, that this thing is from God. [that is, that it is a special and peculiar gift of God, which every man hath not; to wit, that a man is well contented and cheerful with such things, s he hath received at the bountiful hands of God.]
\p
\v 25 (For who should eat there of, or who should hasten (thereunto) [To wit, to eat thereof, or to have the use and enjoyment thereof; namely, with mirth and rejoicing] more then my self?) [as if he had said, if there were any other enjoyment to be had or obtained by of from those temporal things, (why) who could do it easier and better then I?]
\p
\v 26 For he [To wit, God] giveth to a man that is good before his face, [that is, to one that is virtuous and pious] wisdom, and knowledge and joy: but to the sinner [that is, to the wicked, in whom he hath no delight. See Psa.1.1 concerning the word sinner] be giveth travel, to gather, and to heap up, [to wit, temporal goods and riches] that he may give it to him that is good before the face of God: [that is, before his face. Compare Job 27.16,17. Prov. 28.8.] this also vanity and vexation of Spirit. [to wit, so to vex and trouble thy self about getting wealth of riches, which though moist not enjoy thy self, neither live them to whom thou wilt, and whom thou conceives, that he will not know how to use them aright.]
\c 3
\s The Preacher teacheth here, how that all things in the world have their time and season, so as God hath ordained, v.1,2,etc. Concluding thence, that a man cannot do better then to enjoy the gifts of God in this life with a quiet and merry heart, doing good unto his neighbour, 12. Then he maketh mention of the iniquity, which is seen practiced in Courts of Justice, 16. Etc. He also sheweth that men must die, as well as the brute beast, 18,19. As also that by the common condition of them that die, they cannot know whether their soul be immortal, 19.etc. concluding, v.22. as above
\p
\v 1 All (or every) thing hath an appointed time: all (over) purpose [Hebr. Pleasure, or will, desire; to wit of men. See Psa. 27. On v.12.] under the heaven hath its time. [that is, all affairs and transactions of this world are variable and subject to divers changes and alterations over and again, which God alone ruleth and governeth, and cannot be hastened by any man whatsoever. By this mutability it appeareth plainly, that true happiness is not to be sought (much less so to be found) in this wavering and transitory life.]
\p
\v 2 There is time to be born, and a time to die: a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted.
\p
\v 3 a time to kill, [Whether it be done by the will and appointment of God, Exod. 21.13. or by the authority and the commandment of the Magistrate. Oth. To hurt or wound] and a time to heal, [to wit, him that is wounded or hurt] a time to break down, [Hebr. To break in, or to tear, or rent] and a time to build up.
\p
\v 4 a time to weep, and a time to laugh: [See above chap.2.2.] a time to lament, [or to mourn, or to make great moan] and a time to leap up. [or skip, or daunce; to wit, for joy and for gladness. See 1 Chronicles 25.29. and Acts 13.8.]
\p
\v 5 a time to cast away stones, [To wit, when a garden or field is cleansed, or any house plucked down] and a time to gather stones: [to wit, when they intend, or go about to build an house, or to raise some other structure] a time to embrace, and a time to be far from embrancing. [compare 1 Cor. 7.5.]
\p
\v 6 a time to seek, [That is, to provide, or to keep. Oth, to seek, to wit, wisdom, or wealths, or somewhat that a man hath lost. Understand withal, and to find, as Isa. 65.1.] and time to let ( a thing) perish: [oth. To lose; to wit, when a man should thereby come in danger of soul, of life] a time to keep and a time to cast away. [as for example, when a man is in danger of shipwreck at sea, Jona 1.5. acts 27.18,19.]
\p
\v 7 a time to rent [To wit, garments, as was very usual and customary among the Jews, to shew their sorrow of heart] and a time to sow up: a time to keep silence, and a time to speak.
\p
\v 8 a time to love, and a time to hate: a time of war, and a time of peace.
\p
\v 9 what advantage hath he that worketh, of that which he laboured? [Understand withal, none. The meaning is, when the hour and time is not come, let a man do what he will, he shall not be able to affect any thing. Compare above chap.1.3.]
\p
\v 10 I have seen the travels which God hath given to the children of men, to trouble themselves therewith.
\p
\v 11 . he [To wit, God] hath made every thing beautiful [or fair, comely, decent] in his time: [that is, God maketh every thing so, as that is beautiful and excellent, and every thing cometh to pas in due time and season, though with men great changes and alterations to happen] also he hath put the age in theirs [mens] heart: [that is, hath put a natural inclination and proneness to search out the ages and times, and whatsoever is or hath been done in them. oth. The eternity; that is, an inclination or proneness tending to the searching and inquiring into those things that are eternal and infinite: or an inclination and proneness tending to eternity] so that a man cannot find out [to wit, perfectly, and by his own wits and understanding] the work that God hath made from the beginning to the end. [Hebr. From the head to the end.]
\p
\v 12 I perceived that there is nothing better for them, [To wit, men: of in them; to wit, things] then for (a man) to rejoice, and to do in his life. [that is, to live virtuously and godly. See below chapter 12.13.]
\p
\v 13 Yea also that every man should eat and drink, [To wit, with delight and joy] and enjoy [Hebr. See the good of all his labour: (this) is a gift of God.
\p
\v 14 I know that whatsoever God doth, it shall be [ That is, stand or continue] forever; there is nothing to be put to it, neither is thee anything to be taken from it: and God doth (it) that men should fear before his face. [that is, it shall always come to pass as he hath decreed and ordained: for the decree of God is unchangeable. If the creature were able to make the least change in that which God intendeth to do: if the creature were able to diminish or increase the blessing: to ease, or aggravate the cross; then men will honour and stand in awe of the creature and not of the Creator. Therefore God hath so limited all that he intendeth to bring upon us, or that he intendeth to remove and keep off from us, whether it be good or evil, as that the creature is not able to make the least or alteration therein, to the end that we might only fear the face of the Creator, and in all humility wholly and solely depend upon his providence.]
\p
\v 15 that which hath been, the same is now, and that which is to be, the same hath already been: and God seeketh that which is driven away. [Understand withal, and he bringeth again to light, that which is past or gone, renewing by his almighty power and all-wise providence the sundry kinds of beasts and other creatures: He causeth the spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, each to return again in their season: In like manner the Flowers, Herbes, and Fruits both of the trees and of the Earth: When men and beasts die and perish, then he causeth others to be born, and to grow up in their stead, etc.]
\p
\v 16 Moreover, I saw also under the Sun, [To wit, another vanity] in the place of judgement, there was wickedness, and in the place righteousness, there was impiety. [That is, in the court of justice, or in the place of Judicature, where justice and judgement should be pleaded and maintained, there the clean contrary was practiced.]
\p
\v 17 I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked; [That is, the innocent and the guilty. The meaning is, when I beheld the iniquity and injustice that reigned among men in the producing of sentence or judgement, then I comforted my self with this, that I called to mind, that God the supream and most righteous Judge shall and will in his own due time judge all men righteously, rendering to every men according to his works] for [oth. But] the time for all (or every) purpose, ad for all ( or every) work is there. [to wit, where God shall at the last day set up his judgement-seat, where all mens deeds and actions shall be judged. It is as if he said; the wicked they have a time here, but God shall also have a time there.]
\p
\v 18 I said i mine heart of the condition of the children of men, [That is, concerning or belonging or appertaining to the being, the estate or condition, the dealing or conversation of men; to wit, when I duely considered it, and searched unto it] that God shall declare unto them [or shall give them clearness] and that they shall see, that they are in themselves (as) the beasts. [as if he should say: foreasmuch as the vanities of men are so many, and so great, and that there are such swarmers and such variaties of troubles and cares, whereunto they plunge themselves so deeply, and with such delight and complacency, as if they should ever abide here: therefore I have thought with my self, that God will make it out clear unto them, and will give them, visibly apparently to see and apprehend, what they are in themselves, and according to the nature and condition of this lower world, to wit, as the beasts or brute creatures, Psa. 49.13,21.]
\p
\v 19 For that which befalleth the children of men; the same befalleth the beasts also, and one manner of (condition) befalleth them (both) : [To wit, when we look on nothing else, then on that which outwardly befalleth both men and beasts. For men draw breath, they eat, drink, sleep: they are also subject to sickness, diseases, aches, pains, yea also finally to death it felt, no otherwise then the brute creatures, or beasts are, as followeth in the text. But else the excellency of men above beasts is exceeding great] as that [to wit, the beasts] dieth, so dieth this, [to wit, man] and they [that is, they both; to wit, both men and beasts] all have one manner of breath, [understand here by breath the spirit of life] and the excellency of men above beasts, is none: [to wit, as much as concerneth their dying] for they are all vanity. [to wit, as well men as beasts. Oth. It is all vanity.]
\p
\v 20 They go unto one place: [To wit, into the earth. This is to be understood concerning the body, as may appear that which followeth. Hebr. Every one, or all, (or every) thing goeth, &c.] they are all of the dust [see Gen.1.24. and 2.7.] and they all turn to dust again. [compare Gen.3.19.]
\p
\v 21 Who perceiveth that the breath of the children of men, [That is to say in this place, the soul, as Luke 22.46.] sendeth upward, [and consequently remaineth in being, after that it is departed out of the body. See hereof further below chapter 12.7. where Salomon saith in plain terms, that the soul returneth unto God that gave it. So there that the soul was mortal: the meaning is who can perceive or know this, by the common outward accidental conditions, of them that die] and (that) the breath of the beasts goeth downward to the Earth. [where it vanisheth to nothing; having no more a being, after it is gone out of the body.]
\p
\v 22 . Therefore saw, that there is nothing better, then that a man should rejoice in his (own) works, [That is, in those things which he earneth by his labour] for that is his part [that is, his portion, which he shall enjoy, see above chap.2.24. and 3.12, and below 5.18. As if he said: a man when he dieth, he shall carry nothing away with him, neither shall he know after he is dead what is done here upon Earth; therefore it best that he do not vex and torment himself with unprofitable care, how things shall go after his decease, what heir he shall leave behind, or how they shall dispose of his goods, or how they shall demean themselves when he is gone: but that he with a quiet and merry heart (in the fear of God) use and enjoy those things which he possessth; for he shall have nothing else of the same, see above chap.2.3.] for who shall bring him thither, to see that which shall be done after him? [as if he had said, no body.]
\c 4
\s Solomon sheweth in this chapter, how the poor are wronged and oppressed by the great ones of the world, v.1.etc. how excellent and virtuous men are envied. 4. The ill condition of the sluggard. 5. That some men have not an heart to enjoy their own labour. 6. He commanded those above them that keep company with others. 7. Here some glory in their power, but that wisdom is to be more esteemed, 13. The favour of the subjects to their magistrate is unconstant.
\p
\v 1 Then I turned my self and considered all the oppressions that are done under the Sun: and behold, there were the tears of the oppressed, and of those that had no comforter; [or they had no comforter] and on that side [Hebr. On the hand] of their oppressors (there) was power. [the meaning is, they have a strong party against them that is able to overpower and oppress them] they on the contrary have no comforter.
\p
\v 2 Therefore I praised the dead, [To wit, because they are freed from all the miseries and troubles. See Job.3.17,&c.] which were already dead, above the living, which are yet alive.
\p
\v 3 Yea he is better then them both, which had yet been, [That is, he that was never born. Solomon speaketh this in respect of miseries of this life. See Job.9.11,12,13,16, and 21.] who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the Sun?
\p
\v 4 Moreover, I saw [That is, I considered] all the labour, and all the fitness of work, that is procureth envy to a man from his neighbour; that also is vanity and vexation of Spirit. [the meaning is, that those that acquit themselves diligently in their callings, and are painful and industrious in all their works and dealings, they are subject to the envy of those that are wicked and slow or careless in their business: which often troubleth or grieveth the godly exceedingly.]
\p
\v 5 The fool foldeth his hands together, [The Scripture attributeth the name folly, or foolishness, to all that is contrary or repugnant to the word of God. Here a fool is as much to say as a sluggard, or slothful man. And here the nature and disposition of sluggards, and of cares negligent persons, that will not put forth their hands to labour, and to take pains for their living, is opposed by the Preacher to the nature and disposition of diligent and industrious persons, of whom he had spoken, v.4. And he will hereby intimate, that notwithstanding it is very grievous thing for a man to be subject and liable to envy and hatred of wicked and ungodly wretches, for one diligence and industry, yet it is therefore no less great folly and madness, to spend and consume ones life idly and slothfully. Compare Prov. 6.10. and 24.33.] and eateth his (own) flesh. [that is, (as we use to say) the fool devoureth and consumeth all that he hath, and he falleth at length into such extreme poverty, that in grief of heart and penury he wasteth and consumeth his own flesh and blood.]
\p
\v 6 Better is an handful [Hebr. A palm full] with quietness, then both the fists which labour and vexation of spirit. [some take these to be as it were the words of the fool to excuse his idleness, whereof see v.5. As if he should say, to what purpose should I toil, and take such pains, as many men do? A little will suffice my turn, I will therefore go on softly and easily. The words are good: it is better to live in quietness with moderate riches, then to posses great riches with much care and trouble. See Prov. Chap.15.v.16,17, and 17,1. But idle persons abuse the same for a coverture of their slothfulness. See Eph. 4.28. Others understand these words to be the words of the Preacher tending to the admonition of the sluggard, that he ought to labour diligently, though he should get but a little, that he might live in a fair and honest life.]
\p
\v 7 I turned me again, and I saw a vanity under the Sun.
\p
\v 8 There is one (alone) and not a second, he hath neither child nor brethren: [By children, are meant, descendants (as they are called) in a direct straight line: and by brethren, all collateral or friends that come sidewards and stand in side or in collateral line] yet there is no end of his labour, neither is his eye satisfied with riches, [that is, though he should possess all that he seeth, yet he would not be contented and satisfied] neither saith (he) For whom do I now labour, and cause my soul [that is, my self] to want the thing that is good! [As if he had said, Why dare I not take my relief of mine own estate? Or, why do I live in such a base, sordid and cumbersome condition? The meaning is, he considered not with himself, Is it not a great folly, that I do my self no good, nor bear good will to my self, but do nothing but rape and scrape, and toil for strangers? Psa.39.7,&c. This is spoken of covetous misers and muck-worms, that are never contented and satisfied, but are always gathering and hoarding up, although they know not who shall be the heirs of their goods or estates] This is also vanity, and it is troublesome travel.
\p
\v 9 Two are better then one: [That is, the condition of two that live together, is better then those of one. It seemeth that covetous miseries are reproved in these words, who are of no body but for themselves alone, and desire to keep company with none, for fear that familiarity and friendship would cost them somewhat, whereas good friendship and familiarity, is better then temporal riches] for they have a good reward of their labour, [to wit, forasmuch as they can sooner and earlier accomplish their desire and purpose, then if they were alone by themselves without any ones help. For whilst they help one another, they labour-goeth on the faster, and they have the better success, and the more gain and profit comes in.]
\p
\v 10 For if they [That is, one of them, or one of them both. See Judg. 12. On v.7.] fall [to wit, into sickness, or misery, or sin] the one lifteth up his fellow: but woe to the one (alone) that is fallen: for there is no second to help him up.
\p
\v 11 Also if two lie [Or sleep] together, then they have warmth, but how should one be warmth (alone)?
\p
\v 12 And if any man should prevail against one, then two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not soon broken. [The meaning is, if they be yet more in company then two, yea if they be many united and linked together in one society, then they shall be the better able to resist and oppose their Enemy, that comes to assault them.]
\p
\v 13 Better is poor and wise young man, then old and foolish king, who knoweth not of being admonished. [As if he should say, the royal dignity is indeed highly and greatly esteemed in this world, and they that attain unto it count themselves exceedingly happy above other men: But there is no happiness to be found therein; however a King (when he is come to age) hath not such wisdom as is necessary and requisite for to govern both himself and his subjects well, and moreover will not be directed or admonished by others, that are wiser then himself. Therefore a poor man that hath understanding (though he be young in years) is to be more accounted and esteemed, then such a king. Of the word young man, see Gen.44.on v.20.]
\p
\v 14 For one [To wit, one poor young man, ver.13.] cometh out of prison, [Hebr. Out of the house of those that are bound, or of bound ones] to be King, [it seemeth that the Preacher here hath respect to that which befall Joseph, Gen.41.14,39,43. And Psa.105.18,20,21. The like is also seen in Mordecai, Est. Chap.6. and in many other more] whereas also one that is born in his Kingdome, [that is, one that is born and an hereditary King, and not an elect or chosen King] becometh poor. [this befell king Zedekia, 2 Kings 25. And Nebbuchadnezzer King of Babel, Dan.4.30. and others besides. So that it is vanity for any man to be proud of royal dignity and power, or to rely thereupon, in regard of instability and uncertainty thereof.]
\p
\v 15 I saw all the living [Understand here by all, all those that dwell in one Kingdome or Land] walking under the Sun, with one young man, [that is, openly covering, or keeping company with him; to wit, that they might gain his good will and favour betimes, or in time] the second, [that is, who is the second; to wit, counting from the father, the Father being the first, the eldest Son the second] that shall stand up [that is, reign] in this (mans) stead. [to wit, in the stead of the King that now reigneth. Intimating that in all ages of the world there had been found more, that have reverenced and worshipped the Sun-rising, then the Sun-setting. The meaning of the whole verse, is this, I observed in general, the whole world sideth with the young man, that is, with the King which is grown old is not much more esteemed. This is also vanity, and a toilsome trouble in the Royal dignity.]
\p
\v 16 There is no end of all people, [That is, the people are infinite in number, they are past numbering] of all that have been before them; [to wit, before the King that now is, and his Son the King that shall be, or that is to come, spoken of before, ver.15.] the posterity also shall rejoice over him: [Heb. In him; that is, over the same; as if he should say, they will neither be contented of satisfied with the government of the Kings successor, when he shall be grown old]surely that is also vanity and vexation of spirit. [the meaning seemeth to be this; The inconstant multitude they will always be eager and desirous of a change, and when he once cometh to reign, whom they have so eagerly longed after, then they will not rejoice in him long, but soon grow weary of him, and desire and with for another again in his room. This is a grievous and sad thing in the heart of the King: And consequently, true happiness cannot be found in the Royal dignity.]
\p
\v 17 Keep thy foot [Or feet, for the Hebrew word is read two ways] when thou enterest into the house of God, [the meaning is, consider wither thou goest; when thou goest to the Temple, thou goest not to a common or ordinary place, but a place that is holy, and dedicated to holy things; so that a man must appear there with humility and reverence, as before the face and presence of God. This 17th. Verse some do add to the fifth chapter, as speaking of one and the same matter] and be rather nigh to hear, [to wit, the holy Word of God, to thereby instructed in the holy knowledge of him] then to give the slay-offering of fools; [that is, hypocrites and those that onely made an outward shew of holiness; the godly did it not, as thinking to appease God by that outward work done, and thereby to make satisfaction to their sins; but fools thought so, see Sam.15.22. Psal.50.8 Prov.15.8. and21.27.] for they know not that they do evil. [to wit, when they offer sacrifices with such an heart and mind. Oth. Surely they know not to do any thing (but) evil. Oth. They know not what evil they do.]
\c 5
\s Salomon teacheth the Congregation, how they shall behave themselves in the exercise of outward warship, vers.1,&c. Next, how they shall behave themselves, when they see that Rulers and such as are in authority do not administer injustice, 7. Which is the best way of thriving, 8. The vanity of riches, and of covetousness, 9. Then he sheweth that mans happiness consisteth in a cheerful enjoyment of the gifts of God, 17. Which to be able to do, is likewise a gift of God, 18.
\p
\v 1 Be not too rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart hasten to utter a word, [Or any thing] before the face of God: [the meaning is, when thou comest into the house of the Lord, to call upon God, make not too great hast, that thou mayest not pray unto him without reverence and attention. Oth. Be not too quick, &c. To wit, to make any vow unto the Lord unadvisedly, or undiscreetly] for God is in heaven, and thou art upon earth; [therefore ( as if he should say) we must not speak unto that great and high God, as is we had to do with our equals; but we ought to come before his high and glorious Majesty with all humility and lowliness of heart, remembering that we are poor vile earth-worms] therefore let thy words be few. [to wit, which thou usest in prayer. The rule of praying aright, in few words, is prescribed unto us by our blessed Saviour, Matthew 6.7.]
\p
\v 2 For (as) a dream cometh through much business: so a fools voice, by the multitude of words. [That is, as much dreaming issueth from the multitude of affairs, wherewith a man is troubled and busied in day time: so doth the babbling and prating of fools issue and proceed from the desire and custom of speaking much.]
\p
\v 3 When thou shalt vowed a vow unto God; [See Numb.30.3. Deut.23.21.] defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools; [that is, in hypocritical and vain men, who being in straights make great and large vowes, but when they are delivered out of trouble, they soon forget what they have vowed] whatsoever thou shalt have vowed, pay it.
\p
\v 4 Better is thou that shouldest not vow, then that thou shouldest vow, and not pay. [Compare, Deut.23.21,22.]
\p
\v 5 Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh [That is, thy self, or thy body, thy corrupt flesh] to sin; [by refusing to pay thy vow] neither say before the face of the Angel, [to wit, when he cometh to require at thy hand the thing that thou hast vowed. Some do understand here by the Angel, our Saviour Christ, who is called, the Angel of the Covenant, Malach.3.1. see Exod.23 on v.20. oth. The Priest of Teacher, who is an Angel, or Messenger of God, Mal.2.7, 1 Cor.11.10. Revel.2.1,&c.] that it was an error: [or, mistake, fault, ignorance, that is, a fault of ignorance. As if he would say, I did not mean so, or I vowed inconsiderately, not thinking of it afore-hand, and therefore I desire to be excused and freed from the vow] wherefore should God be very wrath, because of thy voice, [that is, at thy saying, by reason of such rash vowes, and idle and unprofitable excuses] and destroy the work of thine hands? [that is, that God should cause the things to proper ill, which thou takest in hand. The meaning is, wilt thou make it so that God be exceedingly provoked to anger against thee, for such kind of speeches and actions of thine? It shall indeed go very ill with thee, if touching this matter thou lookest not well to thy self in thy self in time, Exod.23.21.]
\p
\v 6 For as in the multitude of dreams (there) are vanities: so likewise (in) in many words: [Or, in many matters, in many things. The meaning is, dreams have often times no signification at all, neither doth anything follow upon them, therefore they are meer vanity. Oth. For (as) when dreams are multiplied, vanities (are) also (multiplied) so is it likewise with many words. Compare, Prov.10.19.] but fear thou God. [As if he should say: To use many words is but vain. A must have deeds as well as words: he must have the true fear of God in him, when he cometh before the face of his Majesty. Oth. There fore fear God: that is, in regard he hath power to punish thee, therefore fear his wrath.]
\p
\v 7 If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and the spoiling of judgement and justice in a Province, marvel not [To wit, not too much, so as thou shouldest not despair and grow out of heart, or doubt of Gods Province, as if he suffered all things in the world to run at random, without any guiding or governing by him at all] at such a purpose: [oth. Pretence, intent, thing, matter, dealings; that is, at such kind of dealing. It may be applied either to the evil intention and practice of wicked men, or to Gods wise and righteous providence] for he that is higher that the high ones, [that is, God, who is the most high, much higher and mightier , then the highest and mightiest of this word, be they Emperors, Kings, Princes, or Potentates, or what they may be. Oth. For the highest takes notice of the height] regardeth it: [to wit, the oppression of the poor, etc. And he so regardeth them, as that he shall certainly punish them in his own due time] and there are the high ones [to wit, the holy Angels, who are under the command of none but God alone: they likewise regard and heed the actings of wicked Judged] above them. [to wit, above those that violet judgement and justice, and do oppress the poor. See Dan.10.20. and 11.1, the meaning of the words of this verse seemeth in brief to be any one that thinketh that it is vain for to fear and serve God uprightly, because wicked men do almost whatsoever they lift, without being punished for it: the thereunto is, that there is a God in heaven, that diligently and narrowly heedeth all unrighteous dealings, to punish them in wicked men, how highly soever they maybe exalted here in this world.]
\p
\v 8 The profit of the Earth, that is for all, [Or is in all, ; that is, it is everywhere in use and useful] the King himself is saved by the field, [the meaning is, a King himself is subject to the necessity of tillage or husbandry, without which he can maintain neither himself, nor his Court, nor his Army, nor his Subjects. See hereof examples in Pharaoh, Gen.41.and 47. And in Saul, I Sam.9.11. oth. Becameth a servant of the field. That is, Kings, Princes, or the great ones of the world, do sometimes give themselves to husbandry or tillage. So that in this verse is lively represented unto us the praise and commendation of tillage, above all other trades and occupation, whereunto men do give and apply themselves in this life.]
\p
\v 9 He that loveth money, is not satistified with money; and whose loveth abundance, is not ( satisfied) with increase: This is also vanity. [This verse speaketh of insatiabileness of covetous misers; according to the common proverb, Much treasure stoppeth not a misers mouth. Oth. He that loveth money, shall have no increase; that is, he that exceedeth in costly apparel and household stuff. He that keepeth a great retinue both of men and maid-servants, and lavisheth out his money about other necessary things, his rents and revenues cannot maintain him. Compare this with psa.37.16.]
\p
\v 10 Where goals are multiplied, there are also multiplied those that eat the same; what use [ oth. What enjoyment, benefit, profit] have the possessor thereof [Heb. Lords, Masters, or Owners; to wit, of the Goods] but sight of their eyes? [that is, more then the beholding of them with their eyes. Meaning, that those that have great and vast estates, they have no more profit or benefit by them, then only to serve their own necessities, to take of them what may serve to suffice nature: they have no more profit by them over and above, then only to see and behold them with their eyes; that is, no more then a man hath of a painted map. Others take in this sense, that rich men must daily see before their eyes, that their riches are eaten up and devoured by others. The whole meaning of the verse amounteth to this. The more goods any man hath, the more he standeth in of other mens help and service, whom to maintain he must needs be at great costs and charges. Therefore riches cannot in any wise tend to the quietness and happiness of him, that posesseth them in great abundance.]
\p
\v 11 The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, [Or whose laboureth, to him sleep is sweet, oth. Whose doth husbandry-work, to him sleep is sweet: for the Hebrew word is properly used of husbandry-work, or tilling the ground, as Gen.2.5. and 2 Sam.9.10.] whether he hath eaten little or much; but the fullness of the rich suffereth him not to sleep. [to wit, not only in regard that the rich is not weary with labouring, but also in regard that he over-chargeth his stomach with good cheer. Like wise the rich and wealthy of this world are subject to more danger than the poor men are. Besides the rich misers have an unsatiable desire to increase and augment their estates, and are always in fear that they shall lose them, which often breaketh and hindereth their sleep.]
\p
\v 12 There is an evil that bringeth sickness [Hebr. A sick evil, see below on v.15.] (which) I saw under the Sun: riches kept by the possessors thereof [as above ver.10.] to their own evil. [that is, to the hurt of those that have them. Hebr. To his evil; that is, to the evil or hurt of every one that have or posses them. Riches are kept with care, oftentimes to the owners, or possessors own mischief: for oftentimes rich men fall into great troubles by reason of their riches: or riches perish & are wasted by evil ad wicked practices, whether by leading a voluptuous and prodigal kind of life, or otherwise: therefore they tend to vexation and disquietness of mind. See below 6.2.]
\p
\v 13 Or riches themselves perish, by toilsome trouble: [Or trouble some travel, see above chap.1. on v.13.] and he [to wit, the rich man, whose goods are vanished and come to nothing] begeteth a Son, and there is nothing at all in his hand. [to wit, that he may give to his son; or that he shall get into his hands; to wit, after his Fathers death.]
\p
\v 14 According as he [To wit, the rich man, or the rich mans son, being now become poor] come forth out of his mothers womb, (so) shall he return naked, going as he came: and ha shall take nothing with (him) of his labour [that is, of goods that he hath gotten and gathered by his labour, as v.18,19.] which he might carry away with his hand. [this is spoken here of the rich man, or of the rich mans son, now grown poor: But this speech or saying is true of all men in general, how rich or wealth soever they be: for let man be never so rich, or never so wealthy, yet when they die, they carry nothing away with them. see Job 1.21. and 1 Tim. 6.7. and Psa. 49.18.]
\p
\v 15 Therefore this is also an evil that bringeth sickness: that every manner of way as he come [to wit, naked] so goeth he away: [to wit, out of this world] what is it to him, that he hath laboured in the wind? [or, for the wind; that is, in vain, or for an empty transitory thing, being no more the better for all his labour, then if the wind had driven and blown it away. See Job 6. On v.26.]
\p
\v 16 That he hath also his days eaten in darkness, [that is, in sorrow and misery, shunning the society and company of men] and that he hath had much grief, also his sickness, [this is not so much to be understood of a corporal or bodily sickness, as of an inward distemper or sickness of the mind, hearts-grief and displeasure] and raging anger? [Hebr. Properly frothy anger.]
\p
\v 17 Behold what I have seen, a good thing which is beautiful; to eat, and to drink, and to enjoy, [Hebr. To see] the good of his labour, which he hath laboured under the Sun, (during) the number of the days of his life, which God giveth him: [it is both good and comely, or beautiful, for a man to eat, and to drink; to wit with joy or rejoicing, not troubling himself too much, or being too anxious and careful about future things. Or things that shall come to pass hereafter: yet so, as that we never forget to have and set God before our eyes in the enjoyment of his blessings; for seeing signifieth here enjoying. See the annotat. Job 7. On v.7.] for that is his portion. [to wit, which is allotted to him in this life of his temporal goods, he can look to have no more of them. But the children of God have a further and a better portion then this; for God himself is their portion, Psa.16.5. and 73.26. and Lamen.3.24. Yea they are joint heires with Christ of an inheritance in corruptible, Rom.8.17. 1 Pet.1.8.]
\p
\v 18 Every man also to whom God hath given riches and goods. And he giveth him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion; and to rejoice in his labour, that is a gift of God. [That is, he moveth and increaseth his heart thereunto, that he should take his share and portion of such things as God hath given him, and should with comfort and cheerfulness use and enjoy the same.]
\p
\v 19 For he shall not much remember the days of his life: [that is, he shall vex and torment himself with thinking often of the grief and sorrow which he hath had in his life-time, nor with the care and fear of the suffering which yet may befall him] because God heareth him in the joy and gladness of heart. First a natural joy of the heart, arising from a sence and apprehension of temporal happiness and prosperity. Secondly, a civil or political joy of the heart, issuing from the practice and exercise of some excellent vertues: as in the heathen, who acquitted themselves most excellently in prudence, justice, valour, etc. Thirdly, there is also a spiritual joy or gladness of the heart, proceeding from a sense and apprehension of our peace and reconciliation made with God. This is the chiefiest and the most excellent joy of all, Rom.5.1,2. Psa.4.7,8.]
\c 6
\s In this Chapter the Preacher relateth the misery of niggardly and covetous men, to whom God giveth not an heart to use their goods, judging that riches are no ways advantageous or beneficial unto them, to help them to the attainment of temporal felicity; but on the contrary that they hinder et are hurtfull unto them.
\p
\v 1 There is an evil which I have seen under the Sun, and it is much among them.
\p
\v 2 Amen, to whom God hath given riches, and goods and honour, and he wanteth nothing for his soul, of all that he desireth: [that is, of all that his heart desireth] and God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but that a strange man [whether he be an Enemy, that taketh them violently away from him, or a far remote kinsman: or some body else, that is no kin to at all] eateth it up: [that is, his riches or his estates. The meaning is, God granted him not, that he may freely and peaceably enjoy his wealth, because he taketh him out of this world, before he hath gotten that contentment and satisfaction to himself, which he imagined he should have: Or because while his eyes yet alive, he is thrust out of possession of his own goods or estates, and is constrained to see a stranger to be in possession of them: Or though he lived long, and keepeth his wealth or riches, yet he hath not an heart to use them with joy and delight. Compare above chapter 5.18.] This is (also) vanity, and evil pain.
\p
\v 3 If a man beget an hundred (children), [that is, many children. A certain number of uncertain] and lived many years, so that the dayes of his years are many, but his soul were not satisfied with good, [see Job 21. On v.13.] and he also had no brutal: [that is, if the case were so with him, that he might have no honourable or decent burial bestowed upon him: but that he (who formerly lived in great state and dignity) was now thrown away unburied upon some dung-hill, or into some other filthy noisome place, as Saul, Jezebel, 2 Kings 9.35. Jojakim, Jerem. 22.19. and others more besides] I say that an untimely birth is better he, [to wit, in the judgment of flesh, and in respect of outward accidents. Because an untimely birth, or a mischance (as we call him) is free from all those miseries, which such a man is liable unto, See Job 3.16.]
\p
\v 4 For it [To wit, the mischance, or the untimely birth] cometh (in) [to wit, into this world out of his mothers womb] with vanity, [that is, in vain; for he enjoyeth not this life, nor this world] and he departeth in darkness, [that is, without being talked of, or without any notice being taken of him; as that which is done in darkness, is not seen or regarded by men] and his name is covered with darkness. [to wit, in the grave, under the Earth. The meaning is, he is no more remembered or thought of.]
\p
\v 5 Likewise he hath not seen, nor known the Sun: [And consequently it is not grievous to him to want the light of the Sun] he hath more rest then he. [to wit, that covetous worldling, of whom mention is made, v.2,3.]
\p
\v 6 Yea though he lived [To wit, the covetous worldling] twice as thousand years, and saw [that is, enjoyed] no good: do they not all go one place? [to wit, into the gave, or under the Earth, where they again are turned into Earth, as much as concerneth body. As if he had said, what shall this long life profit him? For he must at length be put under the ground, as well as the untimely birth, that hath not lived one day in the world: Or as well as other men, that have lived but a small time.]
\p
\v 7 All the labour of man is of his mouth; [That is, therefore, and for that end, that the mouth might have something to eat] and yet the appetite is not filled. [the meaning is, though a man have enough for his mouth, as concerning necessity, yet notwithstanding he is never fully satisfied; she always coveting and desiring still more.]
\p
\v 8 For what hath the wise more then the fool? [That is, a further confirmation of that which was said, v.7. to wit, that all the labour of man is for his mouth: Herein saith the Preacher, all men are like one another, no man enjoyeth more then what is necessary for the body. Otherwise he acknowledge above chap.2.v.13,14. That there is a great and wide difference between a wise man and a fool] what hath the poor (more) , [oth. What (advantage) hath the poor, etc. As if he had said, one man hath no more advantage then another, no man enjoyeth more his necessary food. The word rendered here poor, is like wise so taken, Exod.22.25. Lev.19.10. Deut.24.12. otherwise it signifieth properly miserable, or afflicted] that knoweth to walk before the living. [that is, that is wise and skilful to converse among men, and earn his own living. The Preacher concludes from thence, that likewise true happiness doth not consist therein, that any one is diligent and nimble earner of his own bread, seeing that a foolish man maketh a shift to live as well as he.]
\p
\v 9 Better is the beholding of the eyes, then the desire of the appetite? [As if he had said, it is better to be contented with a little that a man hath for the present, then always with an insatiable desire to rake for more, and still to be greedy and coveting after more. Others understand it thus, that in these words is an objection of the flesh against that which the wise man had uttered of delivered against covetous misers; as if he had said, yet it is better to have some thing then nothing at all: Therefore some do render the words thus, the beholding of the eyes (say they) is better then the walking of the appetite] This (to wit, this unsatiable and greedy desire] is also vanity and vexation of Spirit.
\p
\v 10 Whatever also any man is, [That is, of what state or condition soever man is, be he high or low, rich or poor] his name is already named, [to wit, man, as is expressed in the following words: and that which he should be, is already before ordained and declared by God in his most wise and secret counsel: Therefore it is in vain for any man of strive to be rich, and of an high estate, whom God will have to be poor and of lower estate: And therefore it is vanity to be careful and troubled about future things] and it is known, that he is man: [that is, a weak and frail creature; to wit, made of dust and earth, as Hebrew word Adam (here mentioned and exprest in the text) signifieth] and that he cannot plead with him, that is stronger then he, [to wit, with or against God, as complaining of him, because he hath place him in this, or in that condition. How I pray should dust and ashes dare to contend, or be able to enter into judgment with the Judges of all the Earth. See Job 4.17, etc. And 9.2,3, and 14.1. and chap.25. and 34.23.]
\p
\v 11 Verily there are many things that increase vanity: what hath man more (of them) [The meaning is, it ought to suffice a man that he himself is vanity, though he did not add unto vanity many other things that increase. Oth. When a man hath many vanities, that is, possesseth much goods, and many great places or offices] then he increaseth vanity.
\p
\v 12 For who knoweth [To wit of himself] what is good for a many in this life, (curing) the number of the days of the life of his vanity, [understand this so, namely, what is truely and really good for him, such as might be able to bring him true rest and contentment] which he spendeth as a shadow? [oth. Which he, [to wit, God) hath made (or appointed) as a shadow. Compare Psa.144.4. Jerem.4.13.] for who can tell [or certify, shew, make known] a man what shall be after him under the Sun? [compare below chap.8.7.]
\c 7
\s The wise man teacheth in this chapter, how among so many things that are in the world, we should study and endeavour to get and keep a good name, v.1. that we should often set before our eyes our mortality, 2. Next, he giveth certain good lessons, how men should suffer themselves to be instructed of those that are wise, 5. To patience and perseverance. 7. And other vertues. 8. The praise of wisdom, 11. And of other vertues. 14. Men are sinners, 20. An evil woman ought to be avoided, 26. God hath created man good, 29.
\p
\v 1 A Good name [to wit, (with God and honest men) raised by reason of their virtue and piety. See Eccl. Chap.ver.44,45,46,47,48,49, etc.] is better then good oil:[understand here pleasant sweet smelling ointment or oil, which the Jews held in great esteem: or precious ointment, to heal wounds and sores. See Psa. 133.2. Some understand by good oil or ointment all manner of pleasant or delightful things. Compare Prov.22.1.] and the day of death then the day that a man is born (on) [to wit, when man dieth godly and piously. Compare Rom.7.24. Phil.1.23. For then a man attaineth to everlasting happiness, instead of his wretched transitory life.]
\p
\v 2 It is better to go unto the house of mourning, then to go unto the house of the feasts: (For) in it [To wit, in the house of mourning] is the end of all men; [that is, there we may behold examples and spectacles of the transitoriness of mans life, and the power of death over all men, who, or of what condition soever they be] and the living layeth it in his heart. [to wit, that which he there seeketh before his eyes, having well observed what the end of mans life is, and how man ought to prepare themselves for death.]
\p
\v 3 Mourning is better then laughing: [Or vexing, etc. That is, it is better to have godly sorrow, and to mourn over ones sins, then to have worldly joy; for godly sorrow is good for the soul; it worketh amendment to salvation not to be repented of, 2 Cor.7.10. oth. Anger is better then laughing, for a stern countenance makes the heart cheerful; that is, it is better to reprove sinners sharply, and with a stern countenance, then to flatter them with laughing words; for reproofs are good to bring sinners to amendment] for by the sadness of the countenance [Hebr. The illness, or disturbance of the countenance. See Gen.40. on v.7.] the heart is made better. [to wit, when by prosperity it being departed out of the way, it is humbled and brought unto the right way again by grief and heaviness.]
\p
\v 4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning: but the heart of the fools (is) in the house of the mirth. [The meaning is, that the wise were to go into the house of mourning. And though they be not with their bodies as bodily presence in the house of mourning, yet they are sorrowful, and compassionate with the affected. In the house of mourners a man learneth to be humble and lowly, but in the house of mirth a man learneth to be unruly and wanton.]
\p
\v 5 It is better to hear the reproof of the wise, then for a man to hear the song of the fools. [That is, the vain mirth and commendation, or praise, the flattering, sooth-saying, or cogging, which may do more love to hear then a pleasant song. He intimateth, that this is also a kind of happiness in this life, for a man to endure reproof willingly at the hand if pious and virtuous men, whensoever he hath sinned, that he might thereby escape damnation: And for a man to loath and abhor the vain delights and flatteries of those that fear not God. Compare Prov.13.18. and 15.31,32.]
\p
\v 6 For as the sound of thornes under a pot [To wit, that hangeth and boileth on the fire] so is the laughter of a fool: [whereby he bewrayeth, that he taketh delight in him that doth evil. The loud crackling of thornes under a pot, is no pleasant music to the ear, and the fire of thornes lasteth not long. So the Godly take no delight in hearing the flattery and loud laughter of fools, which kind of mirth and jollity also soon vanisheth and decayeth. Compare Psa.58.10.] this is also vanity.
\p
\v 7 Verily, the oppression would make a man mad, [That is, when a wise man himself is extremely afflicted with sorrows and miseries, it will make him sometimes do or speak that which befitteth a fool rather then a wise man. Examples see in Job and David. Oth. When a man is deceived, that maketh a wise man to lose his sences: Or oppression; that is, wealth or estate taken from a man by oppression, etc.] and the gift destroyeth the heart, [it corrupteth the understanding of man: to wit, when the Judge taketh gifts of bribes of those that have causes to be tryed before him. See Exod.23.8. Deut.16.19.]
\p
\v 8 Better is the end of a thing then the beginning thereof: [To wit, the end of a good thing is better then the beginning thereof. Therefore a wise man always hath an eye upon the end of the things, which he taketh in hand: and though the means whereby a good business is performed, be hard and bitter, yet (eying the end which man intendeth) he ought to go on and persevere therein with patience and forbearance: the event or issue is sometimes better then it appeareth at first, or in the beginning] the long-suffering (person) [Hebr.one that is long in spirit. Compare Num.14.18. So in the following words, high-spirit] is better then the high minded (person.)
\p
\v 9 Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosome of the fools. [He speaketh of an unjust and unlawful anger which continueth long, and taking place in the heart of man, turneth into hatred. Otherwise, there is also a lawful and commendable anger, namely, in wise men, who are sometimes angry upon good grounds and for just causes, but bear not evil ager long in their bosomes, or in their hearts. Of the word, bosome or lap, see Job 19. On v.27.]
\p
\v 10 Say not, what is (the cause) that the former dayes [The years or times past] were better then these? For thou shouldest inquire wisely after this. [say not, etc. To wit, as murmuring against Gods Providence, and as if you would say, Why doth God govern the World so? What is the cause hereof? Otherwise, it is lawful to lament the wickedness ad misery of the times, being heartily sorrowful, that the world the longer it continueth, the wickeder it growth, and that therefore also plagues and judgments are multiplied.]
\p
\v 11 Wisdom is good with an inheritance; [That is, with riches, which a man inheriteth, or getteth by inheritance. As if he should say, It is an excellent thing for a man to have both wisdom and wealth together in this life] and those that behold the Sun, have benefit (by it0 [that is, those that live in this world, have profit by it, for riches avail not those that are gone out of the world.]
\p
\v 12 For wisdom is for a shadow, (and) money is for a shadow; [The meaning is, that wisdom and temporal wealth serve a man for a defence against hurt or mischief, that may befall him, as a shadow serveth a man for a covering or shelter against the scorching heat of the Sun. Oth. For they are in the shadow of wisdom, and in the shadow of money] but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to the possessors thereof. [that is, herein exceedeth wisdom, and her excellency is far beyond that of money and wealth, in that she giveth life to those that enjoy her. By wisdom here is to be meant true wisdom, which is the true knowledge of God, and of the laws and commandments; this (to wit, this wisdom) giveth life, to wit, everlasting life. But others understand here by life, rest, peace, contentment of mind or heart, which is true life indeed.]
\p
\v 13 Consider the work of God, for who can make that straight which he hath made crooked? [As if he had said, Wilt thou have rest and peace in thy heart and mind, then be therewith contented, that thou kowest, that is the work of God, even that which daily happeneth, and that it is Gods pleasure it should be so: no man can hinder or alter that which God hath once decreed or done, Job 12.14. Therefore we ought not to vex and trouble ourselves about those things which we daily see and hear, seeing they cannot be altered or changed by any counsel or act of man. See Job. 12.14. and above, ch.1.15.]
\p
\v 14 In the day of prosperity [Heb. of good; that is, when it goeth well with thee, when God blesseth thee with much goods or riches] enjoy the thing that is good, [Heb. Be in thing that is good; that is, be contented and cheerful] but in the day of adversity, [Heb. Of evil] look to; [to wit, for as that thou remembrest, that evil also cometh from God, and that thou oughtest therefore to bear it patiently. Oth. Consider, to wit, the work of God, whereof is spoken, v.13. oth. Heed; to wit, the cause, which is the righteousness and providence of God, who oftentimes chastifieth and trieth the godly for their good. Oth. Consider the day of adversity; that is, in prosperity think of adversity, which may befall thee from the hand of God] (for) God maketh the one ever against the other, [Hebr. this over against, or next to that; to wit, day. The meaning is, the day of prosperity and the day of adversity are both from God, and these two contrary times hath he set and appointed one against another, so that a man is not always in prosperity, neither always in adversity; therefore he ought always, both in prosperity, and in adversity to think of a change, enjoying prosperity cheerfully (yet not without looking about him) and bearing adversity patiently, with expectations of better] because man shall not find anything that shall be after him. [to wit, after God; that is, to end, that man might onely look up to Gods providence and disposing, without desiring to search or inquire into this or that thing, without God, or out of God. Oth. After him, to wit, that shall be after that man. Oth. In such a manner should that man should be able to find nothing after him; that is, God hath ordained all things so wisely, as that no man after him is able to invent or devise any thing better.]
\p
\v 15 All these I seen in the dayes of my vanity: [That is, during my vain and transitory life] There is a righteous man that perisheth in his righteousnesse; [that is, when he gave himself to virtue, and therein daily proceeded. Such an one perisheth in his righteousnesse; to wit, whether he be oppressed by wicked men that cannot indure the godly, or whether God take him soon out of this world into a better life, as happened to Josia, 2 Chron.35.23,24.] or on the contrary, there is a wicked man, that prolongeth (his dayes) in his wickedness.
\p
\v 16 Be not too righteous, [That is, be not too strict to search too narrowly into thy neighbours words and actions, and to punish then severely. Others take it in the sence; Do that which thou art commanded to do, and do it faithfully, but do not more then thou art command, or then thy calling requireth] neither count thy self too wise: [this is spoken against curious spirits, that think by their own wisdom to search and find out the deep secrets of God, Rom.12.3. or the desire to know more then God hath revealed to us in his word] why shouldest thou bring desolation upon thy self? [that is, why shouldest thou bring thy self into danger and disgrace, desiring to appear more godly, more virtuous and more wise and understanding then others, by searching and diving too deep into secret mysteries of God, Prov.3.7. Rom.12.3.16.]
\p
\v 17 Be not too wicked, [That is, give not thy self over to gross sins, or let not sin reign in thy mortal body, as the Apostle exhorteth, Rom.6.12.] neither be (too) foolish: why shouldest thou die out of thy time? [As if he should say, thou shouldest else be punished by the Magistrate, and before the natural time of death cometh, be snatcht and taken away from the Earth. Compare Job 15.32. Psal.37.13.]
\p
\v 18 It is good that thou shouldest take hold thereon; To wit, on that, whereof mention is made, v.16.] neither with-draw thine heart from this: [to wit, from that which is, verse 17. Or from that which I shall further say. Some apply both exhortations to that which was spoken in the former verses in general] for he that feareth God, he escapeth all that. [that is, he departeth from both extreams, to wit, from being too righteous, and from being too unrighteous or wicked, (escaping thereby the miseries that are wont to follow thereon) and keepeth the mid-way, wherein all virtue conststeth.]
\p
\v 19 Wisdome strengthened the wise more then ten [That is, many, see Gen.31.7. and Prov.21.22. and24.5. and below chap.9.6. Rulers are in one City.
\p
\v 20 Verily, there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doth good, and sineth not. [Compare, 1 Kings 8. Verse 46,47. 2 Chron.6.36. Prov.20.9. 1 John 1.8.]
\p
\v 21 Also give not thine heart unto all words that are spoken, lest thou hear thy servant curse thee. [That is, examine not too narrowly, to know what men say of thee, neither regard it over-much: for if thou shouldest do so, it might easily be, that thou shouldest hear sore against thy will, that thine own servants speak ill of thee. Many things are spoken, thou must let passé unregarded.]
\p
\v 22 For thine (own) heart [That is, thine own conscience] hath also oftentimes confessed, that thou hast cursed others. [that have wronged thee, or, which thou thoughtest (though false information of others) that they had done thee wrong.]
\p
\v 23 All these have I proved by wisdom; I said, [To wit, with my self] I will get wisdom, [that is, I thought, I imagined, I perswaded my self, that I should get or obtain perfect wisdom] but it was (yet) far from me. [for a man can never attain to a perfect knowledge of all things, and the causes thereof.]
\p
\v 24 That which is far off, and exceeding deep, [Hebr. Deep, deep, see Gen.25. on v.30.] who shall find it (out?) [oth. Thus; it is far that which hath been; that is, that which was long ago, men have no great knowledge thereof: And what knowledge (I pray) can they have of things that are altogether deep and hidden? As how God governeth the world, and all things that are therein, and especially what shall come to passé in future times, see in the book of Job, chapters 38,39,40,41. And Rom.11.33,34.]
\p
\v 25 I turned me about, and my heart [To wit, with my thoughts] to know, and to search, and to seek (out) wisdom, and a conclusion; [the Hebrew word signifieth the shutting up of a speech, which from certain premises is infer”d and summ”d up by the conclusion] and to know the wickedness of folly, and the foolishness of madnesses. [oth. And foolishness (and) madnesses.]
\p
\v 26 And I found a thing more bitter then death, a woman, whose heart (is) nets and yarn, and her hands are bonds: [Heb. Snares and nets; such as are wont to be spread for wild beasts, to catch them in. He speaketh of an unchast and immodest woman, who by her crafty and sweet deceitful words, seeketh to insnare men in uncleannesse, to catch them in her nets, and to hold them fast, when she hath got to them, see Prov.2.16.17. and 5.3,6. And 6.34. and 7.6,&c. Andch.9.13. Such a woman is more to be shunned avoided then death itself] whose is good before the face of God shall escape from her; [As if he had said, No man can escape the deceit of such a wicked woman, unless God by his special grace and aid deliver him from her, as he delivered Joseph from unchastise wife of Potiphar, see ch.2.26.] on the contrary, the sinner [that is, such a one as doth daily give up himself to the committing gross sins. See Psa. 1. O ver.1.] shall be taken by her. [see Prov. 6.26. and 7.23. and 22.14.]
\p
\v 27 Behold, this I have found, saith the Preacher, the one by the other, to find (out) the conclusion. [That is, to come to the result and close of all.]
\p
\v 28 Which my soul [That is, I] yet seeketh, but I have not found it; [the meaning of these words seemeth to be this; After I had sought a long while, to know the true ground of all, I found nothing else but this, that as yet I had found nothing; that is, I find and perceive by certain and grounded experience, that I want the knowledge of very many things. Oth. That which my soul yet seeketh, I have not found the same] one man [Hebr. Adam; that is, one man. The opposition sheweth, that Adam signifieth here a man] have i found of a thousands, [to wit, of a thousand men] but a woman (indued) with all these things: Intimating, that there are very few men found, that are wise, good, prudent, and of great knowledge and understanding, but yet far fewer women so qualified and conditioned, see Prov. 31.10. The words one and none are here taken for few, and fewer, to wit, in comparison of the rest; for else many godly, both men and women, are mentioned both in the old and new testament.]
\p
\v 29 Lo, this onely have I found, that God hath made men upright, but they [To wit, men] have sought (out) [yea, and they seek them still, in regard they are fallen from the glorious state, wherein they were created and set by God] many inventions. [to wit, wicked, naughty, evil devises or practices. As if he had said, But this is a sure thing, that all mankind, both men and women, are corrupt and sinful; however no blame can be laid upon God, for he made man good, and after his own image; but all the blame lieth upon man himself, who brought himself, and all his posterity into that wretched and damnable condition, by the seduction and instigation of the Devil, and by his own wilful disobedience.]
\c 8
\s An exhortation to yield all due obedience to the King, or to the Magistrate, v.2,&c. That man should not be much troubled at approaching evil, 6. Next he relateth yet some other vanities of this life; as namely, how subjects are oppressed by evil Magistrates, 9. That many men continue in sin, because they are not presently punished, 11. However, they shall not escape punishment, 12. Though oftentimes the godly are afflicted, and the wicked prosper in this world, 14. Thereupon he concludeth, that it is best in this life for a man to enjoy the gifts of God with cheerfulness, 15. Laying aside the necessary and superfluous care for the things of this life, 16.
\p
\v 1 WHO is like the wise? [Divers, both Hebrew and also other translations join the first words of this verse to the last verse of the seventh chapter] and who knoweth the interpretation of things? [As if he said, it is most certain, that a wise man excelleth all other men in worth and dignity, because he can interpret and answer all things well, and upon good grounds] the wisdom of men lighteneth his face; [that is, it maketh him courteous and friendly. Oth. It giveth him the light of knowledge, so that he seeketh very plainly and distinctly, how he ought to walk and what he ought to do, or to leave undone, see above, ch.2.14,] and the surlinesse [or cruelty. Heb. Strength or hardness] of his face is changed (thereby). [to wit, by wisdom; that is, he layeth the fiercenesse or cruelty aside, which commonly appeareth, and is seen in the face. See Deuterom.28.50. and Judges 14.14. and the Annotations there.]
\p
\v 2 I (say) give heed to [Hebr. Keep. It is a short abrupt phrase] the mouth of the King; [that is, that which the King saith, or that which he commandeth thee. The word, mouth, signifieth often a sentence, or words: and signifieth often commands or precepts, as Exod.17.1. compare, Prov.24.21.] but according to the nature of the oath of God. [that is, obey the King or the magistrate so, as that in the mean while thou forsake not, nor forget the duty and oath whereby thou art principally bound and ingaged unto God. Oth. In regard of the oath of God, or because of the oath of God, or the oath of Gods sake.]
\p
\v 3 Make no hast to go away from his [To wit, the Kings] face; [to wit, through impatience, when he enjoyneth thee somewhat that peaseth thee not; bewraying by thy speedy going away, that thou art loth to do that which the King injoineth thee. Oth. To go away, that is, to depart from his service, and to leave him. [Some understand this and that which followeth, of God] persist not in an evil thing; [that is, maintain not a bad cause, stand not out in it, plead not for it. See the annotate. 2 Kings 23. On ver.3. or do not obstinately persist in refusing to obey the Kings command] for he doth whatsoever pleaseth him, [to wit, the King, so that whensoever he pleaseth, he be avenged on thee, and when he is once angered, he will soon punish thee.]
\p
\v 4 Where the word [That is, the command] of a King is, there is dominion; and who shall say unto him, what doest thou? [that is, why doest thou enjoin me this? The meaning is, when once the King commandeth his servants to punish thee, who dare oppose or with-stand his power and swaying authority.]
\p
\v 5 Whoso keepeth the Commandment, [to wit, the commandment or precepts of the King, which is not repugnant to the will and commandment of God] shall feel no evil; [that is, he shall not incure the displeasure and punishment of God, or of the King, or of the Magistrate. Compare Rom. 13.3. Heb. Shall not know (both) time and manner. [that is, a wise man knoweth how to fit and frame himself to every occasion or opportunity he meeteth with, so as not to offend either God or the King.]
\p
\v 6 For every purpose hath time and manner: Because the evil of man is much over him. [that is, man is subject to much misery and infirmity, therefore he ought to be wise and prudent in his affairs.]
\p
\v 7 For he knoweth not what shall cometh to passé: for who shall certify him, when [Or how] how it shall come to pass? [that is, he knoweth not what God will do to him, as he like wise knoweth not the time when: and therefore he cannot prevent it. Therefore he ought continually to beg to God, an holy prudence, that he may know how to behave himself aright, compare above, ch.6.12.]
\p
\v 8 There is no man that hath dominion over the Spirit, [To wit, when death seizeth upon man] to keep the spirit in; [that is, to keep the breath, or the soul, or the spirit of life in the body, that it should not depart out of it. The Hebrew word signifieth as much as to shut and keep in a prison] neither hath any dominion over the day of death: [or, in the day of death: [or, in the day of death. That is, when death cometh to assault life, and that once the day of death is come, there is no way or means to escape death, compare Job 14.5. and Psal. 39.6.] also (there is) no weapon [that is, carnal weapons. Oth. No discharge] in this battle, [that is, when life and death strive together, or fight one against another] neither shall wickedness deliver its masters. [as we commonly say, iniquity or justice, smiteth its own master. Oth. The disquiet stir; as if he had said, that a man at one time that intendeth this thing, at another time that thing, and is very busy and restless to attain to his intent and purpose, this likewise will not avail or profit him against death.]
\p
\v 9 All these have I seen, when I applied mine heart unto all (or every) work that is under the Sun. There is a time that (one) man ruleth over (another) man, to his (own) hurt. [to wit, either to the hurt of him that ruleth, or of him over whom he ruleth. Or, (I saw also) a time, wherein, &c. To wit, when an unrighteous or unjust man is advanced into the place of authority, and swayeth the sceptre; whereas those that execute that office, ought chiefly and above all to seek the good and welfare of their subjects, Rom. 13.4.]
\p
\v 10 So have I seen the wicked that were buried, [That is, that were put in oblivion] and (those that) came and went out of the place of the holy, they were forgotten in that City (in) which they had done judgment; [understand here by the place of the holy one, the Temple, wherein the holy God dwelleth. To come, or to enter in, and to go forth, is as much here as converse, or to be conversant in the house of God, and to exercise ones self in godlinesse. Others understand here by the holy place the place of Judicature, where the judges sit in Gods room or place, and represent the person of god, God being there present with them, yea bring president in the midst of them. oth. Understand this verse of the wicked, and render it thus; and then I saw the wicked, that they were buried and perished, and went away from the place of the holy, and were forgotten in the City wherein they had done so: that is, had governed wickedly] This [to wit, this inconsistency and unthankfulness of the people] is also vanity.
\p
\v 11 Because judgment (concerning) an evil deed is not speedily done, therefore the heart of the children of men is full in them to do evil. [As if he had said, because God often delayeth his righteous judgment concerning the wicked, therefore they conceive that they shall always remain unpunished, and therefore they fall to all manner of wickedness and profaneness, compare Psal.50. on v.21.]
\p
\v 12 Though a sinner do evil an hundred (times), and (God) prolong his (dayes) yet I know surely that it shall go well with those that fear God, [To wit, with a fillal or child-like fear] that fear before his face. [that are said to offend him, see Psal. 37.9,10,11,12,18,19,20. Prov.1.33. Isa.3.10.]
\p
\v 13 But it shall not go well with the wicked, [Understand withal, but he shall be punished at last, either here or hereafter] neither shall he prolong (his) dayes: [that is, he shall not live long, at least in quietnesse, and with a good conscience, which is true life indeed] he shall be as a shadow, [which soon passeth away, see Psalm 144.4. oth. He shall not prolong his dayes, as a shadow; which becomes long towards the Sun-setting as the Sun declineth or goeth down] because he feareth not before the face of God.
\p
\v 14 There is (yet) a vanity which is done upon the earth: That there are just men unto whom it happeneth, [Heb. Toucheth, hitteth] according to the work of the wicked, [That is, as if they had done the works of wicked men] and there are wicked men unto whom it happeneth, according to the work of righteous. [the meaning is, sometimes it fareth ill with the godly, and well with the wicked. See Psam. 73.11,12,13,14.] I say [or, I said,] that this is also vanity. [to wit, because no man can be assured, that he shall always prosper in this world, because of this virtue and piety. Oth. This is also vanity; that is, this is a vain and absurd thing, according to thing judgment of man.]
\p
\v 15 Therefore I commended mirth, because a man hath nothing better under the Sun, [That is, as much as concerneth this temporal life] then to eat, and drink and to be merry; [but so as that he always have the fear of God before his eyes. See below, chap.12 verse 13. Compare above, chap.2.24. and 3.12,22. And 5.18. and 9.7.] for that shall cleave unto him of his labour, [that is, that shall be his portion] the dayes of his life which God giveth him under the Sun.
\p
\v 16 When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to consider the business is done upon the earth, that a man neither by day, nor by night seeth sleep with his eyes; [That is, sleepeth not, to wit, by reason of care and trouble, which a man hath and undergoeth, for and about temporal riches. See above. Chap.2.vers.23.24.]
\p
\v 17 Then I beheld all the work of God; that a man cannot find out [To wit, by his own wit or understanding] the work that is done under the Sun: [to wit, gods providence concerning the things that are done in the world, as namely, how this can stand with the righteous government of god, to punish the holy oftentimes so severely, ad on the contrary, to blesse the wicked so exceedingly] to seek which (out0 [that is, to understand which thing; to wit, to know how all things in the world are wisely and prudently governed by God] a man laboureth, but he shall not find it out; yea, if a wise man also should say, [to wit, with himself in his heart] that he knew it, yet (surely) he shall not be able to find it out.
\c 9
\s The Preacher relateth certain things that happen both to the godly et to the wicked, v.1,&c. Therefore he concludeth, that it is best for a man to enjoy the gifts of God with cheerfulness, 7. And to be diligent in his calling, 10. And to leave the issue to God, 11. Next he teacheth, that man knoweth not the time of his death or misery, 12. Lastly, he exhorteth wisdom in the highest degree, 13.
\p
\v 1 Surely all this have I said (up) [Hebr. Given, as above chap.7.2.] in mine heart, [that is, I have taken all this to heart] that I might clearly understand [or, might declare] all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works are in the hand of God, [that is, are subject to the government of God] neither doth man know either love or hatred (by) that is before his [to wit, mans] face. [that is, when a man shall judge according to outward things, which he seeth daily doth befall both good and bad; then no man can conclude or judge from thence, whether he be in Gods favour or displeasure, yea or no; much less can he conclude or judge it of another; for the godly are in this world as well, yea sometimes more plunged then the wicked, as v.2. further followeth. Concerning the certainty or assurance which the children of God have of his love towards them, of that is elsewhere spoken.]
\p
\v 2 All (or every) thing happeneth to (them) [To wit, to the righteous and wise] as to all (others): [to wit, to the unrighteous and foolish. Hebr. All like as to all] one and the same thing [oth. One accident, as above chap.2.v.14. and below v.3.] (happeneth) to the righteous and to the wicked, to the good and to the clean, as to the unclean: as well to him that offereth, [that is, to him that diligently heedeth the worship of God] as to him that offereth not, as to the good, so (also) to the sinner: to him that sweareth, [that is, rashly, or fastly, making no conscience of perjury] like as to him that feareth an oath. [to wit, a rash oath, fearing to offend God thereby. The meaning is, adversity befalleth the righteous, as well as the wicked, and on the contrary prosperity befalleth the wicked as well as the godly.]
\p
\v 3 This is an evil among all that happeneth under the Sun, [As he had said, this is that which sorely grieveth and vexeth a man] that one and the same thing [see above v.2.] (happeneth) unto all, [to wit, men] and that so the heart of the children of men is full of wickedness, and that in their life [that is, during their life, or while they live] there are madness in their heart: and after that [that is, after all the madness which they have practised and committed all their life long] they must (go) to the dead. [to wit, go; that is, they must die. Compare Prov. 2.18. and 9.18.]
\p
\v 4 For him that is accompanied with all the living [That is, for him that is yet alive] there is hope, [as if he should say, as long as a man is yet to live, he hath hope that it shall go well with him in this life, but when he is once dead, the hope is out, or at an end. Oth. For who is there that is exampled? To wit, from death, or that he should not die. Some take the words of v.4,5,6,7,8,910. As being spoken in the person of the wicked, and begin this fourth verse thus: For (say the wicked) for him that is yet, &c. Others attributes these words unto Solomon, whose opinion we follow] (for a living dog is better [or is in a better condition] then a dead lion.) [Hebr. It is better to, or, for a living dog, &c. That is, he is happier; to wit, because he may enjoy life.]
\p
\v 5 For the living know that they shall die: [The meaning is, because the living know that they must die, therefore do they with merry heart enjoy these temporal goods, as long as they may] but the dead know nothing at all: [namely, of that which is done here upon Earth, as Salomon further sheweth, v.6. For his purpose is not here to prove that the souls of men after the death of the body, perish and come to nothing. See Job 14.21.] they also have no reward more, [that is, they enjoy no more any comfort of their labour, in eating and drinking, as they did while they were alive] but the memory of them is forgotten. [that is, is had in oblivion; to wit, with men, namely, so far as concerneth these earthly things; no man is careful, or enclined to do them service, or to pleasure them.]
\p
\v 6 Also their love, also their hatred, also their envy is already perished: [That is, they know not what there is done under this world, neither do they enquire after it, therefore they love no man in this world, neither do they hate, or envy any man] neither have they any portion more in (this) age, [compare this with that which is said above 3.11, and see the annotate. There. Oth. For ever; that is, never in this life] on all that is done under the Sun.
\p
\v 7 Go thy way (then) [To wit, whiles thou art yet alive] eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a good heart: [that is, with cheerfulness. See Judg.16. on v.25. and 1 Kings 21. On v.7. The meaning is, enjoy cheerfully that which God hath given thee by means of thy labour; for Salomon speaketh here to the godly] for God already delighteth in thy works. [to wit, because thou fearest him and gettest thy living by the labour whereunto thou art called; and consequently it is needless to vex and torment thy self with vain carking and distracting care: rest thy self satisfied and contented in the wise providence of almighty God, and in the love and affection which he heareth unto thee.]
\p
\v 8 Let thy garments be always [To wit, as long as thou mayest have it so. For there may come a time that we may grieve with those that grieve. See above chap.7.2.] white, [that is, pure, clean] and let no oil [to wit, sweet-smelling oil, see the annotate. Ruth 3. On v.3. and Luke 7.46.] be wanting upon thine head. [that is, be merry or joyful. A token of this joy or mirth was in times past, the wearing of pure white garments, and the anointing of the head with sweet-smelling oil or ointment.]
\p
\v 9 Enjoy life with the wife whom thou lovest, [ Hebr. See life, etc. That is, enjoy the delights and sweetness of this life all manner of ways, as much as thou canst or maiest with the leave of God; and with peace of good conscience. See Job 7, on v.7. here life signifieth as much as good and joyful life all the dayes of thy vain life, [Hebr. Of the life of thy vanity; that is, as long as thy vain and transitory life lasteth] which [to wit, dayes. Compare above chap.8. on v.15. Others understand by, with, which wife] (God) hath given thee under the Sun, all thy vain days; for this is thy portion in this life, and of thy labour which thou labourest under the Sun. [that is, that which thou mayest enjoy of the good which thou gotten by thy labour.]
\p
\v 10 Whatsoever thine hand findeth [See Lev.25. on v.28. and Judg.9. on v.33.] to do, [to wit, whatsoever is good, and tendeth to the furthering and advancing of thy calling] do (it) with might, [that is, do it as diligently and as well as thou canst] for there is no work nor deliberation, [or, reason, understanding, apprehension] nor knowledge, wisdom in the grave, whither thou goest. [that is, when thou art dead, thou shalt not be able to do any of all those good things, which thou doest in this life.]
\p
\v 11 I turned me, and saw under the Sun, that the race belongeth not to the swift, nor the battle to the champions, neither also meat [Hebr. Bread] to the wise, nor also riches to men of understanding, [he speaketh of successful race, whereby a man out-runneth the danger: and of successful battle, whereby man getteth victory. The same is not always on the side of swift; So neither is the victory always on the side of the strong and valiant champions, etc. But with those unto whom God giveth his blessing] nor also favour to well-knowing men [as if he had said, to attain unto favour with men, thereunto it availeth not for a man to be skilled or able and well experience? Understand withal, unless God add a blessing thereunto] but that time and chance happeneth to them all. [that is, that which God from all eternity hath ordained, the same shall and must come to pass at such a time, as God hath ordained it should be, and likewise in such a way and manner, as he hath ordained it shall be done. For Solomon speaketh not of any uncertain chance or casualty, but of such a one which is ruled and governed by God.]
\p
\v 12 That also knoweth not his time, as the fishes that are caught with the evil net; [That is, with an evil net. For when the fishes are caught, they are then killed, Thus straightway in this verse time is called evil, in regard of the evil that befalleth a man in it] man knoweth not his time, [to wit, the time of his death, or the time of misery, that shall come upon him: yea he knows it no more then the silly fishes that swim i the water know what danger is at hand, or approaching unto them. see the annotate. Psa.81. on v.16.] and as the birds are caught with the snare: as they, (so)are the children of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.
\p
\v 13 This wisdom have I seen also under the Sun, and it was great with me. [That is, in my judgment.]
\p
\v 14 There was a little City, and a few men were in it; and (there) was come a great King against it, and he compassed it about, and he built great bulwarkes against it.
\p
\v 15 And (there) was found in it a poor wise man, who by his wisdom delivered the city; but no man remembered that same poor. [That is, no man gave him thanks, as they ought to have done, for his good counsel, whereupon the deliverance followed. Oth. No man thought on that poor man; that is, no man ever thought that that poor man was so wise.]
\p
\v 16 Then said I, wisdom is better then strength, [Compare Prov. 21.22. and24.5. above chap.7.19.] although the poor mans wisdom was despised, and his words were not heard. [that is, were not esteemed.]
\p
\v 17 The words of the wise ought to be heard in quiet, [Hebr. In rest] more then they cry of him that ruleth over fools. [as if he should say, they ought to be heard with greater attention, then the cries of fools. Or the words may be taken in this sence, those that keep themselves quiet, ought to be sooner and rather heard, then those that make a great noise, when they are among fools.]
\p
\v 18 Wisdome is better then weapons of war: [Hebr. Then the vessels, or instruments of war] but one sinner destroyeth much good. [that is, one foolish man giving ill counsel. Yea even when a wise man committeth an error, many good things misery thereby, and likewise his own reputation and credit. By the word sinner may be also understood here, a bold presumptuous man, that relying on himself, whether it be in his own wisdom, or i his own strength, unadvisedly assaulteth his Enemy, whereby he endangereth not only himself, but also in the manner many more with him.]
\c 10
\s Salomon recommendeth wisdom to ever man, and adviseth ever one to beware of folly, v.1.etc. and he instructeth how men should behave themselves in the presence of the King, when he is offended, 4. Although it often fall out that wicked men are advanced to honour by the King, and the Godly despised, 5. Then he speaketh of the imprudence of some men, 8. And he speaketh again, how profitable that wisdom is, and hurtfull that folly is, 10. Etc. Especially in a Prince, 16.etc. who may not be cursed, 20.
\p
\v 1 A dead Fly causeth the ointment of the Apothecarie, [That is, an ointment or oil, that is prepared and made very artificially and curiously by the skill and art of the Apothecarie] to stink (and) bubble up: [Hebr. Flies of death causeth to stink; that is, every dead fly causeth to stink. The meaning is, though a fly be but a very little creature, yet it causeth a sweet-smelling oil or ointment to stink; to wit, if it fall into it, and continue there] (so doth) a little folly a (man) that is precious in wisdom, (and) in power. [that is, because of his wisdom and honour. The meaning is, so is also a little folly the cause, that a man of note and esteem loseth his reputation and credit.]
\p
\v 2 As wise mans heart is his right (hand) [That is, a wise man manageth and ordereth his affairs well and wisely, pondering all things before-hand in his heart] but a fools heart is at his learnt hand. [that is, he manageth his affairs foolishly. We ought in no wise to conclude from these words, that Salomon here would infer, that the heart of the wise men is or lieth otherwise in their bosom then the hearts of fools doth in theirs; for the heart both of wise men & also of fools lieth in the midst of the breast, tending or declining a little toward the left side. It is a similitude taken from the right hand and left, in the performing of any business, either well or ill. The most and the greatest part of men use the right hand to do a thing well; so that when a man doth a thing well and with wisdom or judgment (which proceedeth from the heart) it seemeth, that he then hath his heart lying at his right hand, to manage his affairs aright; On the contrary, he that manageth his affairs not well, nor conveniently, or wisely, he seemeth to have heart lying at his left hand.]
\p
\v 3 And also when the fool walketh on the way, his heart falleth (him): [That is, then the infirmities of his heart appear and are discovered] and he saith to every one, [that is, to every one that seeth him go or walk in the streets] that he is a fool. [that is, he doth sufficiently bewray (to wit, by his gate, behaviour, apparel and gesture) that he is none of the wisest. Oth. He saith of every one, that he (to wit, that man of whom he speaketh) is a fool]
\p
\v 4 When the spirit [That is, the anger. See the annotate. Judg. 8. On v.3.] of the Ruler riseth up against thee, leave not thy place; [that is, thy calling, office, state and condition of life. Oth. Leave not thy place; that is, behave and carry thy self, as it becometh a subject to do, namely, submissive and humble] for it is necessary, it purifieth great sins. [which otherwise a Ruler in his wrath might commit against thee; therefore seek rather to asswage and soften his anger with sweet and gently words. It may also be taken in this sense, soft and humble words practice, that is, prevent, or remove, or cover great offences or trespasses, which thou mightiest have committed against the Prince. Oth. Softness, or meekness, or mildness, [that is, meek or mild yielding) pacifieth great offences.]
\p
\v 5 There is (yet) an evil (which) I have seen under the Sun, as an error which proceedeth [That is, is committed] from the face of the Ruler: [that is, a great fault, that is, as are the faults that proceed from Princes, or from the great ones of the land; for the greater and higher any man is in his place and authority, the greater and more hurtfull are also the faults that are committed by him.]
\p
\v 6 A fool [or the fool] is set in great [or, in many] dignities: [that is, sots or idiots that are altogether unfit to govern and rule others, and to bear office, are advanced to places of honour and command. It pleaseth God sometimes that such should govern cities and countries, that he might punish them by such kind of governors. Hebr. Folly is, etc. That is, such a man that is folly it self] but the rich, [to wit, in wisdom, or those that are rich in understanding, or those that are both rich and wise; that is, that have knowledge and understanding enough, to be in place of command, or to bear office well] sit in low place. [that is, in low degree, in humility.]
\p
\v 7 I have seen servants [that is, such as had a servile and foolish spirit, or nature, or that were descended from servants and slaves] on hors-back: and Princes [that is, valiant, understanding, wise men, that have such a spirit, or such a courage as Princes have, or at least ought to have] going as servants upon the ground. [that is, going on foot, yea even ministering unto others.]
\p
\v 8 Whoso diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: [That is, he that intendeth mischief to another, it shall fare ill with him, by him just judgement of God. See Prov.26.27. Solomon sheweth in this and in the 9. Verse, by four similitudes, how dangerous and hurtfull imprudence and want of circumspection is. See Psa.62. on. V.4.] and whoso breaketh throw a wall, a Serpent shall bite him. [serpents lie commonly hid in the clifts and chinks, or in the holes of walls, when the walls are broken down, that they appear, and come to light, and bite or sting those whom they first meet with. It seemeth that Solomon here saith that those that break either the Ecclesiastical or Political laws and ordinances, they shall go unpunished.]
\p
\v 9 Whoso carrieth way [Or removeth] stones, [to wit, great stones, that are too heavy for him to remove. Oth. The stones which separate his neighbours landmarks or bounds from his own, thereby to enlarge his own ground. See Deu 27.17.] shall endure grief thereby: [the meaning is, as those that lift up heavy stones, or remove them, or carry them from one place to another, do labour painfully: so all offices and high places have their difficulty] whoso cleaveth wood, shall be in danger thereby. [so as that in cleaving he may easily hurt or wound either his hand, or or foot, or some other member of his body. Oth. He shall grow warm thereby. In this signification is the Hebrew word taken, 1 Kings 1.2. The meaning is, that businesses or great weight and concernment are not performed, with great trouble, much sweat and difficulty.]
\p
\v 10 If he [To wit, that he will cleave wood with a blunt axe] hath made the iron [that is, an iron tool, whether it be an axe or such like too] blunt, and he do not whet the edge, [Heb. The face; that is, the fore most part which cleaveth the wood] then must he [to wit, that he will cleave with a blunt axe] put forth more strength: [Heb. Then must he strengthen the powers] but wisdom is an excellent thing to make (something) straight. [that is, wisdom is the best help or means to make a thing right or straight indeed. Oth. But wisdom is an excellent direction; that is, when a men would do a business concernment well and in a right manner; then it is not strength and force as cleaving of wood but wisdom and understanding that doth the thing.]
\p
\v 11 If the serpent before the inchantment be done, [Or before the inchantment, before she is inchanted. Hebr. Without inchantment] then there is no benefit for the most excellent (inchanter). [that is, the inchanters inchantment doth not benefit him at all, but her sting is deadly. See Psa.58.v.5. and 140.v.4. Hebr. Then there is nothing left for the mister of the tongue. That is, for him that useth his tongue to charming or inchanting. See the like phrase Gen.14.13. and Psa.140.12. Understand withal, in the like manner it will not benefit a subject, that he then first seeketh and endevoureth to practice his Prince with treating and submissive words, after the Prince hath begun to punish him in his wrath and displeasure: and so likewise in general, that it is in vain to use means against an evil or mischief, when it is too late. Oth. If the serpent bite, not being charmed, then the babbler is not better,]
\p
\v 12 The words of a wise mans mouth are gracious: [Heb. Are favour; that is, they make a wise man gracious; and consequently they are advantageous and profitable unto him] but the lips of the fool swallow up himself [that is, they bring him into trouble.]
\p
\v 13 the beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his mouth [That is, of the words of the mouth] is wicked madness, [that is, is mischievous madness; because his madness increaseth still more and more.]
\p
\v 14 The fool maketh many words; [That is, he maketh great deal of chatting of that which he intendeth to do, telling others that he will, and how he will do it, as if he could effect and accomplish whatsoever he will or intendeth. But he shall be deceived is his own vain hope. See Jam.4,13,14.] (but) a man knoweth not what it is that shall come to pass; and what [or, how] shall come to pass after him, who shall tell it to him?
\p
\v 15 The labour of the fools maketh every one of them [Hebr. Him; that is, every one of them] weary, because they know not (how) to go to the City. [that is, a fool may be compared to him, that desiring to go to a city, knoweth not the way to it, and therefore with much adore he goeth thither through crooked and by-ways. The meaning is, he knoweth not how, or in what manner he shall effect and accomplish that which he intendeth or purposeth. Others take the words of this verse in this sence: fools, or many men void of understanding are often careful and troubled about many business of high and mighty concernment, wherein they exceedingly vex and torment themselves, whereas indeed they are ignorant of common and trivial things, which are as plain and as well known as the streets, or the way or common road leading to a city, which is even known unto children and simple persons. It seemeth to be a proverb, whereby great ignorance is meant or descried.]
\p
\v 16 Wo to thee, (o) land, [That is, the inhabitants of the land] whose King is a child: [whether in years or in understanding, see Isa.3.4,] and whose Princes [that is, Counsellors, Officers, Judges, and the like persons in authority, or bearing great offices] eat [that is, feast and make good cheer] in the morning. [that is, at an unseasonable and unfit time; to wit, at such times as they ought to fit in judgement, and to be in counsel. See jer.21.12. compare Isa.16.11. and Amos 6.4.]
\p
\v 17 . Blessed art thou (o) land, whose King is the son of the Nobles: [That is, that is of a noble birth, of a noble stock or race. Understand withal, and that is trained up in piety, wisdom, and all virtue. Hebr. A son of white ones; that is, of nobles, that were wont to wear white garments. See Nhem.2. on. V. 16. In Prov.22.29. the ignoble or mean men are called darkened, or obscure ones] and whose princes eat in due seasons, [that is, at the time when men are wont to eat; to wit, after they have dispatched their necessary business] for strength, and not for (much) drinking. [that is, to strengthen the body, not to be drunk.]
\p
\v 18 Through great laziness [Hebr. Two laziness; that is, double laziness, or laziness of both hands] the ceiling growth weak: oth. The rafters, or beams sink; that is, the house goeth to decay, and all goeth to waste] and through slackness [or letting down] of the hands the house becometh leaking thorough. [or the house leaketh through. Understand withal, how much more shall the land perish and come to nought, where careless and negligent princes, and such as are given to all manner of licentiousness, bear rules.]
\p
\v 19 Feasts [Hebr. Bread, as Dan.5.1.]are made [Hebr. They are making] for a laugh, [that is, for merriment, to be joyful and merry together] and wine rejoiceth the living: and money answereth all things. [or money causeth all things to answer: that is, it maketh every thing to be present. All things are under the obedience or command of money; therefore every one ought to be diligent and careful, that by his honest labour, and by the use of lawful means, he may gather something afore-hand, and lay up somewhat in store.]
\p
\v 20 Curse not the King, even in thy thought, [Or, in thy conscience, or heart. As if he had said, Though it fareth thus in the Courts of Kings and Princes, yet do not think or speak any evil of them: yea, even not in the innermost and secretest place of thine house, as is further explained in the following words. Compare Exod.22.28.] neither curse the rich in the innermost (part) of thy bed-chamber; for the fowls of heaven would carry the voice away, [to wit, unto the Kings, who should be certified thereof in a most wonderful manner] and the winged (creatures) [Hebr. The Lord, or the possessor of wings of feathers: that is, the creatures that have wings, as Prov. Chap.1. on v.17.] shall make the word [or the matter] known. [to wit, unto the King; who will punish thee, when he heareth that thou hast cursed him. The meaning is, speak not evil of the King, or of those that are in authority, for it will not long lie hid, it will out at last, though the fowls of the air should be means or the instruments to bring it out, or discover it. Kings and Princes have many eyes, as well as they have long hands.]

\s AN exhortation to liberality unto the poor, without regarding their unworthiness, v.1,etc. Having the providence of God always before our eyes, 5 yet without neglecting the taking of pains, 6. Life is sweet unto men, yet there are more evil dayes then good, 7. An exhortation unto young men, that they would always, in the midst of their pleasures and delights think of the day of judgement, 9.
\p
\v 1 Cast thy bread upon the water: [That is, do well unto every one, both to those whom thou knowest, and also to those whom thou knowest not. Hebr. Upon the face of the water, or of the waters, meaning, by the water, the poor, who have nothing wherewith to recompense a man again, so that it seemeth to be lost, whatever is given unto them. so we are likewise used to say, of a thing which we conceive to be lost and gone. It is all one, as if it were cast into water, or thrown into the sea] for thou shalt find it after many dayes. [Hebr. After multitude of dayes; that is, after many dayes are expired. The meaning is, God will restore it unto thee again, yet often times also the man himself, unto whom long before thou hast shewed some kindness or relief.]
\p
\v 2 give a portion [to wit, thine almes or thy bread] to seven, [a certain number for uncertain, as Prov. 6.v.16. Mich.5.5. so are likewise the words following, and also to eight, to be understood. Christ saith, Give to every one that asketh, luke 6.30. compare deut.15.7,8.] urea also to eight, for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon earth. [as if he should say, the time may come, that thou shalt be bereaved of all that thou hast, and be made a beggar. Then shalt thou with, that others would afford the liberal assistance; Do thou then likewise so unto others. See Luke 16.9. Galat.6.9. 2 Corinth.9.10.]
\p
\v 3 When the clouds are grown full, then they pour down [Heb. Then they empty] showers of rain upon the earth; [intimating, that the rich ought plentifully to shew their liberality unto the poor, as the rain doth plentifully water the dry ground, without distinction of places or fields: God causeth his rain to fall on the evil, as well as on the good] as the tree falleth toward the South, or as it falleth toward the North, in the place where the tree falleth, there shall it be. [the meaning is, as a tree that once falleth, or is felled, riseth not again, nor beareth any more fruit: so like wise when we are once dead, be it in what state or condition soever according to the soul, we shall not rise again, to enter again into this temporal life; so that we are dead, we shall not be able to give or communicate any thing unto the poor; and therefore we ought to do good, while we are alive. See Galat.6.10.]
\p
\v 4 Whoso observed the winds, he shall not sow, and whoso regardeth the clouds, he shall not reap. [As if he should say, he that too curiously mindeth wind and weather, and from sometime to time still looketh for better weather, not intending to sow, still he hath weather holly according to his mind, he will not easily fall upon the work of sowing, but will let flip the fittest season and opportunity of sowing: so likewise he that in harvest time, or in the time of reaping, too much regardeth wind and weather, will neglect also the seasonable time and opportunity of reaping. Some apply these words to the distribution of almes, thus: So likewise, if a man should too ferupulously think of all changes and alterations of times, as if he should think that he himself might grow poor, &c. Or, if he should think of the unworthiwhileness and unthankfulnesse of the poor, &c. He that ferupleth those things, he will never give almes, and by doing so, he will never do that which he ought to do.]
\p
\v 5 As thou knowest not what is the way of the wind, [To wit, whence it cometh, and whither it goeth, how long and how mightily it will blow out of one part or corner of the world, Job 3.8.] (or) of what fashion (or quality) the bones are in the womb of a (woman) with child: [Heb. Of a full (woman). By the bones here must be understood the whole bulk or fruit, or the child in the mothers womb, compare Psa 139.15,16.] so thought knowest not the work of God, who worketh all. That is, thou knowest not, neither indeed canst know the providence of God, nor understand or apprehend what he in his most wise counsel hath decreed; how long thou shalt have and keep thy goods: therefore leave thy unnecessary and profitable care, and do good unto the poor, as long as God granteth thee life and power to do it.]
\p
\v 6 In the morning [that is, betimes] sow thy seed, and in the evening with-draw not thine hand: [to wit, from sowing, or from casting the seed into the ground] for thou knowest not what shall be right, either this or that; [that is whether that will grow, which thou hast sowen in the evening, or whether that will better grow which thou hast sowen in the morning] or whether they both shall be good together. [Hebr. As one, that is, alike good.]
\p
\v 7 Moreover, [Or truly, or surely. As if he had said, it is true indeed, etc.] the light [that is, this temporal life, that a man may behold the light of the Sun] is sweet, [that is, it is pleasing and acceptable unto man] and it is good, [that is, a pleasant thing] for the eyes to behold the Sun.
\p
\v 8 But if a man live many years, (and) rejoice in them all, then let him also remember the dayes of darkness; [That is, let him remember death]; for the dead are laid in the grave, where there is darkness] for they shall be many; (and) whatsoever is come, [that is, whatsoever hath befallen him] is vanity. [that is, he shall be sain to confess, that there is nothing permament and perpetual in this life, wherein a man may fully rejoice.]
\p
\v 9 Rejoyce, O young man, in thy youth and let thine heart cheer thee, [Heb. Do thee good] in the dayes of thy youthfulness, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the contemplation of thine eyes; [that is, in all that is pleasing and delightful to thine eyes, follow that freely, take thy pleasure in this life. Do whatsoever thine heart desireth, and whatsoever is pleasing and acceptable to thine eyes. From these words it appeareth plainly, that Salomon speaketh not here in good earnest, but Ironically, and by way of derision, against those that speak and mean, that which is here mentioned, in good earnest; namely, that youthful years ought or may be spent in pleasures and delights. In Numb.15.39. the Lord forbiddeth to walk in the ways of the heart] but know, that God for all these things will cause thee to come before judgment. [As if he had said, thou wilt be loath to come thither, but God will make thee come, to give an account of all that thou hast spoken and done, see below, chap.12.14.]
\p
\v 10 So then cause wrath to depart from thine heart, [Under the term, he comprehendeth all evil motions of the heart, which do disturb or disquiet it, when they are exhorted to forsake pleasures and delights, and to imbrace the fear of God. Others understand by wrath, sin, which provoketh the wrath of God against men. Oth. Grief , trouble, sorrow, ] and put away evil, [that is, all manner of evil concupiscence, and evil lusts or sins] from thy flesh: [that is, from thy body, see Rom.6.13. and 1 Cor.6.15.] for youth and young age [the word that is used in the Hebrew text, signifieth properly the morning or break of day. Youth or childhood are as morning of mans life. The morning is soon gone, the day passeth swift away, and the presently night followeth, wherein none can work] is vanity. [in regard it is transitory, passing soon away, and full of folly.]
\c 12
\s The wise man exhorteth young men to apply and accustome themselves unto pretty, before old age cometh, v.1. which he desireth by many comparisons, 2.&c. Hereupon followeth the conclusion of this Book, that all is vanity, 8. And he concludeth, that the sum of all learning is this, to fear God, and to keep to his commandments. 13.
\p
\v 1 And remember thy Creator [The Hebrew word is used in the plural number. Compare the annotate. Gen.1. on v.26. The meaning is, apply and inure thy self to the fear of God, and to keeping of his commandments] in the dayes od thy youthfulness, before the evil dayes [that is, the dayes of old age, which bring much pain and grief along with them; for old age is as a continual disease or sickness] come, and the years draw nigh, whereof thou shalt say, no pleasure in them.
\p
\v 2 Before the Sun, and the light, and the Moon, and the Stars be darkened, [Not that they are darkened indeed, but that they seem to be so unto those that are old, being half blind] and the clouds return after the rain. [that is, one misery cometh after another, as one tempest followeth after another. This verse, and some more that follow, contain a description of old age, after the manner of the Poets, and there is a continual allegory prosecured until seventh verse.]
\p
\v 3 In the day, when the keepers of the house [That is, the arms with the hands, which preserve the body (wherein the soul dwelleth, as in an house) serving to keep off evil, and entertain and imbrace good] shall tremble, and the strong men [that is, the legs or shanks, which bear the body, like two strong men] shall bow themselves, and the grinders [that is, the teeth, which (as it were) grind meat, chewing and biting it in pieces] cease, [to wit, from grinding, that is, from chewing. The meaning is, when the teeth shall not be so nimble to chew meat, as formerly] because they are grown less: [to wit, less number] and those that look out of the windows [that is, the eyes, that see or look from between the eye-lids] shall be darkened.
\p
\v 4 And the two doors [That is, the two lips through which the meat passeth, as between two doors. Compare, Job 41.5. Others understand by the doors the throat, or pipe through which the meat and drink do pass] toward the street [That is, which are seen outwardly in the body. There are also inward doors which are not seen, as the covering of the throat, and the covering of the bladder of the gall] shall be shut, [to wit, instead of opening them, when they should receive to take in hard meat. Some understand this thus: when the doors, that is, the lips, shall be shut, because old persons have an impediment in their speech, not being able to frame and utter words so well as young man do] when there is [cry, because of] a low sound of grinding, [to wit, when the teeth doe grind the meat in pieces, or grind it small. The meaning is, because the teeth can hardly chew, so that a man can hear nothing crack nothing or break between or under them, as is heard, when young chew and bite meat in pieces, having good teeth, which old persons seldom or never have] and he [to wit, the old man] riseth up [to wit, from his bed] at the voice of the bird, [that is, in the morning, when the birds begin to sing, for he cannot keep sleep to take rest] and all the singing men [Heb. The daughters of the song; that is, the singing women. Understand withal the singing man also, or the Musicians. Oth. All the daughters of the song, that is, all the parts or members of the body, which frame or form the voice] shall be bowed down. [or, shall bow; that is, shall perish, decrease, lose their strength; or shall be little esteemed, and counted of no value; inasmuch as the old man regardeth it not, as taking no more any delight in music. See the example hereof in Barfillai, 2 Sam.19.35.]
\p
\v 5 Also (when) they [To wit, old persons] shall be afraid of the high place [or, of high places; that is, of high exalted, or uneven places, which old men and women are loth to tread on, by reason of the weaknesses of their legs, fearing to stumble at them, or to fall down from off them, or because it is troublesome and cumbersome to them to climb up high stairs or hills] and (when) there shall be terrors in the way, [or amazements; to wit, great or many: Fearing, that they may hit their feet or toes against something] and the almond tree shall flourish, [when there shall be grey or hoary hairs there] and the grass-hopper shall be a burden to himself, [that is, the old man, who is grown as lean, crooked and withered as grass-hopper. Oth. And a grass-hopper, that is, a thing as light as a grass-hopper] is burden some to him, and the desire [to wit, after bodily pleasures and delights, also appetite to eating, drinking, etc.] shall perish: for man goeth to his everlasting house, [that is, to the grave; for there shall men abide a long while. As he had said, When a man is sensible of all those incommodities and distempers in his body, he may well then imagine, that he is nigh unto death, yea, that he hath one foot already in the grave] and the mourners [that is, those persons that see the dead put into the grave, and which doth bewail and lament them, or mourn over them; for which purpose certain persons in former time were wont to be hired. See the annotate. Jerem.9. on v.17.] shall go about in the street.
\p
\v 6 Before the silver cord be inchanted [That is, before the marrow or pith in the back-bone be loosed. This marrow is white like silver, and it is extended from the Bram all along the back-bone, like unto a cord or rope. Others understand here by the silver cord, the arteries. Oth. Removed. Oth. Chained or bound; that is, dried and stiffened] and the golden bowl be beaten in pieces, [by the golden bowl is meant, the same thin membrane or skin, wherein the brain lie, or which is of a gold colour. Others understand here by the golden bowl, the skull, wherein the brains lie shut up. Which likewise perisheth by death, and is as it were broken asunder] and the pitcher be broken at the fountain, [by the pitcher here is meant the chief great hollow vain, at or about the liver, called Vena cava] and the wheel beaten in pieces at the well; [by the wheel here is meant, the lungs, which by their continual motion do at one time thrust out the breath from them, and at another time draw it in again, resemble the wheel of a well, now drawing up the bucket towards it self, anon letting down again into the well.]
\p
\v 7 And the dust returneth to the earth as it was: [By dust here, is meant the body, which in the beginning was taken out of, and made of earth, Gen.3.19. see Job 7.v.5.] and the spirit [that is, the soul. See Numb.16.22. and 27.16.] return to God, [to wit, into heaven. It is to be understood, that Salomon here speaketh to the people of God. Some understand it of the souls both of believers and unbelievers, which are both sentenced by God, as supream Judge, immediately when man dieth, every one to their place, the souls of believers to heaven, of unbelievers to hell. Compare, Luke 16.22.] who gave it [see gen 2.7. Numb.16.22.]
\p
\v 8 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, it is all vanity [See above, ch.1.2. Psa.62.9. and 144.4.]
\p
\v 9 And moreover, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge, [That is, good doctrines; he being converted, did like wise convert and teach others] and gave good heed, [oth. He pondered or weighed; to wit, in the scales of wisdom] and searched out [oth. Examined] he set in order many proverbs. [Salomon spake many proverbs, 1 kings 4.32. whereof onely the Book of the Proverbs, and the Book called Ecclesiastes, [in Hebrew, Cohelet) is come to our hands. And understand here, under the name of Proverbs, most excellent wise sentences or sayings, treating of the life and manners of men, and of the course of the world, see the annotate. 1 Kings 4. On v.32.]
\p
\v 10 The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, [or, matters, things] and that which is written, is right, [or rightly constituted, ordered aright; that is, such, against which no man hath any thing to say] (even) words of truth.
\p
\v 11 The words of the wise are goods, [Intimating, that as oxen are driven on, or made to plow, by the pricking of the goads or sharp pins, that so likewise men ought to be put on by sharp and earnest exhortations to the practice of virtue and piety, and to the loathing and abhorring of worldly vanity] and as nails knock deep in [Heb. Implanted] (by) the masters of the assembles, [or of the congregation; that is, of the Teachers of the Congregation (that) [or which, to wit, words of the wise; which, to wit, nails] are given by onely Shepherd. [Heb. By one shepherd; to wit, by God, who is the Shepherd and Keeper of his people, Psa.23 and who sending forth his Prophets and Ministers, enlighteneth and enableth them by his spirit, see John 10.11. 1 Pet.1.11. and ch.5.4. oth. By the first shepherd.]
\p
\v 12 And whatsoever is above them, my son be warned: [Above them, to wit, the words of the wise, and of the onely shepherd. Oth. Moreover, my son, be thy these admonished or exhorted. Heb. Properly, be enlightened; to wit, by the Proverbs that are contained in this Book, and especially also in the Book of my Proverbs, and others Books besides. Thou hast enough with these, observe these but well, and take heed of receiving and entertaining that which the Philosophers or wise men of the world have written concerning the chief good and happiness of man, for these were not led by the spirit of God, and therefore have step far aside from the right way] of making many Books [to wit, as the Philosophers, the wise men of the world, have done] (there) is no end, and much reading [Or, too much reading. Oth. Too much study] is a wearing of flesh. [that is man. The meaning is, maketh the head and the brains weary.]
\p
\v 13 Of all that hath been heard, [that is, all that, whereunto this Sermon of mine tended, concerning the chief good] the end [that is, the conclusion or summer] of the matter is, Fear God, [by whom alone thou canst obtain the supream good and salvation, but not by any earthly or transitory thing] and keep his Commandment; [compare, Deut.6.2. and 10.12. and Prov.3.7.] for this (becometh) all men. [oth. For this is the whole (work or duty) of man; that is, he ought to make it his whole businesses, or his whole employment: this is the most principal end of mans life: or, this is the whole of man; that is, absolute and perfect happiness: or herein consisteth his welfare and salvation. Oth. Of the whole man.]
\p
\v 14 For God shall bring every work [Or, every deed or action; that is, all mens deeds and works] into judgement, with all that is hidden, whether (it be) good, or whether (it be) evil. [For at the last day will God Judge the very secret thoughts of men, Rom 2.16. Hebr. 1.34. Compare, 1 Corinth.4.5. and 2 Cor.5.10.]
