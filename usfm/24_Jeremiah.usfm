\mt THE PROPHET JEREMIAH
\c 1
\s Jeremiah's pedigree, and the time of his prophesying, God calleth him to the prophetical office,and confirmeth him by a token, agaist his execuses, reaveleth him the visions of an almond- rod, and a seething pot, giveth him a strict commission against those of Juda, with a promise of his assistance.
\p
\v 1 The words (Oth. The acts) of Jeremia, (Hebr. Jirmejabu) the son of hilkia: (Hebr.Chilkijabu) of the Priests, (He is not called an High Priest as the other Hilkia was, that found the book of the law,2 Kings 22.8 and dwelt at Jerusalem) that were at Ananoth, [See 1 Kings 2. on verf. 26 1 Chron.6.60. And below chap.32.8.] in the land of Benjamin:
\p
\v 2 To whom the word of the LORD came in the dayes of Tofia, the son of Amon, king of Juda. [See 2 Kings 21.26. and 22.1, &c.] in the thirteenth yeer of his reign. [Properly of his reigning]
\p
\v 3 It came also(to him) [To wit,the word of the Lord came to Jeremia as appeareth verif. 2. ] In the dayes of Jojakim,son of Josia, king of Juda. See 2 Kings 23.34. 2 Chron.36.4.] untill the aleventh year of Zedekia,the son of Josia, [see 1 Chron.3.15,16.] King of Juda was ended: [hence maybe gathered that Jeremia prophesied above 40 years in Juda, and after that yet some time in Egypt. See chapters 43 and 44] Until Jerusalem [That is the inhabitants of Jerusalem] was carried away captive, in the fifth month. [see 2 kings 25.8.]
\p
\v 4 Then the word of the LORD came unto me,saying:
\p
\v 5 Before I found in thee in (mother's) belly, [Of the inserting of this word, see Judges.13.on vers.5. And job 3. on vers.10.] I knew thee, [See Exod 33. on v 12.] and before thou comest fort out of womb, I sanctified thee: compare Gal.1.15] and Ex 29.44] I appointed thee [Hebr properly gave] (to be) a Prophet unto the nations.
\p
\v 6 Then said I Ah LORD, behold, I cannot speak; [Or know not (how) to speak. See Exod chap 3. and 4 and chapt 6.12,30) for lam young.[Or child,youth, youngmen, and consequently very unfit for this business, and without any esteem. Of the Hebrew word, see Genesis 22 on verse 5.It is so used of children and young men, opposed to the ancient,Jos 7.16, and 13.18and 3.5 and 20.4]
\p
\v 7 But the Lord said unto me,Say not,Iam young: for everywhere where l shall send thee, thou shalt go, and all that l shall command thee, thou shalt speak.
\p
\v 8 Be not afraid of their face [To wit, of the faceof them, to whom l send thee. Compare Ezek 3.9] for lam with thee[ Compre Gen21 on verse 22,Deut 31.6,8,Jos3.5] to deliver thee, saith the LORD.
\p
\v 9 And the Lord put forth His hand, and toutched my mouth:[Compare Isai 6 and on verse 7. This was a Divine token unto the Prophet,to comfirm and strengthen him in his calling.[ Compare Ezech 2 verse 8] and the LORD said unto me,Behold. L give my words in thy mouth [ see deut.13 on verse 18. So below chapt5.14]
\p
\v 10 “ Behold l do set thee this day over the nations, and over the kingdoms, to pluck up, and to break down, and to spoil and to destroy:(also) to build and to plant”[The meaning is,to tell them in my name, and to set lively before their eyes, that l will do it; and l will surely accomplish and retify thy words,(which thou shalt thus speak unto them) for the punidshment of the obsinate,and for the comfort of the penitent. [ Compare furthur, Ezech3 on verse 18 and 43. on verse 3.]
\p
\v 11 Morover,the word of the LORD came unto me ; saying,What seest thou, Jeremia?”and l said,l see an almond- rod [Or stick, twig]
\p
\v 12 And the LORD said unto me,Thou hast well seen;[Hebr. Done well or made good to see or by seeing, seeing. Compare deut 5 on verse 28, P salms 33on verse3] For l will be quick about my word, to perform it[As the almond tree buddeth and beareth fruit early, quickly and speedily upon the Jews.There is a word in Hebrew ; which we cannot so well imitate in our language, as if it should be said, l will be quick almond tree like, or as the almond-tree hath its name from thence, because it is nimble and quick to bear fruits betimes so will l.[ compare vision with Amos 8. 2]
\p
\v 13 And the word of the LPORD came unto me the second time,saying, what seest thou ? And l said, l see a seething pot[Hebr,a pot blown up, blown on. Understand by this pot, the city of n Jerusalem,and the land of Judah(as Ezech11.3,7 and 24,etc) wherein God would as it were seethe and boil, the Jews in his wrath, by the fire of the Babylonians, whlo country lay Northward off from Canaan] whose fore path is towards the north[ Hebr.face from or, towards the face of the North.Meaning this seething pot and burning, signified the mischief that should come from Chaldea and Syria]
\p
\v 14 And the LORD said unto me,From the North shall this evil[or punishment]open itself,upon all the inhabitants of the land.[ see below chap4.6]
\p
\v 15 For lo, l shall call the families of the kingdoms of the North[ That is, l will by my divine providence ordain, that they shall come, as by special command.[ compare below chap25.9 and ther on verse 29. see likewise chap5.15 and 6.22 and 10.22( the families of the Kingdom of the North) Hebr. Toward the North,northward] saith the LORD; and they shall come and set everyone i his throne(before) the door of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Juda. [see bslow chap 52.4,5]
\p
\v 16 And l will utter my judgement agaist them,[Heb. With them] touching[Or,for,because of] all their wickedness: [that is, I will set before them my doom or sentence, concerning the punishnents, which thereby their wickedness have deserved. Compare below chap 4.12 and39.5 and 48.21 and 49.12 and52.9.] (in) that they have forsaken me,and(have) burnt insence unto other Gods, and (have) bowed themselves (down) before the works of their (own) hands. [meaning the idolatrous images]ismayed at their face,lest i slay thee [Or bruise thee to shivers, break thee in pieces,or smite thee, that is, that is kill thee. It is the same hebrew word that is used in the former words in the signification of being astonied, dismayed, affrightened. See the like elegancy in the various use of a word, below chap 12.14
\p
\v 17 Thou then gird up thy loins,That is,Prepare thyself,to execute thy office and calling,nimbly,readily, and boldly. Compare Exod.12. On vers 2.] and dget thee up, and speak unto them all that I shalll command thee:be not d.] before their face.
\p
\v 18 For, behold I make thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and copper walls [Hebr. A City of defence, also, a pillar of iron, walls of copper, That is an un conquerable Fort, which is expounded in the next verse. Compare below chap.15.19,20.21.] against the whole land, aginst the kings of Juda, against the Princes thereof, against the Priests thereof, and against the people of the land.
\p
\v 19 And they shall fight against thee, bet not prevail against thee: for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to help thee out.
\c 2
\s God setteth before the etes of his people,in serious manner , the mercies which he had bestowed on them from the beginning ,and cpmplaineth vehemently of their abominable,continual,and most unreasonable idolatrous unthankfulness ,verse 1. The loke was not to be found among the heathen ,10 and thier horrible and double wickedness ,12 . whereby themselves are the cause of their miseries, 14.An upbraiding of their running in vain to Egypt and Assur ,18,36.also of their loose, impudent stiffnecked ,manifold ,and more then heathenish idolatry, and shameful forgetfulnessand forsaking of God,20 also bloodshedding, and hypocricy,34.
\p
\v 1 And the word of the LORD came unto me saying :
\p
\v 2 Go ,and cry before the ears of Jerusalem ,[That is , of the inhabitants ofJerusalem] as above cha.]. Saying : Thus saith the LORD ; l remember the kindness of thy youth ,[Hebr. L remember thee,&c. See Psalms 79.on verse 8( the kindness ofthy youth)That is the kindness, or ,mercy, which l shewed thee in thy youth] and love of thine espousals,[ That is , the love which l bear unto thee, when l married thee ; that is , when l first accepted you to be my people in Egypt, and afterward made my covenant with you in Horeb.[ compare Ezech .16.8,22. and see concerning the phase, Psalms59.11 and 106.4 , Isai26.11 also below chap.51.35 , Joel 3.19 .Obad. Verse 10,Jona2.9. e.t.c] when thou walkest after me in the wilderness , in an unknown land[ compare below verse6]
\p
\v 3 Israel was holiness unto the LORD, the first -fruits of his increase [Hallowed by him to his people, and separated from all other nations : as the frst-fruits were hallowed unto him see Exudus 19,4,5,6] all that did eat him up ,[That is sought to eat him up : that is to destroy him; that wronged or hurt him[compare Nehem.6 on verse 9 and Psalms 14 on verse 4 and 79 on verse 7] were counted guilty[And punished as such ,as the following words shew ] evil came upon them[To wit, evil of punishment ;that is, misery, destruction: as appeared in theEgyptians, the Amalekites , the Kings Sihon and Og. The Medians, and the Canaanites ] saith the LORD
\p
\v 4 Hear the words of the LORD, ye house of Jacob ,and the families of the house of Israel.
\p
\v 5 Thus saith the LORD, what iniquity have you fathers found in me, that they are turned away far from me? [compare Mic.6.3,4]and have walked after vanity?[That is after idols , that are nothing but vanity , and make Idolaters in vain in their imagniations ,and deceive them in their hope and expectation. Compare 2 Kings 16 on v. 15. Psal. 62 on verse 11 and below verse 8.11.] and they are become vain?
\p
\v 6 And said not; [To wit, with themselves; that is, thought not. So verse 8.] Where is the LORD, that brought us up out of the land of Egypt? that led us in the wilderness, in a land of deserts and pits, [Hebr. of the desert , and of the ditch;[ That is, waste and full of pits; that is , rugged, uneven, untrodden. Some such a land, where, in regard of the want of all things, the passengers could look for nothing but death ,and the grave ,unless God did exraordinarily, provide other ways]in a land of drought,and of the shadow of death,[see Psal 23.on verse 4] in a land that no man pass thorow,and where no man dwelt?
\p
\v 7 And I brought you into a fruitful land [ Thes are again God's words (into a fruitful land)Hebr.carmel. See 2 Kings 19 on verse 23.So below chap4.26 and 48 .32,& c meaning Canaan] to eat the fruit thereof, and the good thereof:but when ye entered into it,ye defiled my land,and made mine heritage[see Psal 68 on verse 10] an abomination[ committing therein all manner of idolatry, as followeth]
\p
\v 8 The priest saith not , where is the LORD? And they that handleth the law [As the [Priests, Levites, Scribes that were to teach and expound the law of God or the scripture unto the people [See Malach 2.6,7 also Ezra 7.6 Nehemi8.1,3,7,8&c]knew me not;[see Rom2.20]and the shepherds transgressed against me :[Oth.revolted from me ,see 1 Kings 8.50and 12 on verse 19] and the prophets prophesied by Baal[That is , in Baal's name, see Judg. 2 on verse 11] and ( after things that)do not profit [That is after idols, and traditions of men . So verse11 which above verse5 are called vanity , and below verse13 self-hewen cisterns, that hold no water ]
\p
\v 9 Therefore l will yet contend with you,saith the LORD: ye with your childrens children will l contend .
\p
\v 10 For passe over into the Isles of the Chittites ,[See Genes25 on verse4, Numb 24 on verse24]and behold, and send (unto) Kedar,[ See Genes 25 on v 13. and below chap 49 .27, Psal 120 ,5,6, Cant 1.5 it is held to be a country in the desert and stony Arabia .Compare Ezech 27.21] and consider it well[Hebr. Greatly] and see if the like has been done.
\p
\v 11 Hath also a nation changed (their) Gods, though there are no Gods? Yet my people have changed their glory,(unto that which) doth not profit.[That is ,the true God, and the true Religion, into Idols ,and Idolatry. See Psl 106.20 with the annot.]
\p
\v 12 Be astonished here at, ye hevens,[See Deut 4 on verse 26]be sffrighted,[ Properly let your hairs rise up: or be moved] be very desolate [By withdrawing, or loffe of the heavenly light] saith the LORD .
\p
\v 13 For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me, the fountain of living water.[ The authour and original of true happiness, of all blessed and permanent help , of saving comforts , and of eternal life, compare Joh 4.14 & c ( of living water) see Genes 26 on verse 19 and compare Psal 36 on verse10]to hew themselves out cisterns [ Or troughs .Compare above on verse 8] broken cisterns that hold no water.
\p
\v 14 Is Israel then a servant?[That is so ill delt withal by enemies, as if so be he a servant and a slave] or is he an inborn of the houses ?[That is , a slave servant, who is also called the son of the house , see Genes 15 on verse 3 . and 17 .13] why is he (then) become a prey?[god speaketh of the approaching judgements ,as if they had already lighted upon his people, because of the undoubted certainty thereof. So in the sequel, and elsewhere often]
\p
\v 15 The young lions[That is , the enemies;To wit; the Babylonians]have roared upon him ,[ see isai 5.29 below chap 4.7]they have lift up [Hebr .given] their voice [That is made a found, cry, as a wild beast doth upon his prey] and they have made his land a desolation , his cities are burnt, [so] that no man dwelleth in them.
\p
\v 16 Also the children ofNoph and Tachphans [That is , the Egyptians. See both these Cities,Isa 19.13 and 30.3,4 also below chap 43.7,8 also Ezek 30.18, with the annot. These words are somewhat otherwise written in the Hebrew] have eaten up [Oth. Broken, bruised in pieces]the crown of thy head [ whereas thou thinkest to be holpen by them , they shall spoil thee, especially in the South-boarders lying towards Egypt]
\p
\v 17 Doth thou not do this thyself?( in that) thou forsakest the LORD thy God, in the time when he leadeth thee in the way .[ When he leadeth thee the light way , or, in his way bthe Doctrine and exhortations of his servants]
\p
\v 18 And now,what hast thou tho do [Hebr. What is it to thee, or, what hast thou ;to wit, to do ? Compare Judges 11 on verse 12 . 2 Sam 16 on verse 10] with the way of Egypt,to drink waters of Sihor? [ see Jos 13 on verse 3 ,Isai 23.3] and what hast thou to do with the way of Assur, to drink the waters of the river ? [ Euphrates. The meaning is, To what purpose doest thou thus run and travel into Egypt, or into Aslytria for help, as if l were not able to help thee? Compare below verse36.]
\p
\v 19 Thine (own) wickedness shall chasten thee, [That is,thou shalt be punished of thy wickedness: or let thy wickedness correct thee , that is ,let the friut of thy wickedness instruct and convince thee, that thou hast offended] and thy backsliding shall reprove thee:know then and see , that it is evil and bitter, that thou forsakest the LORD thy God , and (that) my fear is not with thee , speaketh the Lord, the LORD of hosts[ see 1 Kings 18 on verse 15]
\p
\v 20 When I of old[ or, because, l, etc.(of old) Or, in former time.So the hebrew word olam ( which otherwise signifieth eternity , also a long time to come , also the time of man's life ) is likewise often taken for a long while ago ,for things of old,etc see Gen 6.4, Deut 32.7 , Isai 57.11 and below chap 6.16 and 18.15 and 28.8 Ezech 26.20, etc ] had broken thy yoke ,[ meaning the yoke bondage and thraldom in Egypt ](and) burnt[Or ,pulled off, pluck off.]thy bands , the thou saidst,I will not serve[To wit, Idols. Oth. I will not transgress. Compare the promises which they made unto God , Exod.19.8 and 24.3 . , Jos 24.16, etc ] but upon all (or, every)high hill, and under all(or,every) green tree that thou runnest about , playing the harlot [As if the LORD should say ,But ye have not kept your word : for upon every hill,&c (thou runnest about) compare this signification of the Hebrew word , with Isa 51.14 and 63.1 and below chap 48.12. oth. Thou liest, or thou layest thyself down , thou rollest thyself (playing the harlot) compare below verse 23. That is ,committing idolatry. See Lev 17 on verse7. And Deut 12 on verse 2,3 Or, thou harlot]
\p
\v 21 Yet l have planted thee a noble vine [see Exod15.17 ,Psal 44.3 and 80.9] a wholly faithful seed: [Hebr . Seed of truth, or, faithfulness; that is ,a true good stock, a right plant that bringeth forth good feed ,that is , good fruit, that beareth seed in it. Compare Isa 1.22 and 5.2 .oth, whose whole feed( should be) truth,in one and the fame sense ] how art thou the turned to me (into) degenerate[Hebr. Properly declining .That is,degenerate,bastard] branches of a strange[or outlandish] vine?
\p
\v 22 For though thou shouldst wash thee with salt peter,[Hebr.Nether; that is, nitre,salt-peter, salt digged out of the grou] and shouldst take the much sope, (yet) thine iniquity is signed [or marked] before me , saith the LORD.[so that it cannot be hid or obscured from me ,as fine gold hath its mark.Thae Hebrew is only found so here , being derived from another,which signifieth fine gold and is likewise taken by Hebrews fo a mark.token or spot, whereby a thing may be known and discerned.Some render it,glistereth,or shineth,like gold also spotted .(Though thou shouldest wash thee ,etc) that is all thy hypocritical pretences, execuses,fig-leaves,wherewith thou seekest to cover thy wickedness, cannot help thee]
\p
\v 23 How sayest thou, lam not polluted, l have not walked after the Baals ? See thy way[ that is,thne Idolatrous nature and practice] in the valley ,[ this may be understood of valleys in general, Isa. 57.5,6 or in particular, of the valley of Hinnom that lay near Jerusalem, where they committed their abominable Idolatry with Molech. See 2 Kings 23.10 and bnelow chap 19.2 &c] know what thou hast done, thou light swift she-carmel,[Its conceived, that the Hebrew word Bichra signifieth a certain kind of small, or young she-carmels, that were very swift in running , as post horses are , and so run before others ,as the first born(from whence the word Bechoris used ) came before the other children ,compare Isa 60.6 Therefore such a she-carmel was called by a Greek word Dromas, that is ,she-runner;the word Dromedary is also used in our own language.Hereunto God compareth Israel , by reason of their fiery disposition to run into all manner of Idolatry ] that traverseth he wayes [ the Hebrew word rendered here traverseth, is only found in this place,being derived from another word, which signifieth a shoe-latchet . God doth intimate hereby,that Israel ran up and down,to and fro in Idolatry, as a shoe-latchetis often variously turned and shaken to and fro.]
\p
\v 24 She is wilderness,[Heb. taught, that is,accustomed,exercused and experienced,as below, chap13.21,23 and 31.18. Hos 10.11 ] in the wilderness,[the meaning is, that she is not leftton be restrained or temed in her hot disposition , then a wilderness is . See Job39.8 ] according to the delight of her soul she draweth the winde, who should turn away her meeting ?[ she draweth in the wind ; or swalloweth in the winde. Compare below , chap 14.6. that is , she cheereth and delighteth herself upon all occassions (which she herself seeketh and persueth after her spiritual whoredom ) being so impudently hot , as that non can restrain or beat her off from it .Oth.she snuffieth up and draweth the winde according to her occassion,who should turn her away?]all that seek her will grow weary ;in her moneth they shall finde her.[the Idolaters that desire to commit fornication with her , need not to take grea t pains, she is easie to be found. Compare Ezek 16.33,34 and 23.40 (they shall finde her in her moneth) The New Moon, or monethly courses , for she hath laid aside all modest. See Levit 20.18. some understand this of the Idolatry, which they commited on every new moon]
\p
\v 25 With-hold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst:[These are the words of God, who calleth Israel away from their impudent heat] but thou saiest, it is past hope, No;[it is in vain, it is lost labour ,I will not do it] for I love strangers,[to wit ,idols] and I will walk after them.
\p
\v 26 As a thief is ashamed,[Hebr. According to the shame of a thief. Compare below, chap 48.27] when he is found,[that is ,is taken and apprehended in the very act] so are they of the house of Israel ashamed:[or, shall be ashamed.Oth.they have made the house of Israel ashamed, that is they shall make ashamed,&c. They shall be made ashamed;that is, they shall be surely ashamed] they, their Kings, their Princes, and their Priests, and their Prophets.
\p
\v 27 That say to a tree, Thou art my father,and to a stone, Thou hast begotten me.[Or,brought me forth] for they turn (their) neck unto me, and not (their) face; [that is, they have revolted from me and have been refractory and rebellious. See below, chap 7.24 and 32.33, And compare Exod 32.9] but in the time of their evil[to wit,the evil of punishment, when miseries threatened come upon them. So in the next verse]they say, Arise and deliver us.
\p
\v 28 Where are then thy Gods that thou hast made thee ?let them arose , if they shall deliver thee in the time of thy evil : [compare Deut 32.38.Judg.10.14]for(accordingto) the number of thy cities are thy gods, o Juda.[thatis, thou hast as many several Idols as thou hast cities .Therefore let us once see ,whether allof them together be able to help the .]
\p
\v 29 Wherefore do ye contend against me?ye all have transgressed against me,[see above ,verse 8] speaketh the LORD.
\p
\v 30 In vain have I smitten your children:[see Isa 1.5 below, chap5.3]they received not correction ; see Prov 1,onv 2.] your own sword have devoured your Prophets, like a destroying [ or devouring .see of the Hebrew word Judg.20. On v.21.]Lion [the meaning is,it is so far from thence, that ye should have received my reproofs ,as that on the contrary ye have like raging wilde beasts destroyed the Prophets , that diswaded you from Idolatry; as came to passe in the time of Asa, Joab,and Manasseh. See also Mat.23.29,&c. Luke11.47,&c and 13.34.]
\p
\v 31 O generation! Comfider [Heb. See] (now) the word of the LORD: have I been a wilderness unto Israel? Or land of utter darknesse? [ Have I led and delt ill with Israel, or have they fared so ill by me ,as men that faint and perish in wildernesse,and in daark unfrequented ways , for hunger,grief,sorrow,and want? surely(will the LORD say)the ontrary is most true. Such interrogatives imply a strong denial.(or a land of utter darknesse) Hebr .obsurity of the LORD. The Hebrew particle I A H, according to the opinion of most expositours, being added thereunto for the exaggeration ar aggravation of the thing. Compare Genes. 13, on v.10. Oth. A land that casteth down, or causeth to fall the inhabitants thereof, that is ,causeth them to faint and perish for want ; the sense being all one] wherfore then say my people , We are LORD's,[or, we bear rule ] we will come no more unto thee?[thatos,our affairs go well , we have strenghtened our Kingdome by foreign aid and covenants,we have now no more need of thee, we need not seek any more unto thee.]
\p
\v 32 Doth also a Virgin forget her ornaments? (or) a bride her bindings?[ wherewith she tieth her attire fast to her head. Some take it to be the attire of the head, or of the nec,or throat ] yet my people have forgotten me [ who am their glory and onely ornaments, see 2 sam.1. On verse 19 see also below, hap.3.21.] dayes without number. [ A very long time]
\p
\v 33 Why doest thou make thy way good, whereas tho seekest dallying[Hebr, properl;y love.The meaning seemeth to be , why wilt thou yet hidethy Idolatrous condition and practise, whereas indeed thou bdoest nothing else then to seek oassion everywhere to get acquintane and society with other Idolaters,and to ommit Idolatry with them. Some understand this of her onstant running and travelling, to get favour among heathenish Idolatrous Nations, and to make covenant with them.Some: whereof,v 36. They did both .and the one depended upon the other] therefore hast thou also taught the most wicked (harlots) thy wayes.[or, whereby, so that thou also, yea, thou hast also,&. That is, thou art sovile an harlot, as thou that surpassest the very worst out-landish or heathenish harlots that be , beause by thy practise thou makest them worse then they are of themselves.]
\p
\v 34 Yea, the blood of the souls[That persons,compare Prov. 28.17 with the annotat.] of innocent needy ones is found in thy skirts: [to wit of thy garments ] I have not found it by digging up, but upon all these , [to wit, skirts of thy garments,(l have not found it et) it, to wit, the blood . The Hebrew known that signifieth blood is indeed in the former words used in the singular number but is joined with a verb of the plural number, as if one should say. The blood are found, that is , the bloods, as the Scripture often useth the word bloods so,or it may be understood of much innoent blood , where with they were defiled. See v30 .This was so manifest, as that it needed not to be found out by any strict search, neithe needed the blood to be digged up , as if it were hid in the earth , but it was publickly to be seen , sticking yet (as we may say) upon the skirts of their garment . (Some take it thus , thou, because the Hebrew verb may be taken in the first person of the masculine gender , and in the second of the faminine )hast not found them (to wit, the innocent poor) digging thorow,(that thou mightest have killed them as guilty night thieves , Exod. 22.2,3.) but (thou hast killed them) for all those things ; to wit, for all thy fore-mentioned Idolatriies, which they reproved. See on verse30.]
\p
\v 35 Yet thou saist,Surely Iam innocent ,Surely this anger,[To wit, the LORD's anger] is turned away from me:[As if they had said , we are sufficiently sure of it, that the LORD is not wroth with us .Oth.let onely his anger turn away from me; that is , l will sufficienly prove that lam innocent, if so be he will but deal kindly with me,and not be sorigorous and severe as do hypocrites do always excuse themselves, and blame God] behold l will plead with thee .[or, submit myself with thee to judgement, as elsewher. See Ezeh.1720and 20.35.Joel3.2,&] beause thou saiest, l have not sinned .
\p
\v 36 Why travellest thou much[ Hebr. Greatly] abrosd, changing thy way ?[travelling sometimes to this, sometimes to that party for help] Thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt.[Compare Isa30.3,4,5. And below , hap 37.7. Hos.5.13, & By Egypt is meant here the Egyptians, so in the following clause, by Affur the Assyrians ] as thou wast ashamed of Affur [ see 2 chron 28.20,21. As if the LORD should say, As thou likewise be deeived by the other .]

\v 37 Thou shalt also go forth from thene [ beause thou doest thus travel forth from thence , therefore thou shalt, &c. Or , from this (man) to wit, the Egyptian. Oth for that cause] with thine hands upon thy head,[ that is , with mourning, shame, and disgrace, see 2 sam.13.19 with the annot. ] for the LORD hath rejeted all thy onfidence, [ Hebr. Thy confidences, in the plural number; that is , all thy vain refuge, which thou seekest out of God] so that thou shalt not prosper in it.

\s Gods great forebearance with the wiked and obstinanceIdolatry of Juda , and an invitationt repentanc,v 1, etc.A comparing of the wickednesse of Israels sinning , but exceeded them in wickednesse,6. Israel is also invited to repentance,12 . With fair evangelical promises, concerning the gathering of the elect Jews and Gentiles unto the church of Christ , the ordaining of the office of preaching, the repealing of the ceremonies, and the setting up of new form of worship: also concer ning the spirit of adoption, of prayer, and of true repentance (whereof God giveth his elect a pattern ) and the inheritance of heavenly Canaan,14,etc.
\p
\v 1 They say ,[Heb.to say, or,saying; that is ,they say so, in a manner of speaking ,suppose that,&] If a man leave his wife, and she go from him,and become another mans, shall he also yet return unto her?[that is ,may also the first husband take her again]should not that same land [ wherein such an abomination should be committed. See hereof, Deut.24.4] be greatly profaned] thou now hast played the harlot with many lovers ,[Heb. Companions,friends]yet return again unto me,speaketh the LORD .[the Lord doth intimate hereby , that he will not withstanding graciously receive his people , if they shall seriously repent of all these abominations and breaches of covenant]
\p
\v 2 Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and , behold where hast thoou not been lien with?[That is , there are no high places, but thou hast committed Idolatry upon them ]thou hast sate for them in the wayes ,[ to watch for the lovers , as a common impudent strumpet. Compare Gen 38.14. Ezek. 16.24,25.] as qan Arabbian in the wildernesse: [As thieves and robbers watch for passengers in the desert places]so hast thou profaned the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wckedness .
\p
\v 3 Therefore the drops of rain [Or, showers of rain] have been with-held,[ to wit, by me, according to my threatenings , Levit 26.19. Deut 28.23,24] and there hath been no latter rain : [see Deut. 11 on verse 14 ] but thou hast an whores [Heb. A womans ,a whores; as often] forehead, thou refusest to blush .[That is , thou wilt not be ashamed, whih tho indeed oughtest to be , when thou feelest my judgements , which l bring you upon the land.]
\p
\v 4 Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me? [Heb. Doest tho not cry utno me , or doest thou not call me,&c as if God should say , wilt thou not now yet return unto me? Repent yet from this time] My father , thou art the guide of my youth.[ that hast led and guided me from the beginning with instruction , counsel, action, as a good husband doth his wife. Compare prov 2.17]
\p
\v 5 Will he reserve (anger) forever? [compare below, v12 and Psalms 103 .9 also Levit.19.18 Nahum 1.2 in which places the word anger, for the clearing of the sense, is to be understood. These and the words that follow may be taken as the words of the people , which God prescribeth unto them , to move him him thereby in a penitent and humble manner to have compassion on them : or, as the words of God, or of Prophet,shewing that God will turn away his anger,if they do repent] will he keep (it) continually? Behold thou speakest,and doest those wickedness,[which are related above .These are the words of God unto Israel] and doest prevail.[that is, thou doest obstinately break thorow with thy wickedness, as if God should say,It's but in vain for me to call thee to repentance, thou carest not for it,thou goest but the more wilfully on in thy wickednesse]
\p
\v 6 Moreover the LORD said unto me,In the days of King Josia; [When the ten tribes of Israel were carried away into Assyria] hast thou not seen what the backsliding Israel hath done?[Heb. Properly aversnesse, or back-sliding. Oth. The backsliding, in the faminine gender, agreeing to the following text, where Israel is compared to an harlot] she went up into all (or every) high mountain, and under all (or every) green tree, and there played the harlot.
\p
\v 7 And l said , after she had done all this, Turn thou unto me , but she returned not: This trencherous(one) her sister Juda saw.[The treancherous (one) so doth God call them of the tribe of Juda, by reason of their Idolatry, whereby they had broken the spiritual bond. And faith of marriage , that was between God and them. As well as the other ten tribes of Israel had done,which were all kinsmen of Juda, as being all descended from Patriarch Jacob:therefore they are called sisters .Compare Ezech.16.46. And 23.2,4,etc. So in the sequel.]
\p
\v 8 And l saw, when because all, wherein the backslidden Israel had committed adultery,l had forsaken her, and given her her bill of divorce,[delivering her into the hand of the Assyrians,who carried the ten tribes away captive,as rom the face of God , and out of their own Land] that the unfaithful,her filter Juda,feared not [ stuck not,or, was not afraid to follow the evil example of Israel ,notwithstanding that she had,as it were beheld with her eyes all those judgements that had lighted upon Israel. Compare below chap.44.10 and Prov.28. On vers.14] but went her wayes, and played the harlot herself also.
\p
\v 9 Yea it came to passe, by reason of the fame of her whoredom ,[Hebr. Voice,&c which may be also so taken, as they it was a crying voice, as the scripture elsewhere speaketh, Gen. 4.10 with the annotat. Oth lightness ]that she perfumed the land :[some apply this still to Israel , by comparing the following verse ] for the committed adultery wood with stone and with[That is with stone and wooden idols so e zech. 20.32. See there]
\p
\v 10 and even in all this ,[or, for, or, by all this,that is , though she had seen all this that was before related concerning Israel]her unfaithful sister Juda hath not turned unto me with her whole heart; but falsly,[Heb. In ,or,with falshood; that is, deceitfully,hypocritically] saith the Lord.
\p
\v 11 Therefore the Lord said unto me ,The backslidden Israel had justified her soul [That is herself, her person,as often. See Genes 12.on verse 5 ] more then the unfaithful Judah. [The meaning is, Israel may boast of it,that she hath not done yet so wickedly,as judah hath. See Ezek.16.51,52. And 23.11]
\p
\v 12 Go thy wayes, and proclaim these words towards the North,[ Toward Assyria and Media, whither the ten tribes were carried] and say: Repent , thou back-slidden Israel, saith the LORD, then I will not cause mine anger [ Hebr face; that is, mine anger,or, my angry countenance, whereby is meant God's severe judgements, See Psal 21. on verse 10 and below chap. 4.26. Lev.17 on verse.10] to fall upon you: [Oth. I will not cast down my face against you : that is, I will not look upon you with an angry and stern countenance: ( Compare Genes.4.5,6) but will shew mercy and favour to you]for I. am gracious,[See 2.Chron.6 on verse 41] I will not keep (anger) forever. [see above on verse 5. Compare Psal.86.15 and 103.8,9.and 145.17]
\p
\v 13 Onely know[or,acknowledge] thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the LORD thy God;[See above chap.2. On vers28.]and hast scattered thy wayes to the strangers, under all (or,every) green tree,[That is,hast run hither and thither to and fro,like a light impudent harlot, to commit idolatry with strange idols, as above vers.2.6 See also Ezech.16.24,etc and 23.5,6,7etc] but ye have not bee obedient to my voice,saith the LORD.
\p
\v 14 Return,ye backsliding children,speaketh the LORD, for I have married you: [Having the authority of an husband over you] and I will take you, one of a City,and two of a Family, and I will bring you to Zion.[I will in mercy save a remnant, and bring them to fellowship of my Church,represented by Zion. See 1Chron9.3 and Rom.11.5. For this hath principally respect to the time of Christ,and of the New Testament]
\p
\v 15 And l will give you pastours;[That is , Teachers,Preachers] according to mine heart; they shall feed you(with) knowledge and understanding. [see further concerning this promise,below chap.23.4. Ezech.34.23.and Compare Eph4.11.and 1Sam.13.14]
\p
\v 16 And it shall come to pass, when ye shall be multiplied and become fruitful in the Land,[To wit, by the preaching of the Gospel,as came to passe in the time of our Saviour Christ,and his Apostles. See some beginning hereof, Acts 1.15. 1Cor.15.6 and afterward, Acts 2.41 and 4.4,etc] in those dayes, saith the LORD,[That is, the Ceremonies of the Old Testament(among which the ark was likewise a chief part)shall cease, as being shadows and types of the Messiah Jesus Christ, who being then come shall accoumplish all things, and cause his Church to worship God in Spirit ,and in truth ,in all places. See Job.4.21,23. 1Tim 2.8,etc.]neither shall it come to minde;[that is expounded by the following words. Compare Isai.65.17. And below chap 7 on vers31] neither shall they remember it,[To wit,not so,as in former time,and for the use of God's worship. Compare below Chap.16. On vers14.]nor visit (it)neither shall it be made[or be repaired]again[Or,(that,or.all those things)shall come to passe, or, be done no more. Oth it shall be no more magnified;that is , be highly esteemed and praised: because the Son of God shall be manifested in the flesh; as the word made, is likewise so taken by some,Deut.32.6 and 1Sam.12.6. And elsewhere.]
\p
\v 17 At that time they shall call Jerusalem, ther throne of the LORD and all heathen shall be gathered unto it ,because of the Name of the LORD ,[Or, to the Name of the LORD ;that is , to the LORD Himself,who shall be manifesteed in the flesh ,andand unto his Church,as it were by Name ]to Jerusalem: and they shall walk no more after the opinion [Or imagination,speculation, thought.Oth.ha rdnesse. See Deut.29.19 Psal 81.13 and below chap.7.24 and 9.24 and 10.8 and 18.12, etc.]of their evil heart,
\p
\v 18 In those day es the house of Juda shall go to the house of Israel : and they shall come together out of the Land of the North, into the Land that l have given for inheritance unto your Fathers [See above on vers.14. They that formally were separated from one another,and were at oddess and enemies to each other ,shall live in peace and unity together ,here in the Church of God,by one Spirit of Faith, as members of one body under one head Jesus Christand shall hereafter possess the inheritance of God in the heavenly Canaan .Compare Isai.11.13 Ezech.37.16,etc and Hebr,11.14,15. And 12.22 and below chap 50.4 (and they shall come together out of the Land of the North). That is, of their captivity: this being a figure of their spiritual captivity ,and deliverance out of it by Christ (into the Land that l have given unto your Fathers for an inheritance)Or which l cause them to inherit,or, possess hereditarily].
\p
\v 19 I said indeed;How shall l put thee among the children? And give thee desired Land [Hebr. The Land of desire,of wish See Psal .106 on verse 24.]the beautiful inheritance.[Hebr. The inheritance of beauty. So was Canaan called , being a type of the heavenly Canaan See Ezech 20.3 Dan.8.9 and 11.6,41,45.]of the armies of the heathen ? But l said ,Thou shalt cry unto me ,[or, call me]My father ,and thou shalt not turn away from after.[L said,etc.That is, l thought as straight way again, spoken of God after the manner of men ,as it were considering and advising thus with himself , to expresse the unworthiness of his people (whereof furthur vers. 20.) and the greatness of his mercy:as if God should say:But how shall l attain to it ,to make me a church of such a wicked nation, and to adopt them for my children , and the heirs of the heavenly and glorious Canaan , with the multitudes of the Gentiles ? Whereunto God thus maketh answer within himself : I will by my spirit of conversion and adoption cause them to return (as followeth ) and to cry unto me in faith, Abba, Father, and not to depart from me . See Rom.8.9. Jerem. 32.40. Some take this versw as a consequent of the former promise and render it thus ,Also l said ,or For l said, how shall l,& c.by way of admiration: and in the sequel also l said , Thou shalt cry unto me ,etc.]
\p
\v 20 Verily (as) a woman unfaithfully departeth from her friend ;[Or companion ; that is, husband. Cmpare Hsi.3.1.] so have ye delt unfaithfully against me, ye house of Israel , saith the LORD.
\p
\v 21 Ther is a voice heard [That is , there shall be heard ] upon the high places , a weeping (and) supplications[or a weeping of supplications] of the children of Israel, because they have perverted their way , and have forgotten the LORD, their God . [here beginneth a prophecie and description of the conversionof the Israelites.]
\p
\v 22 Return, ye backsliding children, I will heal your backslidings: [This is the voice of God]. Behold (here) are wel, we come unto thee, for thou art the LORD our God. [This is the answer of the weeping and supplicating penitent Israelites.]
\p
\v 23 Truly in vain (it is expected) from the hills,(and) the multitude of the mountains: truly in the LORD our God is the Salvation of Israel.[ Compare Psalm 121.1]
\p
\v 24 For the shame [That is, the Idol Baal, of whom indeed we may be ashamed and confounded. So below ,chap.11.13. Hos .9.10 ] hath eaten up[that is ,devoured] the labour of our fathers, [that is, that which they had gotten by their labour ,as is expounded in the words following] from our youth ;their sheep, and their oxen, their sons and their daughters.[ this shameful Idol Baal had consumed the labour of their fathers, both in respect of the just judgements that came upon them for it.]
\p
\v 25 We lie (down)in our shame, and our confusion convereth us , for we have sinned against the LORD, our God , we and our fathers from our youth unto this day: and we have not been obedient unto the voice of the LORD our God.
\c 4
\s An exhortation to true repentance, v 1 ,&c. A large declaration and represantation of the future destruction of the land of Juda by the Babylonians , for their sins, contrary to the prediction of the false Prophet, 5,27. Whereat the Prophet bitterly lamenteth, 19. In the meanwhile God promiseth a gracious moderation of the plagues ,27.
\p
\v 1 If thou will return, Israel, saith the LORD, return unto me :[As if God should say: If thou at any time art minded to return, as thou often times pretendest thou shalt mind to do , then do it now , and do it sincerely without hypocrisie and mixture of any Idolatry, as is shewed in the sequel] and if thou will put away thine abominations[ that is, thy abominable and horrible Idolatry,or dung-gods which are joyned with the abominations, Deuteronom,29.17. See 2 Chron.15 on verse 8.] from my face , then wander not about.[ Upon mountains and hills , to commit idolatry. See above , chap 2.20. and 3.6,13. Or, then thou shalt not wander about ; that is ,go into exile; and in the sequel ,And thou shalt swear.]
\p
\v 2 But swear (As true as as) the LORD liveth [shewing thereby that thou knowest and honourest me as thine onely God, and that sincerely, withou falshood or hypocrise, as followeth. Compare below chap 5.2 ] in truth, in judgement and in righteousness: [These three things comprehend all that is requisite to an holy oath and worship of God, in respect to God , a mans self and his neighbour , both in his general and particular calling .Compare the former annotat. And Genes.18. On verse 19, 1 Kings 10 o verse 9 .]so shall the heathen [ that now mock both at you and me because you behave yourself so shamefully as that lam fain to punish you by the heathen themselves by the honour of my Name.bless themselves in him , and glory in him [Namely, the LORD; beholding your piety , and there upon God's blessing upon you , they will be invited to turn unto the true God , and to seek their happinesse onely in him, to ascribe it to him alone , and to account themselves blessed and happy in him Compare Gen.22 on verse 18 , Deut. 29.19 Psal 10.3 and 49.19,20.]
\p
\v 3 For thus saith the LORD to the men of Juda ,[Hebr, the men, etc. That is, the men, or every man , or those of Juda , so verse 4 and chap.11.9 and 17.25. and 18.11 and 32,33, & c.] and to Jerusalem [ that is , the inhabitants of Jerusalem,as verse 4.]Break up unto yourselves a fallow ground :[As a fallow ground must be well ploughed up and cleansed anew , that it may be fit to receive good feed, and to bear good fruit : so purge yourselvev throughly from all uncleanesse, and be renewed as new creatures , and put on the new man ,&c Compare Hebr.6.7 , Gal 6.15Ephes. 4.22,23 ,24 ] and sowe not among thorns . Compare Matth.13.7,22.]
\p
\v 4 Circumcise yourselves to the LORD ,[see deut.10 on verse 16 and 30 on verse 6 and furthur Genes.17 also below chap.9.26.] and put away the fore-skins of your heart , ye men of Juda , and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my wrath come forth like a fire [compare Deut 4. on v 24] and burn, that none can quench (it) because of the wickednesse of your dealings
\p
\v 5 Declare it in Juda, and cause it to be heard at Jerusalem,and say,ye blow the trumpet in the land:cry with a full (voice),[Heb. Cry,fulfill. Of such a connexion of two words, see Psal.45. On verse 5. The meaning is, cry out to the fool everywhere, let all places be filled with proclamation. Others cry,gather together,lay,make a full Congregation, that everyone may hear and know it: for it shall be a general calamity thorowout the whole land] and say,Assemble yourselves and let us go into the defenced Cities. [Against the enemies coming. Hebr. Cities of defence.
\p
\v 6 Set up the standards towards Zion [For a token that they must all flee to Jerusalem as a Royal fort] flee in heaps, [or, mightly strengthen yourself for the flight. So below, chap 6.1 and Isai 10.31. Oath heap yourselves together,gather yourselves together,flock together (as we say) as Exod 9.19. to wit, to flee altogether. The Hebrew word ( that is found in the forementioned places) hath the signification of fleeing, departing,retiring to some other place, and of gathering together] stay not: for I bring evil [ that is, great mischief,misery,and calamity,as the last words of this verse do shew} from the North, [ from Chaldea, or Babylon] and a great breach. [ or ,breaking: that is, misery,calamity,destruction,desolation,as below, v.20 and chap. 6. 1 ,14 and 6. 11,21 and 10. 19 & 14.17.

\p
\v 8 For this gird on sacks ,[ see Genes .37. on verse 34.] lament and howl, for the heat of the LORD's anger is not turned away from us .
\p
\v 9 And it shall come to passe at that time, saith the LORD,(that the heart of the King , and the heart of the Princes shall perish: [That is , all their courage shall fail. See 2 Kings 25,&c and below chap. 39 and 52] and the Priests shall be astonished , and the Prophets shall wonder .[ to wit, the false Prophets . See following annot. On v 10.]
\p
\v 10 Then said I, Ah Lord,LORD, Truly, thou hast greatly deceived [Hebr. Deceiving deceived ] this people and Jerusalem, saying , Yea shall have peace ; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul[Compare below verse 18 The meanig is,thu hasr greatly deceived ,&c. To wit by the false prophets , whom thou suffereth to promise falsely unto the people, under the pretence of thy Name and Service, all happinesse and prosperity ,whereas indeed utter misery and destruction is at hand . Compare 1 kings 22.21,22,23, and the annotat. there, also Ezech.14.9. And below chap 6.14 and 7. 4,10, and 23.1.]
\p
\v 11 At that time shall it be said to this people , and to Jerusalem;A dry winde from the high places in the wildernesse, by the way of the daughter of my people ; [That is, towards the land of Juda, and Jerusalem ]not to fan, nor to cleanse [But to waste, will the LORD say ;A dry, or thin, oth. Smooth winde .That is, that will go thorow smoothly and wothout opposition , to cast all things down to the ground : Meaning the Babylonians that should come from the North , upon the mountain of Libanus. See below v.15.]
\p
\v 12 There shall come unto me the winde that shall be too strong for them [Hebr. Full; that is, too strong, that they shall be not able to indure and with-stand it.Hebr.fuller then they.Oth. A full winde from those .(places) to wit, that are describe before] now will l also uter judgements upon them [ that is , pass my doom or sentence upon them .That is , l will hold a Court for the trial of them .See above chap.1.16. Another use of this phrase is below, chap.12.1]
\p
\v 13 Behold he cometh as clouds[The Babylonians shall come as swifly against thee ,as clouds ,&c ] and his charets are as whirl-winde, his horses are swifter, {Hebr.lighter]then eagles : wo unto us , for we are waste .[they are the word of the Jews as being sensible of feeling Gods judgement: or, the words of the Prophet,as lamenting the misery of the people .]
\p
\v 14 Wash thine heart from wickednesse, O Jerusalem ,[compare Isa.1.16] that thou mayest be saved , how long shall ye suffer the thoughts of thy vanity [that is, thy vain thoughtsreby tho reliest on vanity and falsehood , or iniquity ]to over-night[or to lodge, to abide]in the innermost (part) of thee?
\p
\v 15 For a voice declareth from Dan ,[The coming of the Babylonians, that march from thence thorow Israel towards Juda .Dan was the outermost border of Cannan in the North ] and causeth misery to be heard ffrom mount Ephraim.[ The innermost border of Israel in the North of Juda .]
\p
\v 16 Make mention to the Nations, behold, cause it to be heard against [that shall beseige and environ Juresalem, and shall take diligent heed that bnone shall escape. See 2 Kings 25.4,5 .] from a farre countrey;[to wit, frrom Babylon] and they lift up their voice [Hebr, give their voice ; that is , make a noise, as above, chap.2.15.] against the cities of Juda.
\p
\v 17 As the watchmen of fields [ that beset the fields on evey side , that the wild beasts that are hunted may no where escape ] are they round about against her : beseiging Jerusalem on every side , 2 Kings 25.1&c] because she [to wit, Jerusalem, as appeareth ,vers.14.] hath been rebellious against me , saaith the LORD.
\p
\v 18 Thy way, [That is , thy bad condition and practise , see Genes.6 on vers.12.] and thy dealings have done these things unto thee ;[occasioned and caused all these palgues] this is thy wickednesse [ thai is , the fruit and reward of thy wickednesse] that is(so)bitter : [Oth , therefore it is so bitter ; to wit, the suffering that is nigh at hand .Oth, that he (to wit, the enemy) is so bitter, and seeketh thy life, and utterly undo thee, compare v.10.]
\p
\v 19 O my bowels, my bowels! [These and the rest that follow on this verse are the words of the Prophet, who is exceedingly troubled in the presense of God, as if he beheld these miseries with his own eyes. Compare Isai.15.5 and 16.11 and 21.3.] Iam in travel , O the walls of mine heart ; that is , in my midriff, heart- covering , in my inner parts in my heart] mine heart maketh a noise in me , l can not hold my peace : [Or be still] for thou, my soul, heareth the sound of the trumpet, and the cry of war.
\p
\v 20 Breach upon breach is cryed out ;[That is , one misery or estruction is no sooner gone , but we presently here tidings of another .Compare Psal.42.8. And se above v.6.] for the whole land is destroyed : suddenly are my tents [ that is, the habitations of my people ]destroyed ,my curtains in a moment .[that is, very suddenly.]
\p
\v 21 How lond shall l see the standard? Hear the voice of the trumpet?
\p
\v 22 Surely, my people is foolish ,the do not know me;they are foolish children, and have no understanding : they are wise to do evil ,[Crafty and well verst in evil. Compare 2 Samuel 13. on verse 3.]but to do good they know not.[Compare Amos 3.10.]
\p
\v 23 I beheld the land, [To wit the land of Juda] and lo , it was waste and void: [see Genes. 1.2 This is a figurativ description and a lively portraiture of an universal and terrible desolation and ruine of the land of Juda] also the heaven and its light was not .[that is, the heaven was dark and black. Compare Isai.5.30and 50.3 and below vers. 28.]
\p
\v 24 I beheld the mountains, and lo, they trembled: and all the hills shaked.[ Hebr.made themselves light , or swift; that is, moved themselves swifly.]
\p
\v 25 And l beheld, and lo, there was no man: and all the birds of the heaven were flewn away.[Hebr. Properly swerved away , or fled away. See below, ch . 9,10 and 50.3.]
\p
\v 26 I beheld, and lo, the fruitful land,[Hebr, carmel. See above .chap. 2 on vers.7.] was a wildernesse, and all the cities thereof [to wit,of the fruitful land that lay in it ]were broken down, because of the LORD ,[Hebr. because of the face of the LORD, which some take to be his anger , his angry face ,see above ,chap. 3 on vers.12.] because of the heat of his anger.]
\p
\v 27 For thus saith the LORD , This whole land shall be a desolation:[That is, everywhere exceedingly wasted ] (yet will l also make a full end) [or destruction, consumption . Compare below chap.5.10,18. Ezech.11.13 and 20.17. That is, l will not make an utter desolation, but yet inter-mingle my mercy with my wrath, and reserve me a remnant, and a feedin Jacob. See below chap. 30.11 and 46.28. This God inserteth here , among the terrible threatnings , for the comfort of the elect and believers . Some conceive that the meaning of these words is: There shall not be an end for all this ; my wrath and judgements shall not yet cease for all this, shall still go on , and continue a long while upon this Land:Whereunto they apply the mourning of the earth and Heaven, whereof mention is made in the sequel . This phrase is used in another sense of sinners , that have exremely offended , and filled up the measure of their sins.See Genes. 18 on vers.21.]
\p
\v 28 For this shall the earth mourn, and the heaven above be black:[As wearing mourning-apparel.See Psal.35. On vers.14.] bec ause I have spoken it, I have purposed it , and it shall not repent me , neither will I turn back from it.
\p
\v 29 All the cities flee[Hebr.all the City ,or, the whole City is fleeing; that is,the citizens , or, the inhabitants of the cities (as the following words shew) shall flee and so in the sequel] for the cry [hebr. Voice] of the horsemen and they go into the clouds ,[That is, up to the tops of mountains, that reach to the very clouds , for to hide themelves there .Oth, into thick , or close places, as thickets,etc.] and climb up upon the rocks : all the cities shall be forsaken, so that no man dwell therein .
\p
\v 30 What will thou do then, thou wasted one? [ To wit. Daughter of Zion, as in the following verse. That is,thou that shalt be waste or destroyed]though thou shouldst clothe thyself with scarlet, though thou shouldst adorn thy self with golden ornaments, though thou shouldst rent thy face with painting,[ though thou shoudst attire and paint thyself so much , and so often, as that thy face and cheeks should come to split and rent by it :To wit, in an idolatrous and heathenish manner, to please and mitigate thine enemies : as harlots do trick up themselves , to please their lovers] (yet) shouldst thou trim thyself in vain: the lovers,[To wit,the Babylonians, that seek to master thee] despise thee ,they will seek thy soul . [That is, seek thy life. See 2 Sam.4. on vers.8]
\p
\v 31 For l hear a voice as of a (woman) that is in a travell , an anguish as of one that is in pain of the first childe. The voice of the Daughter of Zion , she draweth breath painfully,[Oth. Sigheth, lamenteth, by reason of her burden and distresse] she spreadeth forth her hands , [As those are wont to do , that mourn exceedingly, and are in extreme pain] (saying) O wo (is) me now, for my soul is weary because of the murderers.[Tha Babylonians.]

\s A complaint of the sad and faerful condition of Jerusalem and Juda ; As that there were no godly men more to be found among small or great,vers. 1 .4,5.That all grosse sins were rise among them,as, false and hypocritical swearing, 2. obstinacy and hardnesse of heart , 3,21,22,23,24. Idolatry, 7,19. Adultrey and whoredom ,7,8. Contempt of Gods word , and of his Prophets ,11,12,13,. Riches gotten by wicked and theevish devices ,26,27. Justice in judgement ,28. Prevailing of the false Prophets , and wicked Priests ,31 .For all which sins God threateneth to punish them by the Chaldeans ,9,14,15,&c. Yet without destroying them utterly ,10.
\p
\v 1 Go about thorow the divisions of Jerusalem, and behold now, and enquire and seek in the streets thereof; if ye can finde any man , if there be one that doth judgement , that seeketh truth;[or faithfulness, faith .The Lord intimateth , that all places were full of hypocrisie] then will I be gracious unto her .[Or pardon it, That is , I ill spare the whole City of Jerusalem for the godly mans sake .compare Genes.18.24&c.]
\p
\v 2 And though they say ; (as true as ) the LORD liveth ;[ when they do sometimes swear by my Nme for a cloak and covering of their Idolatrous swearing , whereof below verse 7.] yet [Or surely ,so, Oth. Therefore ] they swear falsly[To wit. Because they seek not judgemment , nor faithfulness ,or truth.
\p
\v 3 O LORD do thine eyes (look)after the truth? [That is, it is doubtless true , that thou regardest faith and truth , without which thou hatest all outward shew ,as meer hypocrisie]thou hast smitten them, but they have felt no pain;[That is thou hast plagued them in diverrs manners, and at sundry times consuming a great part of them , as fplloweth, but have not been bettered by it, but have remained as obstinate and hardened as they were before. Compare Isai.1.5 and 9.13. above chap.2.30] thou hast consumed them (but) they have refused to receive correction :[see above chap. 2.30] they have made their faces harder than a rock, so that they are exceedingly impudent . Compare above chap.3.3.] they have refused to return.
\p
\v 4 But I said : [To wit, with myself: that is , I thought ] surely, these are poor :[a company of poor ,ignorant people ] they deal foolishly , because they know not the way of the LORD , the judgement of their God .
\p
\v 5 I will go [ Hebr. I will go me, according to the Hebr phrase] to the great ones, and speak with them; for they know the way of the LORD , the judgement of their God: but they had altogether broken the yoke, (and) burst the bonds. [Compare Psal.2 on verse 3]
\p
\v 6 Therefore a loin out of the forest hath slam them ,[That is, shall shy them. Spoken in a Prophetical manner of the future invasion of the Babylonians ] a Wolf of the deserts [or ,of the entrings ] shall waste them, a Leopard watcheth against their Cities, whosoever goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces : see of the Hebrew word . Psal.50 on verse 22.] for their transgressions are multiplyed, their backslidings are grown exceeding many
\p
\v 7 How should I pardon thee [O Jerusalem] for this? Thy children forsake me , and swear by them that are no Gods ; when I have satisfied them,then they commit adultery and assembly by heaps in the harlots house .
\p
\v 8 (Like) well fed stone Horses, they are up betimes, they neigh[Through lustfulnes like wanton Horses . Compare below chap.13.27.] everyone after his neighbours wife. Compare Ezech.22.11.]
\p
\v 9 Should I not visit [To wit, by punishment . See Genes.21. On vers.1.] for these things, saith the LORD? Or should not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ? Compare below vers.29 and chap.9.9]
\p
\v 10 Climb up her walls [To wit ,Jerusalems walls. It is spoken to the enemies ] and destroy her , (but make not a full end)[ compare above chapt. 4 on verse 27.] take away her tops ,[Or , stickings out, pinnacles , battlements . Oth. Plant, branches , foundations] for they are not the LORDS.[They, to wit, the people,or, the walls and battlements pertain not to the LORD, who will now no more own Jerusalem with all her fair forts and strong holds of his , because of the wickednesse of the inhabitants thereof.]
\p
\v 11 For the house of Israel and the house of Juda , have delt very unfaithfully [Hebr.dealing treacherously delt treacherously] against me , [compare above chap.3.20.] saith the LORD.
\p
\v 12 They deny the LORD, and say ,It is not he:[ It is not the LORD, by whose command the Prophets do threaten us all manner of evil]neither shall evil come upon us, [compare Isi 25.15.] neither shall we see [That is, we shall not finde nor feel]See Job 7. on vers. 7.] sword nor famine.
\p
\v 13 Yea those Prophets[ The true Prophets. These are yet the words of the people ] shall be winde,[ Their Prophecies shall not be accomplished , nothing shall come of it, it's but winde. Compare Mich 2 .11 and Job 6. on vers. 26.] for the Word is not with them : [they have not the Word of the LORD. He doth not speak such things by them. Compare 2 Chron. 36.16.]thus shall it come unto them [That which theythreaten us, shall ligh pon theselves]
\p
\v 14 Therefore thus saith the LORD the God of Hosts, [See 1 Kings 18 on vers.15 ] because ye speak this word : Behold I will make[ Hebr, give] my words in thy mouth ,[Here God speaketh to Jeremia Compare above chap.1.9,10, where God also ascribeth his own work to the Prophets , because he would comfirm the word of his servant. See there on vers.10.]fire,and this people, wood, and is shall consume them.
\p
\v 15 Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far,[From Babylon .see Isai .5.20 and Deut 28.49 above chap.1.15 and below chap.6.22] O house of Israel , saith the LORD;it is a strong [Or,rough,hard]nation, it is a very ancient nation ,[Hebr, a nation of antiquity, eternity,or,age ;That is ,a mighty nation of old,ever from Nimrods time .see genes.10.8,etc and above chap.2 on vers.20, a nation,whose language thou shalt not know , neither hear[That is , understand . See Genes.11. On vers. 7 .] what they shall speak.
\p
\v 16 Their [T wit, this nations, whereof in the former verse] quiver is an open sepulchre.[That is, they shall kill, and bring to the grave, multitudes of you with thei arrwes ]they [To wit , the Babylonians] are all champions.
\p
\v 17 And they [To wit,that strange nation] shall eat up thine harvest, amd thy bread ,[Compare Levit,26.16, Deut.28.31,33.] (Which)thy sons and thy daughters shaould eat ; that is, consume them .Compare below chap.8.16] they shall eat up thy sheep, and thy oxen, [Thy small and great cattel] they shall eat up thy vine, and thy figtree:[That is ,the fruit of thy vines and fig-trees] the [to wit, the Babylonian soilders] shall impoverish thy fenced Cities , wherein thou trustedst with the sword .
\p
\v 18 Nevertheless, in those dayes, saith the LORD, I will not make a full end with you .[See above chap.4 on vers.27.]
\p
\v 19 And it shall come to passe, when the shall say,;Wherefore hath the LORD our God done all thes things unto us ? [compare below chap.16.10.] that thou shalt say unto them ;[To wit, in my Name, with my words,as appeareth by that which followeth ] Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange Gods in your Land , so shall ye sere foreigners, in a Land,that is not yours.
\p
\v 20 So declare this in the house of Jacob, and let it be heard in Juda saying:
\p
\v 21 Hear now this , ye foolish, and hert-laees people :[ That is, which have no understanding : no eyes nor ears of the soul, to consider and obey the Word of God . Compare below chap.6.10.]which have eyes ,but see not ,which have ears, but hear not.
\p
\v 22 Will ye not fear me , saith the LORD? Will ye not tremble before before my face?I that have placed the sand, for a bound unto the sea ,by an everlasting statute , that shall not passe over it : though the wavesthereof tosse themselves, yet shall the not prevail , though they roar, yet shall they not passe over it [Compare Job.38.10,11. Psal.33.7 and 104.9.]
\p
\v 23 But this people have a revolting and rebellious heart : the are revolted and gone away.
\p
\v 24 Neither say they in their heart : Let us now fear the LORD uor God , that giveth rain, both the former rain, and the latter rain.[see Deut.11on vers .14 ] in it's season:[See Psa;.1 on vers.3.] who reserveth unto us the weeks, the appointed times of the harvest.[Some understand hereby every seventyyear, wherebthey had to let the land rest , and to lie untilled , in which yeers God had promise them singular blessing. See Levit.25.4,etc and vers.20 etc Oth. The set, or, appointed weeks of the harvest.See Levit.26.2,10 Oth. The oaths of the appointed times.
\p
\v 25 Your iniquities turn away those things ,[To wit, the blessing mentioned in the former verse] and your sins hinder that good from you .
\p
\v 26 For among my people are found wicked ones : every one of them layeth wait ,[Hebr. Layeth wait; that is, every obne of them] as the fowler do order themselves.[That lie down,bow,bend and frame themselves , to catch bords with all the craft and policy that maybe .Oth as the for among my people are found wicked ones : every one of them layeth wait ,[He layeth wait, that is, every one of them ]as the fowler do order themselves ,[that lie down,bow,bend,and frame themselves , to catch bords with all the caft and policy that may be .Oth. As the fowlers do set (snares)] they set a destructive snare[Hebr.destruction ,or, something that destroyeth ; that is, that destroyeth men ] they catch men.
\p
\v 27 As a cage is full of birds ,so are their houses full of deceit.: therefore they are grown great and rich.[That is, full of wealth, which they have gotten by deceit.]
\p
\v 28 They are fat ,[Compare Deut.32.15.]they are smooth ,yea, they surpas the deeds of the wicked,[That is, they are bworse in their practices, then the most wicked of all are wont to be .Compare above c.2.33. Oth .they transgresse (by)wicked facts .Hebr. They surpass,or,exceed the words,things, matters,or, dealings of the,or, of a wicked man:or, thus, they go thorow,by wicked devices:That is, commit all manner of wickednesse bodly.]they judge not the cause,(even) the cause of the fatherlesse,[Compare Isai.1.23, Zach.7.10.]yet they are prosperous;[That is,they prosper,grow rich,fat,and well liking,as was said in the former words]neither do they judge the right of the needy.
\p
\v 29 Should I not visit for those things, saith the LORD? Should not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ? See above vers.8 and below chap.9.9.]
\p
\v 30 A terrible and horrible thing is done in the Land.[Compare below chap.18.13. And 23.14. Hos.6.10.]
\v 31 The Prophets[To wit, the false Prophets] prophesie falsly, [Hebr. In, or, with falshood,or, lying.Compare below chap. 14 .18 and 23.25,26. Ezech.13.6.] and the Priests bear rule by their hands,3,14,15.,[That is, by the help and service of the false Prophets.The one helpeth and strenghteneth the other .Or, they ear rule on their fides.Oth. Take in their hands ,to wit, gifts.] and my people are willing (to have)it so:[Hebr. Love it so] but what will ye do in the end thereof ?[Hebr. In the hindmost,last, or uttermost thereof ;or, of her; to wit, of Jerusalem,or,of the Land; that is, how will ye fare with it at last, when I shall visit ti, to wit, eirther Jerusalem,or the Land?Compare Deut.32.20. Oth. What would ye do at last? What grosse abominations would ye not commit at last?]
\c 6
\s God representeth lively before the eyes of the people the neer approach of the Babylonians, the beseiging and taking of Jerusalem,and their carrying of them away into captivity,v.1,11,12.21,22,&c. He exhorteth them to repentance ,8,16.But forasmuch as all manner of wickednesse as cruelty,oppression, and violence,7. Hardnesse of heart , rebellion,obstinacy ,10,16,17,29,30. coveteousness ,13.Back-biting,28.Falshood and flattery, both of Priests and Prophet 14,15,16.concept of Gods word, and following their own imaginations,19,28.Hypocritical worship, 20. prevailed; he foretelleth them, that they shall all, one after another be thrust forth out of the land, 9. and be strenghtened the Prophet against the wickednesse of the people, and the fruitfulness of his ministrey among them, 27, 29.
\p
\v 1 Flee in troops, yea children of Benjamin[see above ,chap.4. On vers.6 &understand by the children of Benjamin, the inhabitants of Jerusalem at the sequel sheweth.see judg.1.21. With annotat.] otu of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet at Thekoa,[see 2 Sam14 on vers.1] and lift up a token of fire , [as by such kind of tokens they are wont to advertise the inhabitants or citizens, in time of danger, of enemies approach . OTH. Tokens of smoke or, beacons.Her. Lifting up. Compare Jugd. 20.38,40.]as Bethlehem- Che-rem [see Num 3.on vers.9. Some are of opinion,that bthis place lay between Jerusalem and Thekoa] for they looketh [That is, sheweth it self , breaketh forth] evil out of the North ,[see above, chap. 1.on vers.13.] and a great breach.[ as above, chap.46.]
\p
\v 2 I have (indeed) likened the daughter of Zion[That is,Jerusalem, and consequently the inhabitants thereof. Or i have made the daughter of Jerusalem like,&c.]to a beautiful etc voluptious(woman.)
\p
\v 3 (But)there shall come shepherds [The Princes of the Babylonians. Compare below,chap.49.19.] unto her with her flocks:[that is, armies.Compare beIow, chap.49.20.]they shaII pitch[Heb.fasten,fix]tents round about against her,[understand hereby the beseing of Jerusalem]they shall eat up every one his place, [Hebr.hand, that is,place,as elsewhere.See Job1. On vers.14.]
\p
\v 4 Hallow the war against her, [That is, trim yourselves, prepare yourselves for war ,order the war ,proclim it, let them march up against Jerusalem, as followeth. Compare chap.12.3 and 22.7 and, 51.27,28.These are the words of the Babylonians, wjhom the Prophet bringeth in,speaketh in this manner ,as also vers.5.]get you up, and let us march at noon.[as below chap.15.8 ,that is, at bright day light ,dread,publickly] O wo unto us ,for the day is gone away ,[that is,our good dayes are past , adversity and misery is at hand :if they be taken for inserted words uttered by the Jews.Otherwise they may be also the words of the Babylonians ,that complain of themselves for neglecting time and opportunity, being greedy after the prey,as eager soilders are wont to do]and the shadowes of the evening are declined .[ or are spread, stretched out; that is, become great;it beginneth to wax dark, whereby sorrow and misery may be understood .See Genes.15. On vers.12.]
\p
\v 5 Get you up, and let us march by night, and detroy their Palaces.
\p
\v 6 For thus saith the LORD of hosts ,[See 1 Kings 18. on v 25.] Hew down trees, [to make a fort. See Deut.20.10.] and cast up a wall agaist Jerusalem : [as Jugd.20.15, see there ] she is the city that shall be visited ;[compare above chap.5,9,29] in the midst of her is meer oppression .[Hebr. She wholly,oppression is in the midst of her. That is concerning this whole City , there is nothing more rise in it everywhere, then oppression with delight and violence; she is full of deceivers and oppressours.]
\p
\v 7 As well giveth up, [or ,casteth up] her water,so she giveth up her wickednesse,violence and destruction is found in her ,torment and plaguing [which they cruelly offer unto their neighbours, causing the oppressed everywhere to lament and cry] is continually before my face .
\p
\v 8 Suffer thyself to be corrected, Jerusalem, let my soul be drawn away from thee[or,be loosed ,depart, be dis-mebred from thee, as one member from another ; a very pathetical phase ,having respect to Gods favour and loving kindnesse,which he had born and shewed to this City, as a husband to his wife. Compare above chap.2.2,3.] lest I make thee a desolation , a land not inhabited.
\p
\v 9 Thus saith the LORD of Hosts ,They[the Babylonians] shall diligently glean,[Hebr.gleaning glean. So that nothing that is worth any thing shall remain,but all shall be carried clean away,as grapes are thorowly gleaned in the vintage .Compare 2 Kings 24.15,16. and 25.11,12. and below, chap. 52.28,29,30. And see of this similitude , Judg.8 on v.2. And 20 on vers.45.] the remnant of Israel as a vine:Bring back thine hand as a wine-gatherer, into the baskets.[or, as a grape-gatherer , who filleth one basket after another full with grapes , and carrieththem away, so shall the Babylonians say to one another ,Ye must go back again, to fetch away Jews , some at one time, and some at another . Some hold these to be the words of God , as giving that enemy charge to do it.
\p
\v 10 To whom shall I speak, and make protestation, that they may hear it? Behold their ear is uncircumcised,[as it were covered with foreskin,so that they are unfit to hearken or attend, or consider, as followeth.Compare Lev. 26.41. Acts 7.51. and above chap.5.21] that they cannot hearken: behold the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach,[they despise it, and mock at it ] they have no delight in it [to wit. In the word of the LORD : or, in him, to wit, the Lord.]
\p
\v 11 Therefore iam full of the fury of the LORD [That is, with denouncing, declaring, and prophesying the fury of the Lord] Iam grown weary with holding in, I will pour out ,[oth, pour out, as if the LORD , or the Prophet by the spirit of the LORD had said ; I have waited long enough, tell them in plain terms , that Gods wrath shall be poured out without pitying or sparing any ] upon the little children .[Hebr, the little childs , see of the Hebrew word,Psal.8. On v.3.]in the street , and upon the assembly of young men together : for even the husband with the wife shall be taken prisoners , the aged with him that is full of dayes.[that is , very old , stricken in years,decrepit.]
\p
\v 12 And their houses shall be turned over unto others , with (their) fields and wives together:[That is, they shall be taken from you ,and given to others that shall possess them, as Numb.36.7] for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of this Land ,saith the LORD .
\p
\v 13 For from the least of them unto the greatest of them every one of them practiseth coveteousness e:[ as if one should say ,is coveting covetousness; that is henkereth after filthy lucre] and from the prophet, meaning the false prophet] unto the Priest, every one of them commited [Hebr. Doth] falshood.[That is, goeth about with lies and falshood .Compare above, chap. 5.31 and below ,chap.8.10. Where the very same words are repeated .]
\p
\v 14 And the heal the breach of the daughter of my people in the lightest (manner.)[That is, they comfort my people against the calamity that is threatened .(in the lightest manner)or, as a light manner,or break by a ligh speech, by telling a tale , as if it were by a jestor a sea e-crow,as if the sins or the punishments that were threatened , were of no concernment ] saying, Peace peace,[that is ,it shall go well, there is no danger ] yet there is no peace .
\p
\v 15 Are they ashamed, because they have committed abomination?[Oth.Have they(the Prophets and priests)made (my people) ashamed ,when they committed abomination ?] Yea ,they are not in the least ashamed neither know (they) to make (others) blush;[The Prophets and Priests are not ashamed themselves , neither do they make evil doers ashamed, so that there is no shame found among any .Hebr. Being ashamed , they are not shamed] tharefore they shall fall among them that fall; at the time that I shall visit them , they shall stumble ,saith the LORD.
\p
\v 16 Thus saith the LORD, stand in the wayes , and behold, and ask for the old paths ,[Hebr.paths of eternity, that is, which God, in former times ever taught and led his people in , to bring them to salvation . Compare above chap.2. On v.17, and below , chap.18. 15.] where indeed is the good way, and walk therein, then shall ye find rest [comfort and salvation] for your souls: but they say,We will not walk (therein.)
\p
\v 17 Also they have set watchmen over you ,saying, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet .[That is, I have set Prophets over you ,that shall declare and proclaim unto you the jugdements that are at hand,as watch-men that are set upon high places to see afar off ,and to give warning by the trumpet of the enemies approach, or any other ensuing danger.See Isai.21.11. Ezek.3.17. And 33.7,&c.] but they say,We will not hearken.
\p
\v 18 Hear ye Gentiles.[To be witnesses of the abominable unthankfulnesse and obstinacy of my people, and of the justice of my judgements upon them]and peceive, O thou congregetion, [Of the nations] what is among them.[what wickednesse is rise among my people]
\p
\v 19 Hearken ,O earth,[seeDeut.4.on vers.26 and 32.on vers.1.]behold,I will bring evil upon this people, the fruit of their thoughts:[The just deserved punishment of their wicked devices and practices.See Prov.1.on vers.31 and below chap. 17.10] for they regard not my words , and my law they reject it.
\p
\v 20 To whay purpose then shall (there) come frankincense for me from Sheba ?[which thou causest to come with great trouble and charges, to make incense for me, as it were to please me withal.Of Scheba, see Genes.10.on vers.7. And Isai.60. 6.] and the best calamus[Or, Cynamom, sweet-smelling reed, or, cane, as Exod 30.23.]from a far countrey? Your burnt-offerings are not pleasing(unto me,) [Hebr.for,or,according to pleasure in them .Compare Psal.19.15. Isai.56.7.] and your slay-offer ings are not sweet [That is, acceptable] unto me.
\p
\v 21 Therefore thus saith the LORD, Be hold I will lay all manner of stumbling blocks before this people:[Hebr.stumbling blocks in the plural number.So the Lord calleth all the instruments, means and occasions of the ruine of the Jews] and the fathers and the children together, the neighbour and his companion[ That is, all sorts of men,of what condition or quality forever they be] shall dash themselves agaist them ,and shall perish.
\p
\v 22 Thus saith the LORD ;Behold there cometh a people from the North-country ;[As above vers.1.] and a great nation shall be raised [By God, to match up to the boarder of Juda, and from thence into the midst of the Land] from the sides of the earth.[pOr, of the Land; that is , uttermosts parts, or borders.]
\p
\v 23 They shall carry bowe and spear,[Or, standards, spear,or,pole .See Job.8.on vers.18. For carry, the Hebrew hath lay hold en; that is hold and carry. Compare below chap.50.42, &c. Where the very fame is prophesied of the Medes and Persians, that should come against Babel] it is cruel (people,) and they shall not be merciful,their voice shall roar like the Sea, and they shall ride upon Horses : it[ To wit, this people, or, everyone ; to wit of this people] is prepared, or set in aray] as a man for war, against thee, O Daughter of Zion.
\p
\v 24 We have had the fame thereof,[The fame of this peoples approach] our hands arre grown feeble : [Our courage iss fallen. See 2 Sam.4. On verse 1] anguish hath taken hold of us,pain,as of a (woman) in travel. [ This is a lively description of a future calamity. Compare above chap.4.31. And below chap.49.24.. and 50.43.]
\p
\v 25 Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way: for the sword of the enermy is there,terror round about. [As below chap 49.29.]
\p
\v 26 O Daughter of my people, gird on a sack, as above chap.4.8.] and wallow thyself in ashes, [ See 2 Sam 1. on vers .2. and below chap.25.34. Oth sprinkele thyself with ashes] make thee mourning of an onely (son,) [That is, as for the death of an onely son. See Amos 8.10. Zach.12.10.] most bitter wailing; Hebr wailing of bitterness] for the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.
\p
\v 27 I have set thee(for) a watchtower,[or a tower of spying out,looking out(specular) Compare 1 Sal 23.13. Oth. An approved tower; that is, a strong invincible tower. Compare above chap.1.18. They are words of God to Jeremia](for) a fortresse among my people: that thou mayest know and try their way.[That is,mayest observe their doings, examine them , and passe a right sentence concerning the same, and declare it unto them.]
\p
\v 28 They are all the most revolting ones of revolters.[That is,the most wickked revolters,that may be found. Compare Genes.9.on vers.25.] Walking (in) back-bitting,[slandrering me, my word, my Prophets,in particular thee,and lift up one another(by back-bitting) against thee. See the phrase, Levit.19.on vers.16.] they are copper and iron: [That is ,stiff-necked,or,of little worth; whereas they ought to be like gold and silver. Compare Ezech22.18,&c.] they are all corrupters .[corrupting themselves and others .Oth.corrupt(children)]
\p
\v 29 The bellows are burnt , the lead is consumed of the fire .in vain hath (the melter) melted so diligently [Hebr.melted, melting ,for to refine .Oth in vain hath the melter melted] seeing the wicked are not plucked away.[That is, could not be severed from the drofle of their wickednesse,Oth.the wickednesses,or, the wicked things ;that is, allevil:as the Hebrew word(that otherwise continually signifieth, the wicked)is also taken.Psal.78.49.Compare below chap.15.19. Where the same similitude is used, but in another case: they are two distinct things, to cleanse the wicked from their wickedness, and to distinguish the godly from the wicked.The meaning of the words of this verse is, that all the pains that the prophets have taken ,to purify this people from the drosse of their sins,was in vain:The similitude is taken from the refining of metals]
\p
\v 30 Men call them [Hebr. They call them,or, did call them : that is, men called them, they are called , as elsewhereoften]reprobate silver: for the LORD hath rejected them.[Compare Isai. 1.22.].

\p
\s God causeth his people to be exhoeted to true repentance, and ceasing from their vain confidence in their vain confidence in the outward worship of God and the Temple,with an upbraidind of their wivked and impudent abuse thereof, vers. 1 , etc. He threateneth them with the example of salv, 12. He forbiddeth the Prophet to pray for the people, because of their idolatrous outrages, 16. He exhorteth them to mourn for the abominations of Prophet, in the valley of the son hinnom, 29.
\p
\v 1 The word that came to Jeremia, from the LORD, saying:
\p
\v 2 Stand in the gates of the LORD's house, [That is, the Temple, as vers.4.] and proclaim here this word,and say: Hear the word of the LORD, O all Juda, ye that enter in thorow these gates, to worship the LORD. [Hebr. Properly, to bow yourselves, or, to bow down before the LORD. See Genes.24. On vers 26.]
\p
\v 3 Thus saith the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel; Make your wayes and dealings good: [Whereas your conversation and dealing at present is wicked, therefore amend it so, as that departing from evil, ye purpose and practise thing that is good, that is, truly repent. See below, vers.5. and chap.18.11, etc. The word amending, signifieth otherwise to make a thing that is good, yet better, and so to grow and increase in goodness] then will I cause you to dwell in this place [To wit,settle you from age to age in your habitation, as below vers 7.]
\p
\v 4 Trust not in false words, [Hebr. words or, things of lying, or, of falsehood; that is, whereby you should come short and deceive yourselves. So below vers.8] saying: The temple of the LORD, THE temple of the LORD are thefe.[As it were pointing with the finger at the building of the Temple, wherein the Court, the Holy place, and the Holy ofHolies, were all of them called Holy places, and habitations of the Lord. This was the vain compfor and confindence of the false Prophets, whereby they hardned the people in their wickednes: To wit, that there were no danger, because they had the Temple, and the Temple- worshop among them, wherey they thought to be sufficiently secured, although in the mean while they lived wickedly, and thereby prophaned all things,as is shewd in the sequel. Oth. These things( to wit, our services) (pertain to) the Temple : the meaning being one, and the fame with the former.]
\p
\v 5 but if ye shall truly make good your wayes: if ye shall truly do judgement [Hebr. Making good, shall make good, and doing judgement, shall do judgement] between the man, and between his neighbour: Compare above chap 5.28]
\p
\v 6 (If ye) shall not oppresse the stranger, the fatherless and wiow, [See 1Sai 10.1,2:] and shed no innecent blood in this place. [See isa 59.7] and shall not walk after other gods, to your evil: For which you should be fain to fare ill]
\p
\v 7 Then will i cause you to dwell in this place, in the Land, that i gave to your father, from age to age. [That is, from one age to another; that is, for ever.]
\p
\v 8 Behold, ye trust in false words, [As above vers . ] that profit not.
\p
\v 9 Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear false, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not?
\p
\v 10 And (then) come and stand my face in this house, [As if the Lord should sa, Are ye not ashamed to deal to hypocritically and wickedly?] which is called by my Name, [Hebr. Upon which my Name is called, or, proclaimed. So vers 11.14,30 and below chap 14.9. and 15 16 etc. Compare the phrase with Isai 4 1. ] and say, We are delivered, [That is, There is no cause to fear, we are now free and out of danger, we shall cerainly worship] to do all thse abominations? [ That is, to give your selves this leave and liberty, and to harden your selves more and more in this wikednes, and to go on in it. Oth. That we may do all these abominations]
\p
\v 11 Is then this house, which is aclled by my Name, a den of murderers [Hebr. Properly, breakers though, breakers in; that is, such as use violence, high – way men, theeves, robbers, murderers. See Psal 17. on vers 4 ] inyour eyes? [That is, do ye so esteem of it? Is it in your judgement such an house , etc? Compare Matth 21.13. Mark 11.17. Luke 19.46] Behold , i have also seen it, saith the LORD. [As if God should say, Are ye not ashamed to commit such abominations in my fight, before mine eyes? Know therefore also, that i do behold it, and i will requite it: for, etc]
\p
\v 12 For go your wayes now unto my place, wich was at Silo, where i caused my Name to dwell [ See Psal 78.60. and compare 1Kings 8.13. with the annotat] at the first, [ After that Joshua had taken possetion of the Landof Cannan. See Jos 18.1] and see what i did to it, captive by Philistines. See 1 Sam 4.11 Psal 78. 60,61. and afterward caused the ten tribes, under which Silo lay, to be carried away cative into Assyria. See vers 14.15] because of the wickedness on my people Israel.
\p
\v 13 And now, because ye do all these works, saith the LORD, and i spake unto you, being up early, and speaking, [That is, sending my Prophets unto you early, and be-times, constantly and continually, with fingular diligence. See 2 Chron 36 on vers 15 so below vers25. And chap 11.7 and so often in this book] but ye heard not, i called you, but answered not: [see Prov 1.24 Isa 65.12 and 66.4 ]
\p
\v 14 Therefore will i do [By the Babylonians] unto this house, which is called by my Name, wherein ye trust, and unto this place, which i gave to you, and to your fathers, according as i have done to Silo.
\p
\v 15 And i will cast yoe away from my face;[Compare 2Kings 17 on vers 18] like as i have cast away all your breathern, the whole seed of Epharaim.[ meaning, the ten tribes comprehended often under the name of Epharaim ( As the greatest, chiefest , and noblest tribes) which where caried away out of their own Land into Assyria. See 2 Kings 17 vers 6 , 23 and 18. 11]
\p
\v 16 Thou then, pray not for this people neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, [The LORD speaketh this to Jeremiah ] neither run apon me: [By interceding, or speaking for them. See Job 21.15. so below chap 27.18 ] for i will not hear thee .
\p
\v 17 Seest thou not what they do inthe citie of Judah, and in the streats of Jerusalem?
\p
\v 18 The childern gather up wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the weman need to dore to make; [That is bake] figures cake [With idolatrous figures, as some expound the Hebrew word] for the Melecheth of Heaven, [The Hebrew word that is here left in the text, is diversly expounded by the learned. Some trunslate it in the Queen of Heaven; whereby some do understand the Moon; others, some great star. Other render it, the work or , workmenship of Heaven; that is the whole firmament with all the stars. Compare below chap 8.2 and 19.13. and 44. 17,18,19,25 .] to offer [Or testing to power out see Psal 16 on vers 4 . so below chap 19.13 and 32.29. and 44.17,18,19& c . ] drink- offerings unto other Gods, to vex me. [Or, to prvoke me to anger: the meaning of the whole verse is, There are all made and distructed with there idoltry.]
\p
\v 19 Do they vex me, saith the LORD? (do they) not (do it) to them selves? [Or, is it not to, or, against themselves?] to the confusion of their (own) face?
\p
\v 20 Therefore thus saith the Lord LORD; Behold , mine anger, and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon men, and upon beasts, [Hebr. Upon the men, and upon he beast] and upon the tree of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground : and (it) shall burn, and not be quenched.
\p
\v 21 Thus saith the LORD of Host, the God of Israel: Put your burnt – offering unto your slay – offerings, and eat flesh. [As if the Lord should say; Offer as much you will, and fill yur selves full with the thank offerings: ye do this for your selves, not to serve me by it, (Compare Hos 8.13.) as is showed in the sequel]
\p
\v 22 For i spakenot unto your father, nor commanded them, in the da when i brought them forth out of the Land of Egypt, concerning matters of burnt – offering or slay offering. [The meaning is , This was not the chiefest thing that i commanded them, as ye hypocrites conveive of it, but such sincere obedence, which they have not yeilded unto me, and ye yet lesse do yeed, as folloeth. See of such use of the word not, Hos.6. On vers 6. and below chap 16. on vers. 14.]
\p
\v 23 But this thing commanded i them, saying, Heartken to my voice, [See Deut.6.3.] so will i be a God unto you, [See Genes. 17. on vers 7. Compare Exod 19.5. Levit 26.12] and ye shall be people unto me: See Deut 7. on vers. 6.] and walk in all they way, that i shall command you, that it may go well with you.
\p
\v 24 But they be hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walk in the counfels,inthe opinion [see above chap 3.on vers 17] of their evil heart: and they turned [Heb. Became, or, were ] backward, and not forward. [Hebr according to, or, before the face. That is, they turned their neck, or, back, and not their face towards me, as above chap 2.27. and below chap 32.33,etc]
\p
\v 25 From that day, that your father were come forth out of the Land of Egypt, unto this day, i have sent unto you all my servants, the Prophets, daily, being up early and fending. [That is, sealonably and constantly fending. Compare above vers.13.]
\p
\v 26 But they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear: but they hardened their neck, [See Exod 32. on v.9 also below chap 17.23. and 19.15 Nehem 9.17,29] they made it worse than theiir fathers.
\p
\v 27 Also thou shalt speak all these words unto them, but they shall not hearken unto thee: thou shalt indeed call unto them, but they shall not answer thee.
\p
\v 28 Therefore say unto them; this is the people, that hearkeneth not unto the voice of the LORD their God, nor receiveth discipline; [See above chap 5.1.] is perished, and destroyed [Or, cut off] from their their mouth.[That is, they all deal hypocritically, unfaithfully , and falsely, they keep not their word nor faith with their God]
\p
\v 29 Cut off the hair of thine head, [A token of great mourning. See Job 1.20, Isia 15.2 and below chap 16 on vers 6. The Hebrew word signifieth such kinde of hair, that a man hath let grow long, and from fame root cometh also the word Nezirite, of which see Numb.6.2,5. And Judg. 13.5. (O Jerusalem) and cast it away, and take up a Lamentation upon the high places: for the LORD hath rejected and for saken the generation [See Psal 12. on v.8] of his indignation.[r, running up, or, over- running anger; Or, (as lome) that had provoked his wrath, it cometh all to one sense. Compare Deut.32.on vers 19.]
\p
\v 30 For the children of Juda have done that have done that which is evil in mine eyes, saith the LORD : they have set their abominations[as above chap.4.1.] in the house [The Temple ] which is aclled my Name, [As above vers 10.] to pollute it.
\p
\v 31 And they have built the high places of Topheth, [See of abomination, 2 Kings 23 on vers 10] which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, [2 Kings 23. 10 called the valley of the children (Hebr. Sons) of Hinnom. See there and below chap 32.35.] to burn their sons and their daughters with fire: which i commanded not, [But indeed have sharply forbidden, and abhorred it. See Lev 18.21] neither came (it) into mine heart. {Or, ascended up into, or, upon mine heart. It is spoken of God after the manner of men; as we use to say, it never came into my minde, it came not once into my heart, it never vascended into my thoughts; meaning that i should command them such abominations, or, thst i should be pleaded with them. Compare above chap 3.16. and below 19. and 32.35. and 51.50. also Ezech. The same phrase is used somewhat otherwise below chap 44.21. for, to lay to heart, or that something cometh up into the heart, to observe and to punish it]
\p
\v 32 Therefore behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be called Topheth, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of murder: and they shall [Or, men shall,&c. ] bury in Topheth, [This place, which the idolatrous Jews by their abominable Idolatry held to be very holy, shall be then polluted by dead bodies of the slain. So below chap. 19.11,13] be because there shall be no place. [Oth, till there be no more place]
\p
\v 33 And the carcases [Hebr. The carase. So below chap 16.4 and 34.20 etc] of this people shall be meat for the fowls of Heaven, and for the beast of the earth : See Deut.28.26 below chap 34.25] and none shall sray them away.[Chafe away the fowls, or the beasts from the carcafes]
\p
\v 34 And i will cause to sease fro the Cities of Juda , and from the street of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bride groom and the voice of the bride : [Compare Isai 24.7 below chap. 16.9 and 25.10 Ezech 26.13 Hos 2.11] for the Land shall become a defolation. [Compare above chap 6.8]

\p
\s A furthur prophecy, concerning the future justly deserved reproach and distresse of the Jews, as well dead as alive, v.i, etc. And updraiding of their continual brutish impenitency, (with a disgracing of them by the example of the brute beasts) sottish and false boasting of wisdom, wresting of the law, falsehood, scornful flatteries and imudency of the false Prophets and Priests, general transgression, and idolatry: all which God will severely pnnish by the Babylonians, 4. Whereas the Prophes mourneth and Lamenteth bitterly, 18.
\p
\v 1 At that time, saith the LORD, they [ To wit, the Babylonians] shall bring out the bones of the Kings of Juda, and the bones of their Princes, and the bones of the Priests, and the bones of the inhabitants of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves.
\p
\v 2 And they shall spread them aroad before the Sun, and before the Moon, and before all the host of heaven; whom [ To wit, the Sun, Moon, etc.] they have loved, and whom they have served, [See above chap. 7.18. and below chap 19.3.] and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sougth, [Or, asked counsel of] and before whom they have bowed down them selves : they [To wit, the aforefatd bones] shall not be gathered , nor burted ; they shall be gahered, nor burted; they shall be for dung upon the earth. [Hebr. Upon the face of the earth; that is, in the open countrey.]
\p
\v 3 And death shall be chosen before life, [That is, they shall rather wish to be dead, than to live. Comapare Rev. 9.6.] by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family. In all the places of them that remain, whether i shall have driven them, saith the LORD of Hosts. [See 1 Kings 18. 0 vers. 15.]
\p
\v 4 Moreover, say unto them; Thus saith the LORD : shall men [Heb. Shall they; to wit, men : so in the following words, shall be, &c.] fall, and not rise again? Shall man turn away and not return ? [ That is, there is surely none so void of reason, as that he would not willingly rise again when he fallen, and would not gladly return into the right way, when he gone astray]
\p
\v 5 Why (then) doth this people at Jerusalem slide back, with an everlasting ick sliding? [O, strong, passing thorow, ever proceving, infinite everlasting back-sliding; that is, an exceeding obstinate back – sliding. Of the Hebrew word, see Psal 4. on vers.1 and 13 on vers. 2.]
\p
\v 6 I listened and hearkened, they speak that which is not right; there is no man , that repenteth him of his wickedness, saying, What have i done? Every one turneth him about to his course, as an outragious horse [That hunteth, neigheth, breaketh through, and runneth every where thorow, like a water – flood, from whence the Hebrew word is properly used: So the Scripture likewife compareth the neighing of an horse unto thunder, Job 39.22.] to the battel.
\p
\v 7 Even a stork on the Heaven, [Heb. In the Heaven; that is, in the air] knoweth her appointed times, and a turtle – dove, and crane, and swallow, abserve the time of their coming : [Or, a stork knoweth by the heaven, &c. That is, by the condition and change of aite. These brute creatures know by natural instinct, which they have from God, what is for their good. Comapare Isai.1 3.] but my people know not to judgement of the LORD. [Heed not that which is prescribed unto them by God in his word. Oth. The judgement of the LORD, which by all marks and token they might percieve, that God intended to bring upon them, if they did not repent]
\p
\v 8 How do ye say then, We are wife, and the Law of the LORD is with us? Lo, certainly, in vain [Heb. For lying;that is, in vain. See 1 Sam.25.21. Or, for faksehood, falsely] worketh the false pen of Scribes. [They that ought to understand and expound the Law aright, use mere falsehood. See 1 Sam 25.21. or, for falsehood pen of the Scribes. [They that ought to understand and expound the Law aright, use mere faslehood. See Ezra 7. on.v.6. These are delivery rendered, but all comes to one sense and meaning, to wit, that they wrote in vain many things concerning the Law of God, seeing they abused all to folsehood and lies, and did not in the least according to it, nor taught others to do so. Compare Matth.23.13. Luke 11.52. Rom.2.1, &c.]
\p
\v 9 The wife men [The Scribes, that falsly boasted of thier wisdom, as is said in the former verse] are ashamed, affrigthed, and taken : [Oth, have (These) wife men made (any one) ashemed? Were (the men) frighted and taken? To wit, by their reproofs, so that they repentend of their wickedness?] Behold, thay have rejected the word of the LORD, what wisdom [Hebr.(things) wisdom] should they have then?
\p
\v 10 Therefore wll i give thier wives unto others, their fields to (other) possessors: [Compare above,c 6.12.] for from the least unto the greuest, every one of them practiseth covetousners : from the Prophet unto the Priest every one of them committeth falsehood. [See the same words, that are recorded here and in the following verses, unto vers.13. Above chap.6.13,14,15. Savin fome alteration. See the annotat. There]
\p
\v 11 And they heal the breach of the daughter of my people in the lightest (manner,) saying, Peace, peace : nt there is no peace.
\p
\v 12 Are they ashamed, because they have [Or, when they have, &c,] committed abomination yea they are not in the least ashemed, and know not to blush : therefore they shall fall among them that fall, in the time of their visitation shall they stamble, saith the LORD.
\p
\v 13 I will surely snatch them away, [Of the Hebrew word, see Ps...6.on.v.9. Heb. Gathering i will gather them . Oth, devour, or confume,] saith the LORD : there are no gaps on the vine, nor figs on the fig – tree; yea the leaf is fallen off; [This may be fo understood, that they brought fouth no good works at all, yea had no shew or appearance of any. Comapare Isai.5.1, &c. Matth.21.19. Luke 13.6,&c. Or, (with other) it may be taken for the future general defolation of the Land : or, that, for a fore – going token thereof, it was all prefent already, fo with the fruits of the ground, and what there might yet remain, as that the enemy hence forward should take all quite away] and [Ot, for] (the commandments, which) i have given them, they transgresse them.[Oth, and (thd things,) that i have given them, (to wit, fruits of the ground, and other gifts) shall depart, or, passe away from them, or, i had given them indeedto them, (but) they shall depart from them]
\p
\v 14 Why do we sit still ? [They are the words of the distressed and fleeing people] assemble your selves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, [Hebr, cities of defence,Comapare below, chap.4 5.] and be silent there : [Waiting for help, or, deliverance, as some take it, having, respect unto following verse : or, that we may be quite there] Surely the LORD our God hath cause us to be silent, [So that we have nothing to say to all these plagues, as we were wronged. They are the Prophets words, wherein he answereth the words of the people, deriding ( as fome conceive) the vain hope of the Jews ] and and given us water of gall to drink, [That is, fent us bitter and deadly calamity. See Psal 69. on vers.22. So below cha.9.15 and 23.15.] because we have sinned against the LORD.
\p
\v 15 Men look for peace, but there is no good : [Or, we look, they look : wait (freely) whereas, etc. All to one sense]for a time of healing, [See Psal.20.on vers 3. These and the like phrases are oppoted to others, that make mentionof hurt, strips, wounds, &c. ] but behold, there is terrour.
\p
\v 16 The snorting of his [The King Babels] horses it head from Dan : [See above chap.4. On vers.15.] the whole Land trembleth at the sound of the neighings of his strong ones : [This may be understood eithe of the shouting of the strong champions of his army, or of his neighing of hisstrong horses] and they come, that they may eat up the Land, and the fulness thereof, [That is, all that dwell therein.
\p
\v 17 For behold, i send serpents, cockatries among you, against which (there) is no charming : [The most hurtfulenemies that are, the Chaldeans, whose power and crueltyye shall not bable to turn away, or escape. They are the words of God. See of the word charming, Psa.58. On vers. 6.] they shall bite you, saith the LORD.
\p
\v 18 My freshing is in,[Or, with] sorrow : mine heart is faint in me. [ That is, when i should refresh, and strengthen my nature with meat, drink, or sleep, the sorrow overwhelmeth me. Oth, when i would refresh, strengthen my self against sorrow, then mine heart is, &c. To one sense. The Prophet demeaneth himself, as if he saw the future calamity present before his eyes]
\p
\v 19 Behold, the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people is from a very far countrey : [To wit, Babel, whither they should be carried captive. Oth. (shall be heard) because of (them that come) from a far countrey; to wit,the Chaldeans. Hebr.as if one should say, land, or, countrey of remotenedres] Is not the LORD then at Zion? Is not her King with her? [Is the promise then at an end (may some man say) which he hath made so often concerning Zion and his people?] Why have they provoked me anger [Or, incesed me] with their carved images, with vanities of strangers? [With the idolatries of strange heathenish nations or, with strenge Gods. See 2 Kings 17. on v.15. Hebr.of the strange, unkown, outlandish, (one) It is Gods answer to the former question]
\p
\v 20 To harvest is past, the summer is at an end : yet we are not delivered.
\p
\v 21 I am broken [ Through heart grief, and inward sorrow. Comapare Psa. 51.on vers.19.] because of the breach [See above chap.4. On vers. 6.] of the Daugther of my people : i go in black, [As mourners use to do. See Psa.35. on vers.14.] astonishment hath taken hold on me.
\p
\v 22 Is there no balm in Gilead? [See Gen.37.25. and below chap 46.11. and 51.8.] is there no [Chirurgain, or Physician there?] As there was plenty of precious spice and oitments in Gilead, so that they were wont to be transported from thence into other countreys; so it seemeth that there were also skillful Physicians, or Chiruigians there. But some do apply these phrases by way of complaint of the spiritual means, whereby they should and ought to escape these miseries; to wit, true repentance, and following the good counsel of the faithful Prophets. Other understand it as derision of the vain means and remedies, whereby the people indevoured in vain to escape this mischeif. Both in good sense, but to the first fuiteth here very well the biginning of the next chapter] for, why is not the health [ Or, healing ] of the daughter of my people risen? [Or, why hath it not increased? Why is not my people healed, or cured, amended? See the same phrase, 2 Chro.24.13. Nehem.4.7. and below chap.30.13,17 .with the annotations]

\p
\s The prophet presenteth his lamentation, vers.1, &c.and wish th to be absent from his people, because of the abominations that were common among them, as adultery, treachery, lying and deceit, 2, &c. Disobedience, and idolatry, 13, 14. Therefore God must and would punish them, and so fearfully waste them, as that it be sufficiently lamented, 7, 9, 10, &c. God dehorteth from vain confidence, and teacheth his people to trust in him alone, and to endeavour after that which pleaseth him, 23 and Lastly, be threateneth not onely the Jews, as abusers, but also the Gentiles round about, as despisersof circumcision, 25..
\p
\v 1 Oh, that mine head were water, [Hebr.who will give, &c. A manner of wishing in use among the Hebrew. So in the sequel. See Deut.5. On v.29.] and mine eye a spring vein of tears!then would i weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people.
\p
\v 2 Oh, that i had in the wilderness a lodging place of way – faring men! [See Isa.24. On vers.20 ] then would i leave my people, and go from them : for they are all aldulterers, a treacherous company. [Hebr.or, assembly of treacherous ones. Oth. (on) the prohibitation day (that ously. See Levit 23. on vers.36.]
\p
\v 3 And they bend their tongue, (like) their bowe, for lies; [Hebr.tread, &c.as they do the foot – bowe when they bend it. Or, thus; They bend their tongue, their bowe is lies] they grow in the Land,but not for the truth : [Or, in the truth, or faith, faithfulnesse] for they proceed from wickedness, to wickednesse, [Compare Deut.29.19.with the annotat.above chap. 6.7] but they know not me, saith the LORD.
\p
\v 4 . Take you heed, every one of his friends, and trsut not in any brother : for every brother doth nothing but deceive, [Hebr.treading down treadeth down; that is, oppresseth, deceiveth all manner of wayes, Genes.27.on vers. 36.and below chap.17. On vers.7] and every friend walketh (in) back – bitting. [ Compare above chap 6.28.]
\p
\v 5 . And they deal deceitfully, [Oth.mock, deride. See the use of the Hebrew word, Genes.31.7. 1Kings 18.27. Job 31.9] every one with his friend, and speak not the truth; they teach their toung to speak lies, they weary themselves by dealing perversly
\p
\v 6 Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit : [These are the words of God to Jeremia. Of deceit; that is, of men, that deal most deceitfully : wherefore all thine admonition used among them are altogether in avain. Deceit, for Deceiver, see Job 35. on vers.13]
\p
\v 7 Therefore thus saith the LORD of Hosts; [ See 1 Kings 18. on verse.15.] Behold, i will melt them, and try them : [ By the fire of calamity, plagues and punishments: for they cannot otherwise be brought to the to the sense and feeling of their wickedness] for how should i do (other wise) in respect, of the Daughter of my people?
\p
\v 8 Their tongue is murdering arrow, [Oth, arrow stretched out, shot out, Compare Psal. 120.4. Prov.30.14.] it speaketh deceit : every one speaketh [Hebr.he speaketh; that is everyone , or, they speak] with his neighbour (of peace) with his mouth [Compare Psal.12.3.and 28.3.] but in his inmost (parts) [That is, in his heart] be layeth his snare. [Or, be layeth snares for him. Hebr. A snare]
\p
\v 9 Should i not visit them [With punishments. See Genes.21. On vers.1.] for these things, saith the LORD? And should not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
\p
\v 10 I will lift up a weeping and wailing for the mountains, and a lamentation for the shepherds – huts, [Or, pastures, where the shepherds have their habitations or huts] of the wildernesse: for they are burnt down, [That is, it shall surely so come to passe: and so in the sequel] (so) that none passeth thorow, nither do men hear the voice of cattel; frm the fowls of the heaven uno the beasts, are they swerved away, gone away, [As above cha. 50.3.]
\p
\v 11 And i will make Jerusalem heaps (of stone,) an habitation of Dragons: [Compare below chap.10.22.] and i will make the ities of Juda a desolation, without an inhabitant.

\v 12 Who is the wife man, that may understand this? [As if he had said, there are but very few such to be found among all the people, notwithstanding that i with other the servants of the Lord, do continually proclaim this by God command, against the seducings of false Prophets, who speak nothing but peace. See above vers. 8.11, 15.] and to whom hath the mouth of the LORD spoken, that he may be publish [Or, declare] it ? Wherefore the Land is perish (and) burnt like a wilderness, that no man passeth thorow it.
\p
\v 13 And the LORD said; Because they have spoken my law, which i had before their face, and have not hearkened unto my voice, nor walked according unto it:
\p
\v 14 But have walked after the conceit of their (own) heart: [As above chap.3.17.] and after the Baals, [See Judg. 2. on v.11.] which their father had taught them:
\p
\v 15 Therefore thus saith the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, i will gave them water of gall to drink: i will feed this people [Hebr. I will feed them, this people] with worms [That is, send them bitter, and destroying calamities and plagues. See above chap. 8.14. Deut. 29. on vers. 18. and Psal. 69. on vers. 20]
\p
\v 16 And will scatter them among the heathen, [See Levit 26.33] whom they have not known, they nor their fathers: and i will send the sword after them, till shall have confirmed them. [as below, ch. 49.37]
\p
\v 17 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, consider it, and call he morning women, that they may come: [This hat respect to the custome of those times and places, that in timeof great morning they sent for Singing – men, and Singing – women, that could sing artificial lamentations, to provoke men to weeping. See 2 Chron.35.25. And Job 3.8. Ezech. 32.16. Amos 5.16. Matth.9.23. Mark 5.38.
\p
\v 18 And make hast, and lift up a wailing for us: that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eye-lids gush with water, [That is, that tears may run down, fall down, flow down, come down from our eyes in great abundance. So below, chao.13.17. And 14.17.]
\p
\v 19 For there is a avoice of wailing heard out of Zion: How are we destroyed! We are geatly comfounded, because we have forsaken the land, because they have overturned our dwellings. Or because our dwellings have cast (us) out, or cast (us) away.]
\p
\v 20 Hear then the word of the LORD, ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailings, and everyone her companoin lamentations. [Hebr. Wailing, lamentation.]
\p
\v 21 For death is come up into our windowes, [Or, surely &c. and so the words of this verse may be a pattern or form of lamentation.] it is entred into our palaces, to cut off the little children [see of the Hebrew word Psal.8.on v.3from the City-Palaces , young men from the streets.
\p
\v 22 Speak, Yhus saith the LORD, yea, a carcase of man shall lie [so the Hebrew word, which commomly signifieth falling, is also else where taken for lying. See Deut.21.1. Judg.4.22. And 9. on vers.26. 1 Sam.31.8. 2 Chron.21.2. below, chap.51.4. Ezech.7,&c.]as dung upon the open field [Hebr.face of the field] and as sheave after the reaper, [Some ears of corn, which the reaper passeth by, and letteth fall, and looketh no more after them] which no man gathereth up. [or, and no man shall gather it in, take it up, take it away, to bury it, Compare above, chap. 8.2.]
\p
\v 23 Thus saith the LORD, let not a wise man glory in, [Or, of, for. So in thy sequel] his wisdome, neither let the strong men grow in strenght; let not a rich man glory in his reaches. [Compare, 1 Cor .1.31. 2 Cor.10.17.]
\p
\v 24 But let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that Iam the LORD, doing loving kindnesse judgement and righteousness upon the earth: for in those things I have delight, saith the LORD.
\p
\v 25 Behold, the dayes come, saith the LORD, that I will make visitation [As above, v.9.] upon all circumcised ones with those that have the foreskin,[ Hebr.with the fore-skin: that is, with the uncircumcised heathenish nations. Compare below, chap.25.. 17,18,19,20,&c. Some understand with, or in the fore-skin, such as ate circumcised according to the flesh onely, but are uncircumcised in heart, as I said of Israel in the next verse.]
\p
\v 26 Upon Egypt, [That is, the Egyptians, and so forth] and upon Juda, and upon Edom, and upon the children of Ammon, and upon Moab, and upon those that are shortened, or cut short at the corners, [Hebr.the corner; to wit, of their head; that is, those that are shaved round about at the corners of their head, as the Arabians were. Compare Levi.19.27. So below, ch.25.23. And 9.32. Oth. That lie in the utmost corner; that is, the heathenish nations (as some conceive) that dwell in the utmost corners of Canaan, in the east, south,or toward wildernesse:for all the heathen have the foreskinned] but all the house of Israel have the fore-skin of the heart. [that is, are uncircumcised in heart, though they be cir circumcised according to the body .see above, chap.4.on vers.4. Lev.26.41. Rom.2.28,29.]
\c 10
\p
\s God forbiddeth his people to be afraid of the tokens of heaven, as the heathen were, v.1,2. he describeth at large and derideth the vanity of the idols, and the folly of idolatrous image – worship by opposing thereunto his Divine Majesty and Power, as also the service which Jacob owed him especially, vers.3, etc. he prophesieth and representeth by wailings the destruction of Jerusalem, and all Juda, by the Babylonians, 17. whereupon the Prophet in his own, and the Churches name, prayeth unto God for moderating of his judgment, and for punishment of the wicked enemies , 23.
\p
\v 1 Hear the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, [Or, hath spoken of or concerning you] o house of Israel.
\p
\v 2 Thus saith LORD, Learn not the way of the heaven, [Or, (to go) in the way the heathen; that is to follow their Idolatrous custome and practice] and be not dismayed at the token of heaven, [the Sun, Moon, and Stars, &c. See Genes.1. on v.14. of whom the heathen made Idols, and ascribed unto them the government of the world, and by their course and motion foretold things to come: wherein the Jews did imitate them, as appeareth above, ch.7.18, &c.] because the heathen are dismayed at them. [Oth, howbeit, notwithstanding, etc. also but let the heathen, etc.]
\p
\v 3 For the institution of the nations [Idols, Idolatrous ordinances, ceremonies] are vanity: for it is wood that men have hewn out of the forest, a work of the workman hands with the ax.[Compare below, v.8.Isa.44.14, etc.Or (one) hetheth down a tree out of the forest, (for) a work, etc.]
\p
\v 4 They trim it[Heb. Be maketh it fair and beautiful] with silver and with gold, they fasten them with nails and with pammers [They fasten the wooden Idols (which they have made) to a wall of pillar] that it [the Image, idol] may not wag. [Or, not go forth. Or, they suffer it not wag; that is they make it so fast, as that it is out of danger of growing loose, or falling, from which this wooden god cannot preserve it sel.]
\p
\v 5 They are like a palm – tree [ standing firm and bolt upright, they raised up by beaten plates of an equal size, as if they had life and would speak, but are not able to do any work of living man, as followeth] of close work, [See Exd.25. on vers.31.] but cannot speak, they must be carted, [Heb. Carrying they are carried] for they cannot go: be not afraid of them, they cannot do evil, also there is no doing good by them. [They can neithr hurt their enemies, nor help their friends. Compare Deut.32. on vers.31.]
\p
\v 6 Beacause none is like unto the, LORD, thou are great, and thy Name is great, in might. [Whereas on the Contrary all idols are weak and feeble.]
\p
\v 7 Who should not fear thee, thou King of Gentiles? [ Even bearing rule over those nations, that know not thee, but worship idols] for thee doth it appertain: [or, it befitted thee, that men should fear thee] Because among all the wife men of the Gentiles, [That are wont to beast most of wisdom, and yet are mere fools, as is shewed in the next verse] and in their whole Kingdom [ That is, all their Kingdoms, which all together make up one idolatrous heathenish Kingdom.] (there) is none like unto thee.
\p
\v 8 Ret they are in one thing [Or, altogether, all counted in one] brutish [As brute beasts. So vers.14.21. Isai.41.29. Habak. 2. 18. Zach. 10.2. See Psal vers.11.] foolish : a stock is an instruction of vanityes [By Idolatrous images, and their worship, men are led to mere vanity; they are nothing but teachers of mere vanity. See 2 Kings 17. on vers.15. and of the use of the Hebrew word, which signifieth instruction and discipline, Prov. 16. on vers.22.]
\p
\v 9 Silver stretched out [Into plates] is brought from Thurfis, [From beyond the Sea. See 1 Kings 10. on vers.22.] and gold from Uphath, [That is, held to be all one with ohir, whereof see 1 Kings 9. on verse 28.others held it to be Fez] (for) the work of woman, and of the hands of the Goldsmith: skie – color and purple is their clothing, [The clothing of the Idolatrous images] they [The idols ] are all the work of wife men[ That is, skillful, artificial workmen. Compare above chap.9. on vers.17. and Exod 31.6.]
\p
\v 10 But the LORD God is the truth, [Oth. The Lord is the true God; or, (in) truth; that is, truly] he is the living God, [Who most property may be said to live, as having from everlasting to everlasting his in incomprehensible Divine life and offence in and of himself, and making alive whomsoever he will, as being the fountain and author of life. See Job.5 21, 26, etc. Therefore he ought to be acknowledged and honoured as God alone] and an everlasting King: [Hebr. King of eternity. Compare 1 Tim 1.17.] at his wrath the earth trembleth, and the heathen are not able to abide his indignation.
\p
\v 11 (Thus shall ye say unto them; The Gods, that have not made the Heaven and the Earth shall perish from the Earth, and from under this Heaven.) [This verse is put in the Chaldean or Babylonian tongue, to teach the godly Jews, they being in captivity in Babel, how they should make profession of their faith concerning the true God, and oppose and gain say o idolaters.]
\p
\v 12 Who [ Our God, whomme serve, of whom is spoken, vers.10.] hath made the Earth by his power, who hath prepared [Or, established, founded] the word by his wisdom and hath stretched out the Heaven by his understanding [See Geness.1.6. below chap.51.15. Job 9.8.Psai 104.2. Isai.40.22.and 44.22. and 51.13.]
\p
\v 13 When he giveth his voice,[Meaning thunder, as Psal.29.3, etc. or, Gods command, as some] then there a noise [Or, multitude] of water in the Heaven, [That is, the air] and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the end of the earth: he maketh lightings with rain, [See Job 37.11 and 38.25 or, against rain, for rain] and causeth the winde to come forth out of his treasures. [See Job 38. on vers.22. and Psal.135.7.]
\p
\v 14 Every man is become brutish, [The meaning is, all cunning workmen of Idolatrous images, are become as brutish, as beasts] so that [Or, from, by, or, in, because of that (their) skill of making images, wherein they thought to get great glory and renown. Compare Rom. 1.22.] be hath no knowledge, every Goldsmith is ashamed of the carved [Or, graven] image : for his image is lying, [Or, falsehood: it is mere deceit] and there is nospirit [That is, breath, blast. See Job 9. on vers.18.] in them [The carved, and molten images]
\p
\v 15 They are vanity, a work of seducings: [That is. Mere seducing work] in the time of their visitation[When God shall punish and destroy the idols and idolaters together] they shall perish.
\p
\v 16 The portion of Jacob [So doth the Lord call himself, because he is become a God in covenant, and a Saviour, and consequently as an invaluable inheritance of his people, in the Messiah, whole co – heirs they are , Rom. 8.10. Compare Psal.16. on vers.5.] is not like them ; [To wit, the idols] for [Or, but] he is the former of all things, and Israel is the rod of his inheritance[See Psal 74 on vers.2.] the LORD of Hosts [See 1 Kings 18. on vers.15.] is his Name.
\p
\v 17 Take away [Hebr. Properly gather together, and consequently take, or, conveigh away. See Psal .26. on vers.9. The words are here placed in the feminine gender, whence many do gather, that God here speaketh to the Daughter of Zion, or, to Jerusalem, that (without relying on the strength of their City) they should pack up their goods, and flee away, iin regard of the approaching invasion of the Babylonians, whereof in the fequd, and plainly, vers.22. Compare above chap.6.1. and 8.14.Ezech.12.3,4, etc. Some understand it of Bable] thy ware [Or, merchandise] out of the Land, thou inhabitant of their fortresse.
\p
\v 18 For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling away the inhabitants of the Land [That is, cast them out of the Land by the Babylonians, as with a sling] at this time, and will distresse them, that they may finde it (so) [That is, amy receive the just deserved punishments, or, may actually finde the truth of my Prophecies]
\p
\v 19 O wo (is) me for my breach,[They are the words of the Land, or, of the people of Jerusalem, etc. as above chap.4.31. or, of the prophet, speaking in person of the people, as if it were his own suffering, that he felt, and sustained. Compare below chap.14.6. and below chap.14.17.] my plague is painful: and I had said, [To wit, with my self; that is, thought that it would not fall so heavily but I should be able to bear, and overcome it, as followeth; but it falleth out quite other otherwise, then I imagined] This is indeed a sickness, which I shall be able to bear. [Oth. surely this is a sickness, yet I must bear it. As if he had said; This is indeed a grievous sickness, much heavier then I have conceived it would be, yet notwithstanding I must endure it]
\p
\v 20 My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken; my children [That is, the citizen of the city of Jerusalem, in the whole name this complaint is made] are gone forth from me, and they are not; there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.
\p
\v 21 For the pastours [Ecclesiastical and political Governours] are become brutish, [As above vers.8. and 14.] and have not fought the LORD: therefore they have not dealt understandingly, [Oth, thay have not been happy, or, prosperous] and all their pasture [That is, flock of their pasture, the Congregation] is scattered.
\p
\v 22 Behold, there cometh a voice of the bruit, and a great trembling of the Land of the North: to make the Cities of Juda a desolation, an habitation of Dragons. [As above chap.9.11.]
\p
\v 23 I know, o LORD, that with man his way is not: [That is, his purpose and acting is not in his power. See Genes.6. on vers.12.] it is not with a man, that waltketh, to direct his going. [Or, step. And consequently (will the Prophet say,) I and all believers, we renounce all our own wisdom and strength, commending all our purpose and action, in this our trouble, to thy fatherly government: beseeching thee, inasmuch as thou intendest to punish this Land by the King of Babel, and he with all his designes and actions, likewise shut up under thy providence, that thou wouldst limit his power, and in mercy moderate thine anger to wards thy people, according to thy gracious covenant promises. Compare above chap. 4. in vers. 27. This is the scope and substance of this, and the next vers.]
\p
\v 24 Chastise me, [See Psal.6. on vers.2.] LORD, but with measure: [Hebr. Properly with judgment; that is here, with reason and moderation, or, in a reasonable, or, moderate way, so (as thou hast promised unto thy children) that thou also wilt consequently preserve thy justie; See below chap. 30.11. and 46.28 and compare Isa.30.18. Ezech.34. 16. The contrary is the bringing to nothing, whereof in the following words] not in thine anger left thou bring me nothing. [Hebr. Diminish me, make me few, or, mean; that is, bruise, or, grinde me to dust, or make me small, s that I am no more people : which was a consequent of the divine wrath, whereof in the following vers. This is opposed to the moderate chastisement]
\p
\v 25 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen, [As if he should say, wilt thou needs pour out thy full wrath, do it not ( I beseech thee) upon thine own people, but rather upon thine and thy people enemies] that know thee not: [See Job 18. on vers.21. and Psal .79. on vers.6.] upon the families, that call not upon thy Name: for they have eaten up Israel; [See above chap. 9.16.] and (have) made his habitation desolate.
\c 11
\p
\s God causeth his covenant with Israel to be proclaimed by the Prophet, vers.1, etc. He punisheth the former, and the present breach of covenant, committed by Israel and Juda, by manifold idolatry, 8. Therefore he intendeth to bring a great and an unavoidable mischief upon them,11,16,17. He forbiddeth the Prophet to pray for them, 14. He complaineth of the people by hypocritical services, and carelessness, 15. The prophet complaineth unto God, of the murderous conspiracy of his Country – men of Anathoth, against him, and defireth Gods vengeance on them, which God foretelleth him, that he will bring upon them,18.
\p
\v 1 The word, that come to Jeremia, from the LORD, saying
\p
\v 2 Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak to the men [Hebr. man. See above chap.4. on vers.3. So below vers.9.] of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. [Thou Jeremia, and other godly Prophets and Priest, that yet remain among the people, (as some do take it) hear this , and present it afterwards unto the people]
\p
\v 3 Say [Thou Jeremia] then unto them; thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Cursed be the man, [Or, every man, as Psal.1.1. and elsewhere often. See convenant, [That is, that obeyeth not the law of God. See Deut.27.26. Gal.3.10.]
\p
\v 4 Which I commanded your father in the day when I brought them forth out of the Land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, [See Deut.4. on vers.20.] saying, Be obedient unto my voice, [That is, word, commandments] and do them, [To wit, the words of the convenant, as vers.3.and below vers.6.] according to all that I command you: then shall ye be a people unto me, [As above chap.7. vers.23] and I will be a God unto you
\p
\v 5 That I may confirm the oath, which I sware unto your father; to give them a Land slowing with milk and honey, [See Exod.3. on vers.8.] as it is this day: Then answered I, and said, Amen, [See Numb.5. on vers.22.and Deut.27.15. etc.] O LORD
\p
\v 6 And the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all words in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying: Hear the word of this covenant, and do them
\p
\v 7 For I earnestly testifies [Hebr. testifying testified] unto your father, in the day [That is, from that time] when I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, unto this day; being up early, and testifying [ See above chap.7. on vers.13.] saying; Hearken to my voice.
\p
\v 8 But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked, every one after the opinion [See Jerem.3. on vers.17.] of their evil brought upon them [That is, I will surely bring upon them] all the words of this covenant [That is, the threatening added unto it; that is, judgments threatened. See thereof Levit 26. and Deut 28.] which I commanded (them) to do, they did (them not.
\p
\v 9 Moreover the LORD said unto me: There is a combination found the men of Juda, and among the inhabitation of Jerusalem. [That is, a league, conspiracy together, to do evil, directly opposite and repugnant to the covenant, which they have made with me, and sworn to confederacy.]
\p
\v 10 They are returned to the iniquities of their fore fathers, [Which were disobedient in the wilderness, and consequently in after times] which refused to hear my words; and they [As a wicked posterity of their wicked fore father] walked after other Gods, to serve them: the house of Israel, and the house of Juda have broken [Or, made void] my covenant, which I made with their father [See Genes.15. on vers.17.18.]
\p
\v 11 Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring an evil [That is, punishment, mischief, misery etc. as vers .12 ] upon them, out of which they shall then cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them. [Compare Prov.1.28. Isai.1.15. below chap.14.12. Ezech.8.18. Mich.3.4.
\p
\v 12 Then shall be the cities of Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry unto the Gods, unto whom they have burnt incense: but they shall not be able to deliver them at all [Heb. Delivering not deliver ] in the lime time of their evil. [Which I will bring upon them, vers.11. So ver.14.17,23]
\p
\v 13 For (according to) the number of thy Cities, were thy God, O Juda: [As above chap.2.28.] and (according to) the number of streets of Jerusalem, have ye set (up) altars for that shame; [That is, shamefull Idol Baal. See above chap.3. on vers. 23.]to burn incense unto Baal
\p
\v 14 Thou then, [O Jeremia] pray not for this people neither lift up a cry,or a prayer for them.(see above chap.7.16 and below chap.14.11) for I will not hear,in the time when they cry unto me for this evil.
\p
\v 15 What hath my beloved (to do) in mine house,(compare the Phrase with 2 Sam.16.10. and the annotat there. (beloved) To wit, this people, (The Hebrew word is put in the masculine gender, but the following words in the feminine) that so call themselves, or boast of it, that they are my people. Or, God calleth them so notwithstanding their unthankfulness, because of his covenant, which he had made them, their fathers, and the mercies that he had bestowed on them. Compare below chap.12. 7,8 Rom. 3.3. and 11.28. Some understand hereby, the Prophesied daily in the Temple to this wicked people. Compare chap. 7.2. As if God should say; What have servants any more to do in the Temple among this rebellions people, to instruct them, or, to pay for them? See vers. 14 (mine house) The Temple: as if God should say; To what purpose do they run so much, and so often in the Temple, whereas they are so full of all kinde of wickedness.] Seeing the [Meaning the daughter of my people, or city of Jerusalem; that is, the inhabitants thereof ] that lawd act [Oth. Gross lewduesse; because the Hebrew word, which signifieth an abominable fact, or plot, (See Prov.31. on vers.16.) hath here a letter more then ordinary, serving to heighten the signification of it. Compare Psal.3. on vers.3 Understand hereby, the abominable idolatry, mentioned, vers 13, etc] with many,[ To wit, with many idols, as above vers.13. Or, it may be understood of the multitude, or great company of those, that commited these abominations, thus: seeing many of them commit thus heinous act. Some put in instead of with many (yea even) the Great ones. Compare Eze.8.11. and 23.39] and the holy fesh is passed from thee? [Hebr. The flesh of holiness, or, of the sanctuary, are passed from thee. As the word flesh is not in use among using the plural number, so neither is it used more then once in the whole text of the Hebrew Bible in the plural number, to wit, Prov.14.30. The meaning is, All thy offerings, O Jerusalem, are no more of any value, thou offerest no more an holy offering, because thou profanest all thy things by thy wickedness. Some understand it thus: that God threateth them, that the time is at hand, that the time is at hand, that they being punished, and driven out of their Land for their wickedness, shall come no more into the Temple, nor sacrifice, nor keep their wonted joyful feats with the flesh of the offerings as they did at present, but with an horrible profentation of Gods holy institutions, therefore God would caft them out of the Land. Some understand by the holy flesh, the true sincere Israelites, who were circumcised both outwardly inwardly] when thou (doest) evil, then thou leapest up joy; [Or, when (in) thy wickedness, &c. Oth. When evil (that is, thy punishment, misery) is at hand, or is fore – told or threatened by Prophets) then thou rejoycest; that is, thou despisest my threatening so extremely, as that even to vex and spite me as it were, thou doest the more rejoice, to shew that thou carest not at all for them]
\p
\v 16 The LORD had called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, of pleasant – fruits: [Hebr. fruit of form] (but now) with a sound of great cry [ Compare Ezec. 1.24.] be hath kindled of fire [Meaning the desolation, destruction, and consumption of the land people, by the Babyloan] about it, [The olive – tree. Oth. A fire hath kindled the leaves thereof] and the boughs [ Or, branches, twings, sprigs] thereof shall be broken.[Oth. They shall break.]
\p
\v 17 For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, [As an olive- tree, as was said in the former verse] hath thee: because of the wickedness of the house of Israel, and of the House of Juda, which they commit among themselves, to incense me, [Or, to provoke me anger] burning incense unto Baal.
\p
\v 18 Now the LORD made it known unto me, [When in simplicity of the heart my calling, according to God command, and thoygth not of any evil] that I might know it.: Then thou causeth me to see their dealings. [Jeremia speaketh this unto God, whom he callethto record, that he speaketh this not out of humane suspicion or passion, but onely by divine revelation in a vision. Compare below, chap.24.1.]
\p
\v 19 And I was like a Lamb (like) an ox, that is led to be slain, [To the daughter, to be killed, that he may be slain] for I know no that they thought against me, [That is, intended wicked devices and practices and practices against me] (saying) Let us destroy tree with fruit thereof, [To wit, the Prophet Jeremia with his Doctrine and Prophecy. Hebr. properly bread; that is, meat, and consequently fruit, serving for meat] and let us cut him off from the Land of the living, [See Psal.27. on vers.13.] that his name may be no more remembered.
\p
\v 20 But, O LORD of Hosts, thou righteous Judge, [Heb. Judge of righteousness, or, that judgest righteousness] that trist the reins of the reins of the heart, [The innermost and secret thoughts and motions of the heart. See Job 19.on vers.27. and Psal7. on vers.10. and 26.2. 1 Sam.16.7. 1 Chron.28.9. revel.2.23.] let me fee thy vengeance on them, [Which thou will take of them, or excute upon them] for unto thee have I discovered [Presented and committed as to mine Advance and Judge] my cause.
\p
\v 21 Threfore, thus saith the LORD of the men of Anathoth, [See above chap.1.1.] that seek thy soul, [Seek thy life. See Exod.4. on vers.19. and 2 Sam.4. on verse.8.] saying: Prophet not in the Name of the LORD, that thou die not by our hands.
\p
\v 22 Therefore, thus saith the LORD of Host; Behold, I will visit them; [That is, punish them See Genes.21. on verse 1.] The young men shall die the sword, their sons and their daughters shall die by famine.
\p
\v 23 . And they shall have no remnant: [That is, none of them shall remain: they shall all perish and be cut off: meaning if they do not repent ] for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, (in) the yeer of their visitation. [Or, to wit, the yeer of their visitatio; that is of their punishment. So below.23.12. etc.]

\s The prophet complaineth to God the prosperity of his wicked country men, and prayeth him to take them away, that the land may not suffer any longer for their wickedness verse 1 &c Against which the Lord instructeth him and foretelleth him yet more persecutions, 5. complaining of the desperate rebellion of his heritage , which he must therefore lay waste by the Babylonians and to punish it with barrenness yet in the mean while not intending that the heathenish neighbor nations should not go unpunished who upon his occasion would be likewise be ready to fall upon Israel with promise of the deliverance of his people and grace unto Gentiles that with his own people should turn unto him,14.
\p
\v 1 Thou wouldst be righteous, O LORD when I should contend against thee: [the meaning is thou wouldst be justified in all thy doings as Psalms 51.6 if I should reason or plead with thee or dispute with thee about thy judgment , manner or course of providence which thou keepest both with the wicked and the godly whereof in the following words compare Psalms 73.2,3 c] yet will I talk with thee of thy judgments [or yet let me reason or plead with thee that is make my complaint unto thee compare above chapter 4 verse 12 Hebrew speak judgment with thee ]wherefore is the way of the wicked [that is their purposes and actions see Genesis 6 on verse 12] prosperous ? [This hath respect especially to the man of Anathoth whereof is spoken in the former chapter and below verse 5 but may also be further applied to other like wicked men in general ] wherefore have they rest all those that treacherously commit treachery ? [Compare Job 21.7 Psalms 73.11,12 Habakkuk 1.3.]
\p
\v 2 . Thou hast planted them they have also taken root they have gone [that is shoot up grow spread themselves out] they also bear fruits [Hebr they make fruits se Psalms 1 on verse3 and Hosea 8 on verse 7] thou indeed art near in their mouth [they speak and boast of thee see Isaiah 29.13 Matthew 15.8] but far from their reins [see above chapter 11 verse 20.]
\p
\v 3 . But thou O LORD knoweth me [ by this consideration the prophet raiseth himself up strengthening himself by his good conscience and faith on God’s providence compare Psalms 17 verse 3 and 139.1] thou seest me and triest mine heart that it is with thee [or it is with thee or how the same is towards or with thee: that is thou knowest that I do sincerely and faithfully keep close unto thee and do separate myself from falsehood and wickedness and that therefore I must suffer compare Hosea 9.8 and Genesis 5.8 Mich.6.8with the annotate] pull them out like the sheep for the slaughter [other but thou pullest them away to wit as sheep unawares as the flock to slay them ] and hallow them [that is set them apart ordain them prepare them compare above chapter 6 on verse 4] for the day of killing [this prayer of the prophet is indeed a prophecy and doctrine concerning the sudden and unexpected change of the temporal happiness and prosperity of the wicked persecutors and hypocrites of the godly prophets especially of his country-men of Anathoth.]
\p
\v 4 . How long shall the land mourn? [That is being in such a miserable condition] the herbs of the whole field wither? because of the wickedness of them that dwell therein the beasts and the birds do perish [compare above chapter4.25 and 7.20 and 9.10] because they say he seeth not our end[Hebr. Hind most utmost last see Deuteronomy 32.20 and Proverbs 14.12 he to wit the Lord or Jeremiah who daily tell us of the approaching desolation but they will say they are both ignorant if it for which contempt ,obstinacy, security and heinous denial of Gods providence the land itself is so miserable wasted.]
\p
\v 5 . When thou runnest with the foot men they weary thee how wilt thou then mangle thy self with the horses?[ to wit the battle and controversies that is have to do with them God intendeth here and in the sequel to comfort and cheer up in his troubles as if he had said art-thou so saint hearted and troubled because thy country-men of Annotate that are but like foot men do deal so ill with thee how wilt thou then be able to stand it out against the unbridled proud great ones of Jerusalem that are like horses or horse men ?this must not grief thee for thou must yet undergo and overcome far greater and fore persecution then thou hast already done ] if thou only trusteth in a land of peace how wilt thou do then in the listings of Jordan ?[ in a land of peace and rest in comparison of that which is to come how wilt thou do then when the waters do overflow on every side ? here by lifting up or swelling of Jordan may be understood the pride of inhabitants of Jerusalem or the approaching desolation of the whole land of the swelling of Jordan see Josiah 3.25 1 Chronicles 12.15 below chapter 49.19 and c 44 oth. If they weary thee in a land of peace compare Psalms 41.10 where thou trusteth thy self that is in thine own country where thou concieveth that thou oughtest to be out of danger and where they are not altogether so rude as they are at Jerusalem and at court.]
\p
\v 6 . For even thy brethren and the house of thy father even they deal unfaithfully against thee also they call after thee with a full voice [or with a full assembly by troops compare above chapter 4 on verse 5] believe them not [or do not trust them see above chapter 9.4] when they speak friendly [Hebr. Good tings as 2Kings 25.28 and below chapter 52.32] to thee.
\p
\v 7 . I have forsaken mine house [the temple that is I will assuredly forsake it and so in the sequel] I have let mine heritage [that is my people see above chapter 10.16 so in the next verse] go I have given the beloved of my soul [Heb. The love of my soul that is she whom I loved as an husband doth love his wife compare above chapter 11.15 so injustice for unjust Job 24.20] into the hand of the enemies.
\p
\v 8 . Mine heritage has become unto me as a lion in the forest she hath lifted up [Heb. Given] her voice against me [that is she is stout, proud, idle, and untamed roaring against me and my commandments warning and threatening like a lion in the forest ] therefore have I hated her [and consequently put her away from me and cats away and forsaken her as verse 7.]
\p
\v 9 . Mine heritage is unto me a speckled bird the birds round about are against her [that is the strange unknown bed which hath not my livery but many strange colors to whom all other birds shall flock to destroy her oth. this not mine heritage unto me a fingered or clawed bird to prey against whom the birds of prey fly round about against her compare Isaiah 18.6 Ezech. 39,17&] come assemble all ye beasts of the field come to eat [compare above chapter 7.33.]
\p
\v 10 . Many pastors have destroyed [that is princes of Babel shall &c compare below chapter 49.19,20 with the annotate ] my vine yard the people of the Jews as Isaiah 5.1 &c ] they have trodden my field [ or for lion of land ] under foot they have made desirable field [Heb. Portion of wish of desire ] a desolate wilderness[Heb. A wilderness of desolation.]
\p
\v 11 . They have made [Heb he hath made that is everyone of the enemies or they have &c]it [ my field]a desolation being desolate in mourneth unto me the whole land is made desolate because there is no man that taketh it to heart [Heb layeth or putteth it upon or to or in the heart compare 2 Samuel 13.33 c to wit that what is preached by Jeremiah and other faithful prophets of Gods commands .]
\p
\v 12 . The destroyers are come upon all the high places [where commonly at other times and also at present they thought themselves to be safe and secure] in the wilderness for the sword of the Lord [compare below chapter 25 on verse 29 and 47.6] shall consume from the one end of the land to the other end of the land there is no peace for any [Heb. All] flesh [that is no rest prosperity for any living soul or any man sees Genesis 6 on verse 12.]
\p
\v 13 . They [The Jews] have sworn wheat but reaped thorns [see Levit 26.16 Deuteronomy 28.38] they have tormented themselves [or put themselves to pain but great labor] but have not profited be so ashamed [that is ye shall be so surely ashamed compare Psalms 37 on verse 3and Proverbs 3 on verse 4 God speaketh in the promises and threatening in regard of the certainty thereof] because of your revenue which ye see do fail ye] because of the beat of the Lords anger.
\p
\v 14 . Thus saith the Lord concerning all mine evil neighbors [that dwell round about my people as namely the Syrians the Ammonites the Moabites the Philistines and see who upon this occasion that I do chastise my people Israel will perhaps therefore fall upon them ] that touch [ see Genesis 26 on verse 11] mine inheritance[Canaan see above chapter 2.7] which I have hereditarily given in unto my people Israel behold I will pluck them out of their land [by the enemies see below chapters 47,48 and 49 see also Deuteronomy 30.3 and below chapter 32.37but I will pluck out the house of Judah from the midst of them so that these wicked neighbors must not wreck their malice on Judah see the like use of the same word above chapter 1.17]
\p
\v 15 . And it shall come to pass after that I shall have plucked them out [to wit those evil neighbors ] then I will return and have compassion on them [compare below chapter 48 on verse 47] and I will bring them again everyone to his heritage and everyone to his land.
\p
\v 16 . And it shall come to pass if they shall diligently learn [Heb. Learning shall learn ] the ways of the people [the saving religion which I have prescribed unto my church and which is in use among them compare Isaiah 2.3 &c this looketh at the calling of Gentiles] swearing by name as true as the Lord liveth [that is knowing and saving me aright according to my word compare above chapter 2.4 &c] like as they have taught my people to swear by Baal then shall they be built in the midst of my people [being converted by the preaching of the gospel and engrafted into my church they shall with them enjoy the blessing of the covenant of grace see Ephesians 2.18,19,20,21,22.]
\p
\v 17 . But if they will not hearken then will I utterly pluck up [Heb rotting out root out or plucking up pluck up compare Isaiah 60.12] and destroy that nation saith the Lord.
\c 13
\s Gods bounty, the people unthankfulnesse, and future judgments are represented by the token of a linen girdle, verse 1 &c.and by the similitude of filling all wine – bottles full with wine, is shewed, that God will make them altogether drunk in miseries with the cup of his wrath, 12 God yet exhorteth them to prevent these judgements, by humble repentance, 15 (wherewith the Prophet sheweth affection, 17) especially the King and Queen, 18.But knowing that they should little change themselves, as an Ethiopian can change his skin or a Leopard his spots, he foretelleth their utter confusion and destruction, 22.
\p
\v 1 The LORD said unto me , Go thy wayes, and buy the linen, and put thy lion [That is gird thy lions with it. See the exposition, verse 11.] but it not into the water. [lest it should be spoiled: as l have taken care for Israel,that they might not perish, nor corrupt.]
\p
\v 2 And l bought me a girdle, according to the word of the LORD, and put it upon my loins.
\p
\v 3 Then came the word of the LORD unto to me the second time; saying:
\p
\v 4 Take the girdle which thou hast bought, which is upon thy lions, and get thee up, (and) go thy ways to the Phrat, [The great river Euphrates, over which the Babylonians should passe, and carry the Jews over it captive way. See Gen 2. on verse 14] and bide it there in the clist of a rock.
\p
\v 5 So I went my ways, and hid it by the Phrat, according as the LORD has commanded me.
\p
\v 6 Now it come to passe, at the end of many days, [That is, after the expiration of a long time] that the LORD said unto me, get thee up, go thy wayes to the Phrat, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.
\p
\v 7 Then I went to the Phrat, and digged, and took the girdle from the place, where I have hide it: and behold the girdle was spoiled, and good for nothing.
\p
\v 8 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying :
\p
\v 9 Thus said the LORD, so will marre the pride [Or, excellency, eninency, as the Hebrew word is also elsewhere used. Compare below, v.11.] of Juda, and the great pride of Jerusalem.
\p
\v 10 This same evil people, which refuseth to hear my words, which walketh [Hebr, which refuse, which walk, etc] in the imagination [see above, chap 3. on v. 17.] of their (own) heart, and followeth other god, to serve them, and to bow down before them, the same shall become as this girdle, which is good for nothing]
\p
\v 11 For like as a girdle cleaveth to the lions of man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel, and the whole house of Juda saith the LORD, to be unto me for a people, and for a name, [see Deut, 26. on v.9.] and for praise, and for glory, but they have not heard, [that is, obeyed, as often.]
\p
\v 12 Therefore say unto them this word; Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; All bottles shall be filled with wine: [Hebr. all bottle shall,&c. that is, every bottle. As in the Prophet should say , Ye expect a plentiful year of wine, that ye may drink your selves drunk and mad, &c. Understand here, not leather bottles, but stone bottles , or vessels, as may be gathered from vers.14. Compare a Lament 4.2.] then shall they have say unto thee. Do we not know very well, [Hebr knowing, do we not know?] that all bottles shall be filled with wine? [It seemeth that this hath respect to the promises of the false Prophets, that made the people believe, that they should have peace and plenty of all things, which they willingly believed, but prophesieth unto them quite otherwise Compare Mich 2.11. with the annotat.]
\p
\v 13 But thou shall say unto them; Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the Kings that sit upon David throne, [That is, in the room of David, their forefather] and the Priests, and the prophet, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with drunkenness. [giving them to drink out of the cup of my wrath; that is, punishing them in that manner, as that though amazement and anguish they shall know no more what to do, or what to leave undone, then a drinketh mand doth. See below, ch.25. 15.18.27. and 51.7. Isa. 51.17, 21. and 63 6, &c.]
\p
\v 14 And I will beat them in pieces [To wit,against another, as followeth, like some bottles. Compare Judg. 7. on v. 19. and Psal. 2. on v.9. Oth. scatter them, as the pieces of bottle, that is dashed in pieces, are scattered here and there] the one against the other, both the fathers and the children together, saith the LORD, I will not pity, nor spare, nor have compassion, that I should not destroy them.
\p
\v 15 Hear, and give ear, and do not lift up yourselves [Through pride and loftiness of your heart, despising and rejecting that which is in truth Gods word, and shall assuredly (unless you do repent in time) so come home to you, as I have foretold you in the former words Some thus : the LORD hath spoken ; to wit, the following words.]
\p
\v 16 Give glory to the LORD your God, [Acknowledging his judgement and threatings to be righteous, and heartly turn your selves. Compare Jos 7.19. Hosea 11.7. and the annotat there.] before making it dark, [that is bring these miseries and plagues upon you, see Gen 15. on v. 12.] and before your feet stumble against the glimmering mountains. [Heb mountains of glimmering; that is, which is the time of the twilight are as it were covered with darkeness. This simulitude seemeth to be taken from those that travel by night rugged hilly places] that while we look for light, [that is, prosperity, comfort and joy.See Job 18. on v.5,6.] he make it [to wit the light] a shadow of death, [that is, that God should instead of light, surprize you with a shadow of death. See Psalm 23. on verse 4.] and make (it) darknesse.
\p
\v 17 If ye then will not hear it, then my soul shall weep in secret places, because of(your) pride: [That even to your own ruine and destruction you are so abominably proud and obstinate, and will by no means bowe not humble your selves before the LORD, by true conversion see v.15.] and mine eye shall weep bitterly , [Heb. weeping weep] and come down with tears, [as above chap. 9. 18.] because the LORD stock is carried away captive. [That is, because Juda (being indeed the Lords own people, ) which he hath severed and set apart for himself out of all nations, shall assuredly be carried away captive. so in the sequel]
\p
\v 18 Say unto the King and to the Queen, [They are the words of God unto Jeremia, or, as some the Prophets words unto the people. See of the Hebrew word tendered here Queen , 1 Kings 11.19.] humble your selves. [Or, set your selves down low; to wit, in the dust,upon the ground] set yourselves down: for your whole Diadem, the crown of your glory, [That is,your glorious crown, where with you were wont to take pride] is come down.[Hebr. Your head-ornaments,or, head-attires,is come down; that is, all Royal head attire, is come down; that is, and changed with a low estate. Oth your excellencies, bignesses.]
\p
\v 19 The cities of the South are shut up, and there is none to open them:[ To wit, the cities of Egypt, lying in the South of Canaan. Whither the Jews were wont. and perhaps now also intedent, to repair for refuge, but all in vain. Some understand the Cities of Juda lying in the South-end, as if the Prophet should say: even the outermost cities of Juda, that lie furthest off from Babel, are bereaved of men , so that none goeth out, nor in at them] all Juda is carried away, it is wholly carried away. [Hebr, in perfections. That is, wholly and universally. Oth.(the city) of them that sate in peace. That is, of those that were carelesse, looking for nothing but peace]
\p
\v 20 Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the North: [From Babel] where is the flock, [that is, the people of the LORD] was given thee,[That is, was commited to thy charge, to govern, and protect them according to my laws] the sheep of thy glory? [ Or, beauty; that is, wherewith thou wast beautified]
\p
\v 21 What wilt thou [O Juda, or, Daughter of my people ] say, when he [To wit, God] shall visit thee? [To wit, by the Babylonians, whom they by requiring of help, had accustomed and enticed, to be Lord and master over Juda, as followeth. Compare 2 Kings 16.7, etc.] whereas thou hast taught them to be Princes, to be an head over thee? shall not sorrows take hold on thee, as on a women in travel? [Heb a women of bearing, or, of travel: that is, a woman that is in travel, or in pain of child–bearing. Compare above chap. 6. 24.]
\p
\v 22 When thou shalt then say in thine heart, [That is, think with thyself] wherefore have these things be fallen me? [Compare above chap. 5. 19. and below chap 16.10.] for the multitude [Or, greatness] of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, [That is, art thou publickly put shame before all the World, by shameful flight, and by most shameful carrying away into captivity and slavery. This is Gods answer to such thoughts, as are mentioned in the former clause. The phrase is taken from the high listing up of womens clothes, whether by force of others, or for their own necessity, when the same must be done to flee the more readily to passe thorow waters, etc. See below vers,26. and Isai 20.4. and 47. 2,3. also Ezech. 16. 37. and 23. 29. Hos.2.9 Mich.1.11.] (and) thine heels have suffered violence.[That is, are violently made bare, or unshod. Or , thine heels are handled violently, that is , put into the stocks, or laid in fetters or, carried away into capativity]
\p
\v 23 Shall also an Ethopian change skin? or a Leopard is spots? [Which he beareth in his body joyned together one close to another in great abundance, whereunto the Hebrew word properly hath respect. A question, which implieth a strong denial: as if God should say, The Blackamoor and the Leopard can by no means do it. Compare Isa 55.20.] (Then) shall ye also be able to do good, that are taught [That is, accustomed, as above vers. 21. and chap 2.24. Hos 10, 11, etc.] to do evil.
\p
\v 24 Therefore will I scatter them, as stubble , that passeth away, by a wind of the wilderness. [A full, smooth, piercing winde. See above chap. 4. 12. which the light stubble is not able to withstand . This signifieth the seveing of the Jews from their own Land, which by the seducing of the false Prophets they held to be a thing incredible and impossible]
\p
\v 25 This shall be thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the LORD: [that is, the punishment, that I have measured out unto you, according as my justice, and you deserts require. Compare Job 20.29. Psal 11.6 and 2 Kings 21.13. Isa 65.7. also Psal 78.50. with the annotat] who hast forgotten me, and trusted in lying.[False Prophets, idols, strong holds, and vain humane help]
\p
\v 26 Therefore will I also make bare thy skirt [see above vers.22. and Ezech 16. on verse. 37.] upon thy face and thy shame shall be seen.
\p
\v 27 Thine adulteries, and thy neighings, [see above chap. 5.8.] the lewdness of thy whoredom, on the hills, [see above chap 2.20.] in the field; I have seen thine abomination: [see 2 chron.15. on verse. 8. and Ezech 20. on vers. 7.] wo unto thee, Jerusalem, wit thou not be made clean? how long yet after this (time?) [Hebr. after when yet? That is, after how long time yet, will thou cleanse thy self. As if the Lord should say, how long time yet, will thou cleanse thy self? As if the Lord should say, how long shall I wait for thy cleansing? It will be but all in vain, seeing thou groweth daily worse and worse, therefore I must needs go on with my judgement. Compare Hos 8.5]
\c 14
\s A Prophecy of great drought, and the miseries that should ensue thereupon in Juda, vers,1. etc. A mourrnful and servent prayer of the Prophet, for mercy for Juda, 7. Whereupon God forbiddeth him to intercede for them, annexing reason why be should not, 10. The Prophet excuseth the people , as much as he can, by the seducing of the false Prophets, but it availeth not, God will punish those Prophets, and the people together 13. The Prophet is commanded by wailing to represent the calamities, 17. He prayeth again very mournfully for the people, 19.
\p
\v 1 The word of the LORD, that came to Jeremia, concerning the matters of the great drought, restraints, cutting off, hinderances, with–holdings; to wit, of rain dew, (see above chap 3.3) whence drought and dearth must needs follow, so as that the Hebrew word, is likewise taken for it. Compare below chap. 17.8. and see the signification of the original word, Gen.11.6. Job 44.2, &c.]
\p
\v 2 Juda [That is the people, or the land of Juda, He speaketh here of Judah as of a woman] mourneth, and her gates [That is, Cities, and consequently, the inhabitants, or the Judges, and the people that were wont to meet together in the gates. See Genes.22 on vers.17.] are weakened, [Or, languish, are growth faint] they are clothed in black unto the ground: [Or, lie on the ground in black, for a token of mourning. see Job 5. on vers. 11 and Psal 3.5 on verse.14.] and the cry of Jerusalem goeth up. [Increaseth, waxeth greater and greater;by reason of the great misery, that is seen everywhere in the Land; in regard of drought and want both among great and small, as followeth]
\p
\v 3 And their excellent ones [Or, illustrious, glorious ones, &c. See Psal 8. on vers.2.] send their little ones [That is, servants] to the water: they come to the pits [Or, ponds] they finde no water, they return with their vessels empty; they are ashamed: yea blush and cover their head, [Or, wrap their head about, in token of shame and mourning See 2 Sam 15. on vers. 30. so in the next verse]
\p
\v 4 Because the ground in chapt [Or, hurst, split] seeing there is no rain on the earth: the husbandmen are ashamed, they cover their head .
\p
\v 5 For also the hindes cast (their) young ones in the field, [Hebr, the hinde bringeth forth &c] for sake (them) because there is no young grasse.
\p
\v 6 And the wild Asses stand upon the high places, they draw in the winde [As above chap. 2. 24. refreshing themselves therewith, in stead of moist-grasse, or water] like the Dragons: [Which draw in and put forth their breath strongly, as some do write of them] their eyes fail, because there is no herb.
\p
\v 7 Though [Or, seeing, surely] our iniquities testify against us, [Compare Isa 59.12. Hos. 5.5. and 7. 10.] O LORD , do (it) for thy Names sake: [As if the Prophet should say, if our sins stand in thy way, that thou canst not shew mercy to us, then take and find cause in thine own self, and do it for thy precious Names sake, that thine unsearchable mercy and long suffering may extolled by the godly, and that thy Name may not be blasphemed by the enemies. This is the Prophet intercession for the people] for our backslidings are manifold, [Or, great] we have sinned against thee.
\p
\v 8 O the expectation of Israel, [Thou onely true God, in whom alone thy Church petteth her hope and trust, and from whom she ought and wont to look for help in her necessities. So below chap. 17.13 and 50.7. Compare below verse. 22] the deliverer thereof in time of trouble! why shouldest thou be as stranger in the land? as traveller, [Or, way faring man walker] (that onely) turneth in to overnight?[That is, why shouldest thou demean thyself, as if thou wert no more moved at our condition, then a stranger, or one that passeth thorow the Land, etc whereas thou hast taken up thy constant dwelling amongst us, as followeth]
\p
\v 9 Why shouldest thou be us man astonied? [Or, amazed, that is void of counsel, and knoweth not what to do. Oth, wearied. The Hebrew word is onely found here] as a Champion, that cannot deliver? yet thou art in the midst of us, O LORD, and we are called by thy Name, [As above chap. 7.10.] leave us not.
\p
\v 10 Thus saith the LORD, concerning this people [ Here followeth Gods answer to intercession] Thus have they loved to wander [ Sometimes to strange heathenish nations, and sometimes to all manner of Idols, to seek help of them, See above chapter 2. 36, etc.] they have not refrained their feet: therefore thhe LORD hath not pleasure in them, he will now remember [ See Genes. 8. on vers.1. and compare Hos. 8.13. and 9.9.] their iniquity, [That is, he will soon punish them. See Hos. 10. on vers.3.] and visit [That is, punish. See Genes. 21 on vers1.] their sins.
\p
\v 11 Moreover, the LORD saith unto me: Pray not for this people for good.[For their good, that is should spare them any longer. Understand this of those that were incorrigible, whereby God will shew unto all the people, how greatly he was displeased with them, to move them that were corrigible to repentance]
\p
\v 12 Though they fast, I will not hearken to their cry. [compare Prov 1.28. Isa 1.15. above chap. 11.11. Ezech 8.18. Mich.3.4.] though they offer burnt – offering and meat offering, I will not accept them; Compare above chap 6. 20. and 7.21,22.] but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.
\p
\v 13 Then said I; Ah Lord LORD, behold, those Prophets [Meaning false prophets, as followeth. See above chap. 5.31 and 6.23.] say unto them , ye shall not see the sword, [That is, ye shall not have experience of the voilence, and cruelty of war, or, it shall not come upon you. See Job 9. on vers. 7. and below chap. 42.14.] neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you [As if God himself had spoken this] assured peace, [Hebr. peace of truth, assurance, faithfulness; that is, undoubted, assured, firm peace; that is, sure prosperity] in this place.
\p
\v 14 And the LORD said unto me; These Prophets prophesie false in my Name;I have sent them, nor given them command, nor spoken to them. [Compare below chap. 23. 21. and 27.15. and 29. 8,9] they prophesie unto you a false vision,[Hebr.vision of falshood] and divination, [See Deut.18. 10. Ezech 13.2,3,7,89. with the annotat] and a thing of nought , or , nothing, are the Idols also called Elilim. See Levit 19. on vers.4.]
\p
\v 15 Therefore thus saith the LORD; concerning the Prophhets, that prophesie in my Name, whereas I sent them not, and (yet) they say, There shall be no sword nor famine in this land : those very Prophets shall be consumed by the sword, and by the famine.
\p
\v 16 And the people, to whom they prophesie, shall be cast away in the street of Jerusalem, because of the famine and the sword; and there shall be none to bury them, them, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters: thus will I pour out [Compare above chap. 10. on vers. 25.] their wickedness [Or, their evil; that is, the punishment of their wickedness, as above chap. 11. 12. both in one sense] upon them.

\v 17 Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them, Mine eyes shall come down with tears [As above chap 9.18. Compare above chap. 13.17. Lament. 1.16. and 2.18.] night and day, and not cease: for the Virgin of the Daughter of my people, [That is, my people, or, my countrey–men: or, (as some) the state and condition of my people, which he according to Scripture language, compareth to virgin, by reason of her beauty, tenderness, and comliness, in respect of the state, that was given them of God; or (as some) because they were never yet conquered, and destroyed. See 2 Kings 19. on verse 21. Oth. the Virgin, the Daughter of my people] is broken (with) a great breach, [see above chap 4. 6.] a plague that is very smarting:[Or, wound, that is very painful, grievous, sore, and consequently dangerous. So above chap 10.19. below chap. 30. 12. Nahum. 3.19.]
\p
\v 18 If I go forth into the field , behold there the slain with the sword; and if I enter into the City, behold there the sick [Hebr, sickness. See Job 24. on vers. 20.] with famine; Yea both the Prophets and the priest] run about in the land, and know not. [That is, are void, of counsel, know not what to do, whom it besitted to remedy this evil. Oth. for both Prophets and Priests practise merchandise against the Land, and they (to wit, the people ) perceive it not : to wit that they exhaust and cousen them with false Prophecies Compare above, chap 5.31.]
\p
\v 19 Hast thou then utterly rejected [Hebr. rejecting rejected] Juda? hath thy soul loathed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, (so) that there is no healing [Or, Physick, remedie] for us? We look for peace, but there is no good; and for a time of healing, but lo there is terrour [See above chap. 8.15.]
\p
\v 20 LORD, we know our wickedness, (and) the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee. [Compare Psal.106. 6. Dan 9.8.]
\p
\v 21 Do not disdain (us) for thy Name sake; cast not down [Or, vilify not, let not decay, or, fade, disgrace not] the throne of thy glory: [Thy Temple, Jerusalem , Juda, where thou hast taken up thy seat, and discovered thy glory. Or, hereby may understood the Ark of the covenant, as Psal 63.3. and 78.61.] remember, [To wit, thy covenant]
\p
\v 22 Disannul, not thy covenant with us, [Or, make not avoid, break not, the covenant which thou hast made with us]
\p
\v 23 Are there (any) among the vanities of the Gentiles, that (can) cause it to rain? [That is, can idols give rain? See on 1Kings 16.13. and 2 Kings 17.15. As if he should say, by no means. See Genes 18. on vers.17.] or can the heaven give [To wit, of itself] drops? [Or, showers of rain] art not thou he, O LORD our God? [That is, it is indeed undoubtedly true, that thou art he, that doth this alone . See Genes. 13. on vers. 9. Compare Psal 13 5.7. and 147.8. Isai. 30. 23. above chap. 5. 24. and 10.13.] therefore we will wait upon thee; [That thou mayest give us such rain as is needful for us; for thou art our expectation (above vers. 8.) as in all other troubles and afflictions, so likewise in this of drought, whereof mention is made above in the beggining of this chapter] for thou dost all those things. [Or, thou hast made all those things: rain; and drought etc, come from thee]
\c 15
\s God giveth absolute denial to the prophets intercession which he had made, and commanded him on the contrary to preach and denounce unto the people most sore and heavy plagues (especially four kindes) mentioning the sins, whereby they had deserved them , vers.1,& c.The Priphet complaineth, that everyone curseth him for those Phrophecies, and is comforted by God, 10. and the people threatened again, 13.The prophet complaineth of his persecutours, and prayeth for preservation in his sufferings, appealing to God in regard of his innocency, 15. Is thereupon instructed and comforted by God,19.
\p
\v 1 But the LORD said unto me;[God answereth furthur to the former intercession of Jeremia] Though Moseh and Samuel stood before my face ,(yet) should not my soul [that is minde affection.Compare Psal.27 on verse 12.] be toward his people:[That is, though they were now alive, and prayed for this people, yet I would not hear them, as I have done heretofore. See Exod. 32.14, 1 Samuel7.9 and compare Ezechiel 14.14,18,20.]drive them away from my face,[that is prophecie unto them in my Name, That I will expell them out of my house, city, and land.Compare above chapter 1 on verse 10.] and let them goe forth.
\p
\v 2 And it shall come to pass, when they shall say unto thee, wither shall we go forth? That thou shalt say unto them, thus saith the LORD, whosoever to death, to death,[That is, mortality, pestilence, &c. As may be gathered from the former verse, and so is the sequel. So below chap.43.21.] and whosoever to the sword, to the sword, and whosoever to the famine, to the famine, and whosoever to captivity, to captivity.
\p
\v 3 For I will visit them (with) [Oth. I will appoint over them, as officers, or overseers]four kinds,that is, four sorts of plagues, which are reckoned up in the following words. Compare Ezech 14.21] saith the LORD; with the sword to slay, and wth the dogs to drag,[To be torn in pieces] and with the fowls of the Heaven, and with the beasts of the earth, to eat up, and to destroy. [See Levit.26.16.]
\p
\v 4 And I will give them up[Or, make them, appoint them] for a commotion, to all the kingdoms of the earth;[Or, chasing about, driving about in all kingdoms,&c. See Deut.28 on vers. 25.] because of Manassah, the son of Jehizkia, king of Juda; for that which he did at Jerusalem.[2Kings 21.11,12,13, etc.
\p
\v 5 For who should spare thee [Or have pity upon thee] O Jerusalem? Or who should commiserate thee? [or bemoan thee] Or who should go aside to ask thee concerning peace? [As a man steppeth aside out of the way, to speak to a friend, or an aquaintance of his, and to ask him how he doth . See Judges 18.15 (concerning peace) That is, concerning thy welfare, how thou doest. See Genes. 43. on vers.27. As if the LORD should say, They are not worthy, that a man should trouble himself so much about them, as that he should once ask, whether they be well or ill]
\p
\v 6 Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward: [Compare above chap.5.7.]threfore will I stretch out mine hand against thee, and destroy thee: Iam grown weary of repenting. [That is, Iam weary of with-holding, delaying, diminishing, or keeping off deserved judgements from them, as I have often done. It is spoken of God after the manner of men. Compare Genes.6 on vers.6.]
\p
\v 7 And I will fan them with a fan,[See above chap.4.11.] in the gates of the Land: [That is, in the boarders , uttermost frontier-Cities, strong holds, hereon ye rell at present:as men use to fan or winnow corn in or at the doors, to scatter and winnow dust by the winde: so etc. Oth, in the Cities of the Land; that is everywhere] I have bereaved [That is, I will, etc. And so in the next verse] my people of children,[Or, of all that they have, or, that is dear unto them; because in the next verse is spoken of widows, and the hebrew word is not onely used of bereaving of children, but also of other things. See 2Kings 2.19. Ezech 46. 12,13,14,15. with the annotat.] (and) destroyed (them;) they returned not from their wayes [That is, repented not of their wicked dealings and conversation. See Genes. 6 on vers.12.]
\p
\v 8 Their [That is, the peoples] widows are become more to me than the sand of the seas: [Or, stronger in number than the sand, etc in regard multitudes of their Husbands were slain] I have caused to come to them upon the Mother [Namely Jerusalem] a young man [The king of Babel, being stout and strong in his work, like a youmg man] a destroyer at noon-day: compare above chap.6.4. Oth. Upon the mother of a young men a destroyer at noon-day; that is, upon the assembly of the young men] I have caused him to fall upon her suddenly, the city with terrours. [Hebr. The city and terrours, or, amazements. The sense may be, I will cause that young man to fall uopon her, to wit, upon the city of Jerusalem (called mother before)with great terrour:Or, to wit upon the city, and there shall be more terrour. Or thus: I will cause the cities and terrours suddenly to fall upon her.]
\p
\v 9 She that bare seven,[Namely, Jerusalem that produceth as much people a woman that bringeth forth seven, that is, many (see Gen.4. on vers.32) , children.]is become weak, she has blown out her soul, [is dead of grief and misery, and comfortless. Compare Job.11.20.] her son is gone down, when it was yet day,[or, their day That is, their joy, or flourishing state is turned into exreme sorrow and misery, at the time when she was yet in her prime or thought to be. Compare 2 Samuel 23.4. Amos 8.9 Micha 3.6] she is ashamed and blusheth: and the residue of them [which were not slain at the first] will I deliver to the sword at the face of their enemies, saith the LORD.
\p
\v 10 Woe is me, my Mother,that thou hast born me! [Compare Job 3.1,&c. below, chap.20.14, &c] a man of strife, a man of contention, to the whole land] with whom everyone striveth and contendeth. Compare 2 Samuel 8. on vers 10. The Prophet perceiving, that he could not deprecate Gods judgement, is heartily grieved and complaineth of his sad and troublesome condition under his own wicked countrey-men, against which the Lord comforteth him in the next verse] I have not given (to them) on usury, [From whence commonly strifes and contention, revilings and reproachings are wont to arise] neither have they given to me usury, (yet) every one of them doth curse me.[As if the Prophet h ad said, that he gave them no cause of strife, hatred, cursing, as have nothing to do with them, but to aquaint them with the word of the LORD, and his calling, foralone he suffered.]
\p
\v 11 The LORD said, if thy remnant [Or, the remainder of thee] shall not be for good! [The meaning seemeth to be, If I shall not cause it to go well with thee in the remaining time of thy life,wherein thou shalt remain, when this wicked people shall be plagued and perish: or, if I do not save a remnant of the people in the midst of judgements] if I do not in time of evil [that is,of plagues and miseries] and in time of trouble come between [or speak for, intercede, as Isai.59.16.] for thee by the enemy! [or, cause the enemy to intreat thee (well;) that is, cause the enemy to deal lovingly and kindly with thee. See the fulfilling hereof below, chap.40.1,2,3,4&c. If thy,&c. an abrupt kinde of speech, very usual in making oaths. See Gen.14. On vers.23. And Deut.1. On vers.35 God sweareth Jeremia, that he will turn his sufferings into a good condition, so that in the time of the enemies invasion he shall speed much better than this wicked people shall. Some take in an interrogatory way, in one and the same sense.]
\p
\v 12 Shall also (any) iron break the iron or copper [Or, steel] of the North?[Asif God should say, By no means. Because the Northern iron is much harder, and is like steel, as Gographers also testifie: Are then these men that do so vex thee, hard?Iam yet harder, able enough to break their plots and designes against thee. But some conceive that God in this phase beginneth again to speak of the coming of the Babylonians from the North, whose power the Jews with their defensive weapons would be as little able to resist, as a common iron sword is able to break a Northern sword of steel; both in a good sense.]
\p
\v 13 I will give thy power,[That is, riches] and thy treasurers for a prey, without price; [Hebr. Not for price, or not in buying; that is, for nothing; they shall take all away at their pleasure, without giving anything for it] and that for all thy sins, and in all thy boaders. [Meaning, will do this: or for thy sins, which thou hast committed in all thy boarders, as below, ch.17.3.]
\p
\v 14 And I will carry (thee) over with thine enemies, into a Land, (which) thou knowest not; [Or; carry over (the treasures) whereof, in the verse] into,&c. Oth. I will cause thine enemies to passe over thorow a Land, which thou knowest not; That is, thou shalt not know of their passage and comming; they shall come upon thee by-wayes, and in a manner unknown to thee. Some understand it thus: I will cause thine enemies to go over (thee;) That is, I will cause them to use thee tyrannically. Compare below, chap.17.4 and 43.12. and Deuteron.32.22. Job.22.20. With the annotat.] is kindled in mine anger, it shall burn upon you.
\p
\v 15 O LORD thou knowest (it) [mine innocency, whereof above vers.10. These are the words of the Prophet again to God] remember me, [For good, as Neh.5.19. and 13. 31.see Genes. 8. on vers. 1.] and visit me [graciously. See Genes.21.on v.1.] and revenge me of mine persecutours; [Compare above chap.11.20.] take me not away in thy long-suffering (toward them.) [that is, whilest thou dealest thus patiently with my persecutors, that thou hinderest them not , but delayest thy punishment, yet prevent, that they in the mean while take away my life, as they intend to do. Or, according to thy long suffering, when the same shall be at an end, and thou shalt punish this people,then save me. Oth. In, or by lenghtening of thine anger; that is, whilest thou shalt punish this wicked people a long time, make, I pray, a dinstinction between them and me, that I may not perish with them. Compare, Psalm.26.9.] know that for thy sake I suffer disdain.
\p
\v 16 When thy words are found, then I did eat them up, [That is, as soon as they were present, were revealed to me, or represented unto me by thy revelation, I forth with imbraced them with great zeal, and minded them diligently. Compare Ezechiel 2.8. and 3,1,2,3. with the annotat.and Revelations 10.9.] and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoycing of mine heart: called or proclaimed upon me, because Iam thy servant and thy Prophet. See above, chapter 7.10.] O LORD, God of hosts. [See 1 Kings 18. on verse 15.]
\p
\v 17 I set not in the counsel of the mockers [As the Priests and the false Prophets were at that time . Compare Psal.1.1.] nor leaped up for joy: I sate alone [Separating myself from the wicked, being grieved, and weeping for their wickednesse and the approaching plagues . Compare above chap.9.2. and 13.17. also Exod.33.7.] because of thy hand: [to wit, thy punishing hand, which thou will stretch out against this people, Or, because of command, because I would be wholly governed by thy hand,and by thy spirit of prophecy, and would obey thee. See Ezechiel 1. on verse. 3.] for thou hast filled me (with) indignation. [An holy indignation, which I have drawn from thy prophecies against this peoples obstinacy towards thee, and cruelty towards me. Compare above, chap.6.11.]
\p
\v 18 Why is my pain continually lasting, [Or, strong, piercing thorow; see of the Hebrew word, Psal.13. On verse 1,2.] and my plague smaerting? It refuseth to be healed: shouldest thou be altogether [Or, in a manner. Hebr. being be] unto me as a lying (person) [That is, shouldest thou every way shew thyself towards me, as if thou didst deal with lies? Seeing thou hast made me such strong promises (above chap.1.17,18,19.) and yet Iam daily plagued by this people, and am in danger] (as) waters (that) are not lasting? [That dry up, flow away, and so that he is deceived, that cometh for water to them. Cmpare Job 6.15. Thus the Prophet is assulted with impatiency, grief, diffidence, and murmuring, by reason of the peoples wickedness: whreupon God instructeth and comforteth him in the following words]
\p
\v 19 Therefore thus saith the LORD;If thou shalt return, [From this impatiency murmuring. (where-of in the former verse) so as they do not draw thee away from thy duty and office] then will I cause thee to return, [That is, settle and establish thee, as it were a new in thy Prophetical ministery. Oth. If thou shall turn thyself that way, that I do turn thee; that is, faithfully execute my commands, then shalt thou,&c.] thou shalt stand before my face; That is, minister unto me, be and continue my servant and Prophet. See 1 Kings 17.1 . and 18.5. Deut. 10. on vers.8.] and if thou pluck off the precious from the vile [Or, the precious one from the vile one, that is, fever the Godly (that are most precious in my sight) from the wicked, telling both of them severally and bodly whatsoever I command thee. Some understand here the distinguishing between true and false Doctrine, Prophecy, comfort, etc. It seemeth to be a comparison, taken from the work of Goldsmiths. Compare above chap.6.29. and see likewise, Psal.12. on vers.9.] thou shalt be as my mouth: [Compare above chap 1.9. That is, my true Prophet and Interpreter] let them return unto thee, seeking counsel and comfort fron thee. See below, chap.37.3.] but thou shalt not return unto them. [That thou shouldest fail through faint heartednesse, or humane fear, yeeld to them in their wickedness, also seek counsel and comfort from them]
\p
\v 20 For I have made thee [Or, I will make thee, or, I do make thee; to wit, as it were anew.] against this people a strong copper wall: [Compare above chap.1.18.] they shall indeed fight thee, but not prevail against thee; for Iam with thee, to save thee, and to rescue thee, saith the LORD.
\p
\v 21 Yea I will rescue thee out of the hand of the wicked: and I will deliver thee out of the hand-palm of Tyrants.
\c 16
\s God commandeth the Prophet to have neither wife nor childe in Juda, neither to be present at mourning-feasts, nor at joyful banquets, to represent thereby unto the people the approaching misery, vers.1,&c .At relation of the sins, that were the cause of plagues ,10. Between these God adjoyneth a gracious promise of the deliverance of his people, 14. and after that proceedeth in his threatenings , and a relations of the causes thereof, 16. The Prophet comforteth himself , and comfoundeth the Jews, by the future calling and conversion of the Idolatrous Gentiles,19.
\p
\v 1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:
\p
\v 2 Thou shall not take [That is, marry, see Gen.19 on vers.14.]thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons nor daughters in this place.[which thou mightest beget: whereby the misery of the times that were coming is represented.]
\p
\v 3 For thus saith theLORD concerning the sons, and concerning the daughters that are born in this place: and moreover concerning their fathers that beget them in this land.
\p
\v 4 They shall die painful deaths,[Hebr. Deaths of sickness, or, diseases, painfulness ;which may likewise be understood of deadly diseases.]they shall not be lamented, [Compare below chap.25.33.] nor buried, [Compare above chap.14.16.] they shall be as dung upon the earth;[compare above chap.9.22.] and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by the famine, and their dead bodies [Hebr.dead body; as below, verse 18. and above chap.7.33, etc.] shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.
\p
\v 5 For thus saith the LORD; Enter not into the house of him thsat keepeth a mourning-feast,[Or, mourning steward, of him that hath the rule and managing of affairs in mourning-banquets, which feasts were ordained and kept for to mourn and grieve at the death of their friends, or to comfort one another that grieed for the losse of their friends by death, but they committed at in those feasts all manner of pride, wantoness, and excess, as may be gathered from Amos 6.7. where the like Hebrew word is used, and no where else in the Holy Scripture, for which it is also diversly translated. See further of the scope of this command, on vers.8. And compare Job 27.15. Psa.78.6. Ezech.2.22. Amos 6.10. Especially doth all this agree with that which God caused to be prophesied in Babylon unto the people of the Jews by the Prophet Ezechiel, and to be pourtrayed by a miracle the that Jerusalem was beseiged by Nebchadnezar, Ezech.24.] neither go into lament, nior be grieved for them: for I have taken away [Hebr. Properly gathered. See of the Hebr. Word,Psal. 26. vers.9.] peace from this people, saith the LORD, loving kindnesse, and mercies.
\p
\v 6 So that great and small shall die in this land, they shallnot be buried: neither shall men lament for them; [Hebr. They shall not lament for them; that is, men shall not lament for them, or they shall not be lamented. See Job.4 on v 19. So in the sequel] nor cut themselves, [To wit, in the flesh of their bodies, as Lev.19.27,28. And 21.5,6. Deut. 14.1. for a token of mourning] nor make (themselves) bald for their sakes. [For the like end, after the manner of the heathen, which the Jews did imitate, contrary to Gods command. See Lev.21.5. and Deut.14.1. And compare below chap. 41.5. and 47.5 and 48.37.]
\p
\v 7 Neither shall men deal unto them in the mourning, meaning any bread; [that is, meat, (which jooynedd with the Hebrew verb, Isai. 58.7. Lament.4.4) whih friends and neighbours did use to send , or to carry into the house of mourning, or to the place where the friends met together at the mourninnng-banquet, to comfort and cheer up those that were sad and heavy, as followeth, eating and drinking with them. See Deut.26. On vers.14. Ezech.2.17,22. This doth very well agree with the sequel, where mention is made of drinking. Some understand it of the dividing, or, stretching out, wringing of the bands, which indeed was wont to be done in great mourning ] to comfort any for one, that is dead: nor give them to drink out of the cup of consolation, for any ones father, or for any ones mother.
\p
\v 8 Go also into an house of feasting, to fit with them: to eat and drink. [Oth. house of drinking. Meaning where a merry feast, or great banquet is kept. As if God had said; Thou shalt have nothing to do with their sorrow or joy. From the former 5th verse, and the following 8th verse, some take both these commands to be as it were predictions of such a multitude of dead persons, and of such a general calamity , and with all of such a general calamity, and with all of such a curse of God, as that there shall be no minding time , nor leisure of mourning, or of rejoying.]
\p
\v 9 For thus saith the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place before your eyes, and in your dayes, the voice of the mirth, and the voice of gladnesse, [which was wont to be heard at joyful feasts and weddings] the voice of the Bridegroom, and the voice of the Bride. [Compare Isai.2.7.8 above chap.735. Nbbelow chap. 25.10. Ezech. 26.13.]
\p
\v 10 And it shall come to passe, when thou shall tell this people that all these words, and they (shall) say unto thee; doth the LORD pronounce all this great evil against us, and what is our offence , and what is our sin, which we have sinned against the LORD our God.
\p
\v 11 That thou shalt say unto them; Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the LORD, and have walked after other Gods, and served them, and bowed themselves down before them: but have forsaken me, and (have) not kept my law:
\p
\v 12 And ye have done worse then your fathers: [Hebr.have done evil, doing, or, more then,&c. Compare above chap. 7.26.] for behold, ye walk, everyone after the imagination of his (own) heart, [see above chap.3.on vers.17. And 9.1. and 13.10.] not to hearken unto me. [Compare above chap.11.10. and 13.10. below chap.17.23.]
\p
\v 13 Therefore will I cast you out of this Land, [see Deut.4.27. And 28.64,65.] into a Land, that ye have not known, [That is, have not seen; or wherein have not lived or conversed : for otherwise they knew well enough, that there was ba Land that was called Chaldea, or, Babel. So elsewhere often] ye, nor your fathers: and there shall ye serve other Gods, day and night; because I will not give you favour. [Or, where I, &c. Oth. as long long as I shall give you no favour .That is, until the time that I shall give you grace and favour in the eyes of king Cyrus, who shall release you, to return again to your own countrey, etc. Which favour [would not give unto you uder the rein of the former Kings of Babel. Compare Deut.28.65,66,67.]
\p
\v 14 Therefore [Compare Hos.2.13. With the annotat.] Behold, the dayes come, saith the LORD; that it shall no more be said [it shall no more be said; that is, not so much, nor feelingly as before: (compare the phrase with the above chap.3. on vers.36.Prov.8.on vers.10. Hos.6.on vers.6.) Partly, because the misery, which they should suffer from the Babylonians, should be far greater, and more cruel,(which God inculcateth and whetteth upon them in these 2 verses) then that which they had suffered from the Egyptians, and consequently this new deliverance, should be more glorious. Prtly also , because in this respect is likewise had to their future deliverance or redemption from the spiritual Babel, which uor saviour Christ would not onely bring tothe elect remnant of the Jews, but also to the Gentiles, whereof is clearly spoken in the last verses of this chapter: for which transcendent benefit, they should all of them serve and honour their Saviour, which is likewise intimated by the afore-mentioned of oath. Compare below chap.23.7,8. Isai.43.18,19,etc.] (as true as) the LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the Land of Egypt:
\p
\v 15 But (as true as) the LORD liveth, that brought the children of Israel out of the land of the North, [Babel, and the spiritual captivity and misery thereby typified,] and from all the Lands, whither he hath driven them: for I will bring them again into their Land, that I gave unto their fathers.
\p
\v 16 Behold, I will send to many fishers, saith the LORD, they shall fish them: and after that I will send to my hunters, they hunt them from every mountain, from every hill, [That is, I will by my divine and righteous providence raise up enemies unto them, that shall deal with them as fishers are wont to deal with fish, and hunters with wilde beasts; that is hunt, hurt, catch, and carry away. Some understand here by the fishers, the Egyptians, that (living in a Country abounding with water) dealt much in fishing, Isai.19.8. See 2 Kings 23.29,33,etc. By the hunters, the Babylonians. Compare Genes.10.8,9. Others understand by both, the Babylonians. Compare Habak.1.14,15. Oth. I will send forth many, or great fishers, &c. Some understand this of this sending forth of the Apostles for the conversion of the Jews. Compare Ezek.47.9,10. with the annotat.] ye out of the clifts of the rocks. [That they may be nowhere secure, no not in such places, where otherwise men are commonly wont to hide themselves.]
\p
\v 17 For mine eyes are upon all their wayes; [I take notice of all their purposes and practises. It is spoken of God after the manner of men. Compare Job 34. 21. Prov.5.21. Below chap 32.19. How such kind ofe of phrase is also used for good., see 1 Kings 8. on verse. 29.] they are not hid from my face, neither (is0 their iniquity, concealed from mine eyes.
\p
\v 18 . Therefore will I first [Before I shew them the mecry, and favour, mentioned, vers.15.] recompense their iniquity, and their sin double, [That is, to the full; as Isai..40.2. Below chap.17.18.] because they have profaned Land: [Cannan. See Psal.68. On ver.10. Compare above chap.3.2.] they have filled mine inheritance with the dead bodies of their detestations and their abominations. [Hebr. dead body; as above vers.4. To wit, of men, whom they slew and offered unto Idols. See below chap.19.5. Ezech.16.20,21. Or (as some understand it) with all their Idols and idolatrous offerings, which stank in the sight and presence of God like a dead rotten carcase, because they were unlawful and idolatrous. See Lev.26.30. You may likewise compare herewith, Ezech.43.7.]

\v 19 . O LORD, thou art my force, and my strength, and my refuge in the day of distresse: unto thee shall the gentiles come forth from the ends of the earth, [The Prophet being grieved at the peoples abominations, and troubled at Gods sore judgements, raiseth himself up by his faith, and the certainty of Gods promises; as if he had said: Yet in all this I take thee for my God alone, and abhor all manner of Idolatory: and though thou therefore shouldst be constrained to cut off this people, and to remove them away out of thy presence, yet I know that thou wilt most gloriously fill up the room again, by the gracious and conversion of the Gentiles, who with the elect remnant of the Jews shall know and serve thee better, then this wicked people doth, as followeth] and say; surely our fathers have possessed hereditarily [Or, left for an inheritance] lying (and) vanity, [See above chap14. On vers.22. That is, have lived a very long time, successively, in ignorance of thetrue God, and in idolatory,and have taken comfort and delight, and left the same for an inheritance unto their children.] wherein there was nothing indeed, that profited.
\p
\v 20 . Shall a man manke Gods unto himself? [This may be taken in geneal,as a detestation, and abhorring of all Idolatory whatsoever, both of Jews and Gentiles.] yet they are no Gods. [To wit, the Gods that are made; that is, Idols; as above chap.2.11. Or, (as some) whereas they themselves (To wit, men) are no Gods: As if the Prophet should say; It is the foolishest thing that can be, that a man that is indeed no God himself, should undertake to make a God.
\p
\v 21 . Therefore behold, I will make known unto them [unto this Idolatrous people] at this time; I will make unto them my hand, and my mind: [That is, shew by my judgements, that I am the onely Almighty God] and they shall know, that my name is the LORD. [see Genes.2.on vers.4.]

\v 1 The sin of Juda is written with an iron gaver, [Hebr.graver of iron] with the point [Hebr. Nail] of a diamond: [Oth.durable,and conquently very hard stone, or very hard iron. Because some are of opinion; that the Hebrew word schamir cometh from keeping. Compare Ezech.3.9.] graven in the table of their heart, [Compare this phase with prov.3.3. With the annotat.] and on the horns of your [O ye Jews; as such changings of persons, and in such speeches, are very usual with the Prophets] Altars. [Which ye set up unto idols, and whose horns ye sprinkle in publick with the unclean blood of your idolatrous offerings, whereunto the word, hons, mat be applied . By this comparison God will shew, that they were most inwardly and desparately wicked, obstinate and impenitent. Compare above chap.13.23.]
\p
\v 2 As their children remember their altars, and their groves, [or grove-gods] by the green-trees, upon the high hills. [compare above chap.2.20. The aforesaid wickednesse of the parents appeareth in their children, into whom they so implanted idolatry, that upon all occassions when they come neer to any fair green, or upon any high mountain, they have nothing else in their mouths, but Idolatry, which their parents commit in such places, and therefore they will do no lesse. Compare above chap.7.18. Oth.(they remember) their altars, &c. As they remember their children:`That is, they love Idolatry, as they love their own children; so do they dote on them.]
\p
\v 3 I will give my mountains [Namely Zion] with the field, thy substance, and all thy treasures to the spoil; [Or, my mountains; to wit, of Juda, together with the plain field. Oth. (because the Hebrew word may signify both) O thou mountain runner, or, thou that dwellest in the mountains , I will prevail against thee in the field,&c . that is, thou that reliest upon thy mountaineous land, and thinkest thyself to be in no danger: or, thou that daily wanderest and runnest to and from upon the mountains, to commit thine Idolatry, (which also very well agreeth with the fore-going, and with the following words) I will give all thy riches for a prey unto thine enemies, who shall spoil and carry away all as`easily, as if so be it were done upon the plain even field. See below chap.20.5,&c.](together with) high places, for sin, [Or,(to wit) thy high places, where thou hast bestowed all thy substance upom thy Idols, and wherein thy sin principally consisteth. Compare. Hos.10.8. Some conceive that these words are transposed in the hebrew, (as it is sometimes) and render it, for the sin of thy high places, by comparing above chap.15.13] in all thy borders.[compare above chap.15.31.]
\p
\v 4 So shall thou cease, [That is, be fain to omit the tillage of Canaan, the land shall enjoy her Sabath or rest. Compare Exod.23.10,11. and Levit.26.33,34,35.] (and that for thyself) [That is, by thine own fault] from thine heritage, [To wit, this land of Canaan] that I gave thee, and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies, in a land, which thou knowest not: [See Deut. 28.18. above chap.16.13.] for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, [ye have procured my heavy, wrath, and consequently this plague. Compare above chap.15.14.] it shall burn forever. [In respect of the impenitent, which shall feel the fire of my wrath, unto all eternity: otherwise, a long time, to wit, seventy yeers, as the word eternity, or, ever, is sometimes taken. See Genes.13. On v.15. Deut.15. On vers.17, etc.]
\p
\v 5 Thus saith the LORD, cursed in the man, that trusteth in a man, [As the backsliding Jews trusteth in Egypt, in their own riches. See Isai.31.1. And below vers.11.] and maketh flesh [That is, a frail, miserable man. See Psal.26. On vers. 5.] his arm, [That is,strenght, help, defence. See 2 chron.32. On vers.8.] and whose heart departeth from the LORD.
\p
\v 6 For he shall be like the heath in the wildernesses [Or, a Tamarisk-tree, or, shrub, which is sometimes found in most drie and barren places, where no other trees grow,as the herbarists testify. Oth.a tree that is made quite bare, or, necked, as the Hebrew word in its proper signification is taken, Psal.102.18] that feeleth [Hebr.seeth; that is, feeleth, peceiveth] it not when good [That is, good weather,rain,seasonable warmth, etc.] cometh:[some understand these and the following words of the wicked man himself, who shall not see good but, etc. The sense being but all one. Compare Psal.61.7.] but abideth,[Hebr dwelleth [That is, abideth, or continueth alwayes] (in) dry[Hebr. Properly perched, kindled; thhat is, very dry, withered] places in the wildernesse, (in) a Salt Land, [That is, barren land. See Psal.107.34 and Deut.29.23. Hebr. In a land of saltnesse] and un-inhabited. [Hebr.and (where) thou shalt not, or, shouldest not dwell: or, (which) shall not be inhabited, or, is inhabited, or is inhabitable, as the Hebrew word (which otherwise signifieth, sitting, dwelling, abiding,) is soometimes so taken, when it is used of places. See below chap.50.39. And Isai.13.20. Ezech 29.11,etc.]
\p
\v 7 Blessed (on the contrary) is the man, that trusteth in the LORD: [Compare Psal.2.12. And 34.9. prov. 16.20. and Isai..30.18.] and whose confidence the LORD is.
\p
\v 8 For he shall be as a tree planted by the water, [Compare Psal.1.3] and spreadeth out her roots by a river, and feeleth [Hebr. Seeth,as in former verse.]not when heat cometh,[That is, it suffereth no damage by it, withereth not because of it] but her leaf continueth [Hebr. Is] green, [see psal 37. on	vers.18] and in a yeer of drought[See of the Hebrew word rendered drought, above chap.14 on vers.1.] it careth not, [It is spoken by way of comparison, as before, seeth not; that is, feeleth not] and ceaseth not [Hebr. Departeth not] from bearing [Hebr.making. See above chap.12. On vers.2.] fruit.
\p
\v 9 The heart is crafty [Or,fraudulent, deceitful,keeping back, prone to supplanting. The Hebrew word akob is the same, from whence the Patriarch Jacob had his name,because in his birth he took his brother by the heel: but that it also hath the signification of craft, lying in wait, deceit, fraud, supplanting,&c. Appeareth not onely here, but also above chap.9.4. Genes. 27.36. Jos.8.13. 2 Kings 10.19] more then anything,[Or, above all things] yea it is deadly: [Tending to death, whereunto death cleaveth, incurable, desparately wicked. From the Hebrew word man here hath the name of Enosch, signifying his mortal or miserable condition, into which is fallen by sin. By the heart here, is meant the heart of man since the fall, until it be renewed by the spirit of regeneration. And so wicked in heart were the hypocritical and back-sliding Jews, that departed from God and trusted not in him, although they would be not known to be such, but soothed and flattered themselves in their wickednesse, and despised the proof of the Prophets, for which God declareth that he will be their judge, in the next verse] who shall know it?
\p
\v 10 I the LORD search the heart,(and) try the veins:[see Psal.7.10 1Sam.16.10. Or, I the LORD,(it being as an answer to the former question)that searcheth the heart, that trieth the veins] and that, [So is the Hebrew letter vau also used for, and that, or, even, above chap.15.13. Ezech. 17.9. Joel 2.12. Amos 4.10. Micha 2.10. Also Jos.9.27. Judg.7.22, &c.] to give every man according tot his wayes,[That is, purposes, practices and conversion. See Genes.6 on vers.12.]according to the fruit of his dealings. [That is, according as his works, dealings, or his doings do require. So below chap.21.14. And 32.19. compare Prov.1. On vers.31 and above chap.6.19.]
\p
\v 11 (As) a patridge gathereth (egges,) but hatcheth them not , [Hebr. Bringeth not forth: because the patridge is taken, or, because, the male finding the egges, which the female hideth, breaketh them, treadeth them under foot, or through fiercenesse breaketh them in pieces, as the Naturalists do testify, so that many of the egges do often perish: Oth, as a patridge do gathereth (egges,) which had not laid,&c. meaning the strange egges of other fowl:for which cause the young ones when they are hatch forsake these strange dams] (so) is he that gathereth [Hebr.maketh] riches but not by right: [That is, unjustly] he shall be constrained to leave them [To wit, the riches] in the half of his dayes, [compare Psal.55 on vers.24] and his last [That is, end, at last] be a fool. [that is, be esteemed , and counted a fool, as Job 15.8.2 Tim.2.21,&c.]

\v 12 A throne of glory,[Where God always manifested his honour,grace and power for the good of his Church,and consequently will severely punish the unthankfulnese of despisers, that rely upon other help, as followeth] an highness from the first, [That is, from the beginning of the building] is the place of our Sanctuary. [That is, of the Temple]
\p
\v 13 O LORD, the expectation of Israel [Whose help Israel expecteth in troubles: as above chap. 14.8 See there.] all that forsake thee shall be ashamed,[Compare Psal.73.25. Isai. 1.28.] and they that depart from me as thy Prophet, that prophesie in thy Name. Hebr. My departers,or,revolters. Compare below chap.18.19. Oth. They that depart,to wit,from thee] shall be written in the earth; [Our Saviou Christ saith,Luke 10.20. that the names of his disciples are written in the Heavens : on th contrary it is said here, that backsliders shall be written in the earth, That is, though they be counted here pon earth among the people of God, and the seed of Abraham according to the flesh, and consequently, are generaly held to be outwardly members of God's Church and do sometimes bear great sway among them, that yet not withstanding they pertain not the number of the elect, and shall not have a place in heaven,but shall be reckoned among those whose portion is onely in the earth: (Compare Ps.69.29.)and their memorie among God's people shall perish] for they forsake the LORD, the fountain of living waters. [See above chap 2.13]
\p
\v 14 Heal me, LORD, so shall I be healed, save me, so shall I be saved: [The prophet being troubled at the general abominable wickednesse of his people, with whom he had to do, and considering his present and future dangers, and likewise his own infirmities and waknesse, whereof chap.15.18&c. Prayeth unto God, that he would raise him up, strengthen and preserve him both in soul and body] for thou art my praise.[That is, he whom I alone extol,as my Saviour. Compare Deut.10.on vers.21.]
\p
\v 15 Behold,they say unto me;[Mocking at thy threatnings and at thy long-suffering in delaying punishment] Where is the word of the LORD, let it come now. [Compare Isai.5.19. Ezech.12.22,23,25,27,28. 2Pet.3.4.]
\p
\v 16 Yet I have not pressed on, more then(became) an herdman [That is, more then became a Prophet feeding and ruling thy people with thy word] after thee[: as if the prophet should say: They tell me continually, that I am very urgent,and hasty,and wit for nohing more, but that destruction may sieze upon them: whereas thou,Lord, knowest well,that I have no other wayes carried myself,nor demeaned myself more hasty,then it becometh a Prophet that followeth thee,to do, onely telling them that, which thou gavest me in charge. This agreeth very well with that which went before,and that which followeth. Oth.I have not indeed been instant,that I should not be a shepherd after thee:That I have not shewed myself unwilling and backward, to follow thee. See above chap.1.4 etc] neither have I desired the deadly day,[That is, I have not wished for the time of their destruction,longed for it. See below chap18.20. Or,have had no delight of myself to prophesie unto them of their ruin,they are thy words,etc.Thhe Hebrew word is the same, which is used, vers 9.of man's heart] thou knowest(it;)that which came out of my lips,[Hebr.the issue of my lips]was before the face. [That is,I have spoken it sincerely,as in thy presence,being fully assured,that I neither deminished,there from nor added thereto,whereof thou art witnesse]
\p
\v 17 Be not thou a aterrour unto me [OR, dismayrdness Oth. ruine, breaking, destruction, that thou shouldest cut me down: as thou hast threatened me, if l should refuse t6 follow thy calling, above chap.1.17.] thou art my refuge in the day of evil. [That is, of misery as also in the next verse. Compare above chap.16.19.]
\p
\v 18 Let my persecutours be confounded,[compare Psal.35.4. And 40.15.above chap.15.15.]but let me not be confounded;let them be terrified,but let not me be terrified;bring upon them the day of evil,[see Psal.37 on vers13]and break them with a double[that is,perfect.compare above chap 16.18.]breaking.
\p
\v 19 Thus said the LORD unto me;go thy wayes, and stand in the gate of the children of the people,[This hath respect unto one of the chiefest gates of the city,where the greatest part of the people met together,because the Kings were wont to go in and out by it, as followeth]whereby the Kings of Judah come in,and by the which they go out: Yea in all the gates of Jerusalem.
\p
\v 20 And say unto them;hear the word of the LORD,the Kings of Juda, and all Juda, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem,yea that enter in by these gates.
\p
\v 21 Thus saith the LORD;take heed to your souls[That is,as ye love the salvation of your own souls. Or take heed to yourselves;look to your own persons;watch your own selves. Compare Deut.4.15. Jos.23.11.]and bear no burden on the Sabbath-day,nor bring(ought)in by the gates of Jerusalem.[Compare Neh.13.19.]
\p
\v 22 Neither shall ye carry forth any burden out of your houses on the Sabbath-day,nor do any work:but ye shll hallow the Sabbath-day,[See Genes.2.on vers.8.]according as I commanded your fathers.[See Exod.20.8.and 23.2 and 31.13. Ezech.20.12.]
\p
\v 23 But they hearkened not,[That is,obeyed not]neither inclined their ear:{As above chap.11.10. And 13.10. and 16.12.]but they had haerdened their neck,[As above chap.7.26.]that they might not hear[As above chap.16.22.]and that they might not recieve discipline. See Prov.1.on verse2 and 7.on ver.22.]
\p
\v 24 It shall then come to pass,if ye shall deligently hearken[Hebr.heakning shall hearken]unto me,saith the LORD,to bring in no burden through the gates of the City on the Sabbath-day,and shall hallow the Sabbath-day,to do no work therein.
\p
\v 25 Then shall(there)enter in by the gates of this City,Kings and Princes,sitting upon the throne of David,riding upon Chariots and upon horses,[Compare below chap.22.4.]they and their Princes,the men[or everyone,Hebr.man,as above chap.4.3.]of Juda,and the inhabitants of Jerusalem;and this City shall be inhabited forever.[or,shall remain forever. Compare above chap 7.3,7.etc]
\p
\v 26 And they shall come from the Cities of Juda,and from the places round about Jerusalem,and from the land of Benjamin,and from the low ground, and from the mountains,and from the South,bringing burnt-offering,and slay-offering, and meat-offering, and incense, and bringing praise-offering into the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 27 But if ye will not heaken unto me,to hallow the Sabbath-day,and to bear no burden,when ye enter in thorow the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath-day;then will I kindle a fire[The war of the Babylonians,whereby Jerusalem and all Judea shall be laid desolate,as followeth. Compare above ver.4.]in the gates thereof,[to wit, of Jerusalem]which shall burn the palaces of Jerusalem,and (shall)not be quenched.

\s By the parable of a potter God sheweth unto his people his power to make or save them and to break or destroy them and thereupon exhorteth them to repentance verse1,2 &c but complaineth of their rebellion great ingratitude such as was not to be found among the heathen for elsewhere which he must needs punish them 12 the prophet complaineth of their blood thirsty counsels against him and prayeth unto God to punish them of the same 18.
\p
\v 1 The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying:
\p
\v 2 . Get thee up and go down to the potters [Hebrew the farmers] house and there I will cause thee to hear my words.
\p
\v 3 . Then I went down to the potter’s house and behold he made a work [or he did his work he labored] on the wheels [the Hebrew word is put in the dual number because there be two wheels which the potter use in their labor the lowermost which is greater and the uppermost which is smaller as some say that it is still in use in the eastern countries others stools forms.]
\p
\v 4 . And the vessels that he made [others that he made of clay with his hands] was marred like clay in the hands of the potter [that is the clay in the hand of the potter is wont sometimes to miscarry] then he made of it again another vessel [Hebrew he returned and made it another vessel] as it was right in the eyes of the potter [that is as it seemed good unto him or pleased him] to make it.
\p
\v 5 . Then the word of the Lord came to me saying:
\p
\v 6 . Shall l not be able to do unto ye as this potter O house of Israel? saith the Lord [compare Isaiah 45.9 Romans 9.10] behold as that is in the potter’s hand so are ye in mine hand O house of Israel [compare Isaiah 64.8.]
\p
\v 7 . In a moment shall I speak concerning a nation a kingdom that I will pluck up and pull down and destroy it [as above chapter 1.10.]
\p
\v 8 . But if that nation concerning whom I have spoken of it turn from their wickedness then will I repent [see Genesis 6.6 so verse11] of the evil [that is mischief, misery plagues so verse 11] that I thought I do unto them [unto that nation and kingdom.
\p
\v 9 . I shall speak in a moment concerning nation or concerning kingdom that I will build or plant it.
\p
\v 10 . But if it do that which is evil in mine eyes that is hearken not to mine voice then I will repent to the good [that is happiness prosperity and blessing ]wherewith I had said that I would benefit them [that nation and kingdom]
\p
\v 11 . Now then speak now to the men [as above chapter 17.25 and 4.3 ] of Judah and to be inhabitants of Jerusalem saying thus saith the Lord behold I form evil [see of the word evil above verse 9] against ye [the Hebrew word rendered here forming is the same which above signified a potter as if the Lord hath said , I will prepare and bake evil c] and think a thought against ye [that is I intend to bring evil upon ye compare 2Samuel 14.14 and below verse 18] therefore return ye now everyone from his evil way and make your ways and your dealings good [see above chapter 7 on verse 3 compare also 2Kings 17.13 below chapter 25.5 and 26.13 and 35.15]
\p
\v 12 . But they say it is past hope [see above chapter 2.25 and 6.16] but we will walk after our own thoughts and will do everyone the evil of every one the imagination of the evil heart [as above chapter 3.7.]
\p
\v 13 . Therefore thus saith the Lord ask now among the heathen who hath heard such things? [Compare above chapter 2.10] the virgin of Israel [compare above chapter 14.17] doth a very horrible thing [compare above chapter 5.30.]
\p
\v 14 . Will a man also leave a rock of Lebanon for a rock of the field? [that is will a man leave a pleasant cooling snow of mount Libanon whereunto God compareth himself for a dry rock of the field ? whereunto idols and idolatry are compared] shall also the strange cold flowing waters be forsaken ? [to wit these waters that come down from other distance hilly places by secret passages under the ground and are derived by channels and pipes and at last make and yield a very wholesome cool and pleasant fountain in a city or hard by it so that it would be softly to forsake these waters and to seek elsewhere other waters and other shall also the stream to wit which are nigh at hand be forsaken for strange or outlandish or terrible as the word strange is also taken Isaiah 28.21 cold waters which may be or unknown unwholesome and very hurtful ? the meaning of this verse which may be diversely rendered is that the people of God did deal very foolishly in forsaking the true God and the true worship of God wherein their salvation consisted and running the heathenish idols and help to their own destruction as is shewed in the next verse.]
\p
\v 15 . Yet my people have forgotten me [compare chapter 2.32 and 3.21 and 13.25] they burn incense to vanity [to idols as above chapter 14.22] for they have caused them to stumble in their ways [which were prescribed to them by God the false prophets procured that people taking offence at the true worship of God turned aside unto idolatry compare Malachi2.8] in the ancient paths [Hebrew part of eternity that is antiquity which are formerly taught by God published by Moseh and walked in by Godly patriarchs of the signification of the word Olam see above chapter 2 on verse 20 and 6.16] that they might walk in the paths of a way that is not cast up [that is not trodden wherein it is inconvenient and dangerous to walk or an untroden way such as are rocks and snowy mountains whereof in the former verse.]
\p
\v 16 . To make their land astonishment [that is matter terror and admiration other desolation so below chapter 19.8 and 25.9 and 29.18] everlasting whistling [or whistling hissing and piping of eternity token of reproach and shame see 1 Kings 9 on verse 8 and below chapter 19.8 and 25.9,18 and 29.18c or making their land an astonishment &c that is occasioning thereby these punishments and bringing the same upon them or left I being thereby provoked anger make their land c compare below chapter 27.10,15 Lamentations 2.14 Mich. 6.16 with the annotate ] whosoever passeth thereby shall be astonished and shake his head [see 2Kings 9 on verse 21]
\p
\v 17 . As an east wind [that is as if I were an east wind or as with the east wind which was very strong and piercing in those countries see Exodus 10 on verse 13 and Job 27 on verse 21 compare Isaiah 27.28 and 29.6 and above c 4.11, 12,13] will I scatter them before the face of the enemy [compare above chapter 13.24] I will cause them to see the neck and not the face [that is shew myself averse and contrary to them and not kind and favorable to them as they likewise have done to me Hebr. I will see them the neck and not the face which some understand thus that God will look after them or pursue them while their fleeing see below chapter 32.33] in the day of their deadly destruction [or deadly mischance.]
\p
\v 18 . Then said they [unto whom Jeremiah had spoken all these things by command from God see above verse 11 or they have said or say ]come let us think thought against Jeremiah [that is lay thought against him devise devices to take away his life compare the phrase with verse 11] for the law [or doctrine see Psalms 1 on verse 2] shall perish from the priest nor counsel from the wise nor the word from the prophet [ they imply that Jeremiah is a false prophet because almost all that are in the account in the people of God as priest eldest and other prophets speak against him of whom they notwithstanding belief that Gods spirit doth not forsaken them and that men ought to obey them see Deuteronomy 17.9,10 Malachi 2.7,8 John 7.48,49] come and let us smite him with the tongue [fall upon him with false witnesses and put him to death as false prophets other for the tongue sake that is for his grievous and intolerable prophesies] and let us not listen to any of his words.
\p
\v 19 . Lord listens to me and hearkens to the voice of my contenders [that is of them that contend with me of whom he complained above that they departed from him chapter 17.13.]
\p
\v 20 . Shall then evil be recommenced for good? [Is that befitting? Have deserved that faithfulness towards them? The prophet implieth ] for they have digged a pit for my soul [that is laid a plot take away my life ] remember that I stood before thy face to speak good for them [or for their good that is to pray for them so that thou wast fain to command me to make more intercessions in their behalf see above chapter see above chapter 7.16 an d14.13,21,22c] to turn away thy wrath from them
\p
\v 21 . Therefore deliver up their sons to the famine [compare this prayer with Psalm 69.23 c 109.6 c and see the annotate there ] and cause them to flow away [cause their strength to perish like water that is powered out or cause their blood to flow away compare 2Samuel 14.14 Psalms 22.15 and 63.11 Ezekiel 35.5] by the force of the sword [or means of the sword Hebr. Hands of the sword so Job 5.20 see there ] let their wives be bereaved of children and be widows [compare above chapter 15.7,8] and let their man be killed by death and their young men be slain with the sword [Hebr. The slain of the sword] in the battle.
\p
\v 22 . Let there be a cry heard from their houses when thou shalt bring [or shall have brought] a band [a company of plundering and destroying soldiers to wit the Babylonians] suddenly upon them because they digged a pit to take me [compare Psalm 7.16 and 9.16 and 35.7 and 57.7c] and hid snares for my feet [that is laid snares secretly to cause me to fall.]
\p
\v 23 . Yet thou Lord knowest all their counsel against me to death [tending to kill me] make an atonement for their iniquity [or do not graciously cover their iniquity compare Psalms 65.4 with the annotate] neither blot out their sin from below thy face that it should not remain before thee in remembrance and account to be punished] let them be cast down [Hebr. Let them be felled down ones or be thrust down ones so that they being brought to stumbling and falling may consequently be thrown down ] deal thus with them [or against them in the time of thine anger.

\s By the token of a potters pot which the prophet is commanded to break in the valley of the son of Hinnom doth God by the prophet shew first to the civil and ecclesiastical ruler and after to all the people in the temple a most horrible desolation of Jerusalem for the abomination which they committed in that valley and consequently every where.
\p
\v 1 Thus saith the Lord go thy ways and but potter’s pot [Hebr. Pot pitcher or bottle of a former potsherd or earthen vessel that is a bottle made by a potter’s oth. A potter earthen bottle so that the word that signifieth the potsherd or earthen vessel is added to the word pot or bottle and the word former alone as elsewhere is used for a potter the matter agreeing in both renderings the word rendered her pot is in the Hebrew Bukbuk which signifieth a pitcher bottle or any drinking or water bottle having its name from a hollow emptiness or from emptying see below verse 7 what this earthen pot signifieth see verse 10,11] and take unto thee unto the eldest of the people and of the eldest of the priest [see below verse 10.]
\p
\v 2 . And go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom [as above chapter 7.31 see 2Kings 23 on verse 10] which is before the door of the sun gate [so called according to the opinion of some because it was in the east of the court of the temple whereof below verse 14 see also Nehemiah 3.29 but others take rather that it was so called because it stood in the south towards the heat of the sun at noon day where the valley of the son of Hannom lay Hosea 15.8 ] and proclaim there the words that I shall speak unto thee:
\p
\v 3 . And say hear the word of the Lord ye Kings of Judah [that is king of Judah with the princes and rulers as some do understand this compare below chapter 46.25 otherwise it may be also applied to the present king and his successors unto the Babylonian captivity ] and the inhabitants of Jerusalem thus saith the Lord of hosts [ see 1Kings 18 on verse 15] the God of Israel behold I will bring evil [that is plague of misery mischief [upon this place at the which everyone that heareth it his ears shall tingle [see 2Kings 21 on verse 12 1Samuel 3.11 ]
\p
\v 4 . Because they have forsaken me [compare Isaiah 65.11 above chapter 2.13,17 and 5.7,19 and 15.6, & 17.13] and have estranged this place [from me dedicating it to other Gods and filling it with such abomination that I own it no more to be mine] and have burn incense in it unto other God which have not known they nor their fathers nor the kings of Judah and have filled this place with the blood of the innocent [compare above chapter 7.6.]
\p
\v 5 . For they have built the high places of Baal [a common surname of idols see Judges 2 on verse 11 which is here given also unto Moloch] to burn their sons with fire [see Leviticus 18 on verse 21] for burnt offerings unto Baal which I commanded not nor spake it neither came it into mine heart [see above chapter 7.31, 32.]
\p
\v 6 . Therefore behold the days come saith the Lord that the place shall no more be called Tophet or the valley of the son of Hannom but the valley of the son of murder [compare above chapter 7.32.]
\p
\v 7 . For I will frustrate [ Hebr. Make empty or empty as a bottle is emptied so that there is no more liquor in it ] the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem [ whereby they think to escape the force of Babylonians ]in this place [ the meaning is I will make them quiet and destitute and void of counsel I will bring all their counsels and consultations to naught this seemeth to have respect to the pitcher or bottle whereof above verse 2 and below verse 10 having its name from emptying ] and I will cause them to fall by the sword before the face of their enemies and by the hand of their enemies who seek their life see 2Samuel 4 on verse 8 so below verse 9] and I will give their dead bodies [Hebr. Dead body as often for meat unto fowls of heaven and to the beats of the earth. [As above chapter 15.3 and 16.4.]
\p
\v 8 . And I will make this city astonishment [see above chapter 18.16] and whistling whosoever passeth thereby shall be astonished and whistle at her plague
\p
\v 9 . And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters and they shall eat everyone the flesh of their neighbor in the siege and in the straightness wherewith their enemies and those that seek their soul shall straighten them [see Leviticus 26.28 Deuteronomy 28.53 Lamentations 4.10]
\p
\v 10 . Yet shalt thou break the pitcher [whereof above verse 1] before the eyes of the men that were with thee [see above verse 1 they are the words of Jeremiah]
\p
\v 11 . And shalt say unto them thus saith the Lord of host so will I break this people and this city like as one breaketh a potters vessel that can not be made whole [Hebr. Be healed cured] again they shall bury them in Tophet because there shall be no place else to bury [see above chapter 7.32.]
\p
\v 12 . Thus will I do unto this place saith the Lord to the inhabitants thereof and that to make this city as Tophet [an unclean the horrible place see the verse and above chapter 7 on verse 32.]
\p
\v 13 . And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the king of Judah shall be unclean as the places of Tophet with [oth. For or because of ] all the houses upon whose roofs [ because they were flat see Deuteronomy 22 on verse8 and below chapter 32.29]they have burnt incense unto the hosts of heaven [as above chapter 8.2] and have offered drink offerings unto strange gods[as above chapter 7.18]
\p
\v 14 . Now when Jeremiah came from Topheth wither the Lord hath sent him from the prophesy he stood [or he set himself went or stayed] in the court of the Lords house [that is the temple in whose court the congregation assembled and met together ] and said unto the people :
\p
\v 15 . Thus saith the Lord of hosts the Gods of Israel behold I will bring upon this city and upon his cities [that are under her as the metropolis or chief city of Juda ] all the evil[ as above verse 3]that I have pronounced against it because they have hardened their neck [see above chapter 7.26] that that they might not hear [that is obey] my words.
\c 20
\s For the former prophesy Jeremiah is smitten by Pashur the priest and put in prison verse1 2 being released he denounced against him his friends and all the people and God terrible judgments by the king of Babel 3. He complaineth unto the Lord of his sufferings grief and inward conflicts 7 he comforteth himself in Gods assurance and vengeance even unto rejoicing 11 he relateth how impatient he was 14c.
\p
\v 1 When Pashur[Heb. Paschihur] the son [ that is of prosperity ] of inner [upon whose family the sixteenth lot fell in the division of the priest see 1 Chronicles 24.14] the priest now this man was the appointed leader in the house of the Lord [or one appointed or ruler or leader c that is as some expound it the second after the high priest as Eleazar in his father Aarons life time was made overseer and ruler in the house of God Numbers 4.16] heard Jeremiah prophesy in the words
\p
\v 2 . Then Pasour smote the prophet Jeremiah [see 1 Kings 20 on verse 35] and he put him into prison [Heb. Properly as tending to the subversion or overthrow of the welfare of the offenders see further 2Chronicles 16 on verse 10 some conceive that this prison was so called because of the straightness or narrowness of the place wherein a man could scarce and turn himself about so below chapter 29.26] which is in the uppermost gate [Oth. High gate as 2Chronicles 23.20 compare below chapter 26 on verse 10 concerning this name uppermost or high gate there be divers opinion] of Benjamin [that is standing towards the land of Benjamin ] which is by the house of the Lord.
\p
\v 3 . But it came to pass on the next day that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of Prison then said Jeremiah unto him the Lord doth not call thy name Pashur but Migor-missabath[that is terror or fear round about for the reason that followeth.]
\p
\v 4 . For thy saith the Lord I make thee a terror to thy self [or I give thee over to terror and fear] and all thy lovers [or friends so verse 6 and elsewhere] they shall fall by the sword of thy enemies that thine eyes may behold it and I will give all Judah into the hand of the King of Babel who shall carry them away captive to Babel and shall smite [that is slay see Genesis 8 on verse 21] them with the sword.
\p
\v 5 . Also I will give the substance of this city and all the labor thereof [that is all that they gotten of their labor] and all the preciousness thereof and all the treasures of the kings of Judah I will give them into the hand of their enemies who shall spoil them and shall bring them to Babel [compare above chapter 15.13 and 17.3]
\p
\v 6 . And thou Pashur and all the inhabitants of thine house ye shall go into captivity and thou shalt come to Babel and die there and be buried there thou and all thy friends to whom thou hast prophesied falsely [Heb. In or with falsehood]
\p
\v 7 . Lord thou hast persuade me [or allured enticed moved me some understand this of his calling and of the charge that was given him compare above chapter 1.6,7 and see of the Hebrew word Judges 14.15 and compare below verse 10 the same word is used of the just judgment of God in persuading the false prophets Ezech.14.9 see there] and I was persuaded thou hast been too strong for me and hast prevailed [compare the phrase with verse 10] I am a derision all the day long everyone of them mocketh me.
\p
\v 8 . For since that I speak [prophesying to the people] I cry out I cry violence and destruction [compare Job 19.7 and the annotate there] because the word of the Lord is unto me a reproach and derision all the day long [compare Isaiah 57.4]
\p
\v 9 . Therefore I said [with myself that is I thought ] I would not remember him nor speak anymore in his name [that is mention the Lord no more make no more mention of the command ] but it was [to wit the Lords words or his command by the powerful working of the holy ghost or there was and c ] in mine heart as a burning fire [see such a comparison Job 32.18 Psalms 39.4] and I wearied myself to forbear but could not [or I was wearied with forbearing and could not to wit keep it longer to wit or resist the spirit of the Lord I was constrained to go on in ministry ]
\p
\v 10 . For I had the defaming [or railing evil reports] of many Mogor-missabib [see verse 3 this name may be taken for the leading man unto that whereof there is further spoken in this verse oth. Terror or fear surpriseth me round about they say] saying report it to us and we will report it [that is enquire after it and heed it well whatsoever ye hear of Jeremiah and acquaint us with it that we may acquaint our rulers both ecclesiastical and civil therewith that they may take counsel against him] all that are peace with me [Heb. All the men of my peace so below chapter 38.22 compare 2 Samuel 8 on verse 10 and Psalms 41 on verse 10] observe my halting [to see if I should anyway offend or stumble in my calling or course of life and that for it they might bring to ruin or cause me to suffer compare Psalms 35.15 and 38.18] they say peradventure he will be persuaded [suffer himself to be seduced by fair speeches for to contradict himself or to offend some other way and to give occasion and himself to ruin and destruction ] then we s hall prevail against him and take our revenge on him.
\p
\v 11 . But the Lord is with me as a terrible champion [compare above chapter 1.8,19 and 15.20] therefore my prosecutors shall stumble and prevail nothing [compare above chapter 17.18] they were greatly ashamed [it is spoken in the prophetical manner of the time to come for they shall be ashamed of the prophet by faith exceeding rejoiceth as appeareth verse 13 relating in the meanwhile how he was on the other side assaulted by the weakness of the flesh ] because they dealt not understandingly [compare above chapter 9.24 because they have not been or shall not be successful and prosperous because their plots will fail them ]it shall be an everlasting shame [or an everlasting shame as an abrupt kind of speech by way of admiration compare below chapter 23.40 ] it shall not be forgotten.
\p
\v 12 . Thou then O Lord of host [see 1Kings 18. on verse 15] that triest the righteous,[ compare above chapter 11.10 and 12.3] that seeist the reins and the heart [as above chapter 11.20 see there] let me see thy vengeance on them [compare above chapter 11.20 and 15.15 and 18.18] for I have discovered my cause unto thee [as to mine advocate and patrons .]
\p
\v 13 . Sing unto the Lord praise the Lord for he hath delivered the soul of the needy unto the hand of the evil doers.
\p
\v 14 . Cursed be the day wherein I was born let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed [compare this complaint through impatience with Job 3.3 and see the annotate there the prophet relateth here how impatient he was when all the world cursed and reproached him see above verse 8and chapter 15.10.]
\p
\v 15 cursed by the man who brought tidings to my father saying a young son [or man child or son] is born unto thee rejoicing him greatly [Heb rejoicing he rejoiced him]
\p
\v 16 . Yea let that man be as the cities that the Lord overthrew [this seemeth to have respect unto cities of Sodom Gomorra c Genesis 19] and it repented him not [Genesis 6 on verse 6] and let him hear a cry[a wailing of his fellow citizens or neighbor that are slain or are in danger of their lives as is wont to be made at the time of the enemies invasion ]in the morning [that is early unaware then he thinketh not of it compare Hosea 10.15] and a noise of noon tide [when they were wont to feast and to take rest.]
\p
\v 17 . Because he shew me not from the womb or because my mother was not my grave or her womb as of one that is everlastingly with a child [Heb. As one with a child of eternity that is continuing always with child and never bringing forth as if he had said why did it not happen thus wherefore hath the Lord not killed me as in the next verse].
\p
\v 18 Wherefore now am I come forth out of the womb to see [that is to experience see Job 7 on verse 7] trouble and sorrow? And that my days should perish in shame?
\c 21
\s King Zedekiah in the siege sendeth to enquire of Jeremiah whether there be any hope or comfort to be expected from God verse 1&c he is answered no but the quiet contrary 3. Yet God advirseth the people what is best for them 8. And giveth a lesson to the king’s house with a sharp threatening 11.
\p
\v 1 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord when king Zedekiah sent him Pashur the son of Malchia [of the prosperity of Malchia upon whose family the fifth Lot in the division of the priest in David time fell 1Chronicles 24.9as upon the family of Maasejah of whom is spoken in the words following four and twentieth lot fell 1 Chronicles 24.18] and Zephania the son of Maseja the priest saying;
\p
\v 2 . Enquire I pray thee of the Lord for us for Nebuchadnezzar [so below verse 7 and often by this prophet otherwise called Nebuchadnezzar] the king of Babel fighteth against us it may be the Lord will do with us according to all his wonders [as he hath hereto fore done so often for the protection and deliverance of his people] that he may march up from us [that Nebuchadnezzar may break up and leave the siege]
\p
\v 3 . Then said Jeremiah unto them thus shall ye say unto Zedekiah:
\p
\v 4 . Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel ; behold I will turn back the weapons of war [Heb. Instruments or furniture of war ]that are in your hand [that they shall be unprofitable yea hurtful for ye though ye think to defend yourselves by them and to beat back the Chaldeans as followeth ] wherewith ye fight against the King of Babel and against the Chaldeans that besiege ye without the wall and I will assemble them into the midst of the city [I will let the Babylonians or the Chaldeans come in or I will let them in or cause the city see of the Hebrew word rendered here assembling Judges 19 on verse 15.]
\p
\v 5 . And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm yea with anger and with wrath and with great indignation.
\p
\v 6 . And smite the inhabitants of this city both men and beasts [Heb. And the man and the beast] they shall die by great pestilence.
\p
\v 7 . And afterwards saith the Lord I will deliver Zedekiah the king of Judah and his servant and the people and those that are left from the city in pestilence from the sword and from the famine into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babel and into the hand of the enemies and into the hand of that seek of their soul [that is that hunt after their life see exodus 4 on verse 19 and 2Samuel 4.8] and he [the king of Babel] shall smite them with the edge of the sword ] he shall not spare them neither have pity nor have mercy.
\p
\v 8 . And unto this people thou shalt say thus saith the Lord behold I set before your face the way of life and the way of death.
\p
\v 9 . He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword or by famine nor by the pestilence but he that goeth out of it and falleth into the Chaldean [that is he that willingly surrendeth himself to them ]that besiege ye he shall live and his soul [that is life or person ] shall be unto him for a prey [that is he shall have his preservation for a prey which is fetched with hazards and danger of the enemies or falleth unaware into a mans hand for which he rejoiceth so below chapter 38.2 and 45.5]
\p
\v 10 . For I have set my face against this city [see Leviticus 17 on verse 10] for evil [for the punishment and destruction] and not for good [to do well unto them or to bless them] saith the Lord it shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babel and he shall burn it with fire.
\p
\v 11 . And concerning the house and king of Judah hear the word of the Lord
\p
\v 12 . O house of David thus saith the Lord judge judgment in the morning and deliver the spoilt out of the hand of the oppressor [that opposeth him by craft and violence ]left my wrath go forth like fire and burn that none can quench it because of the wickedness of your dealings.
\p
\v 13 . Behold I will be upon thee [or I am against thee that is be thine adversary I will oppose myself against thee so below chapter 23.30,31,32 Ezech .13.8,23 & 29.3 elsewhere this phrase is also taken in good sense or for good see Ezech 36.9] thou inhabitants of the valley [meaning the city of Jerusalem whereof the lowermost part lay in the low ground and the uppermost on the mount Zion where David city and tower was ] thou rock of the plain [where the temple stood on the plain of mount Morija or which the rock lay outwardly before a plain field as some understand this ]saith the Lord ye that say ye should come against us ? Or who should enter into your inhabitations.
\p
\v 14 . And I will visit ye [that is I will punish ye see Genesis 21 on verse 1] according to the fruit of [above chapter 17.10] saith the Lord and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof [ to wit of Jerusalem whereof in the former verse by the forest may be understood the fair buildings of the city that were built with wood that was hewn out of the forest of Libanon compare below chapter 22.7,23or the whole city of the country being full of people as a forest is full of trees compare Ezech 20.46 with the annotate there ] which shall consume all that is round about it [see 2Chronicles 36.19 below chapter 52.13.]
\c 22
\s God sendeth the prophet to the court to tell them there what they had to do if they were meant to prosper verse 1 c forasmuch as they practiced the contrary he threateneth the kings house and Jerusalem with utter ruin and destruction 6. A prophesy concerning Sallum 10 Jojakim 13 Chonia 24.
\p
\v 1 Thus saith the Lord go down to the house of Juda and speak there this word
\p
\v 2 . And say hear the word of the lord thou King of Judah that thou fittest upon the throne of David thou and thy servant and thy people that enter in by these gates.
\p
\v 3 . Thus saith the Lord do judgment and justice [see 1Kings 10 on verse 9] and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor [as above chapter 21.12] oppress not [or plague spoil not] the stranger the fatherless nor the widow [compare above chapter 7.6] do no violence [to them or to any man ] neither shed the innocent blood in this place.
\p
\v 4 . For if e shall do this thing [or this word] seriously [Heb doing shall do] then shall they enter in by the gates of his house Kings sitting upon the throne of David [that is David’s place] riding upon charets and upon horses he [the king that shall beat that time] and his servants and his people:
\p
\v 5 . On the contrary if ye not hear theses words I have seen by myself saith the Lord that this house shall become desolation.
\p
\v 6 . For thus saith the Lord concerning the house of the king of Judah thou art a Gilead unto me [that is so blessed by me with all things that are desirable and pleasant as that thou art like unto the land of Gilead see Genesis 37.25 or as some thou shalt be unto me &c that I will so little pity or spare thee as I have done Gilead see 2Kings 15.29] an height of Libanon [so exalted in honor and dignity as the top of Libanon or the highest cedar that has stand upon it Heb. Head] but if I make thee not as a wilderness and cities not inhabited [an abrupt kind of speech must be used in making oaths see Deuteronomy 1 on verse 35.]
\p
\v 7 . For I will hallow [that is separate ordain appoint prepare arm see Isaiah 13 on verse2 and compare above chapter 6 on verse 4] destroyers against thee everyone with his furniture they shall cut down thy choice of cedars [Heb. The choice of cedars is the sequel sheweth thy best and choiceth houses built of cedar-wood compare above chapter 21.14and below 14.15 and the phrase with Genesis 23.6] and cast them into the fire [or throw them down for the fire.]
\p
\v 8 . Then many heathen [or nations] shall pass by this city and shall say every man to his neighbor wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this great city ? [See Deuteronomy 29.24 1 Kings 9.8.]
\p
\v 9 . And they shall say [that is they shall answer] because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God and have bowed themselves down before other gods and served there.
\p
\v 10 . Weep not for the dead neither bemoan him [namely good king Josiah who lately died in the battle against pharaoh Nacho and was greatly lamented by the people 2Kings 23.29 2Chronicles 35.23,24 this king was taken away before the fearful desolations came as was foretold 2Kings 22.20] weep wholly [Heb. Weep weeping ] ] for him that is gone away [to wit Iobas whom Pharaoh Necho had carried away captive into Egypt 2Kings 23.33,24 where he also died some apply this to king Joachim who was afterwards carried away captive into Babel and died there 2Kings 24.15 and 25.29 as also Zedekiah 2 Kings 25.7 and render in the go away but the following words are to be heeded [for he shall never return to see the land of his nativity.
\p
\v 11 . For thus saith the Lord concerning Sallum the son of Josiah King of Judah [this Sallum is according to the opinion of some Joahas called also Jehoahas and Johanan the son of Josia see 2Kings 23.31 2Chronicles 36.1,2 compare 2Kings 15.13 and 23.31 in 1Chronicles 3.15 a forth son of Josiah is called by this name]who reigned instead of Josiah his father who went forth out of his place he shall never return thither again.
\p
\v 12 . But he shall die in the place wither they have carried him away captive and ye shall see this land no more.
\p
\v 13 . Wo unto him that builteth his house up righteousness [Heb. But not righteousness that is by no righteousness or without righteousness or ah or thou buildest &c this as also that which hath followeth hath respect to King Jojakim see below verse 18who was changed with pride excess injustice covetousness and tyranny] and his upper rooms by wrong [Heb. By not right]that useth his neighbors service [or serveth himself of his neighbor making use of his neighbor or that compelleth him to serve him compare below chapter 25.14 and 27.7 and 30.8 and 34.9] for naught and giveth him his wages [Heb properly work or labor that is wages work as Numbers 22.7 divinations or prediction for the wages with them see further Leviticus 19.13 Isaiah 49.4 Ezech 29.20.]
\p
\v 14 . That saith I will built me a very high house [Heb. An house of measures that is exceedingly above measures high or great compare Numbers 13.32] and transparent upper rooms[ wherein a man can have light and air enough and where the wind may blow through that is large lightsome ] and he heweth him out windows and it is covered with cedar [his house is everywhere ceiled and floored with cedar beams and planks ]and painted[ Heb anointed or anointing that is he caused it to be painted colors or pictures ]with red lead [or vermilion or purple blue some conceive that is properly indigo which is made of an Indian weed or some do ride growing Indian reed and is called Hebrew Scharschar from people in the Idies called Safuri from whence it may come the meaning is that he beatified his house with all kind of foreign rare and precious colors and pictures compare Ezech 23.14 where the very same Hebrew word is found oth. That retrench out from thence for himself my windows and which is ceiled with cedar and painteth with vermilion 7c meaning that Jojakim caused to be broke off from Gods house to accommodate his own building as much as he pleased causing it afterwards to be painted over with all manner of colors as that it could not be perceived. ]
\p
\v 15 . Shouldest thou reign [that is make thy kingdom strong and lasting against the threatening of God] because thou minglest thyself with cedar? [That is because thy strivest to surpass thy father in stateliness and bravery by cedar buildings] did not thy father [good King Josia as below verse 18] eat and drink [that is live quietly at ease and cheerfully see Ecclesiastic 3.13] and do judgment and justice [as above verse 3] and then it went well with him? [Heb. Then it was good or well to him so in the sequel compare Isaiah 3.10,11 where the Hebrew words signifying good and evil are likewise so used for faring well and ill.]
\p
\v 16 . He judged the cause of miserable and the needy then it went well with him in not that to know me [that is an evidence and true knowledge of me]saith the Lord?
\p
\v 17 . But thine eyes and thine heart are not but upon thy covetousness [or thy gain] and upon innocent blood is shed that an upon oppression and violence [Heb. Running as 2Samuel 18.27 and consequently running upon understand it of violence assault trampling down bruising in pieces as here] to do them.
\p
\v 18 . therefore thus saith the Lord concerning Jojakim the son of Josiah the King of Judah they shall not bemoan him [or lament for his death [see Genesis 23on verse 2 and of Jojakins father 2Chronicles 35.24, 25] ah my brother or ah sister [these are forms usual in lamenting for the dead] they shall not bemoan him ah Lord or ah his majesty!
\p
\v 19 . He shall be buried with the burial of an ass [that is he shall be cast away unburied as an ass carcass] they shall drag him and cast him forth far from the gates of Jerusalem [without his land in Babel or by the way when he was carried to Babel compare 2Kings 24 on verse 6 and 2Chronicles 36 on verse 6 below chapter 36.30.]
\p
\v 20 . Go up to Libanon [thou daughter of my people that is the people of Judah] and cry[ to the Assyrians for help this is spoken ironically as followeth ] and lift up [Heb. Give ] thy voice in Basan [these mountains Libanon and Basan lay in north and north-east of Canaan towards Assyria ] cry also from the ferries [or passages [to wit of the rivers which they were to pass over for to go into Egypt that the Egyptians may come and help ye Hebrews Abarim which some take to be the mountain of Abarim whereof mention is made Numbers 33 on verse 47] but also thy lovers are broken [see above chapter 4 on verse 6] as if the Lord should say it is in vain for both the Assyrians and the Egyptians are subdued destroyed and made impotent by the king of Babel compare above chapter 2.36 Ezech 16.26,28and 23.7,8.]
\p
\v 21 . I spake unto thee in thy great prosperity or quietness that is I gave thee warning when thou wast yet in prosperity] but thou sayest I will not hear [compare above chapter 5.23 and 7.23,24,25,26,27,28 and 11.7,8 and 13.10,11 and 16.12 and 17.23 and 18, 12 and 19.15] this is thy way [that is manner of doing see Genesis 6 on verse 12] from thy youth [ever since I took ye that to be my people and gave ye my laws] that thou obeyest not my voice.
\p
\v 22 . The wind shall feed all the pastors [that is all thy spiritual rulers shall be confounded in their vain imaginations counsel and hopes which shall no more strengthen them then when a man thinketh to live by the wind compare Ecclesiastes on verse 14 Hosea 12.2 oth. eat up that is they shall vanish away like smoke without wind ] and thy lovers [priest and false prophets with whom thou hast committed fornication ] shall go into captivity then shalt thou surely be ashamed and confounded because of all thy wickedness.
\p
\v 23 . Oh thou that dwellest in Libanon [that is thou that art stately and takest pride in thy buildings of cedar which thou fetchest from Libanon this seemeth principally to look at the kings house whereof in the sequel] and makest thy nest in the cedars how favored shalt thou be when pangs are come upon thee yea pain as of a woman in travel [as if the Lord should say no mercy or favor at all shall be shewed thee by the Babylonians but clean contrary as followeth : [oth. How gracious or acceptable shalt thou be or how wilt thou supplicate?]
\p
\v 24 . As true as I live saith the Lord though Chonia [Heb. Chonjahu called also Jechonia 1Chronicles 3.16 and Jojachim 2Kings 24.6,8] the son of Jojakim king of Judah were a seal-ring upon my right hand [that is never so lowly and comely a young men beautified and crowned by me with sundry blessings and benefits and of the seed of David wherefore they conceive that the succession would be undoubted and that they had no cause to fear any danger from Babel see the like phrase cant 8.6 Haggai 2.23] yet would I pluck thee from thence [this may be understood of Gods right hand or of Jerusalem from the kings court and from Judah in regard of his carrying away to Babel as followeth here god speaketh of Chonia himself .]
\p
\v 25 . And I will give thee into them that seek thy soul [seek to take away thy life as often ] and into the hand of them of whose face thou art afraid namely into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel and into the hand of Chaldeans.
\p
\v 26 . And I will cast thee out and thy mother that bare thee into another land where ye were not born and there shall ye shall die.
\p
\v 27 . And to the land whereunto their soul longeth [Heb. They lift up their soul that is whereunto they have a desire mind longing see deuteronomy24 on verse 15 return and Psalms 24 on verse 4 see below chapter 44.14] to return thither shall they not return .
\p
\v 28 . Is then this man Chonia a despised scattered idolatrous image ?[or image that is despised and ought to be bitten in pieces so that the people are scattered abroad of the Hebrew word signifying an idol or idolatrous image see 1 Samuel 31 on verse 9 and 2 Samuel 5 on verse 21 that which is said here and in the following words is expounded by way of question as it were in the name of the people whereby the answer of God followeth it appeareth that he was much esteemed by reason of his comeliness]or is he a vessel wherein man have no pleasure ?[or wherein is no pleasant thing compare peter chapter 48.38 Hosea 8.8]wherefore are he and his seed [that is children which he might get or hath had as some do conclude from Matthew 1.12 though they succeeded him not in the kingdom as appeareth below verse 30 ]cast out ? Yea cast away into a land which they knew not?
\p
\v 29 . O land, land, land! Hear the word of the Lord.
\p
\v 30 . Thus saith the Lord write [set it down as a remembrance as a sure and irrevocable decree of the God ]this same man [Chonia ] childless [Heb. Quiet bereaved or the most bereaved to wit of posterity or successors as some or as others of the land and goods instead that they imagined that his seed should reign forever see hereof 1Chronicles 3 on verse 16 the words of the verse are gods answer to the former question f the people ]a man that shall not be prosperous in his days for there shall none of his seed be prosperous sitting upon the throne of David and ruling anymore in Judah some are of opinion that after the Babylonian captivity not Solomons but Nathans Solomon’s brother posterity had the government others conceive that Salathiel was his own true son by birth but that Zerrubabel that succeeded him after the Babylonian captivity was no more as a prince or governor as appeareth Haggai 1.1 and in the book of Ezra and no ways a king sitting upon the throne of David.]

\s A prophesy against wicked pastors with a promise concerning the gathering and restoring of the flock of God by Christ our righteousness verse1 c. a large prophesy against false prophets and dreamers with faithful admonition and fore threatening 9 against those that mocked at Jeremiah and at the charge of the Lord 33.
\p
\v 1 Wo unto the pastors that slay [or destroy cause to perish spoil bring to destruction] and scatter the sheep of my pasture saith the Lord [compare this prophesy with Ezech 34.]
\p
\v 2 . Therefore thus saith the Lord the God of Israel concerning the pastors that feed my people ye have scattered my sheep and have driven them away and have visited them [not looked to them not regarded their prosperity] behold I will visit [that is punish see Genesis 21 on verse1] upon ye the wickedness of your dealings saith the Lord .
\p
\v 3 . And I myself will gather the remnant of my sheep out of all countries wither I have driven [as I will gather my people out of Babel and afterwards which is chiefest of all and is typified by the former my church both out of Jews and Gentiles by the Messiah who shall make of both one sheep fold see Job 10.16] and I will bring them again to their folds [Heb. Dwelling folds] and they shall be fruitful and multiply .
\p
\v 4 . And I will raise up [or appoint set ] shepherds over them which shall feed them [see Ezech. 34.11,12] and they shall fear no more nor be afraid neither be lacking [that is none of them shall be wanting oth. Be visited that is be punished be plagued as above verse 2] saith the Lord.
\p
\v 5 . Behold the days come saith the Lord that I will raise until David a special SPROUT [or sprouting shooting namely the Messiahs our Lord Jesus Christ who being God eternal and only begotten son in the fullness of time and wonderful and incomprehensible working of Holy Ghost took our nature upon him sprout forth from the virgin Mary who was of the house of David as a new sprig from a stem stock or trunk which seemed to be quiet withered or dead compare Isaiah 4.2 and 11.1 and see below chapter 33 .15 Zach3.8 and 6.12 Hebrews 7.14 where a Greek word is used which is properly and for the most part answereth to the going up rising up or springing up of the sun but is used by the Greek translators here and elsewhere for the rendering of the word sprout as it is also retained by the evangelists Luke ,Luke 1.7,8 when Zacharias calleth the Lord Christ the day spring on the high so do we like wise use this word going up coming up rising not only of the sun and stars but also of herbs and fruits on the ground : whereunto the Hebrew word Tsechmach sprout or spring properly hath respect hath respect although the Greek word Luke 1.7,8 they seemeth to have respect to the rising of the sun in the east as some gather from verse 79 he is called righteous being without sin and unspotted holy and righteous yea our righteousness as followeth which God hath caused abundantly to bud and blossom as it were in him for us ] he the same being King [the same phrase is below chapter 37.1 see the annotate there and compare Hosea 3.4,5] shall reign and be prosperous and do judgment and justice in the earth.
\p
\v 6 . In his days [in Lord Christ days that is in the time of the New Testament see acts 3.24] Juda shall be delivered and Israel shall dwell safely [being justified by faith and consequently having peace with God through the Lord Jesus Christ Romans 5.1 understand by Judah and Israel the church of God called Jerusalem below chapter 33.15 and the people of Jesus Christ Matthew 1.21] and this shall be his name whereby men shall call him [Hebr. He shall c. that is men shall call him or shall be called as elsewhere often to wit by his people as the following word our sheweth ] THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUNESS [compare Deuteronomy 11 on verse 16 and Judges 6 on verse 24 and further 1Corinthians 1.30 and Daniel 9.24 also chapter 33.16 Hebr. Jehovah Tziidkenu: which by some translators is so put in the text as proper name. ]
\p
\v 7 . Therefore behold the days come saith the Lord that they shall say no more as true as the Lord liveth that brought up the children of Israel of the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 8 . but as true as the Lord liveth that brought up the true seed off Israel and led them out of the Land of the North [see above chapter 16.14,15 and the annotate there] and from lands wither I [that is the Lord] hath driven them for shall dwell in their own land .
\p
\v 9 . As touching the prophets mine heart in my inmost parts is broken [for grief and disquietness compare Psalms 51. on verse 19or mine heart c is broken because of the prophets these are the words of the prophets ] all my bones quake I am like a drunken man and like a man whom wine overcometh [so that he can not use his understanding or memory rightly ] because of the Lord and because of the word of his holiness [that is his holy words which the false prophets despise and esteem as prophets and esteem as lies.]
\p
\v 10 . For the land is full of adulterers[ see above verse 5,7,8and c 9.2] for the land mourneth because of the curse [or cursing it may be applied either to the curse of God upon the land or to the cursing and false swearing of the inhabitants see chapter 5.2 and 12.4 and the like use of the Hebrew word Hosea 4.2 ] the pastures of the wilderness wither because their course [that is their manner of life the course of their dealings or their violence see of the Hebrew word above chapter 22 on verse 17] is evil and their power not right [they abuse it to mere wrong.]
\p
\v 11 . For both prophets and priests [Heb. Also prophets also priest] are hypocrites [or are unholy profane dealing hypocritically compare above chapter 6.13 and d8.10 and 14.18] even in mine house do I find their wickedness saith the Lord.
\p
\v 12 . Therefore their way hall unto them as smooth places [Heb. Slipperiness see Psalms 35.6 and 73.18] in the darkness they shall be driven on and fall therein [in the darkness] for I will bring evil [evil of punishment mischief misery] upon them in the year of the visitation [as above chapter 11.23] saith the Lord.
\p
\v 13 . I have indeed seen absurdity [Heb. Properly unsavouriness that is absurd foolish things see Job 1.22 with the annotate] in the prophets of Samaria that prophesied by [or from of] Baal and seduced my people Israel [that is the ten tribes.]
\p
\v 14 . but in the prophets of Jerusalem abominableness [as above chapter 5.30 ] they commit adultery and converse with falsehood [Heb walk in or with falsehood ] and strengthen the hands of the evil doers [encourage hem promising them God blessing and peace see below verse 17 and compare Ezech 13.22 ]that they should not return every one from the wickedness they are all unto me as Sodom [that is the inhabitants of Sodom were formerly to wit exceeding wicked compare Isaiah 1.9] and the inhabitants thereof [of Jerusalem ]as Gomorra [that is the inhabitants of Gomorra. ]
\p
\v 15 . Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts [see 1Kings 18 on verse 15] concerning the prophets but behold I will feed them with wormwood [as above chapter 9.15 see there] and make them drink the water to gall [as above chapter 8.14 and 9.15] for from prophets of Jerusalem is hypocrisy [or ungodliness profaneness] gone forth into all lands.
\p
\v 16 . Thus saith the Lord of hosts hearken not unto the word of prophets that they prophesy unto ye they make ye vain [deceiving ye by vain promise so that ye shall be deceived in the end when so ever ye rely on them compare Psalms 62 on verse 11] they speak the vision of their own heart not out of the mouth of the Lord [the vision which themselves have invented or devised and have not received it of me compare Ezech 13.2.]
\p
\v 17 . They say still [Heb. They area saying] unto them that slander me [or reproachfully despise me provoke me] the Lord hath spoken it ye shall have peace: [it shall go well with ye] and they say to everyone that walketh after the opinion of his own heart no evil shall come upon ye.
\p
\v 18 . For who hath stood in the counsel of the Lord:[who else but we they will say compare verse 22 or they will say that none can know God secret counsel and consequently neither Jeremiah thus wickedly mocking at Gods faithful warnings which God gave them by his prophet some understand here the assembly of the holy angels with whom God is said as it were to take counsel 1Kings 22.19 c] and seen or heard his word ?[seen that is perceived or to whom that is was is revealed in the prophetical vision ? Compare Amos 1.1 Mich1.1] who hath marked his word and heard it?
\p
\v 19 . Behold a tempest of the lord a fierce wrath is gone forth yea a painful [or smarting for grievous also appearing compare below chapter 30.23] tempest it shall upon the head of the wicked [compare 2Samuel 3.29 oth. It shall fall grievously &c.]
\p
\v 20 . The anger of the Lord shall not b turned away until he shall have done and till shall have set there the thought of the hearts in the last days [in the time to come as Genesis 49.1 when these prophesies shall be fulfilled which ye now deride] ye shall consider it with understanding [or get understanding of it Oth. Ye shall plainly understand it compare below chapter 30.24.]
\p
\v 21 . I have not sent those prophets yet they run I have not spoken to them yet they prophesied [compare above chapter 14.14.]
\p
\v 22 . But if they had stood in my counsel [whereof above verse18] then they have caused my people to hear my word and should have turn them away from their evil way [see genesis 6 on verse 12] and from the wickedness of their dealings.
\p
\v 23 . Am a God at hand saith the Lord? and not a God a far off ?[by no means will the Lord say but I am both a God at hand afar off this is cleared that which followeth .]
\p
\v 24 . Should any man hide himself in hidden places that I should not see him saith the Lord? Do not I fill heaven and earth saith the Lord? [Compare Psalms 139.7&c Amos 9.2, 3.]
\p
\v 25 . I have heard what he prophets say that prophesy lie in my name saying I have dreamed I have dreamed [God hath revealed this or that thing unto me in a dream see Numbers 12.6 and Genesis 20 on verse 3 and 28 on verse 12.]
\p
\v 26 . How long? [Shall they speak thus and deceive my people] is there then a dream [meaning a divine dream this word is here inserted from the former and following words] in the hearts of the prophets that prophesy lies? Yea they are prophets of deceit of their own hearts.
\p
\v 27 . Which think to cause my people to forget my name [which design and practice they may bring my people to a wicked neglect and ignorance of me my word will and works compare Judges 3.7 and 8.33] by their dreams which they tell everyman to his neighbor like as their father have forgotten my name by Baal?
\p
\v 28 . The prophet with whom there is a dream [to wit a divine dream sent by me] let him tell the dream [shall tell and expound it as his own fiction and invention not as being come from God] and with whom my word is let him speak my word truly [or faithfully Heb. Properly in or with truth or faithfulness] what hath the straw to do with the corn saith the Lord? [What fellowship has false doctrines or means inventions which cannot profit with my saving word and truth? see the phrase 2Samuel 16.10&c.]
\p
\v 29 . Is not my word so like a fire saith the Lord? And like a hammer that beateth a rock all to shivers? [that beateth it so in pieces are scattered or that the rock is scattered like dust or powder whereof the signification of the Hebrew word hath respect compare above chapter 22 on verse 28 and below chapter 51 on verse 19 with the annotate.]
\p
\v 30 . Therefore behold I will be upon the prophets [as above chapter 21. 13 ] saith the Lord that steal my words everyone from his neighbor [or companion that is that secretly or by stealth combine together and teach one another that they shall propound unto the people as my word and in my name or which know full well that the true prophesies are my word and yet deny it before the people and keep it down thus stealing my words out of heart of men and depriving them of the good opinion that they might have thereof that it might be set at naught and neglected some conceive that this hath respect to the chasteness of the false prophets that stole some words and phrases which the true prophets were wont to use in their prophecies from them and for a cloak or covering of their deceit used the same the same in their false prophesies and so like apes imitated the true prophets whereof in the sequel. ]
\p
\v 31 . Behold I will be upon the prophets saith the Lord that take their tongue [that is abuse their tongue presumptuously hereunto or catch with their tongue that is ensnare and entice man by sweet flattering words boldly and falsely saying as followeth that it is my word that is their own device and invention ] and say he hath spoken it [that is the Lord hath has spoken it just as the true prophet with and in the relation of the words of God were wont very often to use these words speaketh or saith the Lord Heb properly the saith or spoken of the Lord in Matthew 22.44out of Psalms 110.1 it is said there according as it is said here hath said or spoken or spake in these words the Lord hath said or spoken unto my Lord where this word is also used in the Hebrew text.]
\p
\v 32 . Behold I will be upon that prophesy false dreams [Heb. Dreams of false hood or of lying dreams] saith the Lord and do tell them and seduce my people by their lies and by their lightness whereas I sent them not nor commanded them neither do they profit these people at all [Heb profiting do not profit] saith the Lord.
\p
\v 33 When this people then when a prophet or priest shall ask thee [to wit in a dividing way and not out of a holy care or desire] saying what is the burden of the Lord? [So were the prophesies called that contained Gods threatening judgments and plagues see 2Kings 9 on verse 25&c as if they have laid hast thou again some mischief in thine head? Hast thou nothing else to prophesy but misery and calamity? ] thou shalt then say unto them what burden? That I will forsake you, [As below verse 39.] saith the Lord.
\p
\v 34 And as for the prophet, or the priest, or the people, [That is, those of the people, that, &c] that shall say, The burden of the Lord [calling the word of the lord so out were mockery wickedness and perverseness as if there were no faithful instruction and bounding comfort in the word of the Lord God but mere threatening curses and plagues to make men desperate] that I will visit [by punishment see Genesis 21 on verse 1] that man and his house.
\p
\v 35 . Thus shall ye say [in godly zeal and humility enquiring about the word of the Lord] everyone of his neighbor and everyone of his brother what hath the Lord answered and what hath the Lord spoken?
\p
\v 36 . But the burden of the Lord shall ye remember no more [that is mention no more have such words no more in your mouth as ye have daily in a mocking a deriding way] for every man own word shall be burden to him [by this mocking and persevering of the word of God he will bring a curse and destruction upon himself as surely as if an express prophesy were prophesied against him] because ye pervert the words of the living God of the Lord of host of our God.
\p
\v 37 . Thus shalt thou say to the prophet [to the true prophet as Jeremiah was] what hath the Lord answered thee? And what hath the Lord spoken ?
\p
\v 38 . But sith ye say the burden of the Lord [or will ye then still say the burden of the Lord? Do ye still continue as obstinate as ye were not caring for all the warnings and threatening that have been tendered to you?] Therefore thus saith the Lord because ye say this word the burden of the Lord whereas I sent to you saying ye shall not say the burden of the Lord.
\p
\v 39 . Therefore behold I will also utterly forget [Heb. Forgetting forget] ye and let ye go [or let ye depart such signification of the Hebrew word is common and frequent in scripture Oth. By changing of a letter in the Hebrew pluck you out or away roll you out] from my face together with the city that I gave to ye and my father.
\p
\v 40 . And I will bring upon ye [or lay upon ye] everlasting reproach [Heb. Reproach of eternity and so in the sequel] and everlasting shame which shall not be forgotten [so above chapter 20.11.]
\c 24
\s God sheweth Jeremiah two baskets of figs the one with very good and the other with very naughty figs verse 1 he instructeth him thereby concerning the mercy which he would shew to some captives and the judgments which he will bring upon the rest ,4,5.
\p
\v 1 The Lord causeth me to see [to wit a vision or in a vision such things as follows compare above chapter 11 verse 18 and see Genesis 15 on verse 1and 46 on verse 2 Amos 7.1,4,7 and 8.1] and behold there were two baskets of figs set before the temple of the Lord after that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel had carried away captive Jechonia [see above chapter 22.24] the son of Jesia king of Judah together with the princes of Judah the carpenters and the smiths [Heb. The carpenters or workmen signifying both carpenters and smiths and the smiths or properly the lock-maker oth. Porter also rich merchants he that locketh up many wares, or lock up setteth them to sake so 2Kings 24.16 and below chapter 29.2 ] from Jerusalem and had brought them to Babel.
\p
\v 2 . In one basket were very good figs as the first ripe figs are :[Compare Mich.7.1.with the annotate ]but in the other basket were very naughty figs ,which by reason of their naughtinesse could not be eaten.
\p
\v 3 . And the LORD said unto me ;seest thou , Jeremiah? And l said, figs :the good figs are very good ,and the naughty are very naughty, which cannot be eaten by reason of their naughtiness.
\p
\v 4 . Then came the word of the LORD unto me ,saying :
\p
\v 5 .Thus saith the LORD the God of Israel; Like those good figs :[Some supply these words thus :As these figs are good :or as thou knowest these good figs &.vers8.] so will l know [esteem them as gracious and acceptable ,take care of them. See Psalms 1: vers6.] them that are carried away captive of Judah;[Hebrew .the captive carried away ,leading away ,as elsewhere often ] whom l have sent away out of these place to the land of Chaldeans, for good . [These words for good , may in a good fence be joined to the word known , or to the word sent away :for God knoweth his for their good ; and he had sent away and hastened those that were his [whom he had among the captives ]for their good, as intending to restore again and build up his church out them, as followeth]
\p
\v 6 . And l will set my eyes upon them for good ,[Compare 1Kings 8.vers.29. and Psalms.32.vers.8.also below chapter.39.12.and 40.4.As on the contrary to set eyes against a man, is taken in a bad sense. see Amos.9.4.The phrase in the Hebrew is alike ,but is expounded by that which is joined with it :and the Hebrew particle signisieth upon ,over and also against according to the nature and quality of the thing] and will bring them again into this land :[Compare above chapter 16.15. ] and l will bring them , [Compare Psalms 28.vers.5.] and not break them down ;and plant them ,and not pluck them up.
\p
\v 7 .And l will give them a heart to know me ,that l am the LORD :[Compare Deut.30.6. Ezekiel .11.19. and 36.26.27.]and they shall be a people unto me ,[See Levit.26.vers .12.] and l will be God unto them [see Genesis .17.vers .7 compare below chapter .30.22.and31.33.and32.38.] for they shall return unto me with their whole heart .
\p
\v 8 .And as the naughty figs , which by the reason of their naughtiness can not be eaten ;[for surely thus saith the LORD ]so l will make [Or appoint order oth. Deliver up and the next verse begins thus I will say deliver them &c compare below chapter 29.17] Zedekiah king of Judah together with his princes and the remnant of Jerusalem that remain in this land and them that dwell in the land of Egypt [that is them that shall dwell there at that time. See 2Kings 25.26 and below chapter 43.44.]
\p
\v 9 . And I will deliver them up [or appoint make &c ]for a commotion of evil until all the kingdoms of the earth [see above chapter 15.4 Deuteronomy 28 on verse 25] for a reproach and for a proverb for a taunt and for a curse in all places wither is shall have driven them.
\p
\v 10 . And I will send the sword the famine and the pestilence among them till they shall be consumed out of the land which I had given unto them and their fathers.
\c 25
\s The prophet by Gods command setteth before the eyes of the people his own other prophets constant and continual ministry in exhorting them to repentance and on the contrary on their continual disobedience verse1 &c wherefore God will plague them as also other nations by the king of Babel with seventy years bondage 8. but then he will also recompense the king of Babel according to his deserts and according to his prophesies 12 a confirmation of these prophesies by a vision concerning the cup of Gods wrath of which the nations must by turn drink round 15. a representation of the terribleness of these judgments 30.
\p
\v 1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the forty year of Jojakim the son of Josiah king of Judah that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel.
\p
\v 2 . Which [word of the Lord] Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all people of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem saying:
\p
\v 3 . From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon the king of Judah unto this day this is the three and twentieth year [or hese three and twenty years ] the word of the Lord hath come unto me and I have spoken unto ye being up early and speaking [that is very diligently seasonable and constantly compare above chapter 7 on verse 13 and here the next verse] but ye have not hearkened [ that is obeyed as also in the sequel and elsewhere often.]
\p
\v 4 . Also the Lord hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets being up early and sending [ compare above chapter 7 on verse 13] but yet have not hearkened nor inclined your ear to hear [compare above chapter 11.7,8,10 and 13.10,11 and 16.12 and 17.23 and 18.12,19,15 and 22.21.]
\p
\v 5 . Saying turn again now everyone from his evil way [see Genesis 6 on verse 12 2Kings 17.13 Jeremiah 18.11 and 35.15 Jonah 3.8] and from the wickedness of your dealings and dwell [that is then ye shall surely dwell I will make that ye c see Psalms 37 on verse 3] in the land which the Lord hath given unto ye and your fathers from age to age .
\p
\v 6 . And walk not after other Gods to serve them and to bow down yourselves before them and provoke not your anger by the work of your hand that I may not do ye evil [meaning the evil of punishment that is that I may not send mischief and calamity upon you as often .]
\p
\v 7 . But ye have not hearkened unto me saith the Lord that ye may provoke me to anger by the works of your hands to your own hurt.
\p
\v 8 . Therefore thus saith the Lord of host because ye have not heard my words.
\p
\v 9 . Behold I will send and take all the families of the North [that is all nations that dwell north-wards compare above chapter 1.15 the meaning is I will by my secret divine providence cause them to gather together themselves and to come up as if they came upon express order and command compare below chapter 49.14] saith the Lord unto Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babel [namely shall I send as the former words exprest or Nebuchadnezzar &c to wit will I take c] my servants [whom I am resolved to make use for the executing of my judgments upon my nations compare Isaiah 44.28 and 45.1 so below chapter 27.6 and 43.10 compare also below chapter 29.4,7,14,20 and 51.7] and I will bring them upon [or against and so in the sequel ] this land and upon inhabitants thereof and upon these nations all round about and I will ban them[see Deuteronomy on verse 34] and make them an astonishment [or terror oth. Desolation see above chapter 18.16 and below verse 18] and a whistling [as above chapter 19.8] and everlasting desolation[Heb. Desolations of eternity that is long lasting desolations .]
\p
\v 10 . And I will cause to perish from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness and the voice of bridegroom and the voice of the bride [as above chapter 7.34 compare also Isaiah 24.7 and above chapter 16.9 Ezech 26.13] the sound of the mills [ or mill stones meaning of the hand-mills which is so great and populous a city were many in number see Exodus 11 on verse 5 and Deuteronomy 24 on verse 6 likewise Revelations 18.22 the meaning is that God will take away all accommodation of lively hood ] and the light of the lamp [or candle whereby maybe understood that God will cause their feasts and banquets which they kept late in the night by great lamp light or candle and torch light to cease or simple that they should be no more night watches in respect whereof there was wont to be light all the night long in so great a city or in general that there should be no more prosperity joy nor comfort as the same is understood in scripture by darkness and want of light.]
\p
\v 11 . And this whole land shall become a desolation astonishment [or unto astonishing or affliction so verse 18] and these nation shall serve the king of Babel seventy years.
\p
\v 12 . But it shall come to pass when the seventy years are accomplished then will I visit upon the king of Babel and the upon all nations saith the Lord like the iniquity as likewise upon the land of Chastens ] everlasting desolation [Heb. Desolation of eternity .]
\p
\v 13 . And I will bring upon that land all my words which have spoken over it all over that is written in this book which Jeremiah prophesied against all nations.
\p
\v 14 . For of them shall cause them to be served those that are also mighty nations and great kings;[ Heb. Have saved themselves that is shall assuredly cause themselves to be served of them using them as slaves and bond-men the meaning is as the Chaldeans and the Babylonians have subdued other great nations and kings and have compelled them to be slaves or bond-men so shall it be don to them by such nations and king that are mighty and great as well as they to wit the Persians and Medes see the same phrase above chapter 22 on verse 13 and below chapter 27.7 and 30.8 Exodus. 34.27c.] thus will I recompense them according to their doing and according to the works of their hands .
\p
\v 15 . For thus saith the Lord the God of Israel unto me [in a vision ] take this cup of wine in indignation at mine hand and give to all the nations to whom I send thee to drink it [or the cup of wine of this indignations &c whereby were typified Gods wrath judgment and plagues which he had prepared for these nations and intended to bring upon them with a command to Jeremiah to shew and declare openly all these things unto them to the honor of God instruction and admonition of his people and conviction of the wicked compare Psalms 75.9 Isaiah 51.17 Revelations 16.19.]
\p
\v 16 . That they may drink and tremble and be made because of the sword [that is war with all bitter consequents thereof compare Psalms 22 on verse 21 so below verse 27.29 ] that I will send among them.
\p
\v 17 . And I took the cup at the Lords hand and I gave drink to all the nations unto whom the Lord had sent to me :
\p
\v 18 . Namely to Jerusalem and to the cities of Judah and their kings and to their princes and to make them their desolations [as above verse 9.11] a whistling and a curse as it as this day [compare Deuteronomy 4.20 ,38.18 1Kings 8.24 hence it is gathered by some that Jeremiah wrote this at the time of accomplishment of this prophesy oth. As if it were this day that is it shall be as surely come to pass if as we now beheld with it our eyes the attentive reader may also compare 2Chronicles 29.8]
\p
\v 19 . To Pharaoh [see Genesis 12 on verse 15 and be low chapter 46] the king of Egypt and his servants and his princes and to all his people.

And to all the mingled heap [some understand hereby a mixture of all sorts of nations dwelling among one another without distinction or limitation of all city or particular borders so verse 24] and to all the kings of the land of Uz [see Job 1 on verse 1 and Genesis 10 on verse 10] and to all kings [meaning petty kings princes governors deputies lieutenants compare below verse47. 4 c and see Judges 3 on verse 3] of the line of Philistine Ashkelon and Gaza [cities of philistine known in scripture ] the remnant of Ashdod [because a great part was already wasted & destroyed by long lasting siege of Psammeticus king of Egypt who was the father of Pharaoh Necho as some histories mention see of Ashdod 1 Samuel 5 on verse 1.]
\p
\v 21 . To Edom [see below chapter 49.27c] and to Moab [see below chapter 48] and to the children of Amon [see blow chapter 49.1c.]
\p
\v 22 . And to all the king of Tyrus [successively one after another and to all rulers princes governors and exceeding rich and wealthy merchants and inhabitants that carried themselves like kings see Isaiah 23.8 and below chapter 47.4 and likewise Josiah 19 on verse 29] and to all the kings of Zidon and to the kings of isles that are beyond the sea [Heb. For the isle &c see Psalms 72 on verse 10 oth. The country that is by the seashore compare below chapter 49.23]
\p
\v 23 . To Dedan and to Thema [people of the stony Arabia descended from Kethura see Genesis 25.3,15 Isaiah 21.13 of another Dedan descended from Cham by cusch in rich Arabia or Ethiopia see Genesis 10 on verse 7 and of Dedan in Edom see below chapter 49.8] and to Buz [see Genesis 22.21] and to all that are cut short to all corners [see above chapter 9 on verse 26.]
\p
\v 24 . And to all kings of Arabia [Or to wit or namely &c meaning that these kings are understood these that are cut short at the corner verse 23] and to all the kings of the mingled heaps [as above verse 20] that dwell in wilderness [meaning the Arabian that dwelt on the sensed cities but in tents see below chapter 49.31 c and Judges 8.11.]
\p
\v 25 . And to all the kings of Zimri [that is as some conceive where the posterity of Simran dwelt who was Abraham son by Kethura Genesis 25.2] and to all kings of Elam [see Genesis 10 on verse 22 and below chapter 49.34c.] and to all the kings of Media.
\p
\v 26 . and to all kings of north that are near and far off the one with the other [Heb the at by or with his brother that is the one as the other or which lie by one another ]yea to all the kingdoms of the earth that are upon the earth and the king of Sesach [Heb Scheschach that is Babel or some other of the chiefest cities of the kingdom of Babylon as may be gathered from below chapter 51.40 the original of the name is uncertain ] shall drink after them.
\p
\v 27 . Thou shalt say unto them thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel drink [to wit of that cup of indignation whereof above verse 15] and be drunken and spew and fall down that ye rise not again [or and rise not again ] because of the sword which I will send amongst ye.
\p
\v 28 . And it shall come to pass when they shall refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink that thou shalt say unto them thus saith the Lord of hosts ye shall drink [Heb. Drinking drink.]
\p
\v 29 . For lo in the city [namely Jerusalem called city of God as followeth] which is called by name [ upon which my name is called or proclaimed compare above c 7 on verse 10 ] I begin to plague [Heb properly to do evil ] should ye in anywise do be held guiltiness ? [Heb being guiltiness or held guiltiness be held guiltiness that is any wise go unpunished ? compare below chapter 30.11and 46.28 and 49.12 and see 1Kings 2 on verse 9] ye shall not be held guiltiness for I call for the sword [that is Jordan by my divine providence it shall come as by a special command so Ezekiel 38.21 compare also Isaiah 13.3 and 46.11 and 48.15 Ezekiel 36.29 Amos 5.8 and 9.6 and Haggai 1.11 hence it is also called sword of the Lord as having command from him below chapter 47.6,7 see further 2Kings 8 on verse 1] upon all the inhabitations of the earth saith the Lord of hosts .
\p
\v 30 . Thou shalt prophesy all these words unto them and thou shalt say unto them the Lord shall roar [like a lion it is spoken figuratively to express the fearful consequents of Gods anger see Joel 3.16 Amos 1.2] from on high and lift up [ Heb give ] his voice from his habitations of his holiness [that is his holy habitation to wit heaven ] he shall terrible roar [Heb roaring roar] upon his habitation [ or against his habitation that is the temple as Psalm 79.7] he shall utter a shout [Heb headed almost agreeing with hed that is an Exodus Ezekiel 7.7] as the traders of grapes against all the inhabitants of the earth [or he shall cause them to cry out or cause them to cry to one another that trade grapes or that tread the presses who in the time of vintage while they are at their labor cry to one another and sing to one another by turns to rejoice and encourage one another in their work see Isaiah 16 on verse 9,10 so God implieth he will cause the Babylonians to encourage and hearten one another on to fall on as it were common shout and alarm of war or to destroy both land and people without sparing Jerusalem itself or the temple compare below chapter 48.32 and 51.14 some take it thus he shall answer himself with a joyful cry as if the Lord would say that he had no need that anyone should instigate or put him in this judgment he is forward or prone enough thereto of himself his own zeal putteth on upon him on upon it.]
\p
\v 31 . The sound shall come to the end of the earth [or there shall come a crackling great or terrible noise &c] for the Lord hath contention [or suit controversy ] with the nations he will keep judgment [or enter into judgment dispute plead ] with all flesh [that is men see Genesis 6 on verse 12] the wicked them he will deliver to the sword saith the Lord.
\p
\v 32 . Thus saith the Lord of host behold there goeth forth evil [evil of punishment that is mischief misery see Genesis 19 on verse 19] from nation to nation [that is from one nation to another ] and there shall be a great tempest raised up from the sides of the earth [oth. Of the land so in the next verse ]
\p
\v 33 . And the slain of the Lord [that is those that by the just judgment and providence of God perished ] shall lie at the day from one end of the earth unto the other end of the earth they shall not be lamented [as above chapter 16.4 ] neither taken up [ Heb. Properly gathered see Psalms 26 on verse 9 ]nor buried they shall be for the dung upon the ground.
\p
\v 34 . Howl ye shepherds [rulers in church and common wealth ] and cry and wallow yourselves in the ashes [this is here inserted from above chapter6.26] ye glorious ones of the stock [so God calleth the chiefiest and mightiest among the people so verse 35.36 see of the Hebrew word Psalms 8 on verse 2] for your days [which are ordained or allotted unto ye by God see Psalms 37 on verse 13]are accomplished that they shall slay [to wit ye or to one another ] and of your dispersions [meaning the days of your dispersions that is that ye shall be scattered and dispersed abroad into foreign countries or your dispersions are near at hand ] then ye shall like a precious vessel [Heb. Vessel of desire or of delight or wishing that is fair pleasant precious desirable see 2Chronicles 32 on verse 27 the meaning is that all their beauty and glory shall perish as for example a fair and precious glass or some hat else that being made of very brittle matter falleth in pieces and is good of nothing more neither can it be joined together or repaired ]
\p
\v 35 . And the flight shall perish from the shepherds the escaping from the glorious ones of the stock[ or shall be left unto that is there shall be no fleeing for the rulers nor escape for the great one s of the land compare Psalms 142.5 Amos 2.14,15,16 &c.]
\p
\v 36 . There shall be a voice of the cry of the shepherds and the howling of the glorious ones of the flock because the Lord destroyeth their pasture .
\p
\v 37 . For the pastures of peace [ or shepherds tents or huts pleasant habitation because the Hebrew word is so taken of peace that is where they afore time went and fed peaceably and dwelt in all safety and prosperity and thought to dwell and continue so still ]shall be cut off because of the heat of the Lords anger.
\p
\v 38 . He [ namely the Lord of whom is spoken in the end of the former verse ]hath forsaken his hut [or hole ] as a young lion [this may be understood thus that God like a lion went forth out of his hole as it were for prey to destroy land and great wrath and as it were to rent in pieces or devour them that he had now forsaken the place of his residence to wit Zion and temple from whence he like a young lion was wont to frighten the enemies and to tear them in pieces and in that respect it will be easy for the enemy now to conquer & subdue the land of Judah c] for [or sure ] their land is become a desolation because of the heat of the oppressor [or spoiler which may be applied unto God and likewise to the Babylonian Heb. Oppressing to wit sword as below chapter 46.16 and 50.16 or land or city as Zeph 3.1some render it because of the heat of the dove because the Hebrew word signifieth also a dove see Psalms 24. on verse 8 as if god should have said he that before was as loving and friendly as a dove is now become like a young devouring young lion and that for the great sin of the people some understand by the dove the Assyrians whom some do write that they bare in their ensigns the picture of a dove then by the Assyrians must be understood the Babylonians as bearing rule at that time over the Assyrians compare Ezra 6.22]yea because of the heat of his anger.

\s The prophet by command of God threatened all the people in the court of temple that god if they continue disobedience will make the temple like silo and the land a curse unto all nations verse 1 &c he is thereupon apprehended and pronounced to be guilty of death 8 but the princes c coming there and having heard the accusation as also Jeremiah’s answer clear him by the example of the prophet Micah 10 Ahikam is commanded is commanded in particular for delivering Jeremiah that is fared not with him as it did with another prophet named Uria 20.
\p
\v 1 In the beginning of the reign of Jojakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word saying :
\p
\v 2 . Thus saith the Lord stand in the court of the Lords house and speak unto all cities of Judah which come to worship [Heb. Properly to how themselves or to how down see Genesis 24 on verse 26] in the Lords house all the words that I have commanded thee to speak unto them diminish not a word.
\p
\v 3 . Peradventure they will hearken and turn a man from his evil way then would I repent me [ see Genesis 6 on verse 6 so verse 13 and 19] of the evil [of punishment see Genesis 19 on verse 19]which I think to do unto them of the wickedness of their dealings.
\p
\v 4 . Say then unto them thus saith the Lord if ye will not hearken unto me to walk in my law which I have given before your face.
\p
\v 5 . Hearkening the words of my servants the prophets which I send unto ye even being up early and sending [see above chapter 7 on verse 13 and verse 25 chapter 11.7 and 5.3] but ye have not hearkened.
\p
\v 6 . Then will I make this house a Silo [see above chapter 7.12,14] and I will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.
\p
\v 7 . And the priests and the prophets [meaning the false prophets and so in the sequel above chapter 2.13] and all the people heard Jeremiah speak [ Heb. Speaking ] these words in the house of the Lord.
\p
\v 8 . So it came to pass when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to speak unto people that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him saying thou shalt die to death [Heb dying die]
\p
\v 9 . Why hast thou prophesy in the name of the Lord saying this house shall be like Silo and this city shall be desolate so that none shall dwell there? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the Lord.
\p
\v 10 . Now when the princes of Judah heard these words [or things matters] they came up from the kings house unto the house of the Lord and they set themselves by the door of the new gate [being according of the opinion of some the greatest of all renewed and repaired by king Jotham otherwise the high gate also the gate of Sur and the foundation gate in the east end of the temple see 2 Chronicles 27 on verse3 and 2Kings 11 on verse 5 and 15 on verse 35 and compare chapter 20 on verse 2] of the Lord [that is which was before the house of the Lord ]
\p
\v 11 . Then spake the priest and the prophets unto the princes saying on this man is the judgment [or right ] of death [that is he is guilty to be condemned to die or to be punished with death so below verse 16 see Deuteronomy 19 on verse 6 and 21.22 Luke 24.20] for he hath prophesied against this city according as ye have heard with your ears.
\p
\v 12 . But Jeremiah spake unto all the princes and to all the people saying the Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard .
\p
\v 13 . Now then make your ways and your dealings good and obey the voice of the Lord your God then the Lord will repent him of evil that he hath spoken against ye .
\p
\v 14 . But I behold I am in your hands [that is power] do unto me as it is good and it is right in your eyes [that is so as ye judge it to be good and right.]
\p
\v 15 . But know for certain [ Heb knowing know] that if ye put me to death ye shall surely bring [properly give appoint see judges 9 on verse 24 Ezekiel 7 on verse 3,4,8] innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and upon the inhabitants thereof for of a truth the Lord hath sent me unto ye to speak all these words before your ears .
\p
\v 16 . Then said the princes and all the people unto the priest and to the prophets and this man there is no judgment of death for he hath spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God.
\p
\v 17 . Also they rose up men of the eldest [that is chiefest man in place of authority persons of note and quality see numbers 11 on verse 16 and compare genesis 50 on verse 7] of the land and spake to al congregation of the people saying:
\p
\v 18 . Micah the Moraschitite [that is born at Morescheth which some conceive to be Morescha from Micah 1.14,15 because the original signification seemeth to be see the annotate there and likewise Josiah 15.44 but others conceive Moresceth to be a village lying not far off from the city of Moreschia on the west borders of Judah or an other city lying by Gath pertaining to be Philistines and perhaps taken by the Benjamites 1Chronicles 8 on verse 13 see further Micah 1 on verse 14 and of another prophet Micah 1 Kings 22 and 2 Chronicles 18] prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah saying thus saith the Lord of Hosts [see 1 kings 18 on verse 15] Zion shall be ploughed like a field and Jerusalem shall become a heap of stones and the mountain of this house [mount Moria where the temple stood ] the high place of forest [ that is every wild dessert woody high place see Micah 3.12.]
\p
\v 19 . Did also Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death?[or put him all to death Heb putting to death, put him to death] did he [name Hezekiah] not fear the Lord ? and besought the face of the Lord? so that he repented the Lord [as above chapter 18.8 elsewhere often ] of the evil which he had spoken against them ? we then commit great evil against our souls [that is we commit a great sin whereby we bring a great destruction on ourselves compare Numbers 16. on verse 38c.]
\p
\v 20 . There was also a man [or there hath or hath been also a man ] that prophesied in the name of the Lord Uriah the son of Semaja [Heb Urijabu shimajabu of this man there nowhere else mention made ] of Kiriath Jiarim[ see Judges 18 on verse 12 ] he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah [that is in the like manner just so as Jeremiah hath done all this in the relation of the prophet Jeremiah himself serving to take notice of Gods gracious providence in protecting of Jeremy by Ahikam without him Jojakim likely would have rewarded him as h had this Uriah .]
\p
\v 21 . And when king Jojakim together with his almighty man and all the princes heard his word the king sought to put him to death when Uriah heard this he afraid and fled and came into Egypt.
\p
\v 22 . But king Jojakim sent men to Egypt Elnathan the son of Achhor [compare 2Kings 22.12,14 and below chapter 36.12] and other man with him into Egypt.
\p
\v 23 . They set Uriah out of Egypt and brought him unto king Jojakim and he smote him with the sword and he cast his dead body [that is caused him to smitten that is slain and his body to be cast c.] into the graves of the children of people [that is in one of the grave of the common people see judges 12 on verse 7 without yielding him as the prophet of the Lord as well worthy of the outward honor or funeral solemnity .]
\p
\v 24 . But the hand of Ahikam the son of Saphan was with Jeremiah so that they delivered him not into the hand of the people to put him to death[that is he defended Jeremiah by his power and authority that he had see of this Ahikim 2Kings 22.12,14 and 25.2 also below chapter39.14.]
\c 27
\s The prophet is commanded to wear a yoke upon his neck and likewise to send yokes to five neighbor kings and to tell them that they shall be fain to bow their necks with Juda under Nebuchadnezzar yoke and the willinger they did it the better it should be for them without hearkening unto false prophets verse 1.2 &c all this doth he afterwards amply propound unto king Zedikiah moreover prophesying that the remaining vessels of the temples should be likewise carried to Babel and there continue till the time appointed 12.
\p
\v 1 In the beginning of the reign of Jojakim the son of Josiah king Judah [eleven years before reign of Zedekiah when Nebuchadnezzar was yet no king of Babel as many be gathered chapter 25.1 at that time received a command concerning that which he should do or say in the time of Zedekiah reign as appeareth by the sequel see verse 3 and 12] came this word unto Jeremiah from the Lord saying :
\p
\v 2 . Thus saith the Lord me make thee bonds and yokes [so is the Hebrew word also taken above chapter 28.10,12,13 otherwise it signifieth also draught trees whereby there are tied to the yoke draught trees see Leviticus 26 verse 13 with the annotate and put them upon thy neck [them that is one of them see Judges 12 on verse 7 and above chapter 26 on verse 23 and wear it to represent lively unto the people their future bondage under the king of Babel see below verse 8.12 and chapter 28.14 and do with rest as followeth .]
\p
\v 3 . And send them to the king of Edom and to the king of Moab and to the king of children of Amon and to the king of Tyrus and to the king of Zidion by the hand of the messengers [or ambassadors ] which come [or shall come are come ] to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah [to make covenant with him against Babylonians or to harden him in his rebellion see 2 Chronicles 36.13.]
\p
\v 4 . And command them to say unto their Lords thus saith the Lord of hosts [see 1Kings 18 on verse 15] the God of Israel thus shall ye say unto your Lords.
\p
\v 5 . I have made the earth the man and the cattle that are upon the ground by my great power and by mine outstretched arm and I give it [or therefore do I give it or have given it &c to wit the earth ] unto whom it is right in mine eyes [that is unto whom it pleaseth or pleased me see Daniel 4.14,22]
\p
\v 6 . And now I have given all these land into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar [in the former chapter often called Nebuchadnezzar] king of Babel my servant [ see above chapter 25 on verse 9] even the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him [a phrase signifying absolute and perfect dominion compare below chapter 28.14 Daniel 2.38.]
\p
\v 7 . And all nations shall serve him and his son [Evilmerodach of whom see 2Kings 25.27 and below chapter 32.31] and his sons son :[Belsarzar see Daniel 5] until also the time of his own lands come [or the right time of his land &c Heb. The time of his land also or even or year of his to wit land or also that to wit time of his land that his land by Gods providence shall brought under the power and subjection of others the Babylonians monarchy take an end compare Daniel 5.26] then shall mighty nations and great kings cause themselves to be served of him [or compel him to serve see above chapter 25 on verse 14.]
\p
\v 8 . And it shall come to pass that the nation and the kingdom which will not serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel And which [to wit nations or kingdom] will not give their neck under the yoke of the king of Babel that same nation will I visit saith the Lord by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence until I shall have consumed them by his hands [that is by his ministry or by his power .]
\p
\v 9 . Ye hearken not unto your prophets [meaning false prophets and such as pretend that they have divine revelation and dream see above chapter 23.25c.] nor to your sooth Sayers nor to your dreamers [Heb. Dreams so below chapter 29.8 so below carrying away captive or captivity for them that are carried away captive or captivity below chapter 28.4,6 and 29.1,4 see Job 35on verse 13]and to your jugglers to your sorcerers [see Levit. 19 on verse 26] which speak unto ye saying ye shall not serve the King of Babel.
\p
\v 10 . For they prophesy falsehood [or a lie so verse 14,16] unto you to bring ye far from your land that I thrust you out and you should perish [see below on verse 15]
\p
\v 11 . But the neck that shall bring the neck under the yoke of the King of Babel and shall serve him those will I have in their own land saith the Lord and they shall till it dwell therein .
\p
\v 12 . After that [to wit the king Zedekiah compare above verse 1 and chapter 5.1 with the annotate ]I speak to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all theses words saying bring your necks under the yokes of the king of Babel and serve him his people so shall ye live [that is remain alive so verse 17]
\p
\v 13 . Why should ye die thou and thy people by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence ?[ which shall surely be if ye will not serve the king of Babel so below verse 17 compare 2Samuel 2.22] according as the Lord hath spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babel
\p
\v 14 . Hearken then not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto ye saying ye shall not serve the king of Babel for they prophesy falsehood unto ye as above chapter 14.14 and 23.21 and 29.8]
\p
\v 15 . For I have not sent them saith the Lord for they prophesy falsely in my name that I might thrust ye out and that I might prophesy ye and the prophesy unto ye [this in deed was not the aim of the false prophets but it will certainly follow thereupon the Lord say if they should believe the false prophets who were also with their false prophesies under the holy and righteous providence of God see 1Kings 22.19c. and above chap. 18 on verse 16.]
\p
\v 16 . Also I spake to the priest and to all this people [that adhered to the priest and to the false prophets ]saying thus saith the Lord hearkening unto the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you saying behold the vessels of the Lords house [which in the time of Jojakim and Jechoniah were carried to Babel 2Chronicles 36.7,10] shall now shortly be brought again from Babel [compare below chapter 28.3] for they prophesy falsehood unto you.
\p
\v 17 . hearken unto them but serve he king of Babel so shall ye live [as verse 12] wherefore should this city become a desolation ?
\p
\v 18 . But if they be prophets and if the words of the Lord be with them let them now make intercession [Heb entreat run upon come between to wit with intercession as above chapter 7.16 see there] to the Lord of hosts that the vessels are left in the house of the Lord and in the house of the king of Judah and at Jerusalem go not to Babel.
\p
\v 19 . For thus saith the Lord of hosts concerning the pillars [see 2Kings 25.16,17]and concerning the sea and concerning the bases and concerning the residues of the vessels that remain in the city.
\p
\v 20 . Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel took not away when he carried away captive Jechonia the son of Jojakin king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babel together with all the nobles [Heb white one see Nehemiah 2 on verse 16] of Judah and Jerusalem.
\p
\v 21 . Yea thus saith the Lord hosts the God of Israel concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the Lord and in the house of king of Judah and Jerusalem:
\p
\v 22 . They shall be brought to Babel and they shall they be [that is remain so below chapter 32.5 Psalms 37.18c.] until the day that I will visit them saith the Lord [this and that which followeth may be applied to this gracious visitation of the Jews whom God would redeem out of Babylonian captivity and cause them to come again with the vessels in their own land or also by way of comparison taken from men it may be applied to the vessels themselves to which God in manner will shew its mercy as that he would bring them again out of the hands of those that violently detained and most shamefully abused them Daniel 5.2,3,4 to their due place and restore them to visit their right use thus God is said to visit the land Psalms 65.10c.]then will I carry them up and bring them again in this place [compare 2 Chronicles 36.22 below chapter 29.10.]
\c 28
\s Hanajah prophesieth falsely against Jeremiah verse 1c. against which Jeremiah descendeth himself 5 Hananja breaketh the yoke from off the neck of Jeremiah 10 who at God’s commandments maketh an iron one instead thereof with a repetition of his prophesy and determination of death unto Hananja the same year wherein he also died 12.
\p
\v 1 Moreover it came to pass in the same year [that he exhorted Zedekiah the priest and the people above chapter 27.12c. to bow their necks under the yoke of king of Babel] in the beginning of king Zedekiah the king of Judah in the forth year, [in which year king Zedekiah also sent an ambassador to Babel see below chapter 51.59] in the fifth month that Hananja [Heb Chananja] the son of Azur [Heb Azzur] the prophet [meaning false prophet so in the sequel ]that was of Gibeon [a city of the priest Josiah 21.13,17] spake unto me in the house of the Lord before the eyes [that is in the presence and so often in the sequel ] of the priest and of al the people saying :
\p
\v 2 . Thus saith the Lord of host the God of Israel saying: I have broken the yoke of the king of Babel.
\p
\v 3 . In the two full years [Heb years of days see Genesis 41 on verse 1 so below on verse 11] will I bring again to his place all the vessels of the Lord which Nebuchadnezzar the King of Babel took away from this place and brought them to Babel.
\p
\v 4 . Also I will bring to this place Jechonia the son of Jojakim king of Judah and all them that were carried away captive [Heb captive carrying away transportation so below verse 6 and 29.1,20 and elsewhere often ] of Judah that were come to Babel saith the Lord [this he speaketh falsely see above chapter 23.31] for I will break the yoke of the king of Babel.
\p
\v 5 . Then spake the prophet Jeremiah to the prophet Hananja before the eyes [as above verse 1] of the priest before the eyes of all the people that stood in the house of the Lord.
\p
\v 6 . And the prophet Jeremiah saith Amen [that is be it true see Numbers 5 on verse 22] the Lord do so the Lord confirm thy words which thou hast bring again the vessels of the Lords house [that is of his as often ] and all that are carried captive [as above verse 4 ] from Babel to this place.
\p
\v 7 . But hear[ thou Hananja] now this word that I speak before thine ears and before the ears of all the people.
\p
\v 8 . The prophet that hath been before me and before thee of old: they prophesied against many lands and against great [or mighty ] kingdoms of war and of evil [that is all manner of plagues mischief and misery which do usually accompany war as famine desolation of the land and people c.] and pestilence [when sins prevailed and were ripe for punishment such hath been ordinarily the burden of the prophets now will Jeremiah say thou practiseth the clean contrary hardening the people in wickedness whereas the true prophets by threatening them with Gods judgments sought to bring them to repentance with promises of grace and mercy to the penitents.]
\p
\v 9 . The prophet that shall have prophesied of peace [or concerning a prophet &c] when the word of the prophet cometh [that is cometh to pass it accomplished so Judges 13.12] then shall that prophet be known that the Lord hath sent him.
\p
\v 10 . Then hananja the prophet took the yoke from Jeremiahs neck [see above chapter 27 on verse 2] and he break it.
\p
\v 11 . And Hananja spake before the eyes [as above verse 1,5] of all people saying thus saith the Lord so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babel in the two full years [as above verse 3] from the neck of all nations [meaning taking it from off the neck c from verse 10 so in the next verse ] and the prophet Jeremiah went his way [looking for further relation and charge from God .]
\p
\v 12 . But the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah after the prophet Hananja had broken the yoke from his neck of the prophet Jeremiah saying:
\p
\v 13 . Go thy ways and speak to Hananja saying thus saith the LORD [O Hananja ] hast broken the wooden yoke [this may be understood that Hananja breaking the wooden yoke from Jeremiah would thereby imitate all the rest whereof is spoken chapter 27.2,3c. should be likewise broken or it may be here rendered wooden draught trees se above chapter 27 on verse 2because in the sequel another Hebrew word which also signifieth a yoke is used compare further Deuteronomy 28.48] now shalt thou [O Jeremiah ] instead of them make iron yokes [these are the words that the Lord spake unto Jeremiah that he might in his name tell them to Hananja.]
\p
\v 14 . For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel I have put an iron neck upon all these nations that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar the King of Babel and they shall serve him yea I have given him the beasts of the field [see above chapter 27 on verse 6.]
\p
\v 15 . And the prophet Jeremiah saith unto the prophet Hananja hear now Hananja the Lord hath not sent thee but thou hast made these people to trust in a lie.
\p
\v 16 . Therefore thus saith the Lord behold I will cast thee away from the earth [take thee away out of the land of the living as the scripture elsewhere speaketh and send thee to thine own place compare Acts 1.25] this year thou shalt die because thou hast spoken backsliding against the Lord [hardening the people by false prophesies in their backsliding and wickedness compare Deuteronomy 13.15 below chapter 29.32.]
\p
\v 17 . So the prophet Hananja died in the same year in the seventh month[the second year after he was foretold of his death by Jeremiah the prophet see above verse 1.]
\c 29
\s Jeremiah sendeth letters to Babel unto the Jews that were carried thither captive with Jechonia and exhorteth them to be peaceable and quiet there to pray for the peace of Babel not to believe their false prophets and dreamers nor to expect deliverance before the seventy years he expired verse1 c. he like wise prophesieth how ill it will be with them that remain in Judah 16. with a special severe prophesy speaketh against two false prophets in Babel Achab and Zedekiah 20 also against Semaia who had written from Babel to Jerusalem that they should punish Jeremiah for his letter24.
\p
\v 1 Moreover are the words of a letter which the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem unto the remaining eldest that were carried away captive [Heb. The residue of the eldest of the carrying away captive as above chapter 28.4andbelow verse 4.22,31] as also to the priest and to the prophets and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar hath carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babel.
\p
\v 2 . After that King Jechonia and queen and chamberlains [or courtiers see Genesis 37 on verse 36 ] the princes of Judah and Jerusalem together with the carpenters and smiths [Heb the carpenter and the smith see above chapter 24 on verse 1] were departed from Jerusalem [see 2Kings 24.2,14]
\p
\v 3 . By the hand [ this dependeth of these words by the first verse which the prophet Jeremiah sent by the hand c. that is by ministry c. these ambassadors took the letter along with them [and Elasa the son of Saphan and Gamarja the son of Hilka whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babel unto Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel saying:[to wit in this letter as followeth so below verse 25.28c.]
\p
\v 4 . Thus saith the Lord of host c[see 1Kings 18.on verse 15] the god of Israel unto all that carried away captive [Heb unto all the captive carrying away as verse 1] whom I [the Lord] have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babel.
\p
\v 5 . Build houses and dwell in them and plant garden and eat fruits of them .
\p
\v 6 . Take wives and beget sons and daughters and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands that they may give sons and daughters and be multiplied there and be not diminished.
\p
\v 7 . And seek the peace [that is welfare and prosperity see Genesis 37 on verse 14] of the city wither I have caused you to be carried away captive and pray unto the Lord for it for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace [when it goeth well with it then will it go well with ye .]
\p
\v 8 . For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel let not your prophets and your sooth-sayers tat are in the midst of you deceive you [making you believe that within two years ye shall be delivered compare above chapter 14.14 and 23.21 and 27.15] neither hearken to your dreamers [Heb dream see above chapter 27 on verse 9] whom ye cause to dream [whom by vanity and credulity you give occasion and cause to seduce false dreams .]
\p
\v 9 . For they prophesy false [Heb in or with false hood ] in my name I have not sent them saith the Lord.
\p
\v 10 . For thus saith the Lord assuredly when seventy years have been accomplished ] at Babel [or on with Babel that in ye shall have been there seventy years captivity not from the destruction of Jerusalem under the reign of the king Zedekiah but from the carrying away of the king Jechonia and many other Jews whereof above veres2 that were now in captivity when Jeremiah sent this letter unto them compare Ezekiel 1.2 and 33.21 and 40.1 with the annotate ]I will visit ye [meaning in mercy see Genesis 21 on verse 1] and I will raise [or confirm set there or cause to stand ] my good word towards you [that is my good gracious and comfortable promises concerning your deliverance ] bringing you again to this place.
\p
\v 11 . For I know the thought that I think towards you saith the Lord thought of peace and not of evil[ corporal and spiritual blessing and not on the contrary see Genesis 37 on verse 14] to give you the end, [Heb. Hindmost last that is here and see Psalms 37 on verse 37 below chapter 31 on verse 17 and compare 1 Peter 1.9] and the expectation [ that is an issue which I have promised and assuredly expect from me or the expected end the end that ye have looked for or desired.]
\p
\v 12 . Then shall ye call upon me and go and pray unto me and l will hearken unto.
\p
\v 13 . And ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall enquire after me with all your heart.
\p
\v 14 . And I will be found [ or shew myself ready compare Psalms 46. on verse 2] of you saith the Lord and l will turn away your captivity and gather you from all the nations and from all places wither I have driven you saith the Lord or I will bring you again to the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive.
\p
\v 15 . Because ye say the Lord hath raised us up prophets to Babel [oth. In Babel that is because you persuade yourself that God notwithstanding that he caused ye to be carried away captive to Babel and yet he also sent prophets thither to comfort you with a promise that God will perverse and continue the kingdom of Judah and deliver ye within the space of two years and bring ye again to Jerusalem therefore hear now what the Lord saith concerning this matter that ye may abandon the vain hope which your false prophets give you and may keep close to the false prophesies which I here render unto you in the name of God and are related in words following others annex this verse unto the former thus when ye shall have said the Lord hath raised us up &c that is the deliverance shall come when ye shall confess with true sincere repentance [ that I and other faithful prophets being raised up by God have told ye the very truth that ye must go to Babel and not be delivered before the time by God appointed.]
\p
\v 16 . Therefore thus saith the Lord of [ Heb. El which is sometimes taken for of see Job 42 on verse 7 Psalms 2 on verse 7] the king that sitteth upon the throne of David and all the people that dwell in the city [ Jerusalem that is that tarried here to which city ye look very shortly to return in peace as the false prophets do make ye believe ] to wit your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity .
\p
\v 17 . thus saith the Lord of host behold I will send the sword the famine the pestilence among them and I will make them like loathsome figs which by reason of their naughtiness cannot be eaten [see above chapter 24.8c.]
\p
\v 18 . And I will pursue after them with the sword with the famine and with the pestilence and I will deliver them for a commotion unto all the kingdoms of the earth[see Deuteronomy 28 on verse 25 and verse 37 and above chapter 15.4 and 24.9] for a curse for a terror [oth. Desolation fearful desolation] and for a whistling and for a reproach among all nations wither I shall have driven them.
\p
\v 19 . Because they have not hearkened unto my words saith the Lord when I sent my servants the prophets unto them being up early and sending [see above chapter 7 on verse 13] but ye hearkened not saith the Lord.
\p
\v 20 . Ye then hear the word of the Lord all that are carried away captive [Heb. The whole captive carrying away as above verse 1] whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babel.
\p
\v 21 Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel of Achab the son of Kolaja and Zedekiah the son of Maaseja which prophesy falsely [or false hood a lie ]unto ye in my name behold I will give them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel and he shall smite them [that is cause them to be slain as is expounded in the sequel ] before your eyes.
\p
\v 22 . And of them there shall be taken up a curse by all them that are carried away captive of Judah which are in Babel that they shall say the Lord make thee like Zedekiah and like Achab [in the former verse called Achab ]whom the king of Babel roasted [that is caused to be roasted ]at the fire [of them c to wit the sense of this verse is that from these false prophets the captive Jews should take up and use a pattern or custom of cursing and use the same in cursing others compare below chapter 42 on verse 18 Isaiah 65.15.]
\p
\v 23 . Because they committed folly in Israel [see Genesis 34 on verse 7] and committed adultery with their neighbors wives and spake the word falsely [or a false word a word that was falsehood or a lie]in my name [that is they taught and prophesied falsely abusing my name and command for that purpose ]which I had commanded them I am he that know it and a witness thereof saith the Lord.
\p
\v 24 . Now thou shalt speak unto Namanja and Nekelamite [this seemeth to be name of descent or birthplace but some are of opinion that Jeremiah or God himself gave him this name in an ironical or mocking way because of these dreams of Chalum signifieth to dream above verse 18 and below verse 31,32[he is called the Nechalmite] saying:
\p
\v 25 . Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts the God of Israel saying because thou hast sent letters in thy name [by thine own authority not by my command as thy falsely boasted] unto all people that is Jerusalem and Zephanja the son of Maaseja the priest [the second priest see 2Kings 25.18 and compare above chapter 20 on verse 1] and to all the priest saying [as above verse 3]
\p
\v 26 . the Lord hath made the priest in the stead of Jojada the priest [some are of opinion that he meaneth Jojada the priest of whose excellent act may read 2Kings 11 and 2Chronicles 23to flatter him according to the manner and the custom of false prophets others conceive that it was other Jojada who was either dead or had also carried away to Babel so that Zephanja in order succeeded his stead] that ye should be overseers [or commanders officers] in the house of the Lord every man that is out of his wits [he meaneth this of Jeremiah compare 2Kings 9 on verse 11] and maketh himself a prophets and thou shouldest put him in prison [of the Hebrew word see above chapter 20 on verse2 ] and in the stocks [The Hebrew word Tinock is only found here so that it is uncertain what kind of prison or chains and fetters or also punishment by death it doth properly signify some compare with Zittim which also signifieth chains and fetters others conceive that it is compounded of Tsi that is ship and Janak that is sucking and render it sucking ship or sucking boat which was among the Persians and the peradventure among adjacent nations also a most cruel capital punishment when a man was laid and it was a packet in between two boats fitted one upon another his head hands and feet only sticking out and so left among the rest being fed with honey and milk which he was forced to suck in his face being turned towards the sun being plagued without by flies and within by worms and filthiness died most miserable in the end.]
\p
\v 27 . Now then why hast thou not rebuked Jeremiah the anthothite [and consequently punished him according to his desert] who maketh himself a prophet among ye?
\p
\v 28 . For therefore he sent [to wit a letter as above ] into us to Babel [to shew that he is a prophet or thus he sent c.] saying it shall last long [to wit the captivity it shall last long it shall be long-lasting] build houses and dwell in them and plant gardens and eat the fruits of them.
\p
\v 29 . Now Zephanja the priest had read this letter before the ears of the prophet Jeremiah.
\p
\v 30 . Therefore the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah saying [here is now prosecuted that which is begun verse 25.]
\p
\v 31 . Send to all them that are carried away captive [Heb. The captive carrying away as above verse 1] saying thus saith the Lord concerning Semaja the Nechalmite [above verse 24 he is called the Nechalmite see there ]because that Semaja hath prophesied unto you and I sent him not and he caused you to trust in a lie [compare above chapter 25.15.]
\p
\v 32 . Therefore thus saith the Lord behold I will visit [by punishment see Genesis 21 on verse1 ] upon Semaja the Nechalmite and his seed he shall have none to dwell in midst of this people neither shall he behold [that is not live to see and enjoy see Job 7 on verse 7] the good that I will do unto my people saith the Lord for he hath spoken apostasy or revolt against the Lord [see above chapter 28 on verse 16.]
\c 30
\s Jeremiah receiveth a command ,to write these words of the lord in a book, verse1,2.A prophesie concerning the corporal deliverance from Babel, and the spiritual redemption by Christ, together with the grace and blessings which God will bestow on his church ,notwithstanding their great miseries, troubles ,breaches and wounds ,3.But God’s tempest shall remain upon the wicked ,23.
\p
\v 1 The word that came to Jeremiah ,from the LORD saying :
\p
\v 2 .Thus speaketh the LORD ,the God of Israel, saying, write thee all the words, that l have spoken unto thee ,in a book.[see below chap.36.2.]
\p
\v 3 .For behold ,the days come ,saith the LORD ,that l will turn away the captivity [Or, bring the again captives] of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD :and l will bring them again into the land that l gave to their fathers, and they shall posses it hereditarily.
\p
\v 4 .And these are the words which LORD spoke concerning Israel ,and concerning Judah.
\p
\v 5 .For thus saith the LORD ,We hear a voice of terror:[or, trembling] there is fear ,and no peace ,[Here the inhabitants of Jerusalem are brought in ,thus lamenting at the time of taking of the City.]
\p
\v 6 .Ask now, and see ,whether a man doth travel with childe ?[That is, can travel with childe ,as]wherefore (then) do l see every mans hands on his loins ,as of a woman in travel ,and all faces turned into paleness?[or ,yellowness, the yellow jaundice that is discolored as those that have yellow jaundice and as the fruits of the ground through too much moisture they purify and are mitten with mildew compare Deuteronomy 28. On verse 22]
\p
\v 7 . O wo! For that day is so great [or certainly sure that day is c or that day is so great!] that none hath been like it [that is the appointed time of the judgment upon Jacob’s prosperity see Psalms 37 on verse 13 and Joel 1 on verse 15 is so great as that they were never been punished so severely ] and it is a time of trouble yet you shall so be delivered out of it.
\p
\v 8 . For it shall come to pass in that day saith the Lord of hosts that I will break his yoke [the king of Babel’s yoke see above chapter 27] from off thy neck[ compare above chapter 28.11] and will burst thy bones and strangers shall no more cause themselves to be served [or compel him to serve them see above chapter 25 on verse 14] of him [namely Jacob.]
\p
\v 9 . But they [Jacob’s posterity ] shall serve the Lord their God and David their king [that is the Lord Jesus Christ see 2Samuel 22 on verse 51 compare Ezekiel 24.33,34 and 37.24 Hosea 3.5] whom I will raise up unto them.
\p
\v 10 . Go then fear not my servant Jacob saith the Lord he not dismayed Israel [compare Isaiah 41.13 and 43.5 and 44.1 above chapter 46.28] for behold I will deliver thee from far countries and thy seed from the land of their captivity and Jacob shall return and be quiet and rest and there shall be no man to make him afraid [or to make him tremble ]
\p
\v 11 . For am I with thee [see Genesis 21 on verse 22] saith the Lord to deliver thee for I will make a full end of all the heathen wither I have scattered thee but I will not make a full end of thee [see above chapter 4 on verse 27 and 5.10,18 and below chapter 46.28] but I will correct thee in measure [see above chapter 10 on verse 24 Isaiah 27.8] and will not hold thee altogether guiltiness I will not hold thee guiltiness that is I will not leave thee altogether or wholly unpunished as before chapter 46.28 compare above chapter 25.29.]
\p
\v 12 . For thus saith the Lord the breach [as above chapter 4.6] is deadly [other concerning thy breach it is deadly compare above chapter 10.19 ] thy plague [or wound as above chapter 14.17] is smarting.
\p
\v 13 . There is none thy judgeth thy cause concerning thy swelling [or wound in this signification is the Hebrew word also used Hosea 5.13 Obadiah verse 7and is no where else found in scripture others for binding up or crushing out that is that thy wound is bound up crushed out cleansed and healed the meaning is that there is none that meddleth with the cause of thy swelling and enquireth whether and how thou art be helped in this misery ]thou hast no healing plasters[Heb healing [or curing of rising or coming up going up that is no plasters are laid to thy wounds that health may come of it or upon it that is increase or that scars might come up compare Nehemiah 4 on verse 27 and below verse 17 others rising of healing by transposing the words as is sometimes done in the Hebrew.]
\p
\v 14 . All thy lovers[on whom thou hast relied as the Egyptian and others compare above chapter 22.20]have forsaken thee they were not thee for I have smitten thee with the stroke of an enemy [that is so hard and so severely as if an enemy had smitten thee so that one should say according to the outward appearance an enemy hath done it in mean while my thought of peace remaining firm and constant see verse 16,17,18c.]with chastisement of cruel one for the greatness of thy iniquity because thy sins are exceeding many.
\p
\v 15 . Why criest thou for thy breach [compare above chapter 13.17]for thy grief is deadly / for greatness of thine iniquity because thy sins are exceeding many [as above chapter 6.6] I have done these things unto thee.
\p
\v 16 . Therefore all they that eat thee up shall be eaten up [compare Psalms 14.4 and 79.7 with the annotate] and all thy adversaries they all go into captivity[and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil and all that plunders thee will I give up to plundering [to shew that I first chastised you because of your sins for your good and that afterwards my time cometh to recompense your enemies that meant it not so and to bless you again compare Jeremiah 10.25.]
\p
\v 17 . For I will cause health to rise unto thee [or lay a plaster upon thee compare above verse 13 and chapter 8 on verse 22 and below chapter 33.6 and also chapter 46.11] and heal thee of thy plagues [or wounds ] saith the Lord because they call thee the expelled ones it is Zion say they [in a scoffing manner as if they say this is that Zion the church of God whereof they have spoken so frequently and in such a boasting manner and of whom they so great in such an opinion but see now I pray c] no man enquireth after her [or she had no inquirer after her [that is no man troubleth himself with her.]
\p
\v 18 . thus saith the Lord behold I will turn away the captivity of Jacob’s tents [that is I will cause the captives of my people to return their own dwellings and consequently will redeem my people out of spiritual captivity by the Messiahs and will build them and bless them ] and have compassion on their dwelling places and their dwelling places and city [Jerusalem and God’s church thereby figured ]shall be builded upon her own heap [ or hill to wit upon mount Zion where it stood before its prime ] and the palace [the temple or the king’s court] shall lie [or be situate that is stand as before in its own place compare Cant5.12] after the manner thereof.
\p
\v 19 . And from them [my people or church ] shall proceed thanksgiving [for the corporal and principally for the spiritual redemption by the Messiah ] and a voice of playing one [that is of such a make merry and are joyful at Gods mercies so below chapter 31.4] and I will increase them and they shall not grow mean [ or small that is be vilified accounted small despised.]
\p
\v 20 . And his [to wit Jacob from verse 18] sons he as afore times and his congregation [namely Jacob’s congregation ]shall be established before my face and I will visit [by punishment see Genesis 21 on verse 1] upon his own oppressors.
\p
\v 21 . And his [Jacob’s as in former verse ]glorious one [the messiahs our savior Jesus Christ of the Hebrew word see Psalms 8 on verse 2who in the following word is called his Lord as also Micah 5.1] shall be of him [that is according the flesh proceed from Jacob as followeth ] and his Lord shall proceed from midst of him and I will cause him to draw near and he shall approach unto me [that is I will anoint and call him for him for this end and purpose that he may be an high priest and a mediator between me and my people ] for he is that should be surety with his heart and to draw near unto me [or that should make his heart a surety engage pawn ,oblige, pledge, assure his heart that should dare behold as to set himself a mediator between me and sinful man as the Messiah doth of whom is spoken in former words so is the Hebrew word also used Genesis 43 on verse 9 and 44 on verse 32 Nehemiah 5.3 Proverbs 20 on verse 16 and 27.13c who is h c. to wit else but the Messiah Jesus Christ who is my son alone fit for it called by me and offering himself willingly for a surely to reconcile my people unto me and to appear as advocate for them before me compare Psalms 40.7,8,9 and 110.4 Hebrews 4.14,15 and 5.4,5,6c. and 7.22,25 and 9.14,15,24c.] saith the Lord/
\p
\v 22 . And ye shall be people unto me [see Deuteronomy 7 on verse 6] and I will be God unto ye [see Genesis 17 on verse 7comapre above chapter 24.7 and below chapter 31.33 and 32.38.]
\p
\v 23 . Behold a tempest of the Lord and indignation is gone forth [see above chapter 23.19] a continuing tempest that gathereth itself when the sky beginneth to be black and thick as the first rising of a great tempest ] it shall remain [or light painfully fall with pain stick close ]upon the head of the wicked .
\p
\v 24 . the heat of the Lord’s anger shall be turned away until he shall have done and until he shall have set there the thoughts of his heart in the last days ye shall consider it [or get understanding of it [compare above chapter 23.30.]
\c 31
\s A father prophesy under the type of the redemption from Babylonian captivity concerning the gathering restoring and blessings of the catholic church of the elect both Jews and Gentiles by the Messiahs Jesus Christ verse1 c. concerning the new covenant of the grace 31 concerning the stability and enlargement of the church 35.
\p
\v 1 At the same time saith the Lord will I be a God unto all families of Israel and there shall be a people unto me [as above chapter 30.22 and below verse 33 and 32.38 c.]
\p
\v 2 . thus saith the Lord the people of them that were left of the sword[that is which were not destroyed as well by other hostile nations as especially when the Levites at Gods commandment flew a great multitude of their brethren with the sword for the idolatry which they had committed with the golden calf see Exodus 32.27,28] found grace in the wilderness [upon Moses intercession Exodus 32.30,31c so will God say shall also now those that are left of the sword of the Babylonian find favor by the Messiah whereof in the sequel] namely Israel when I went to bring him to rest [to bring Israel into the land of Canaan.]
\p
\v 3 . The Lord hath appeared unto me of far times [that is of old long ago they are the words indeed that God hath been in former time very kind and gracious unto us but now they will say his love beginneth to grow cold or to be diminished or to be changed hereunto God maketh answer in the following words of the church speaking of God and supply the sense with the word saying thus the Lord hath appereth unto me of far times saying c] yea I have loved thee [to wit my church Zion the word is put in the feminine gender ] with an everlasting love [Heb love for eternity compare John 13.1] therefore with loving kindness towards thee [or henceforth stretched out or continued loving kindness towards thee or therefore do I prosecute or continue loving kindness to you and will deal by you as followeth compare Psalms 36.11 and 85.6 Ecclesiastes 2.3.]
\p
\v 4 . I will built thee again and thou shalt be built O virgin of Israel thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets [that is to make merry after the manner of those times see Psalms 68 on verse 26 whereby here the joy of the church in the time of the gospel is represented so in the sequel] and shalt go forth in the dance of them that play [see above chapter 30 on verse 19.]
\p
\v 5 . Thou shalt again plant vineyards upon the mountains of Samaria [compare Isaiah 65.21] the planters shall plant and enjoy the fruit [Heb. Profane c. that is freely use and eat the fruit see Deuteronomy 20 on verse 6.]
\p
\v 6 . For there shall be a day [that is a time of grace and joy ]wherein the keepers [the pastors of Gods church preachers of the gospel Hebrew Nozerim by which word some conceive that God hath respect to the name of Nazarenes which was given to Christians Acts 24.5 see also Numbers 6 on verse 2] upon the mount Ephraim shall cry [Heb cried or cry that is shall cry at that time ] get you up and let us go up to Zion unto the Lord our God [compare Isaiah 2.2,3 Micah 4.2 with the annotate.]
\p
\v 7 . For thus saith the Lord cry aloud [or sing triumph shouts ] for Jacob with joy and shout [the Hebrew rendered here shout is properly used of the neighing of horses but is also used of men here and Ester 8.15 Isaiah 10.30 and 24.14 signifying to utter a clear loud joyful voice]because of the head of gentiles [because the Jews being captive under the head of the gentiles that is the Babylonians yet notwithstanding should be surely delivered and not be kept under by the head of the gentiles others under the head or under the chiefest gentiles to wit in Babel and everywhere where the Jews were captives under the king of Babel who was the head of Gentiles where all of us where in spiritual manner held captive under Satan the prince of the world and the prince of darkness others in the front before that is in the cross ways the entering and issues of ways or streets as proverbs 1.20,21 among the gentiles that is openly publicly before them whom the salvation of the Lord shall be revealed]cause it to be held sing praise and say O Lord preserve [or deliver save] thy people the remnant of Israel [compare Romans 9 verse 27.]
\p
\v 8 . Behold I will bring them from the land of the north [that is Babel see above chapter 1.14 where Judah was held captive typifying the spiritual captivity]and will gather them from the sides of the earth[that is the other countries where the ten tribes were in captivity as Assyria Media c.] among them shall blind and lame [compare Isaiah 35.5,6] the woman with child and she that which travel together [that is some of very weakest sort shall go out from Babel corporally and understanding this further spiritually of such as are laden with sins and are very weak see Matthew 11.28] with a great congregation shall they return hither.
\p
\v 9 . they shall come with weeping [for their sin see Matthew 3.6 Acts 2.37c.] and with supplication [or petition for mercy to wit unto me for pardon ] will I carry them will I lead them to the water brooks [see Matthew 5.6 John 4.14c and 7.37 c also Psalms 23.2] in a straight way [of saving doctrine of the gospel ] wherein they shall not stumble [compare John 8.12and 12.35 ]for I am father to Israel and Ephraim he is my first born [see Exodus 4 on verse 22]
\p
\v 10 . Hear the word of Israel you gentiles and declare in the isles that are afar off [Heb from far compare Proverbs 7 on verse 19] and say he that scattered Israel will gather him [Israel ] again and keep him as a shepherd doth his flock [see John 10.11.]
\p
\v 11 . For the Lord hath redeemed [or ransomed] Jacob [that is Christ will assuredly redeem his people as if it were already done] and he hath delivered [or released rescued] him from the hand of him that was stronger than he [to wit from the hand of the enemy chiefly of the devil compare Isaiah 40.10 Matthew 12.29 John 12.31 Colossians 2.15 Hebrews 2.14 1John 3.8.]
\p
\v 12 . Therefore they shall come and shout on height of Zion [to wit in the temple that is in Christian church and flow in great companies as streams of water compare Psalm 34.6 Isaiah2.2 Micah 4.1] unto the good [or goodness so below verse 14] of the Lord [that is the mercies and grace of the Lord Jesus Christ which are here as elsewhere often shadowed out by corporal mercies and favors ]for corn and for new wine and for oil and for young sheep[Heb. Children of sheep or goats or of small cattle ]and oxen and their soul shall be as water garden [filled with spiritual gifts and comforts of the holy ghost [and shall henceforth be no more sorrowful [Heb shall not add or go on any more or hence forward to be sorrowful to wit out of disconsolateness of their sins.]
\p
\v 13 . Then shall the virgin rejoice [that is the virgin shall c.] in the dance [see above verse 4] be files the young men and the old together for I will change their mourning into joy and will comfort them and will make them rejoice after their sorrow.
\p
\v 14 . And I will make the soul of the priest [of the priest [of the ministers of the church compare Isaiah 66.21] drunk with fatness [that is spiritual gifts as the priest in the old testament were wont to receive the best fat flesh both of great and small cattle that were offered in sacrifice compare the phrase with Psalms 36.9 and the annotate]and my people shall [Heb shall in the plural number ]be satisfied with my good [as above verse 12] saith the Lord.
\p
\v 15 . Thus saith the Lord there is a voice heard in Rama [that is in countries between Rama and Benjamin where Rachel died in travel and was buried Genesis 35.16,19,20 1Samuel 10.2 of Rama see Josiah 18.21,25 1 Samuel 1.1, 19 and 7.17 and 8.4c. and 25.1c.]a lamentation a very bitter weeping :[Heb. Weeping of bitterness] Rachel weeping for her children [Rachel that was long ago dead and buried is here figuratively brought in as it were weeping which she would have done if she would have lived in the time of the Babylonian desolation and Herod’s murdering the infants some understood by Rachel the mothers dwell there about descended from Rachel we may also further take Rachel for it were a church by Rachel children are here meant the children of Joseph and Benjamin the posterity of her sons which were first murdered and carried away to Babel and after the time of Christ’s nativity tyrannically butchered by Herod at Bethlehem and in the countries round about ] she refuseth herself to be comforted for her children because they are not[Heb. Because he is not that is saved and left alive see the most principal accomplishments of this prophesy Matthew 2.16,17,18 God will intimate hereby that the great spiritual joy and gladness of the Messiah shall not be without affliction and sorrow but that he will turn it again into joy as followeth.]
\p
\v 16 . Thus saith the Lord refrain thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from tears for there is a reward of thy labor [thy suffering and trouble about thy children]saith the Lord for they shall come again out of the land of enemy[thou shalt again get children enough which shall be corporally called out of Babel and spiritually out of the kingdom of darkness and shall be brought unto thee.]
\p
\v 17 . and there is expectation for thy posterity [or in thine end that is thou hast yet at last to expect much good Heb. Hindmost last uttermost see Psalm 37 on verse 37 and 109 on verse 13 and above chapter 29 on verse 11 Amos 4 on verse 2]saith the Lord for thy children [compare Isaiah 29.23c.] shall come again to their own border[Canaan and the Christian church.]
\p
\v 18 . I have indeed heard [Heb hearing heard] that Ephraim bemoaneth [others comforteth himself saying thou hast chastised me and I was chastised [that is instructed or taught concerning my duty] as an in accustomed calf [Heb untaught calf see above chapter 2 on verse 24 understand not accustomed to the yoke but want on and unruly ]turn me so shall I be turned [so Lamentations 5.21] For thou art the Lord my God.
\p
\v 19 . Surely after that I was turned I repented[compare Deuteronomy 30.2] and after that I was made known to myself [being enlightened by the holy ghost to know both myself and the grace of God ]I knocked upon my thigh [that is mourned or went sad as they do that feel much grief and pain so Ezekiel 21.17] I was ashamed yea I also blushed [or was confounded] because I did bear the reproach of my youth [which I have brought upon me and my manifold sins in former times as by youthful licentiousness and principally in the wilderness also in my flourishing state and condition of Israel’s youth see above chapter 2.2 and Hosea2.3 and 11.1c.]
\p
\v 20 . Is not Ephraim a dear son me? Assuredly [he is will God say though I do chastise him for c. is he not unto me a darling [Heb a child of recreation or delight pleasure compare Isaiah 66.12] for since I spake against him [oth. Of him] I do earnestly remember him still [Heb remembering I will remember him ] therefore my bowels make a noise for him [that is I am inwardly moved or troubled for him see Isaiah 63.15] I will surely have compassion ]upon him saith the Lord.
\p
\v 21 . Set thee up marks make thee pointed pillars [the Hebrew word Tamrurim which above verse 15 taken from another root signifying bitterness seemeth here to be taken from Tamar that is a palm-tree where idolatrous images are compared Jeremiah 10.5 which putteth up his top or point on high and so forward to signify sharp sparing pillars raised up on high pyramids high heaps of stones or stones as a palm token to know the ways by God wisheth them well to remember the way which they went to Babel because they should surely return from thence to their own land] set thine heart upon the path [or high way path or street]upon the way which thou hast walked turn again O virgin of Israel[compare above chapter 14 on verse 17 so Amos 5.2]turn again to these thy cities [from whence thou art carried captive.]
\p
\v 22 . How long wilt thou withdraw thyself [or draw outdraw about go about turn about that thou truly turnest not unto me but runnest everywhere hither and thither away from me compare Cant 5.6 and 7.1 where the Hebrew word is also found ] thou withdrawing daughter? For [or seeing also surely ] the Lord Hath created some new things compare Numbers 16.30also Isaiah 43.19] in the earth the woman shall encompass the man [or woman shall encompass a man surround that is as some conceive the church of God which is a weak woman shall conquer her enemies compared to a strong man whereunto the Hebrew word hath respect by the power of the Lord Jesus Christ and by faith John 16.33 1John 5.4 but the ancient fathers understand this of the mother of our Lord the virgin Mary who is also called a woman Galatians 4.4 who by the secret operation of the holy ghost without the concurrence of man hath conceived environed or encompassed the true valiant champion and the lion of Judah which the Messiah which indeed may truly called a creation of a new great wonder and suiteth not to be amiss to that which went before and to that which followeth the Hebrew word signifieth not only in a hostile manner to environ and besiege but also other ways to encompass surround see 1Kings 7.15,24 Palms 7.8 and 32.10 it may also be understood of the church being converted of the Jews and Gentiles that she should embrace Christ her bridegroom with great love and affection.]
\p
\v 23 . thus saith the Lord of host s the god of Israel yet shall they say in the land of Judah and in the cities whereof I shall turn away their captivity the Lord bless thee thou habitation of justice [as above chapter 50.7 meaning the church of Jesus Christ]thou mountains of holiness.
\p
\v 24 . And Judah together with the cities thereof shall dwell therein together [that is all that belong to the city of Judah shall dwell in their own cities] the husbandmen and they that travel with flock [which is a token of rest and peace in the land.]
\p
\v 25 . For I have [that is I will c as above verse 22] made the weary soul [that is the thirsty soul as thirst is occasioned by labor and weariness see Psalm 63 on verse2 to wit the soul which thirstieth after grace pardon of sin and righteousness compare Matthew 5.6 and 11.28, 29] drunken [with spiritual comfort and joy compare above verse 14] and I have replenished [satisfied with spiritual meat and drink]every sad soul.
\p
\v 26 . Upon this [or for this] I waked and beheld and my sleep was[or became ]sweet unto me.[these are the words of Jeremiah which he here inserteth to testify his spiritual joy for this glorious prophesy concerning Messiah which God revealed to him in his sleep.]
\p
\v 27 . Behold the days came saith the Lord that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with and the seed of beasts [I will indeed sort sow the house &c after the captivity of Babel corporally but especially my church with the Jews which seem here to be understood by men and with Gentiles which seem to be understood by beasts as Matthew 15.26,27 all born again by incorruptible seed of the gospel 1Peter 1.23 compare Ezekiel 36.9,10,37,38 Hosea 2.23 with the annotate Hebrew man and beasts.]
\p
\v 28 . And it shall come to pass like that as I had watched [ or have been vigilant compare above chapter 1.12 and below chapter 32.42] to pluck up and to break down and to throw down and to destroy and to inflict evil so will I watch over them to build and to plant [as above chapter 24.6] saith the Lord [the meaning is as I have vigilantly executed my threatening by punishment so will I also do on the contrary in performing my gracious promises.]
\p
\v 29 .In those days they shall say no more the fathers have eaten unripe[ and consequently sow ]grapes and the children’s teeth are grown blunt[or grow blunt dull Hebrew properly shall or should grow blunt that is our ancestors have sealed in the wilderness and afterwards we must suffer for it this was the proverb of the mocking hypocrite and impenitent murmuring of the Jews which accused God of injustice in his threatening and punishments and justified themselves see Ezekiel 18.2,3c. with the annotate.]
\p
\v 30 . But everyone shall die for his own iniquity every man that eateth the unripe grapes his teeth shall grown blunt.
\p
\v 31 . Behold the days come saith the Lord that I will make a new covenant [see Genesis 15 on verse 17, 18 see of the new covenant Hebrew 8.6,13.] with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.
\p
\v 32 . Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers [some understand this of the covenant of the law or of works written in tables or stone in regard of the following opposition and by comparing this place with 2Corinthians 3.3 ,6,7c. others understand the world covenant of grace so as the same was administered in the old testament as before the coming of Christ in the flesh under divers of types and shadows with much less clearness and meaner gifts of the holy ghost c.] in the day when I took hold of their hand [to lead them by my power and in most friendly and loving way as it were walking together hand in hand ] to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt which my covenant they disannulled [see above chapter 11.7,8 or because they disannulled or brake my covenant ] although I had married them [or was their husband or Lord over them had carried myself as their husband or Lord having the right and authority of an husband over them and dealing well with them as an husband doth with his wife compare above chapter 2.14 and Hosea 2.7,8 others and should have continued to be their husbands or Lords? As if the Lord should have saith by no means but I have despised the as some understand that the apostle hath expounded this Hebrews 9.8] saith the Lord.
\p
\v 33 . But this is the covenant which after these days I will make with the house of Israel saith the Lord I will give [Hebrews I have given that is I will certainly do it as the sequel declareth] my law in the inner most part[that is heart as is declared in the sequel compare below chapter 32.40 with the annotate ] and will write in their hearts[compare below chapter 32.39,40 Ezekiel 36.25,26,27 and 2Corinthians 3.5] and I will be a God unto them and they shall be a people unto me [as above verse 1 so chapter 24.7 and 30.22.]
\p
\v 34 . And they shall teach unto more very man in neighbor and everyman his brother saying know the Lord for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the Lord [by this God will not take away the ministry or the mutual instruction or exhortation out of the New Testament whereas he himself is the author or institutor but he will signify hereby that the clearness of the gospel and the working of the holy ghost shall be such as that they shall be no need of any great trouble or compulsion to force believers of their duty in as much as they shall be taught of the Holy Ghost and shall be moved and servently inclined thereunto by him compare this phrase with John 16.26,27 and 1John2.27 and see Isaiah 11.9 John 6.45 1Corinthians 1.5,7 and 2.10&c.] for I will forgive their iniquity [so below chapter 33.8] and remember their sins no more [see Psalms 79.8 Ezekiel 18.22 Mich.7.18with the annotate.]
\p
\v 35 . Thus saith the Lord which giveth the sin for a light by day and ordinances [or set bounds that is of their ordained course] of the moon and of the stars and of light by night [see Genesis 1.16] which cleaveth the sea [compare Isaiah 51.15] so that the waves thereof of roar the Lord of hosts [see 1Kings 18 on verse 15] is his name :
\p
\v 36 . If these ordinances [mentioned in the former verse] shall depart from before my face [that is cease from their course before me] saith the Lord then seed of Israel [that is the church] also shall cease to be a nation before my face all the days [compare Matthew 28.20 that is as the aforesaid things shall continue and remain so shall there be always a church on earth which shall be my people compare Psalms 72.5,17 and 89, 37, 38 and 102.29.]
\p
\v 37 . Thus saith the Lord if the heavens from above can be measured and the foundation of the earth beneath can be searched out then will I also cast away all the seed of Israel for all that they have done saith the Lord.
\p [that is for their sins for as much as they shall be forgiven and forgotten for the Messiah’s sake above verse 34 the Lord implieth that he will not by any means cast away from their sins.]
\p
\v 38 . Behold the days came saith the Lord that the city shall be built again to the Lord from the tower of Hananeel [see Nehemiah 3.1 and compare Ezekiel 2.1,2,3,4 and 14.10c] unto the corner gate [ see 2Kings 14 on verse 13].
\p
\v 39 . and the measuring line [others the measuring line thereof to wit of the city ]shall further go forth next to it [the corner gate ] unto the hill Gareb [that is of scabby so called according to the opinion of some because the scabby and other unclean persons were appointed to dwell there without the city by the place of execution so hat the city should be built much wider or greater than it was before] and wind about to Goth[some conceive this to be a high mountain on the outermost part of the city of David towards the west and the south.]
\p
\v 40 . And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes[hereby may be understood a valley of the Hinnom where the child were burnt to ashes see above chapter 7.31. or a place for the dead bodies or malefactors also the field that wee without dung-gate the meaning is that the church of God should in those places were formerly all heathenish abominations and pollutions were committed] and all the fields unto the brook kindred [see 2 Samuel 15 on verse 23] unto the corner of the horse gate [see Nehemiah 3.28] unto the Lord there shall be nothing plucked up again nor broken down forever [hence it appeareth that this prophesy hath not respect to the earthly Jerusalem which was destroyed by the Romans as if that should be built again but to the spiritual Jerusalem to wit the church of God compare Ezekiel 48.35 c.]
\c 32
\s Jeremiah in the siege of Jerusalem being imprisoned by King Zedekiah for his prophesies at God’s command buyeth a field taketh witnesses draweth a writing and sealeth it and delivereth it to kept for a token that the Jews should come from Babel into the own country verse 1,2c Jeremiah prayeth humble unto God with admiration of his majesty and works and representeth him his conflict for this thing 16 whereupon god assureth him that he will indeed first punish his people for their great sins and afterwards perform his promises and moreover cause his church to enjoy the grace of a new covenant both temporally and eternally both spiritually and corporally,26.
\p
\v 1 The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord [which is related in the seventh verse following] in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah this year was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
\p
\v 2 . Now the King of Babel army besieged then Jerusalem and the prophet Jeremiah was shut up in court in custody [so below verse 8.12 and 33.1 this was the easier freer larger prison than garrison house was see Below chapter 37.15,18,20,21] which is the king of Judah’s house.
\p
\v 3 . Zedekiah king of Judah has shut him up saying wherefore dost thou prophesy saying thus saith the Lord behold I will give this city into the hand of Babel and he shall take it.
\p
\v 4 . And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of chaldeans [Babylonians] but he shall surely be delivered [Hebrew being delivered be delivered ] into the hand of king of Babel and his mouth shall speak to his mouth [that is they shall speak with one another mouth to mouth as we use to say compare below chapter 34.3,4 and see the accomplishment chapter 39.5c and 52.9] and his eyes shall behold his eyes.
\p
\v 5 . And he shall carry Zedekiah to Babel and he be [that is continue as above chapter 27.22 ]until I visit him saith the Lord [that is shew mercy on him that is he perish by the sword but die in peace and be honorable buried so chapter 34.4,5 and Genesis 21 on verse 1] thou you fight against the Chaldeans yet you shall not prosper.
\p
\v 6 . Jeremiah then saith and the word of the Lord then came unto me saying:
\p
\v 7 . Behold Hananeel the son of Salome their uncle will come unto thee saying buy thee my field [of the field of the Levites see numbers 35 on verse 2] that is the Anathoth for thou hast the right of redemption [see Ruth 2 on verse 20] to buy it understand with all Gods command to Jeremiah to buy that the field at that time of him as the sequel sheweth.]
\p
\v 8 . So Hananeel mine uncles son came to me in court of the ward according to the word of the Lord and saith unto me buy my field I pray thee that is by the Anathoth which is in the land of Benjamin for thou hast the right of inheritance and thou hast the right of redemption buy it for thyself then I perceived that it was the word of the Lord [ that is that was done according to the word of the Lord.]
\p
\v 9 . Therefore I bought the field of Hananeel mine uncles and sons which is by Anathoth and I weight unto them the money[ see Genesis 23 on verse 16] seventh silvers shekels [Heb have seven shekels and ten of silver of the silver shekels see Genesis 20 on verse 16.]
\p
\v 10 . And I subscribed the letter [to wit the bond or bill of sale and purchase as followeth Heb properly I wrote in a letter that is subscribed signed it as appeareth verse 12] and sealed it and caused witness to it [to wit by subscribing or setting their hands to it as verse 12 so below verse 25.44 for which we use to say to make witnesses [when I had weighed the money in the balance.
\p
\v 11 . And I took the letter of the purchase which was sealed and according to the command and statutes and the open letter [as verse 14 whereby some understand a copy or draught transcript of the letter of the purchase others understand it a patent of retification or public decree magistrate to the confirmation of this bargain and sale in all singular and its circumstance others understand it of a letter which tend to give notice to everyone of the bargain and sale that was made .]
\p
\v 12 And I gave the letter of purchase to Baruch [the scribe and minister of prophet Jeremiah see below chapter 36.4,5c.] the son of Nereja the son of Maseejah before the eyes of Hananeel mine uncles son [ this word is here inserted from verse 7,8,9 others my cousins because the Hebrew word Dod is sometimes also taken more largely even for a dear and very loving friend as appeareth from Solomon’s songs and before the eyes of the witnesses which hath subscribed to the letter of the purchases [as above verse 10] before the eyes of all the Jews that sate [or dwelt] in the court of the ward.
\p
\v 13 . And I charged Baruch before their eyes [that is in their presence as above often.]
\p
\v 14 . Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel take these letters this letter of purchase both the sealed letter and this open letter see on verse 11] and put them in an earthen vessel that they may abide many days [that is that they may last a long time .]
\p
\v 15 . For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel there shall yet[or again ] houses and fields and vineyard be bought in this land [hence appeared what God intended by his strange translation at the time of Jerusalem siege to wit to assure his people that the Babylonian captivity should have an end and that they should come again into their own country and posses it see below verse 43.44]
\p
\v 16 . Moreover after that I have delivered the letter of purchase unto Baruch the son of Nerija I paid unto the Lord saying:
\p
\v 17 . Ah Lord behold thou hast made the heavens and the earth by thy great power and by thine outstretched arm [as Exodus 6.5c.] nothing is too wonderful for thee[to wit to do so below verse 27 Heb. Properly more wonderful than thou shouldest not be able to do it when thou doest promise it nothing is impossible unto thee compare Genesis 18 on verse 17 with the annotate Luke 1.37 and Matthew 17.26. This hath respect to the deliverance out of the Babylonians captivity which with men seemed to be a think impossible. Compare Ezech. 37.3.11,12, &c.]
\p
\v 18 . Thou that shewest loving kindness unto thousands, [Compare Exod.34.7.] and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their Children, [See Psalm 79. on vers.12. to wit, of such children, that are partakers of the sins of their fathers, and do follow their foot-steps. See Exod 20.5,6.] after them: thou great, thou mighty God, whose name is the LORD of bosts. [as above chap.31.35. See I Kings 18.on vers.15.]
\p
\v 19 . Great in counsel, and mighty in deed: [Compare Isa.28,29.] for thine eyes [this signifieth sometimes Gods special care for his people, as I Kings 8.on vers.29. Psalm 32.on vers.8. sometimes Gods providence and reward upon all that happeneth or cometh to pass in the world; as here. Compare Prov. 5.21 and 25.3. also 2 Chron.16. on vers.19.] upon all the wayes [see Genes.6. on vers.12.] of the children of men, to give every one according to his waies and according to the fruit of his dealings.) [see above chap.17. on ver.10.]
\p
\v 20 . Thou that hast set tokens and wonders in the land of Egypt, unto this day, [The remembrance whereof continueth unto this day] both in Israel, and amongst (other) men; [Hebr.man; that is, men: as often] and hast made thee a name, as it is at this day.
\p
\v 21 . And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt, by tokens, and by wonders, and by a strong hand, and by an out-strecthed arm, and by great terror. [See Exod.6.6. 2 Sam.7.23. I Chron.17.21.]
\p
\v 22 . And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them; a land flowing with milk and honey. [See Exod.3. on vers.8.]
\p
\v 23 . They also came in, and possessed it hereditarily, but obeyed not thy voice, neither walked i thy law; they ave done nothing of all, that thou hadst commanded them to do: [Hebr.all that thou, &c. they have not done; that is, they have done nothing of that which thou hadst commaned them. See I Kings 11. on ver.34.] Therefore thou hadst caused all this evil [of punishment] to meet them.
\p
\v 24 . Behold the walls [Mounts, trenches, and other works raised by thy enemy, buswarks, fortresses, without the City. See 2 Sam.20. on vers.15. Some understand other warlike instruments, set up, and serving to break and batter down walls and great strong buildings, or out of and from them to annoy and hurt the enemy with all manner of offenssive weapons. Compare below chap. 33.4.] they are come unto the City to take it, and the City is given [so vers.25,36,43. That is, it is as good (as we say) as given, it shall be affuredly given: affaires stand so within the City, as that a man may palpably perceive, that thy word is true in every particular and consequently shall be performed, as followeth] into the band of the Chaldeans that fight against it; because of the sword, and the famine, and the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken, is come to pass, and behold, thou seest (it.)
\p
\v 25 . Nevertheless thou hast said unto me, Lord LORD; Buy thee the field for money and cause witnesses to witness (it: ) whereas the City is given into the hand of the Chaldeans! [As if he had said, This is a strange and wonderful thing to mans apprehension.]
\p
\v 26 . Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremia, saying;
\p
\v 27 . Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh; [See Genes.6. on vers.2. and Numb.16. on ver.22.] should any thing be to wonderful for me? [see above on vers.17.]
\p
\v 28 .Therefore thus saith the LORD: Behold, I give this City into the hand of the Chaldeans, and unto the hand of Nebucadnezar the King of Babel; and he shall take it.
\p
\v 29 . And the Chaldeans that fight against this City; shall come into it, and set this City on fire, and shall burn it, with the houses, upon whose roofs they have burnt incense unto Baal, and offered drink offerings [As above chap.7.18.] unto other Gods, to anger me. [or, to provoke me. So in the sequel.]
\p
\v 30 . For the Children of Israel, and the children of Juda have onely done [That is, done nothing else, but &c.] that which was evil in mine eyes from their youths [see above chap.2. on vers.2.] for the children of Israel have onely provoked me to anger, by the work of their hands, saith the LORD.
\p
\v 31 . For this City hath been unto me for mine anger, and for my fury, [That is, it hath done nothing else, but that which served to provoke mine anger and fury, that hath been all their practise, all their study. Oth. in mine anger: that is, I was angry with them, &c.] from the day that they built it, unto this day: that I should remove it from my face:
\p
\v 32 . For all the wickedness of the children of Israel, and of the children of Juda, which they have committed to provoke me to anger: they, their Kings, their Princes, their Priests, and their Prophets, and the men [Hebr.man, as above chap 4.3.] of Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem:
\p
\v 33 . Which have turned the neck unto me, [See above chap.2.27.] and not the face: though I taught them, being up early and teaching, [see above chap.7. on vers.13. and vers.25. and chap.25.3. and 26.5. and 29.19.] nevertheless they hearkned not, to receive disciplines [see Prov.1. on vers.2. &c.]
\p
\v 34 . But they set their abominations [See above chap.4. on vers.1.] in the house [the Temple] which is called by my name, [as above chap.7.10.] to defile it.
\p
\v 35 . And they built the high places of Baal, [See above chap.7.31. with tha annotate.] which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass thorow (the fire) unto Molech; [that is, to the service and honour of this Idol. See Levit. 18.on vers.21.] which I commanded them not, neither came (it ) up into mine heart, [see above chap.7.31.] that they should do this abomination, that they might cause Juda to sin.
\p
\v 36 . And now therefore, thus saith the God of Israel, concerning, this City, whereof ye say; It is given [As above vers.24.] into the hand of the King of Babel, by the sword, and by the famine, and by the estilence.
\p
\v 37 . Behold I will gather them [To wit, my people] out of all countries, whithe I shall have driven them in mine anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation: [Compare above chap.23.3. and 29.14. and 31.10.] and I will bring them again into this place, and will cause them to dwell safely. [Hebr. in safety, or, in confidence; that is, quietly, safely, and securely, as elsewhere often.]
\p
\v 38 . Yea they shall be a people unto me; and I will be a God unto them. [As above chap.30.22. and 31.1.]
\p
\v 39 . And I will give them one manner of heart, [I will so work by my spirit in the hearts of mine elect, as that they shall be knit and united to one another in love by one faith and one manner of worship] and one manner of ways, [that is, one manner of worship, or, Religion, one manner or way of faith and life. See Isa.30.21. and 35.8. above chap, 6.16. Matth.22.16. Acts 9.2. and 18.25,26. &c.] to fear me all the daies; for the good of them, [that is, for their benefit, health and salvation] together with their children after them.
\p
\v 40 And I will make an everlasting covemant with them, [As above chap. 31.31 &c] that I will not turn away from after them, that I may do them good; [that is, that I will never forsake them, but will continually dwell with them and follow them with my mercy and kindness see above chapter 31 on verse 33 and compare further Romans 8.30 1 Peter 1.5,9 1John 2.19,20,27and 3.9 and 5.18] and I will give my fear in their hearts that they may not depart from me.
\p
\v 41 . And I will rejoice over them to do them good [compare Deuteronomy 30.9]and I will faithfully [Heb or with faithfulness or truth] plant them in the mind [compare above chapter 24.6 and Amos 9.15] with my whole heart and with my whole soul.
\p
\v 42 . For thus saith the Lord like as I brought all this great evil [to wit of punishments that misery or mischief adversity] upon this people so will I bring upon them all this good that I speak concerning them [that is promise or have promised them]
\p
\v 43 . And there shall be fields brought [Heb a field shall c. that is fields as in the next verse in this whereof ye say it is desolate so below chapter 33.10] so that there is neither man nor beast in it is given above verse 24 into the hands of Chaldeans.
\p
\v 44 . Men shall buy [Heb they shall c as often] fields for money and subscribe letters [see above verse 10, 12] and seal them and cause witness to witness in the land of Benjamin [compare above chapter 17.26] and in the places round about Jerusalem and in the cities of Judah and the cities of the mountains in the cities of low ground and in the cities of the south for I will turn their saith Lord.
\c 33
\s God prophesieth further of taking of Jerusalem the carrying away of the people and bringing them back from Babel as also of a blessed joyful and quiet condition verse1 c. of the sending of Christ in everlasting and settled kingdom priest hood and blessed seed 14.
\p
\v 1 Moreover the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah one time while he was shut up into the court of the prison [see above chapter 32.2, 3] saying:
\p
\v 2 . Thus saith the Lord that doth the Lord that formeth it [to wit that which he hath revealed and promised by me concerning the restoring of Jerusalem and of his church see Exodus 2.14,15 others the maker thereof namely Jerusalem and his church whereof is spoken in that went before and in that which followeth ] that formeth it [or the former thereof the meaning being all one ]to establish it the Lord being his name.
\p
\v 3 . Call unto me [that is pray servently ye my people or thou Jeremiah that art here shut up in prison see Job 36 on verse 16] and I will make known unto thee great and firm things [which are firmly determined by me and as it were locked up in the secret counsel and therefore are most firm and sure compare Deuteronomy 30.34.] which thou knowest not.
\p
\v 4 . For thus saith the Lord the God of Israel concerning the houses of this city and of the inhabitants thereof shall be without any human hope or appearance or restoration yet will I restore it as followeth verse 6]and concerning the houses of the king of Judah which are broken down by the mounts and by the swords [that is which shall be suddenly and certainly broken down where the Chaldeans by means of their mounts and bulwarks which they shall cast up shall take the city warlike means and by force of arms compare Ezekiel 26.9 as above chapter 32.on verse 24 others for mounts and for the swords that is the houses that are broken down to make the bulwarks of them against the enemy and to make opposition and resistance out of them.]
\p
\v 5 . There are indeed [to wit saith the Lord verse 4] some come n to fight against the Chaldeans [to wit into the city of Jerusalem to defend it against the besiegers as against the time of a siege men are wont to the chief city with valiant soldiers [but it is so to fill them with the dead bodies of men [to fill that is to satiate them that they wreck their malice by killing and destroying the Jews concerning such word of fill compare Exodus 15.9 Job 16.10 with the annotate by them is meant here the Chaldeans which seek nothing else but to kill and slay others understand the houses that is as they expound it families whereof mention is made in the former verse ] whom I have slain [that is will slay by the sword of the Chaldeans instead that they will intend in my manner that they intend to slay the Chaldeans ] in mine anger and in mine fury because I have hid my fury from this city [ see Deuteronomy 31.17] for all the wickedness thereof [that is of inhabitants other for all whose to wit families wickedness I have hid from this city.]
\p
\v 6 . Behold I will cause health and cure to rise [or lay a plaster or give physic see above chapter 30.13, 17] unto it [to wit to the city of Jerusalem to my church ] and will cure them [the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the members of the church ] and will reveal unto them [unaware and beyond all hope and expectation ] abundance of peace and truth [by the Messiah compare John 1.12 others of a constant durable or sure peace.]
\p
\v 7 . And I will turn the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel [compare above chapter 32.34] and will build them [see above chapter 31.28] as the first [or in the beginning so verse 11 that is aforetime.]
\p
\v 8 . And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity thereby they have sinned against me and have pardoned all their iniquities whereby they have sinned against me and whereby they have transgressed against me [compare above chapter 31.34.]
\p
\v 9 . And it [namely Jerusalem and my church] shall be to me a joyful name [Heb name of joy that is which will be very acceptable unto me and will make me joyful and glad ] a praise and an ornament among all the heathen of the earth [compare Deuteronomy 26.19 with the annotate ] which shall hear all the good I do unto them and they shall fear and all the trouble for all the good and for all the peace that I procure [Heb make do] unto it.
\p
\v 10 . Thus saith the Lord in the place whereof ye say it is desolate so that there is neither a man nor beast in it [as above chapter 32.41] in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are so wasted as that there is neither man nor inhabitant nor beasts in them shall be heard again.
\p
\v 11 . The voice of joy and the voice of gladness and the voice of bridegroom and the voice of the bride [as above chapter 7.34 ]the voice of them that say praise the Lord of hosts [see 1Kings 18 on verse 15] for the Lord is good for his mercy is forever the voice of them that bring praise [or thanksgiving praise offering or praise offering ] to the house of the Lord for I will turn the captivity of the land [or cause the captives of the land to return so below verse 26 and elsewhere often ]as at the first[ that is they being returned out of captivity shall dwell peaceable in this land as aforetimes compare verse 7] saith the Lord.
\p
\v 12 . Thus saith the Lord of hosts in this places which so desolate as that there is no man in it even unto the cattle as also in all the cities whereof shall be again habitations of shepherds [Heb an habitation c] that cause their flocks to lay down [in token of peaceable condition and of a well ordered government as also the sequel declareth compare chapter above 31.2.]
\p
\v 13 . in the cities of the mountains in the cities of the law grounds and in the cities of the south in the land of Benjamin and in the places round about Jerusalem and in cities of Judah shall the flock pass again under the hands of a teller [that is of a tithing man that snore of the tenth sheep or goat with rod and set it apart for the Lord see hereof Leviticus 27 on verse 32and Ezekiel 20 on verse 37.]
\p
\v 14 . Behold the days come saith the lord that I will provoke [or establish settle that is keep as we use to say] that good word [that is gracious and blessed promise concerning Christ in whom all the promises are yea and Amen 2Corinthians 1.20]which I have spoken unto [or concerning of ] the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.
\p
\v 15 . In those days and at that time will I cause a BRANCH of righteousness[see above chapter 23 on verse 5] to grow up unto David and he shall do judgments and justice on earth [as a king see above chapter 23 on verse 5.]
\p
\v 16 . In those days shall Judah be delivered and shall Jerusalem stay safely [see above chapter 23 on verse 6]and this is he that shall call her the LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS [to wit the Lord Christ who shall call his church to wit outwardly by preaching of his gospel and inwardly by powerful working of the holy spirit and shall perfect his work of grace unto the end [see above chapter 23 on verse 6.]
\p
\v 17 . For thus saith the Lord a man shall not be cut off unto David to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel [see 1Kings 2 on verse 4 by these and the following words which are borrowed from the estate of the old testament concerning the kingdom of priesthood of our Lord Jesus Christ see Luke 1.32,33Hebrews 7.1,2,3,11,12,15,16,17,24,28 c. who moreover hath under him not only pastors and teachers of the church but also all the members thereof whom he hath made all kings and priests wherefore his church is also called a royal priesthood see 1Peter 2.5,9 Revelations 1.6 and 5.10 also Romans 12.1 Hebrew 13.15,16.]]
\p
\v 18 . Neither shall a man be cut off unto a Levitical priest from before my face to offer burnt offerings and to kindle meat offering and to prepare slay-offerings all days [that is forever.]
\p
\v 19 . And the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah saying:
\p
\v 20 . Thus saith the Lord if you can disannul the covenant of the night [that is the order that I have set upon the course and the revolutions of the day and night compare Genesis 8.22 Psalms 89.37,38 and 119.89,90,91 and above chapter 31.35,36] so that they should not be day and night in their season.
\p
\v 21 . Then may also my covenant be disannulled in David my servant that should not have a son to reign upon his throne and with the Levites [understand with all the covenant with c] the priest my ministers.
\p
\v 22 . As the host of heaven can not be numbered neither the sand of the sea measured so will I multiply the seed of David my servant and the Levite [ oth. Of the Levites to wit seed ]that minister unto me.
\p
\v 23 . Moreover the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah saying:
\p
\v 24 . Hast thou not seen [that is perceived or heard ] what this people [to wit the scornful Jews that despised the [promises of God and murmured against his judgment as or as some the wicked Chaldeans and the other Gentiles to whom they in a special manner apply the last words of this verse ]speaketh?[Heb. Speak as often ] saying the two families [ Judah and Israel of whom is spoken above others understand Judah and Benjamin]which the Lord hath chosen them hath he now cast off yea they despised my people so that its no more a nation before their face [or shall not be again c because they were so mean and miserable as that in that there was no other account to be made but that they should perish and come to nothing below chapter 48.2,42.]
\p
\v 25 . Thus saith the Lord if my covenant be not of day and night [see on verse 20 these things God repeateth fro the raising up and strengthening of those that believe in him as if he should say how greatly so ever this thing may be beyond all hope and appearance of man yet it shall as little fail as the intercourse of the day and night] if I had not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth [see above chapter 31.35,36.]
\p
\v 26 . Then will I also cast away the seed of David my servant and of Jacob that I should not take some of his seed to rule over the seed of Abraham Isaac and Jacob[this indeed was first accomplished in Zerubabel and other following governors of David’s family but it is principally and spiritually accomplished in our Lord Jesus Christ the branch of David and the ever last king of his church ]for I will turn their captivity and have mercy on them[compare above chapter 31.20]
\c 34
\s God causeth it to be told to king Zedekiah by prophet what shall befall of Jerusalem and his own person and what end he shall have verse1 c. And for as much as the people by a solemn covenant had set at liberty all servant according to the law but afterwards when the Babylonian were departed from the city and had left the siege brought them again into bondage God foretelleth them that he will come again to destroy Jerusalem and all the land and in a special manner to punish those covenant breakers, 8.
\p
\v 1 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord when Nebuchadnezzar [otherwise called in this book and Ezekiel for the most part of Nebuchadnezzar ] king of Babel and all his army and all the kingdom of the earth that were under the dominion of his hand and all the nations fought against Jerusalem and against the cities thereof [see 2Kings 25.1]saying:
\p
\v 2 . Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel go thy ways and speak to Zedekiah the king of Judah and say unto him thus saith the Lord and give this city into the hand of the king of Babel and he shall burn it fire [compare above chapter 21 .10 and 32.29.]
\p
\v 3 . And thou shalt not escape out of his hand and shalt surely be taken[ Heb taking betaken] and delivered into the hand and thine eyes shall behold into the eyes of the king of Babel and his mouth shall speak unto thy mouth [compare above chapter 32.4 and below 52.9,10,11.]
\p
\v 4 . But hear the word of the Lord O Zedekiah king of Judah thus saith the Lord of thee thou shalt not die by the sword [compare above chapter 32.5 with the annotate.]
\p
\v 5 . Thou shalt die in peace and according to the burning [or with the burnings ]for thy fathers the former kings which were before thee so shall they burn thee [that is as they have honored thy predecessors at their burials with fires and burning of all manner of precious spices so shall it likewise be done unto thee see here 2Chronicles 16.14 with the annotate.] and lament thee saying Ah Lord![compare above chapter 22 on verse 18,19] for I have spoken the word saith the Lord.
\p
\v 6 . And Jeremiah the prophet spake these word unto king of Judah at Jerusalem:
\p
\v 7 . When the king of Babel’s army fought against Jerusalem [hereby is intimated the obedience godly boldness and confidence of Jeremiah who was not afraid as matters then stood to tell king Zedekiah that which was commanded by him by God ]and against all remaining cities of Judah against Lachis [see 2Kings 14 on verse 19] and against Azeka [see 1Samuel 17 on verse 1]for these being defense cities [Heb cities of defense ]remained among the cities of Judah.
\p
\v 8 .The word that came unto Jeremiah from the Lord after that king Zedekiah had made a covenant[ see the manner of this covenant making below verse 18.19 and compare Genesis 15 on verse 17,18] with all the people which were at Jerusalem [meaning all those that had servants ]to proclaim liberty for them [to wit all man servants and maid-servants in the seventh year according to the law below verse 13.14 see Exodus 21 .2 this Zedekiah did that by this work of obedience he might obtain deliverance and victory from God but how they meant and kept it after the manner of hypocrites is related in the sequel.]
\p
\v 9 . That every man should let his man-servants and every man his maid-servant being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess go free so that none shalt cause himself to be served of them [see above chapter 22 on verse 13] of a Jew his brother.
\p
\v 10 . Now all the princes and all the people which had entered in the covenant heard [that is obeyed as straightway again and elsewhere often ]that they should let everyone his servant go free so that they should cause themselves no more to be served of them they then heard let them go.
\p
\v 11 . But afterwards they returned and caused the maid-servants and the hand maid whom they had let go free to return [ to their former service so verse 16]and they brought them into subjection for servants and for hand maids [this they seemed to have done because the Babylonians were departed from Jerusalem and were gone against the Egyptians vainly imagining that they had now escaped all danger whereas on the contrary they provoked the wrath of God a new against themselves see below verse 21.22]
\p
\v 12 . Therefore the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying:
\p
\v 13 . Thou saith the Lord the God of Israel I have made a covenant with your fathers in the day when I bought them forth out of the land of Egypt and out of the house of bondage [Heb. House of bond-men]saying:
\p
\v 14 . At the end of the seven years ye shall let go every man his brother an Hebrew which shall be sold unto thee [or which shall have sold himself unto thee] and hath served thee six years thou shalt then let him go free [see Deuteronomy15.12 Exodus 21.2] but your fathers hearkened out thus unto me neither inclined their ear.
\p
\v 15 . Ye were now returned [or had turned to wit in outward shew as much as concerned the outward work] this day and had done that which was right in mine eyes proclaiming liberty everyman for his neighbor and ye had made a covenant before my face in the house which is called by my name [see above chapter 7 on verse 10 understand the temple.]
\p
\v 16 . But ye again turned aside and have profaned my name [which ye have used in the oath of the covenant] and caused everyone his man-servant and everyone his hand-maid whom he had let go free according to their mind [or desire wish pleasure will Heb. Soul see Psalms 27 on verse 12 others for themselves for their persons that is to be their own man or woman and to be free]to return [as above verse 11] and ye have brought them into subjection to be unto ye for servants and for hand-maids.
\p
\v 17 . Therefore thus saith the Lord ye have not hearkened unto me to proclaim liberty everyone for his brother and everyone for his neighbor behold therefore I proclaim a liberty against ye saith the Lord for the sword for the pestilence and for the famine [ an elegant alteration or varying of the words of proclaiming liberty before for good but here for evil that is for punishment which God in his just judgment will execute upon them and cause to rage among them some render it to the sword c as if God had saith I will give liberty to the sword to the pestilence c to range amongst ye ] and I will give you up for commotion into all the kingdoms of the earth [see Deuteronomy 28 on verse 25 above chapter 15.4 and 24.9c]
\p
\v 18 . And I will deliver the man that have transgressed my covenant that have not confirmed [have not really performed not kept Heb properly cause to rise or arise see Deuteronomy 27.26 and below chapter 35 on verse 14] the words of the covenant which they have made before my face with the calf which they had hewn in twain and had passed between the parts thereof [ see Genesis 15 on verse 17,18 others when the calf c that is I will cause them to be torn in pieces that is fowl c as verse 20.]
\p
\v 19 . The princes of Judah and the princes of Jerusalem the Chamberlains [or courtiers see genesis 37 on verse 36] and the priest and all people of the land which had passed through the parts of the calf.
\p
\v 20 . Yea I will deliver them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their soul [that is that seek their life see Exodus 4 on verse 19 and 2 Samuel 4 on verse 8 so in the next verse] and their dead bodies [Heb dead body as above chapter 7 on verse 33] and shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven and the beasts of the earth [as above chapter 7.33 and 16.4 and 19.7.]
\p
\v 21 . Even Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I deliver into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their soul to wit into the hand of the king of Babel’s army which are now gone up from you [that is are marched away from Jerusalem and are marched up against the king of Egypt see above on verse 11 on below verse 37.5,11 who was upon the march to come and help Zedekiah.]
\p
\v 22 . Behold I will give command saith the Lord and will bring them again to this city[that is I will so rule and order the matter by my providence as that the Chaldeans shall come again compare Leviticus 25 on verse 21 and above chapter 25 on verse 29 Amos 6.11 and 9.9.]And they shall fight against it and shall take it and shall burn it with fire and shall make the cities of Judah a desolation that shall dwell in them.
\c 35
\s Jeremiah’s at God’s command gathereth the Rehabites together and inviteth them to drink wine verse1 &c but they refuse to do it because of the prohibition of the Jonadab their father 6by which example God convinceth his disobedient and impenitent people and foretelleth them their destruction 12 but he promiseth his blessing the Rehabites 18.
\p
\v 1 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of Jojakim the son of Josiah [see above c 1.3 and 21.1 and 25.1 & 28.1 & 32.1 by comparing of which places which appeareth that in the gathering of these prophesies together there is not always respect had to the order of time compare below chapter 45 on verse1 and Ezekiel 30 on verse 20] king of Judah saying:
\p
\v 2 . Go thy ways to the house of Richabites [that is to the family or stock of the Richabites so presently verse 3 see of these 1Chronicles 2 on verse 55]and speak with them and bring them into the house of the Lord into one of the chambers [ which were by the temple see 1 Kings 6 on verse 5] and give them [that is offer them present unto them fill them c] wine to drink.
\p
\v 3 . Then I took Jazanja the son of Jeremiah the son of Habazinia together with the brethren and all his sons and the whole house of Rachabite.
\p
\v 4 . And brought them into the house of the Lord into the chamber of son of Henan the son of Jegdalia the son of God [that is the prophet see Deuteronomy 33 on verse 1 and Judges 13 on verse 6] which [to wit chamber] is by the chamber of the chief ones [or princes that is rulers meaning of the temple or sanctuary see Isaiah 43.28 as there were priests and Levites and principally the high priest and the next to him such Hebrew words are used both of Ecclesiastical and political functions compare above chapter 20 on verse 1 and 29.26 also Genesis 41 on verse 45 Numbers 3.32 1Corinthians 12.28c] which is above the chamber of the Maaseja son of sallum the keeper of the threshold [these circumstances served to bring more credit and respect unto the thing among the obstinate Jews .]
\p
\v 5 . And I set before the children of the house of the Rachabites [Heb before the face of the children &c as Genesis 18.8c] cups [or bowl the Hebrew word agreeth almost with another word which signifieth an high cup bowl or beaker c see Genesis 44 on verse 2 the following words signifieth also beakers or such drinking vessels whose difference is now uncertain ]full of wine and beakers and I said unto them drink wine.
\p
\v 6 . But they said we will drink no wine [that is may or must drink no wine [for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father [that is forefather] commanded us [or forbad us see Leviticus 4 on verse 2] saying ye shall drink no wine ye nor your children forever [that is never 1 Corinthians 8.13.]
\p
\v 7 . Neither shall ye built house nor sow seed nor plant vineyard nor have [that is possess] any but ye shall dwell in tents all your days [that is all the days of your lives so in the next verse ]that ye may live many days [that is a long time in the land ] where ye sourjon [for as much as many conceive so as Jonadab here mentioned is the same that is mentioned 2Kings 10 15,23 having been a very godly honorable person so that John also desired to strengthen himself in his zeal in his new estate by the company and presence of his man this Jonadab according to the opinion of some wisely considering his pedigree and corruption that were ripe and common in those times peradventure also foreseeing by a prophetical spirit the future judgment and desolation would reach and instruct his posterity by these particular and special commands that they being contented with this mercy and that they were admitted into the fellowship of God & his church should for the time to come demean themselves so refrained humble and lowly or mean as that like strangers in Israel descended from Jethro Moses father-in-law they might not be distasteful or offensive unto the Israelites as strangers are wont soon to give offence also that they should beware that through covetousness or pleasure and delight they might corrupted and punished with others or by professing of good and inheritance fall not into trust and confidence of temporal riches and so be hindered in the time of exile spoiling of goods c what God further aimed by his example of the Richabites appeareth by this whole transaction which Jeremiah by command of him had with them.]
\p
\v 8 . Thou have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rachab our father in all that he had charged that we drink wine all our days we our wives our sons and our daughters.
\p
\v 9 . And so that we build our houses for our dwellings [or for our abode] neither have we vineyard nor seed nor field.
\p
\v 10 . And we have dwelt in tents that have we hearkened and done all according to Jonadab our father hath commanded us.
\p
\v 11 . But it came to pass when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel marched up towards this land that we said [to wit unto each other] come and let us go to Jerusalem because the army of the Chaldeans [Heb from the face &c that is to escape them for fear of their violence and tyranny ]and because of the army of the Syrians [Heb Aram see Genesis 10 on verse 22] so we abode at Jerusalem [in this verse they give a reason why in this one thing namely that now did not dwell in the tents but lived in the city of Jerusalem: that at this present followed not their fathers charge shewing thereby that it was a human ordinance which in time of need and as occasion required they might without breach of duty very well wave that they might not transgress the law of God this was also Jonadab’s intention and was pleasing and acceptable unto God.]
\p
\v 12 . Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah saying:
\p
\v 13 . Thus saith the Lord of host the God of Israel go thy ways and say unto the man [Heb man see above chapter 4 on verse 3]of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem will ye not receive discipline [as above chapter 32.33]that ye hearken unto my words saith the Lord?
\p
\v 14 . The words of Jonadab the son of Rachab which he commanded his children that they should drink no wine are confirmed [Heb is confirmed that is everyone of this word is performed or kept not withstanding that they through necessity hath now done otherwise through in one particular point wherein they were to be excused so verse 16 compare further Deuteronomy 29.26 with the annotate and below verse 18 also above chapter 34.18 and below chapter 44.25]for they have drunk none unto this day but have hearkened to [that is obeyed ]the commandment of their father and I have spoken unto you being up early and speaking [see above chapter 7 on verse 13 and 2Chronicles 36 on verse 15]see also above chapter 11.7 and 25.3 and 26.5 and 29.19 and 32.33] but ye have not hearkened unto me .
\p
\v 15 . And I have sent you unto all my servants the prophets being up early and sending to say return now every man from his evil way [see Genesis 6 on verse 12 compare above chapter 18 on verse 21 and 25.5]and make your dealings good [see above chapter 7 on verse 3]and walk not after Gods to serve them so shall remain in the land that is so shall ye surely remain dwelling in it see Psalms 37 on verse 3] which I have given to you and to your fathers but ye have not inclined your ear nor hearkened unto me.
\p
\v 16 . Because then the children of Jonadab the son of Rachab have confirmed[see above verse 14] the commandments of their fathers which commanded them but this people hearken unto me :
\p
\v 17 . Therefore thus saith the Lord the God of hosts the God of Israel behold I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil [of punishment] that I have spoken against them because I have spoken unto them that they have not heard and I have not called unto them but they have not answered.
\p
\v 18 . Now Jeremiah saith unto the house of Rachabite thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel because ye have been obedient to the commandment of Jonadab your father and kept all his commandments and done all according to all he hath commanded you.
\p
\v 19 . Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel there shall not a man be cut off unto Jonadab the son of Rachab[compare the phrase with above chapter 33.17 ] to stand before my face [that is unto whom I will shew unto this mercy shall have place in mine house that is among my people or in my church to minister unto me according to my word the phrase seemeth to be taken from the priests and Levits that stood in the Tabernacle and temple to minister before the Lord and consequently in general servants and hand-maids that were to be continually about in the sight of their masters to wait upon them see Deuteronomy 10 on verse 8 also Deuteronomy 1on verse 38 and 1Kings 1 on verse 2 some understand this plainly of the preservation and continuation of this family of Rachabites amongst the Israel as long as the judicial common wealth should continue by compare above verse 7 of the priestly or Levitical state it can not be meant because they were not of the tribe of Levi yea even no Israelites but strangers as is related above and Gentiles by descent wherefore they are observed by some as a type of the calling of the Gentiles and as a spiritual priesthood of faith ]al the days [as above chapter 33.17.]
\c 36
\s Jeremiah at Gods command causeth Baruch to write his prophesies in a great roll and upon a day of humiliation to read out of it in the house of the Lord before all the people verse1c. this is told to the king princes who presently sent to the Baruch with the roll and before them they report the matter unto king Jojakim 11 who causeth the roll to be fetch and having caused a part of it to be read he cutteth he roll in pieces and casteth it into fire and burneth it though many of the princes discarded him from it 21 He commanded Jeremiah and Baruch to be apprehended which God preventeth 26 Jeremiah at God’s command causeth all these and more such like prophesies to be written again in another roll and foretelleth the king the city and the land his judgments.
\p
\v 1 Also it came to pass in the forth year of Jojakim the son of Josiah [see above chapter 25] king of Judah that this word came unto Jeremiah from the Lord saying :
\p
\v 2 . Take the a roll of a book [the word Sepher which is taken for a book signifieth in general all manner of writings letters patents maps c see above chapter 32,11,12c Deuteronomy 24.1 2Kings 5.5,6 and here a roll of a book may be as to say as a written roll instead of a book serving to be written upon all rolled together see further Ezra 6 on verse 2 hence is the phrase the heavens shall be rolled together as a book Isaiah 34.4 Revelations 6.14 compare Isaiah 8.1 ]and write upon it all the words that I have spoken unto thee [as above chapter 30.2] concerning Israel and concerning Judah and concerning all the nations from the day that I spake unto thee from the days of Josiah [see above chapter 1.2] unto this day.
\p
\v 3 . It may be that those of the house of Judah may hear [Heb the house of Judah will hear ]all the evil [of punishment] which I think to do unto them [this serveth to prove the people’s desperate obstinacy who where now so far declined as that they remained no means but threatening of evil]that they may return everyone from his evil way that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin [it may be c it is spoken of the all knowing God after the manner of man to shew acceptable to him true repentance is compare Deuteronomy 5 on verse 29 so also in the word thinking and elsewhere often.]
\p
\v 4 . Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Nerija and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord which he spoken unto him upon the roll of a book.
\p
\v 5 . And Jeremiah commanded Baruch and said I am detained [or shut up which some understand of some imprisonment or confinement from above chapter 33.1 where some Hebrew word is used but others judging that this doth not well agree with below verse 19 take it for some other impediment as by a special command of God or some outward legal uncleanness or religious vow see Numbers 19.11c 1Samuel 21 on verse 7 Nehemiah 6 on verse 10] I shall not be able to go into the house of the Lord.
\p
\v 6 . Therefore go thou thy ways and read in the roll in which thou hast written from thy mouth the words of the Lord before the ears of the people in the house of the Lord upon the fasting day [which they themselves extraordinarily thought to good keep observing doubtless by sundry tokens that God was provoked to anger see below verse 9] and thou shalt also read them below the ears of Judah that came out of their cities [to Jerusalem upon their fasting day as below verse 9.]
\p
\v 7 . It may be their supplication will fall down before the Lord’s face [that is it may be they will fall down by humble supplication and prayer or present their supplication before him it may be likewise taken thus that as prayer is said to ascend in respect of faith so may it also justly be said to fall down before the Lord in respect of humility and confession of our unworthiness some take falling for well pleasing gracious acceptable as below chapter 37.20 compare also chapter 38.26 and chapter 42.2,9] and they will return everyone from his evil way and great is the anger and fury which the Lord hath pronounced against this people [that is great are the judgments miseries plagues which they threatened them if they repent not .]
\p
\v 8 . And Baruch the son of Nerija did according to what Jeremiah the prophet hath commanded him reading that the book of the word of the Lord in the house of the Lord.
\p
\v 9 . For it came to pass in the fifth year of Jojakim the son of Josiah king of Judah in the ninth month [of the year they in called the Ecclesiastical year the month Chisleu or Caslue agreeing with our November and December ]that they proclaimed a fast before the face of the Lord to make a confession of sins before him in the house and to entreat him for mercy for which end the fast was very conductible means but how God esteemed the fats of the wicked and of the hypocrites see thereof Isaiah 58.3,4,5c.] to all the people of Jerusalem as also to all the people that came [or were come ] from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem .
\p
\v 10 . Then read Baruch in the book of the word of Jeremiah in the house of the Lord in the chamber [or at ,or by the chamber see the building of these chabmbers 1Kings 6.5,6 with the annotate ]of Gemaria the son of Saphan the scribe [that is he whom registered the public act of Gods house and the prophesies hat were there read and pronounced as some conceive or the scribe of which see Ezra 7 on verse 6 Hebrew word is otherwise taken on verse 12 where it signifieth the King secretary]in the upper court [ otherwise called according to the opinion of some the court of the priest distinct from the great court of congregation that was by it see 2Chronicles 4 on verse 9but some understand this of the inner and upper part of the court of the people it may that he was in the window of one of the chambers that was in the court and read before the people that were in the court ]at the door of the new gate of the house of the Lord [see above chapter 26 on verse 10] before the ears of all the people.
\p
\v 11 . Now when Micaja the son of Gamria the son of Saphan had heard out of the book the word of the Lord.
\p
\v 12 . Then he went to the kings house into Scribes chamber [that is the kings secretary chamber and into the scribes chamber that is into the secretary’s office chancery or council chamber see 1Kings 4 on verse3 this scribe is presently called Elisama] and lo all the princes sat there the scribe and Pelaja the son of Semaja and Elnathan [see above chapter 26.22]the son of Achbor and Gemaria [whether this be the same man mentioned above verse 10 in respect of his authority and experience as Ecclesiastical historian or scribe as Ezra was employed in this council or consultation on the fast day or it were another one of the princes whereof some conceive that the chiefest are here named in judicious reader may consider]the son of Saphan and Zedekiah the son the son of Hananja and all the princes.
\p
\v 13 . And Micaja made known unto them all the word that he had heard when
\p Baruch read out of that book before the ears of the people [whether he did this out of good intention to give the princes to consider how they should turn away Gods anger as some will gather them thence that the princes having heard this report carried themselves civilly towards Baruch and were moved threat and took care of safety of Jeremiah and Baruch as followeth or whether he sought to bring Jeremiah into trouble for it uncertain compare above chapter 20.10.]
\p
\v 14 . Then all the princes sent Jehundi the son of Nethanja the son of Selemja the son of Cuschi unto Baruch so say the roll wherein thou hast read before the ears of the people take that in thine hand and come so Baruch the son of Nerija took the roll in his hand and came unto them .
\p
\v 15 . And they said unto him sit down now and read it[read the roll that is thou hast written therein] before our ears and Baruch read before their ears.
\p
\v 16 . And it came to pass when they heard all the words that they were afraid the one against the other [Heb the men or everyone against the neighbor or companion that is they looked upon one another with fear and amazement the one looked upon the other]and they said unto Baruch we will surely make known all these words unto the king [Or we must wholly c Hebr. We will making known make known c.]
\p
\v 17 . And they asked Baruch saying tell us now how didst thou write all these words at his mouth?
\p
\v 18 . And Baruch said unto them he read all these unto me out of his mouth [or he called he spake aloudout of his mouth unto me word by word]and I wrote them with ink[the Hebrew word rendered here ink is found in this place ]in this book [ that is in this write or roll.]
\p
\v 19 . Then said the princes unto Baruch go thy ways hide thee thou and Jeremiah and let no man know where ye are.
\p
\v 20 . Then went into the king into court[of the kings palace] but they laid away the roll [to wit under some body custody as this phrase is found2Chronicles 12.10or they kept they gave to keep as Levit 6.4 and below chapter 37.21]in the chamber of Elisama the scribe and they told all those words before the ears of the king.
\p
\v 21 . Then the king sent Jehundi [of whom above verse 14] to fetch [ Heb to take that is to take and bring for which we use to say to fetch see Genesis 12 on verse 15]the roll and he fetched it out of the chamber of Elisama the scribe and Jehudi read it before the ears of the king and before the ears of all prince that stood about the king[or before the king over against him round about him .]
\p
\v 22 . Now the king sate in the winter house [as king and other great man had divers withdrawing places as winter houses and summer houses see Judges 3.20 Ezra6.2 Amos 3.15with the annotate ]in the ninth month [as above verse 9] and there was a fire on the earth kindled before his face [Heb properly and the earth was kindled or burning before his face that is a fire on the heart some understand a pan o fire full of burning coals on which they burnt wood the Hebrew word is only so found in this place .]
\p
\v 23 . And it came to pass when Jehudi had read three or four parcels [Heb doors that is columns for which we now use the word sides or leaves and chapters of a book ] he cut it [the king cut the roll in pieces] with a writing knife [Heb. Properly a writer razor that is a pen knife as we call it ]and cast it into the fire which was on the heart until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the heart.
\p
\v 24 . They were not afraid nor rent their garments [as they were wont to do in sorrow or mourning see Genesis 37 on verse 29 and 2Kings 18 on verse 37 and 19.1 and 22.11but they compiled with the king having forgotten their former remorse verse 16] neither the king nor all his servants [that is none of his officers nor courtier that were about him] that had heard all these words.
\p
\v 25 . Nevertheless also Elnathan and Delaja and Gemaria made intercession with the king that he would not burn the roll but he hearkened not unto them [or so he hearkened not indeed unto them.]
\p
\v 26 . Moreover the king commanded Jerameel the son of Hamalech [or the kings son that is his own son so below chapter 38.6] and Zeruja the son of Azriel and Selemia the son of Abdeel to apprehend [ so is the Hebrew word which otherwise signifieth to take and consequently to fetch also used Proverbs 24.11and below chapter 39.5] Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet but the Lord had hid them.
\p
\v 27 . Then the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah after that the king had burnt the roll and the words which Baruch had written on the mouth of Jeremiah saying:
\p
\v 28 . Take thee again [Heb. Return take that is take again as often ]another roll and write upon it all the first words that are upon the first roll which Jojakim the king of Judah hath burnt.
\p
\v 29 . And thou shalt say[ meaning hereafter in time to come for as much as he was in time by advice of princes and the care of God for him hidden see verse 19.26 but God could easily when he pleased so restrain the kings pride and cruelty as that he was fain to suffer Jeremiah to come into the presence and to hear him speak unto him]to Jojakim [others of Jojakim that is thou shalt in thy prophesies write of him by command from me ] the king of Judah thus saith the Lord thou hast burnt this roll saying [that is thus ] the king of Babel shall certainly come [Heb. Coming come.] and destroy this land and shall cause to cease in it man and beasts [ Heb. From thence or there from c that is that there shall be no more.]
\p
\v 30 . Therefore thus saith the Lord of Jojakim the king of Judah he shall have none to sit upon the throne of David [meaning no son to succeed him in the kingly government for this Jechonia or Jojakim reigned but three months which can not be counted as sitting and was then carried away to Babel 2Kings 24.8,12and Zedekiah who succeeded in his room was not Jojakim’s son but his brother being called before Mattania 2Kings 24.17]and his dead body shall be cast away in the day to the heat in the night to the frost [compare above chapter 22 verse 19 with the annotate.]
\p
\v 31 . And I will visit [that is punish see Genesis 21on verse1] upon him and upon his seed upon his servants [as above verse 24] their iniquity and I will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem and upon the man of Judah and all the evil that I have spoken unto them [and which was contained in the former roll] but they hearkened not.
\p
\v 32 . then Jeremiah took another roll and gave it to Baruch the scribe the son of Nerija who wrote thereupon from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jojakim the king of Judah hath burnt with fire and they added unto them many like words.
\c 37
\s Zedekiah though disobedient yet sendeth to Jeremiah to request his intercession to God for him forasmuch as it seemed that the Chaldeans being engaged against Pharaoh might indeed wholly leave the siege verse1,2 c but obtaineth an answer that Pharaoh would desist and that the Chaldean should return and take and burn the city though they were never so few and weak 6 so Jeremiah upon occasions of the Chaldeans breaking up seeketh to go forth out of the city but is apprehended and brought unto the princes bitten and put into a loath form prison 11 from whence Zedekiah secretly causeth him to be fetch to hear some comfortable thing of him but still hath the same answer yet at his request causeth him to be brought again to the former prison 16.
\p
\v 1 And Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned being king [see the same phrase above chapter 23.5] instead of Conia the son of Jojakim[ see of him above chapter 22 on verse 24 others king Zedekiah reigned instead c some conceive that this phrase here is so used of Zedekiah because Conia otherwise called Jechonia or Jojakim his predecessors had reigned but three months and was not reputed as king compare above chapter 36.30 with the annotate] with Zedekiah[see 1Kings 24 on verse 17]Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel had make king in the land of Judah.
\p
\v 2 . But he hearkened not hear nor his servant [that is officers and courtiers ] nor the people of the land unto the word of the Lord which he spake by ministry[Heb hand ] of the prophet Jeremiah.
\p
\v 3 . Yet King Zedekiah sent Juchal the son of Selemja and Zephanja the son of Maaseja the priest unto the prophet Jeremiah to say pray now unto the Lord our God for us [see the prosecution of this verse 6.]
\p
\v 4 . For Jeremiah was yet coming in or going out in the midst of the people [that is he conversed yet freely among the people performing his office without any let hindrance at all compare Deuteronomy 31 on verse 2] and they had not yet put him into prison [Heb properly house of shutting up or detention restraint so below verse 15,18 as if we should say lock house verse 15 called also the house of bond that is of bond as if we should say binding house.]
\p
\v 5 . And Pharaoh’s army [the king of Egypt’s army who Zedekiah and the Jews had called to their aid and assistance against Nebuchadnezzar of this name Pharaoh see Genesis 12 on verse 15] was marched forth out of Egypt and the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem when they had heard the report of them [of the Egyptians]then they were marched up [that is marched away broke up as above chapter 34.21 and below verse 11.] from Jerusalem.
\p
\v 6 . Then the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah saying:
\p
\v 7 . Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel that shall say to the king of Judah that sent you unto me to enquire of me behold Pharaoh’s army which is come forth to help you shall return into their own land into Egypt.
\p
\v 8 . And the Chaldeans shall return and fight against this city and they shall take and shall burn it with fire.
\p
\v 9 . Thus saith the Lord deceive not your soul [that is yourselves below chapter 38 on verse 17] saying the Chaldeans shall surely depart [Heb. Departing depart] from us for they shall not depart[to wit quiet so as that they shall not reassume the siege or that they should not look for their coming again.]
\p
\v 10 . For though you shall smite the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you and they should remain but some wounded[or stabbed] men of them yet should they get them up every man of his tent and burn this city with fire.
\p
\v 11 . Moreover it came to pass when the army of the Chaldeans was marched up from Jerusalem because Pharaoh’s army [as above verse 5.]
\p
\v 12 . That Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go in the land of Benjamin [being his own country were Anathoth lay] to depart thence [from Jerusalem] through the midst of the people [or to slip away to get away privily amongst the multitude of the people that now returned home in their own dwellings in regard of the breaking up of the Babylonians.]
\p
\v 13 . When he was in the gate of Benjamin [through which a man went to the land of Benjamin] there was a captain of the guard whose name was Jerija the son of Selemja the son of Henanja he took hold of Jeremiah the prophet saying thou wilt fall to the Chaldeans [that is go over revolt depart go over to the enemy Heb. Thou art falling c.]
\p
\v 14 . And Jeremiah said it is false I will not fall to the Chaldeans yet he hearkened not unto him [Jerija hearkened not unto Jeremiah he believed him not] but Jerija took hold of Jeremiah and brought him to the princes.
\p
\v 15 . And the princes were very angry with Jeremiah and smote him and they put him [that is they caused him to be smitten and to be put c] in the prison house Heb. House of bond see above on verse 4] in the house of Jonathan the scribe for they had made that a prison house of shutting up as above verse 4.]
\p
\v 16 . When Jeremiah was entered into the place of the pit [Heb house c which is also taken for place understand here a deep filthy underground prison or dungeon] and into the cabins [or little holes or little chambers which are wont to be in such kind of prison] and Jeremiah had sate there many days [that is a long time others so Jeremiah remained there afterwards.]
\p
\v 17 . Then king Zedekiah sent and caused him to be fetched [Heb. Took him that is caused him to be taken thence to be brought to him see Genesis 12 on verse 15and above chapter 36.21and below chapter 38.14and 40.1,2c] and the king asked him secretly in his house and said is there also a word from the Lord?[hath God revealed any new prophesies unto thee concerning this our sad condition ? hence it appeareth that the king held Jeremiah to be a true prophet of God and yet not withstanding suffered him to be so badly used see below chapter 38.5 and compare Mark 6.20c] and Jeremiah said there is and thou shalt be delivered into the hand of King of Babel.
\p
\v 18 . Moreover Jeremiah said unto the king Zedekiah what have I sinned against thee and against thy servant or against this people that ye have put me in prison? [As above verse 4.]
\p
\v 19 . Where are now your prophets [meaning your false prophets] which prophesied unto ye saying the king of Babel shall not come against you or against this land?
\p
\v 20 . Now then hear I pray thee O my Lord the king I let my supplication I pray thee fall down before thy face [that is let me I pray thee that is fall down before thee with supplication prevail with thee be pleasing or acceptable unto thee see above chapter 36on verse 7] and bring me not [that is cause me not to be brought again or cause me not to return] again into the house of Jonathan the scribe left I die there.
\p
\v 21 . Then king Zedekiah gave charge and appointed Jeremiah [or delivered him to be kept committed him compare above chapter 36 on verse 20] into the court of the custody [see above chapter 32 on verse 2] and they gave him a loaf of bread [see Judges 8 verse 5 with the annotate] daily out of the bakers street until all the bread of the city was up [or was at end was spent] thus Jeremiah remained or sate in the court of custody.
\c 38
\s Jeremiah prophesying in prison as well before time is by the princes with the kingdom’s permission cast into a deep muddy dungeon verse1 c. but is by Ebedemelechh with the kings consent drawn out again 7 Zedekiah sendeth again for Jeremiah to come to him and receiveth still the same answer 14 he commandeth the prophet what he shall answer the princes when they should ask him his business 24. Prophet remaineth still in prison until Jerusalem was taken 28.
\p
\v 1 When Sephanja the son of Mathan and Gedalia the son of Pashur and Jachal the son of Selamja and Pashur the son of Malchia heard the word of Jeremiah spake [see the prosecution of verse 4] unto all the people [to wit those that came unto him in the court of the custody and thence spread his words among all the people] saying:
\p
\v 2 . Thus saith the Lord whoso remaineth in the city shall die by the sword by the famine or by the pestilence [as above chapter 21.9] but whoso goeth forth to the Chaldeans he shall live [that is remain alive God will cause that the Chaldeans shall spare him and grant him his life] for he shall have his soul [that is his life see Genesis 19 on verse 17] for a prey [as above chapter 21.9] and shall live.
\p
\v 3 . Saith the Lord this city shall surely be given [Heb. Being given be given] into the hand of the king of Babel’s arms and the same shall take it.
\p
\v 4 . Then the prince said unto the king let this man we beseech thee be put to death for thus he weakeneth the hands [see 2Samuel 4 on verse 1] of the soldiers but remain in the city and the hands of all the people speaking such words unto them for this man seeketh not the peace [that is welfare preservation see Genesis 37 on verse 14] of this people [or seeketh not peace for this people but c.] but the evil [that is mischief destruction.]
\p
\v 5 . And the king Zedekiah said behold he is in your hand for the king [that is I] can do nothing against you [oth. The king is not to be that can do anything against you.]
\p
\v 6 . Then took they Jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of Malchia [seeking to put him to death secretly] the son of Hannimalech [or the king son as above chapter 36.26] which was in the court of custody and let down Jeremiah with cords now in the dungeon there was no water but mire and Jeremiah sank n the mire [compare Psalms 69.3 and 40.3.]
\p
\v 7 . Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian [Heb. Cuschi a stranger but honest but Jeremiahs own country men see Genesis 2 on verse 13 and 10 on verse 6] one of Chamberlains [Heb. A man a Charmberlain or courtier see Genesis 37 on verse 36] who was the kings house heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon now the king sate in the gate of Benjamin [perhaps to keep court to wit which then was wont to be kept in the city gates see Genesis 22 on verse 17 and compare below verse 10 perhaps also to view something in the siege or to give order concerning something.]
\p
\v 8 . So then Ebedmelech went forth unto the king’s house and spake unto king saying:
\p
\v 9 . My lord my king these man dealt ill in all that they have done to the prophet Jeremiah whom they have cast into the dungeon where indeed should have died for hunger in his place [where he was compare 2 Samuel 2.23 with the annotate as if he had said he was indeed good as dead why then should they thus cruelly take away his life ?] because there is no more bread in the city .
\p
\v 10 . Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian saying: take from thence thirty men under thine hand [Heb.. in thine hand that is take them with thee under thine conduct command for thy service see this phrase 2Samuel 8 on verse 10 so in the next verse ]and fetch up the prophet Jeremiah [Heb. Cause to come up to ascend] out of dungeon before he die.
\p
\v 11 . So Ebedmelech took the men under his hand and went into the kings house under the treasury and took thence some old torn cloud [ to wit of clothes pulled off laid aside as some conceive because the Hebrew word is derived from pulling or clouts pulled all in a heap or slung here and there Heb. Old or torn c. that is some of the oldest c. compare the phrase with Judges 5.29. Proverbs 14.1 Ezekiel 28.7c.] and old worn rags [or rotten filthy perished rags compare Isaiah 51.6 where a like word is used concerning the perishing of the heavens] and he let them down with cards into the dungeon with Jeremiah.
\p
\v 12 . Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah lay now the old torn and worn rags under the pits of thine arms [others elbows as Ezekiel 13.18 Heb holes of thine hands a part for the whole as elsewhere] under the cord [this did this good man that Jeremiah might not hurt himself by the cords or ropes it is worthy our observation that the holy ghost is pleased to describe this word to honor for Ebedmelech for circumstantially] and Jeremiah did so.
\p
\v 13 . And they drew up Jeremiah by the cords and fetched him up out of the dungeon and Jeremiah remained in the court of custody [in the place where he had been before compare above verse 9.]
\p
\v 14 . Then king Zedekiah sent and caused the prophet Jeremiah to be fetched to him [ Heb and took unto him as above chapter 37.17] into the third entry that was the house of the Lord [and most princely most principally entry this may be understood of the gallery through which the king went up into the house of the Lord see 1Kings 10.5 with the annotate ]and the king said unto Jeremiah I will ask thee a thing or ask concerning the word to wit Lord see Ezekiel 3.17and 33.7 and above chapter 37.17] conceal nothing from me .
\p
\v 15 . And Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah when I shall declare it unto thee wilt thou not surely put me to death? [Heb putting to death put to death] and I shall give thee counsel yet thou wilt not hearken unto me.
\p
\v 16 . The king Zedekiah swear secretly unto Jeremiah saying as true as the Lord liveth that made us this soul [ see Isaiah 57.16] if I shall put thee to death or if I shall deliver thee into the hand of these man that seek thy soul[ that is seek to take away thy life see Exodus 4 on verse 19 and 2Saamuel on verse 8 an abrupt sentence very usual in oath understand with all then let God do so unto me c. see Genesis 14 on verse 26.]
\p
\v 17 . Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah thus saith the Lord the God of hosts [see 1Kings 18 on verse 15 ] the God of Israel if thou wilt willingly go forth [Heb. Going forth wilt go forth ]unto the king of Babel’s princes then shall thy soul live [that is thou thyself thy person shall remain alive for wilt thou shall cause to rejoice so verse 20 on Genesis 19.20] and this city shall not be burnt with fire and thou shalt live thou and thine house [that is family wives and children.]
\p
\v 18 . But if thou wilt not go forth unto the king Babel’s princes then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldean and they shall burn it with fire also thou shall escape out of their hand.
\p
\v 19 . And the king Zedekiah said unto Jeremiah I am afraid of Jews that are fallen [as above chapter 37.13] to the Chaldeans left they [the Chaldeans] peradventure deliver me into their hands [into the hands of revolted Jews] and they mock me.
\p
\v 20 . And Jeremiah said they shall not deliver thee he I pray thee obedient to the voice of the Lord according to which I speak unto thee or it shall go unto thee ] and thy soul shall live [as above verse 17.]
\p
\v 21 . But if thou refuse to go forth then this is the word which the Lord hath causeth me to see [that is have revealed unto me in prophetical vision.]
\p
\v 22 . Behold there all the women that are left in the king of Judas house [and were not before carried away with Chonia or Jojakim see 2 Kings 24.14, 15] shall be carried forth to the king of Babel’s princes and the same shall say [thy wives shall say unto thee in an upbraiding manner ]those that were at peace with thee [Heb. The man of thy peace that is thy friends or thy confederate so above chapter 20 verse 10] have set thee on [to rebel see 2Kings 24.20 2Chronicles 36.13 and above chapter 27 on verse3] and have prevailed against thee [drawn thee away by their counsel and instigation from thy duty Obadea verse 7] thy feet are sunk into the mire [thou hast brought thyself into trouble out of which thou canst deliver thyself it may be that by these words respect is had to that which the king had suffered to be done to Jeremiah see verse 6.] they are turned backwards [thou hast revolted from the king of Babel against thine oath 2Chronicles 36.13 compare this complaint against Zedekiah with Isaiah 8.2 some understand it of some of his associates and friends that hath forsaken him.]
\p
\v 23 . They shall then bring forth all their wives and all thy sons [or the daughters below chapter 41.10 with the annotate and 43.6] to the Chaldean also thou shalt not escape of their hand [that which was said before is repeated again for confirmation of the matter ]but thou shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babel and thou shalt burn this city with fire [that is cause it to be burnt or be a cause that it shall be burnt see above chapter 21.10 and 32.29 and 34.2,22 others this city shall burn or be burnt by fire through the Hebrew word is nowhere else more so found signification.]
\p
\v 24 . Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah let no man know of these then thou shalt not die.
\p
\v 25 . And when the princes shall hear that I have spoken with thee and shall come unto thee and say unto thee declare unto us now what hast thou said unto the king? Conceal it not from us then we will not put thee to death and what hath the king spoken unto thee?
\p
\v 26 .Then shalt thou say unto them thy cast down my supplication before the kings face [see above chapter 36 on verse 7that is I made humble supplications unto the king ]that he would not cause me to be brought again into Jonathan’s house [see above chapter 37 verse15] to die there.
\p
\v 27 . When then all the princes came unto Jeremiah and asked him he told them according to those words [that is in such manner as the king hath commanded him] and they left off from him [without speaking anymore to him ] and they left off from him [without speaking anymore to him or doing anything to him Heb. They were silent or kept themselves silent off him compare 1Kings 22 on verse 3 and further Psalms 28 on verse 1 and Job 13 on verse 13]because the matter was not heard [that is was not made known or spread abroad they heard nothing of it consequently had no matter of examining Jeremiah any further.]
\p
\v 28 . And Jeremiah abode in the court of custody until that day the day that Jerusalem was taken and he was there yet when Jerusalem was taken [see below chapter 39.14.]
\c 39
\s Jerusalem is taken by the Chaldeans verse1 c. Zedekiah is taken prisoner and his eyes put out and the son all the nobles of Judah are slain the city is burnt the chiefest of the people are carried away captive 5 Nebuchadnezzar’s charge concerning Jeremiah 11 Whereupon he is released out of prison13. God promiseth to Ebedmelech 15c.
\p
\v 1 In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah in the tenth month came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel [see 2Kings 25.1 below chapter 52.4] and all his army against Jerusalem [or by to c. that is before Jerusalem] and they besieged it.
\p
\v 2 . In the eleventh year of Zedekiah in the forth month on the ninth day of the month the city was broken through [compare 2Kings 25.4 and below chapter 52.7 meaning the outermost wall of the city.]
\p
\v 3 . And all the princes of king of Babel marched in and kept in by the middle gate that is they kept or stayed there to wit by or at the gate of the middle wall which parted the upper city from the lower city]namely Negal-Sarezar, Samgar [some render this word Samgar treasurer or master of the treasure which some apply as Sarezar]Nebu, Sarsechim ,Rab-Saris [that is upper chamberlain or courtier; that is steward as some conceive ]Negal-Samarezar,Reb-mag[that is field marshal or field officer as others compare below verse 13]and all the remaining [Heb. All remnant that is here all the others all the rest] princes of king of Babel.
\p
\v 4 . It came to pass when Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them then they fled and went out of the city by night by the way of the kings garden [which was at or by the kings garden compare 2Kings 9 on verse 27] by the gate between the two walls [see 2Kings 25 on verse 6]and he [ namely the king] went out by the way of the plain [or the wilderness this wilderness or plains lay between Jerusalem and Jericho see 2Samuel 15 on verse 23 and here the next verse.]
\p
\v 5 . But the Chaldeans army pursued after them and hey overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho and took him prisoner [see the Hebrew word above chapter 36 on verse 26 albeit it may be here also simply rendered and they took him but it is as much as to say they caught him and took him prisoner and brought him to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babel to Ribla [see 2Kings 23 on verse 33] in the land of Hamath where he pronounced judgments [or sentences in plural number for which 2Kings 25.6 judgment is used in the singular number see the annotate there and compare above chapter 1.6 and 4.12 so below chapter 52.9.]
\p
\v 6 . And the king of Babel slew [that is caused to be slain [the sons of Zedekiah before Ribla before his eyes also the king of Babel slew all the nobles [Heb white ones see Nehemiah 2 on verse 16] of Judah.
\p
\v 7 . and he put out the eyes of Zedekiah [or he made blind. causing his eyes to be put out or at least so to be spoiled that he came blind as it is conceived that at this day some nations in the eastern countries do spoil the eyes of those whom they take prisoners in war and bereave them quite of their sight without putting their eyes] and bound him with two copper chains to carry him to Babel.
\p
\v 8 . And the Chaldeans burnt the kings house the house of the people [and the house &c that is the house of the inhabitants but especially of the great ones see 2Kings 25 on verse 9] with fire and they brake down the walls of Jerusalem.
\p
\v 9 . Now Nebuchadnezzar the captain of the guard [see Genesis 37 on verse 36] carried away captive to Babel to residue of the people that remained in the city and revolters that are fallen to him [that were gone over or were revolted to the king of Babel or to this Nebuzaradan see 2Kings 25.11] with the residue of the people that remained .
\p
\v 10 . But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the people that were poor that had nothing at all in the land of Judah and gave them that day vineyards and fields [to dress and till.]
\p
\v 11 . But Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babel had given charge concerning Jeremiah [of whose prophesies doubtless the king had heard by the revolters or some other way compare 40.2,3c] in the hand of Nebuzaradan the captain [this may be understood of a charge or commission in writing given to him or it may be taken barely for by or to him] saying.
\p
\v 12 . Take him and set thy eyes upon him [that is take care of him look well of him see above chapter 24 on verse 6] and do him no harm but according as he shall speak unto thee [that is shall desire of thee ] so do unto him.
\p
\v 13 . So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard together with Nebushasban sent Rab-Saris and Nergal –Serezar,Rabmag [see these names on verse 3] and all the commanders of the king of Babel.
\p
\v 14 . They then sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the custody[see above chapter 38.28 but afterwards he was fetched away from among the captives that were on the way to be carried to Babel ]and delivered him to Gedaliah[see 2Kings 25 on verse 22] the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan that he should bring him forth home so he remained in the midst of the people [or dwelt &c conversing among the people and dwelling in his own house for he came until afterwards to Geladiah unto Mizpa see below chapter 40.4,5,6 where it is related that Jeremiah because he had not joined himself unto Gedeliah was carried away a good part of the way with other captives .
\p
\v 15 . The word of the Lord also came unto Jeremiah when he was in the court of custody saying:
\p
\v 16 . Go thy way and speak unto Ebedmelech saying thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel behold I will bring my word upon this city for evil not for good [I will perform that which I have threatened the foretold ]and they shall be in that day before thy face [ that is my words shall be accomplished before thine eyes that thou shalt behold it.]
\p
\v 17 . But I will deliver thee in that day saith the Lord and shalt not be given up in the hand of the men of whose face thou afraid.
\p
\v 18 . For I will surely free thee [Heb seeing free thee] and shalt not fall by the sword but thou shalt have the right soul [that is life as above chapter 38.2] for a prey because thou hast trusted in me [that I would descend thee against all the enemies for my servant Jeremiah whom for my sake thou hast assisted and delivered out of his trouble see above chapter 38.7,8&c.]
\c 40
\s For an introduction into the further prophesies of Jeremiah to the remaining Jews here is related how he was fetched away from the midst of the captives being very favorable dealt with all being adjoined himself with Gedaliah at Mispa verse1 c wither all the fugitive and that they were left and they that were left in the land dead resort and were comforted and advised by Gedaliah 7some of them especially Jobanan advise Gadiliah to beware of Ishmael but he believed them not 13.
\p
\v 1 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Rama[and the other things were also done which are related below after that Jeremiah was set at liberty to wit how that Gedaliah was treacherously murdered and how the Jews intended to go to Egypt see of Rama 1Kings 15 on verse 17 ]when he had caused him to be fetched [Heb had taken him see above chapter 37 on verse 17 so straightway verse 2]where he was bound with chains in the midst of the captives [Heb captivity or captive carrying away as elsewhere often ]of Jerusalem and Judah which were carried away captive unto Babel [the very words of the prophesy follow not until chapter 42.7&c but here in the sequel is inserted a relation of the passages that gave occasion to the aforesaid prophesy.]
\p
\v 2 . For the captain of the guard caused Jeremiah to be fetched unto him the Lord thy God hath spoken this evil [mischief misery evil of punishment] upon this city [that speaketh an heathen man to the shame and confusion of the Jews hence it appeareth that the king of Babel hath understood what Jeremiah hath prophesied compare above chapter 39.11.]
\p
\v 3 . And the Lord hath caused it to come and done according as he had spoken for ye have sinned against the Lord and not obeyed his voice therefore this thing has not happened to you[or is this word com unto you or this word of the Lord is accomplished upon you compare above chapter 39.16.]
\p
\v 4 . Now then [seeing thou art found to be true prophet ]behold I have loosed thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand [others hands ] if it be good in thine eyes [if it please thee ]to come with me to Babel then come I will set my eyes upon thee [see above chapter 39.12]but if it be evil in thine eyes [that is displease thee dislike thee] to come with to Babel then forbear it behold all the land is before thy face [that is lieth open before thee see Genesis 13 on verse 9]wither it is good and right in thine eyes to go thither go.
\p
\v 5 . And seeing he will not return [he namely Gedeliah who is presently named who will not so soon come hither again that thou shouldst need to wait for this coming back for he hath much business to dispatch at Mizpa others and seeing he namely Jeremiah was not yet returned he namely Nebuzaradan said moreover or returneth c by which only few words inserted may be shewed how it came to pass that Jeremiah got among the rest of the captives and was carried away with them to wit because he had not yet repaired unto Gedaliah when he was released out of the court of prison but continued among the people so likewise bound with others and brought hither therefore Nebuzaradan offereth liberty to go to Gedaliah that he might be safe and secure under his protection as followeth others seeing to wit he Zedekiah spoken by way of contempt shall not return anymore c]therefore turn thou to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan whom the king of Babel had set over the cities of Judah and dwell with him in the midst of the people or wither so ever it is right in thine eyes to go thither go and the captain of the guard gave him victual [the Hebrew word signifieth properly but it is also generally taken for daily allowance which is allotted to a man below chapter 52.34 see further Proverbs 15 on verse 17] and a present and let him go.
\p
\v 6 . So Jeremiah came to Gedaliah the son of Ahakim and Mizpa [lying in the land of Benjamin as some conceive see judges 10 on verse 17] and he dwelt with him in the midst of the people that were left in the land.
\p
\v 7 . Now when all the commanders [that is captains chiefs officers so often in the sequel ] of the armies that were in the field [that is the soldiers which they had with them so verse 8] heard that the king of Babel had set Gedaliah the son of Ahikim the man and the women and the children and of the poorest of the land [Heb poverty or thinness of the land see 2Kings 24 on verse 14] of them that were not carried away captive to Babel [compare this relation with 2Kings 25.23c.]
\p
\v 8 . Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpa namely Ishmael [see 2kings 25 on verse 23] the son of Nethaniah and Johanan the son of Kareah and Seraiah the son of Tanbumeth and the son of Ephathe Netophathites and Jezeniah the son of Machathile they and their men.
\p
\v 9 . And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Saphan swear unto them and their men saying fear not to serve the Chaldean abide [or dwell ] in the land to serve the king of Babel so shall it go well with you.
\p
\v 10 . And behold I dwell at Mizpa to stand before the face of the Chaldeans [that is to serve them see Deuteronomy 1on verse 38 and 1Kings 1 on verse 2] which will come unto us ye then gather wine and summer fruits and oil and put them in your vessels and dwell in your cities which ye have taken [that is taken for your dwelling places.]
\p
\v 11 . Also all the Jews that were in Moab and the son of Ammon and in Edom that were in all those lands [that is that were fled into the country thereabout] heard that the king of Babel had left [or appointed permitted Heb. Properly given] a remnant in Judah that he had set before them [them that were left] Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan.
\p
\v 12 . Then the Jews returned out of the places wither they were driven and came into the land of Judah to Gadaliah to Mizpa and they gathered very much wine and fruits.
\p
\v 13 . But Johanan the son of Kariath and all the commanders of the armies [excepting Ishmael of whom in the sequel ] came to Gedaliah to Mizpa .
\p
\v 14 . And saith unto him dost thou know indeed [Heb dost thou knowing know] that Baalis of the children of Ammon hath sent forth Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to smite thee on the life [Heb smite thee on the soul that is to take away thy life see Deuteronomy 19.6 with the annotate so in the next verse ]but Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.
\p
\v 15 . Yet Jonathan the son of Kareah spoke unto Gedaliah secretly at Mizpa saying let me go I pray thee and smite Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and no man shall know it why should he smite thy life and all Judah that are gathered unto thee be scattered and the remnant of the Judah perish?
\p
\v 16 . But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johannan the son of Kareah do not this thing for thou speaketh falsely of Ishmael [ or against Ishmael this was a token of Gedeliah sincerity of heart but he ought to have duly sifted out of the truth of business and to have been upon his guards to prevent the mischief which afterward happened unto him by this traitor see the next chapter.
\c 41
\s Gedaliah and the others besides both Jews and Chaldeans under color of friendship are murdered by Ishmael verse1 c. indendeth to carry away the rest of the people captive unto ammonites but they are delivered out of his hand of Johanan 10 who intended with the whole remnant to go into Egypt 16.
\p
\v 1 But it came to pass in the seventh month [after he treaty as some conceive of Gedaliah with the princes whereof is spoken in the former chapter or of after that Gedaliah was warned to beware of Ishmael or after that he was set over the land] that Ishmael the son of Ethania the son of Elisama of the seed royal [Heb. Of the seed of the kingdom as 2Kings 11.1 Ezekiel 17.13 Daniel 1.3 hence may be gathered that this Ishmael was vexed that any other but himself should have the managing or government of affairs in Judah see 2Kings 25.25] and the princes of the king [which had been among the great ones with king Zedekiah some understand princes of the king of the Ammonites see above chapter 40.14] to wit ten men [ each having his men with him as may be gathered from that which followeth ]with him came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpa and there they ate bread together at Mizpa [ that is fastest together see Genesis 31 on verse 54on purpose to murder Gedaliah under a shew and color friendship as Absolom did his brother Ammon 2Samuel 13 on verse 28,29.]
\p
\v 2 . And Ishmael the son of Nathania got him up together with the ten men that were with him and they smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son Saphan with the sword thus he [Ishmael with his men] slew him whom the king of Babel had sent over the land.
\p
\v 3 . If Ishmael also slew the Jews that were with him namely with Gedaliah at Mizpa the Chaldeans the soldiers that were found there.
\p
\v 4 . Now it came to pass on the second day when he had slate Gedaliah and no man knew it [ understand that it was not yet noised abroad.]
\p
\v 5 . That there came men from Schicem [see Judges 8 on verse 31]from Silo [see 1Kings 16 on verse 24] four source men having their beard shaven and their clothes rent and having cut themselves [or having made cuttings on themselves to wit in their flesh with knives or bodkins having received this forbidden custom or shaving their beards or making cuttings in their flesh from the heathen or desiring in simplicity to shew extraordinary grief for sad estate and condition of God’s people compare above chapter 66 on verse 9]and meat offering and incense where in their hand [that is they had taken along with them they had with them see 2samuel 8 on verse 10 to shew their affection at the place where they were wont offer sacrifice which was now burnt 2Kings 25.9] to bring them to the house of the Lord.
\p
\v 6 . And Ishmael the son of Nethania went forth from Mizpa to meet them going all along weeping [Heb. Going with going and weeping feigning as of he grieved with them for the common calamities as on the contrary he had before feasted and made merry with Gedaliah when he intended to murder him]and it came to pass when he met them that he said come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.
\p
\v 7 .But it came to pass when they were come in the midst of the city that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah cut their throats and cast them [that is here inserted from verse 9]into the midst of the pit [or pond pool Dutch cistern others slew them by or about the midst c.] he and the man that were with him.
\p
\v 8 . But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael slay us not for we have hidden treasures on the fields of wheat and barley and oil and honey so he for bare and slew them in the midst of their brethren [that is with and amongst the rest of their country and kinsmen.]
\p
\v 9 . Now the pit wherein Ishmael did cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had smitten on Gedaliah’s side [Heb on Gedaliah’s hand that is besides him or next to him hand for side see 2Samuel 18 on verse 4Proverbs 8 on verse 3others for Gedliah’s sake or that were under the hand of Gedaliah ]is the same that the king Asa made before Baasha [that is for fear of Baasha Heb from the face this Asa did perhaps when he repaired and fortified this city of Mizpa with the stone of Rama wherewith Baasha had fought to fortify Rama see 1Kings 15.22 for what end this pit properly served is uncertain whether for fortification or for waiting for men and beasts in time of need see] the king of Israel this pit Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled with the slain.
\p
\v 10 . And Ishmael carried away captive the residues of the people that were at Mizpa to wit the kings daughters [as below chapter 43.6some understand hereby certain virgins of the blood royal or ladies of honor whom it may be Nebuchadnezzar left in the land or which being hidden at first afterwards came forth again and were likewise committed to the charge of Gedaliah compare above chapter 38.22 with the annotate ] and the people that were at Mizpa whom Nebuchadnezzar the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried away captive and departed to go over to the children of Ammon[compare above chapter 40.14 and below verse 15.]
\p
\v 11 . Now when Johanan the son of Korea and all the captains of the that were him heard all the evil that Ishmael the son Nethaniah had done.
\p
\v 12 . Then they took all the men [the soldiers that had with them] and want to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and they fought him at the great water which is by Gobeon [compare 2Samel 2.13 with the annotate.]
\p
\v 13 . And it came to pass when all the people that were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Korea and the all captains of the armies that were with him then they were glad.
\p
\v 14 . And all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive to Mizpa turned themselves about and went over unto Johanan the son of Korea.
\p
\v 15 . But Ishmael the son of Nathaniah escaped from Johanan’s face with eight men and he went to the children of Ammon.
\p
\v 16 . Then took Johanan the son of Korea as also all the captains of the armies tat were with him all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah from Mizpa [this may be understood of the people whom Ishmael had carried away from Mizpa ]after that he had smitten Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to wit the man that were soldiers [Heb men soldiers compare Judges 4 on verse4 others valiant or stout soldiers] and the women and the little children and the Chamberlains [or courtier see Genesis 37 on verse 36]whom he had brought again from Gobeon [see above verse 12.]
\p
\v 17 . And they departed and pitched [ Heb sate or abode] at Geruth chimbam which is by Bethlehem[Geruth that is dwelling place or country of Barbour pilgrimage where Chimbam had sojourned or dwelt as a stranger this place which was by Bethlehem being as some conceive given him by David out of his estate for a recompense of the favors which he had received from Bezzilar his father that at that time when he fled from Absolom see 2Samuel 17.38&c.] to go on that they might come to Egypt.
\p
\v 18 . From the face of the Chaldeans for they were afraid of their face because Ishmael the son of Nithan had smitten Gedaliah the son of Ahikam whom the king of Babel had set over the land [from the face c that is for fear as above verse 9 being afraid that the king would revenge this murder upon them.]
\c 42
\s Johanan and all the people desire Jeremiah to ask for counsel of God from them with great promises of obedience verse1 c. Jeremiah had command from God prophesieth unto them their preservation from Judea but their destruction in Egypt with an upbraiding of their hypocrisy and obstinancy,7.
\p
\v 1 Then all the captains of the armies Johanan the son of Korea and Jezaniah the son of Hashanja and all the people from the least unto the greatest came near:
\p
\v 2 . and said unto prophet Jeremiah let we pray thee our supplication fall down before thy face [see of this phrase above 36 on verse 7the meaning is let our humble petition prevail with thee reject it not compare verse 9]then pray for us unto the Lord thy god for remnant for we are left but a few of many like as thine eyes do behold us;
\p
\v 3 . That the Lord thy God make known unto us the way wherein we shall go and the thing which we shall do.
\p
\v 4 . And the prophet Jeremiah said unto them I have heard it [that is well understood see Genesis 11.7 in the annotate or I hear that is I am ready to satisfy your desire ]behold I will pray to the Lord your God according to your words and it shall come to pass that the whole word which the Lord shall answer you I will make it known unto you I will not keep one word back form you.
\p
\v 5 . Then said they unto Jeremiah the Lord be a true and certain witness [Heb a witness of truth and certain or faithful] between us [ or against us amongst us] of we shall do so according to every word with which the Lord thy God shall send thee unto us [an abrupt kind of oath as above chapter 38.16 see there.]
\p
\v 6 . Whether then it be good or evil [to wit in our eyes that whether it like or dislike us please or displease us whether it agree with our reason and understanding or not whether it go with us or against us whether it be acceptable or but then some and grievous to us ]we will be obedient unto the voice of the Lord our God to whom we send thee that it may go well with us when we shall be obedient to the Lord our God.
\p
\v 7 It came to pass at the end of ten days that the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah.
\p
\v 8 . Then called the son of Johanan and all the captains of the armies that were with him and all the people and the least unto the greatest.
\p
\v 9 . And he said unto the them the Lord of host the God of Israel unto whom you cast down your supplication before your face [compare above verse2 ]
\p
\v 10 . If you will still dwell [others still abide or returning to wit from your purpose will abide or dwelling will dwell ]in this land then will I build you,[see Psalms 28 on verse 5]and not break you down and plant you and not pluck you out [compare above chapter 24.6 and 31.4aand 33.7] for I repent me [see Genesis 6 ] for the evil [of punishment] that I have done unto you.
\p
\v 11 . Be not afraid of the face of the king of Babel of whose face you are afraid be not afraid of him saith the Lord for I will be with you to save you and deliver you from this hand.
\p
\v 12 . And I will give mercy unto you [to wit before the face of the king of Babel see the same phrase Genesis 43.14 and compare Nehem 1.11 Psalms 106.46 Daniel 1.9 and 1Kings 8.50 Ezra 7.28] that he may have mercy upon you and bring you again unto your own land [ that is cause you to dwell in peace in your own land vineyards c. which in former time you were constrained to forsake and could not enjoy them see above chapter 40.11,12.]
\p
\v 13 . But you shall say we will not abide to the land that ye may not be obedient unto the voice of the Lord your God :
\p
\v 14 . Saying no but we will go into the land of Egypt where we shall see no war [compare above chapter 14.13]nor hear the sound of the trumpet nor hunger after bread and there we will abide.
\p
\v 15 . Now then therefore hear the word of the Lord ye remnant of Judah thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel if ye shall fully set your face to go into Egypt [Heb setting shall set c hat is if ye shall cast your eyes wholly upon Egypt and firmly minded to go thither so often to the sequel compare 1Kings 2 on verse15] and shall enter into sojourn there.
\p
\v 16 . Then it shall come to pass that the sword which ye fear shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt and the famine whereof ye are afraid shall cleave you from behind there in the land of Egypt and the famine whereof ye are afraid shall cleave unto ye from behind there in Egypt then ye shall die there.
\p
\v 17 . So shall all men be [that so shall it be with them] that set their faces to get into Egypt to sojourn there they shall die by the sword by the famine by the pestilence and they shall have none to remain or escaping [Heb. Have none remaining or escaping meaning some few excepted chapter 44.14, 18] from the evil [Heb from the face of evil ] that I will bring upon them.
\p
\v 18 . For thus saith the Lord of host the God of Israel like as mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem so shall my fury be poured forth upon you when ye shall come into Egypt and ye shall be cursing [or exaggeration that when they curse any man with an oath they shall use your example for it wishing that it may so befall them as it hath befallen you compare above chapter 29.22 and below chapter 44.12 and Isaiah 65.15] and the astonishment[as above chapter 18.16 and 19.8 and 25.9 and 29.18] and a curse[as above chapter 24.9 and 25.18 and 26.6 and 29.18] and a reproach[above chapter 24.9and 29.18] and shall see this place [the land of Judah]no more.
\p
\v 19 . The Lord hath spoken against you [or upon concerning you] ye remnant of Judah go not into Egypt know assuredly [Heb. Knowing ye shall know ] that I have testified against ye [or among ye that I have earnestly as in the presence of God exhorteth and admonished you whereof God exhorted and admonished you whereof God and yourself admonished you whereof God and yourself be witnesses I protest that I have done my devour] this day.
\p
\v 20 . Certainly ye have seduced your own souls [that ye have deceived your own self thinking by your hypocrisy to wrest God according to our own mind others ye have ye have seduced me or caused me to err against your souls that is to your own destruction or that which was in your souls that is speaking otherwise to me then your hearts purposed to do dealing as hypocrites with me ]for ye sent me unto the Lord your God saying pray for us unto the Lord your God according to all the Lord our God shall say so make it known unto us and we will do it.
\p
\v 21 . Now I have this day made known unto ye but ye have not hearkened unto the Lord your God nor unto all which he hath sent unto you[ or nor unto anything for the which he c now they had above verse 5 promised the clean contrary with the strong oath.]
\p
\v 22 . Now therefore know certainly [Heb knowing ye shall know ]that ye shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence in the place wither ye are minded to go to sojourn there.
\c 43
\s The commanders and all the charge one among the people charge Jeremiah his prophesy with Lying they go into Egypt and carry them and Baluch along with them thither verse1,2 c. Jeremiah prophesieth at Taphanes by a divine token of a desolation of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar,8.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the word of the Lord their God with which the Lord their God hath sent him unto them to wit all those words [related in the former chapter.]
\p
\v 2 . then spake Azaria the son of Hosiah and Johanan the son of Korea and all the proud men saying [in the plural number ] unto Jeremiah thou speaketh a lie the Lord our God hath not sent thee to say ye shall not go to Egypt to sojourn there.
\p
\v 3 . But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us that he might deliver us into the hand of Chaldeans that they might put us to death and carry us captive to Babel.
\p
\v 4 . So neither Johanan the son of Korea neither the captain of the armies nor all the people obeyed the voice of the Lord to abide in the land of Judah.
\p
\v 5 . But Johanan the son of Korea and the captains of the armies took all the remnant of Judah that were returned from all the heathen wither they were driven to dwell in the land of Judah.
\p
\v 6 . The man and the women and the little children and the kings daughters [that is men person see Genesis 12 on verse5 ]that Neburazaradan the captain of the guards had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Saphan also the prophet Jeremiah and Baruch the son of Neriah:
\p
\v 7 . And they went into the land of Egypt for they were not obedient unto the voice of the Lord and they came unto Tahphanes [see above chapter 2 on verse16 this place is held to be the same city which is called by the heathen writers Dephne .]
\p
\v 8 . Then came the word of the Lord to Jeremiah at Tehphanes saying:
\p
\v 9 . Take thy stone in thine hand and hide them in the brick-kill[or brickery brick house] which is by the door [or entry] or Pharaoh [ see Genesis 12 on verse 15 this seemeth to have been Pharaoh Hophra so below chapter 44.30] house at Taphanes before the eyes of the men of Judah.
\p
\v 10 . And say unto them thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel behold I will send and fetch [Heb take see above chapter 37 on verse17]Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babel my servant [see above chapter 25 on verse 9 and 27.6] and I will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid [by the ministry of my servant Jeremiah ]and he shall spread his beautiful tent[or royal tent pavilion the Hebrew word is only found here and seemeth to have the name from singular beauty] over them.
\p
\v 11 . And he shall come and smite the land of Egypt [ as below chapter 46.13&c] him for death to death ]meaning he is appointed or dead see above chapter 15.2,2 Zah.11.9] to death and him for captivity to captivity and him for the sword to the sword.
\p
\v 12 . And I will kindle the fire [that is cause or procure desolation or destruction compare above chapter 15.14]in the houses of Gods [that is idolatrous temples ] of Egypt and he shall bury them and carry them away captive [Nebuchadnezzar shall burn the idols of the Egyptians and their houses and temples and shall carry the Egyptians away captive ]and he shall put on the land of Egypt like as the shepherds putteth on his garment [that is he shall take the riches and spoil to Egypt himself for his own profit and benefit to carry them with him as easily and conveniently as the shepherds putteth on his shepherd coat to cover therewith and wrap himself in it against the cold he shall be leaden and covered and as it were wrapped round about with the spoil] and he shall march forth from thence with peace.
\p
\v 13 . and he shall brake the reared images [as 1 Kings 14.23]of Bethmeshesh[that is of the house of the sun called by the heathen writers Heliopolis that is the city of the sun where they committed abominable idolatry this city is conceived to have been also conceived by Hebrews on Genesis 41.45,50] which is in the land of Egypt[there was another Bethmeshshes in Israel by the border of the Philistines 1Samuel 6.12] and he shall burn the houses of gods of Egypt with fire.
\c 44
\s Jeremiah representeth before the eyes of the people in Egypt the former sins and punishments of Judah verse1c. he likewise prophesieth unto them their destruction in Egypt 11 the desperate obstinacy of the Jews against the prophesy 15 for which the prophesy grievously threateneth them the second time and for a token he foretelleth what shall befalleth the king of Egypt 20.
\p
\v 1 The word [namely of the Lord ] that came unto Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt which dwell at Migdol[see Exodus 14.2] and at Tahphanes [as above chapter 43.7] at Noph [see Isaiah 19..13] and in the land of Patros [see Genesis 10 on verse14] saying:
\p
\v 2 . Thus saith the Lord of hosts [see 1Kings18 on verse 15] the God of Israel ye have seen all the evil [ of punishment]that I have brought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities of Judah and behold they are a desolation at this day and no man dwelleth in them:
\p
\v 3 . Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger going to burn incense and to serve other Gods which they knew not they ye nor fathers.
\p
\v 4 . and I sent unto all my servants the prophet being up early and sending [ see above chapter 7 on verse 13] to say oh do not this abominable thing[Heb thing of abomination] that I hate.
\p
\v 5 . But they hearkened not nor inclined their ears to turn from their wickedness that they should not burn incense unto other Gods.
\p
\v 6 . Therefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth [compare above chapter 7.20 and 42.18]and hath burnt in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem so that they are become solitariness and a desolation as it is of this day.
\p
\v 7 . And now thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel wherefore commit ye so great an evil [or guilt that is sin] against your souls [that is to your own destruction against yourselves against your lives &c compare Numbers 16 on verse 38]to cut off from you the man and the woman from little child and suckling [ see the Hebrew word Psalms 8 on verse3 out of the midst of Judah that ye may leave yourselves from remnant ? [all this implieth the Lord you will cause by this wickedness of yours you carry yourselves no otherwise then as if ye had a mind and a desire to bring these miseries upon ye so in the sequel compare above chapter 18 on verse 16.]
\p
\v 8 . Provoking me to anger by the works of you hands burning incense unto other Gods in the land of Egypt wither ye are come to sojourn there that ye may cut yourselves off [or might cut off all remnant unto yourselves ]that ye might be a curse and reproach among all the nations of the earth?
\p
\v 9 . Have ye forgetten the wickedness[other evils that is plagues so in the sequel but compare the next verse ]of your fathers and the wickedness of the kings of the Judah and the wickedness of their wives and their own wickedness’s of your wives which they [namely the fathers king &c] have committed in the land of Judah [otherwise the mischief which they to wit the enemies have exercised in your lands the evil that they have committed there] and in the streets of Jerusalem?
\p
\v 10 . they are not yet contrite in heart[that is they are not softened nor brokened in heart they have heard no hearty sorrow and repentance nor sued for mercy see Psalms 51 on verse 19] neither have they feathered [compare Proverbs 28 on verse 14and above chapter 3.8] nor walked in my law nor in my statutes which I gave before your face and before the face of your fathers [ that is which I clearly and quickly propounded unto you and to your fathers that ye may order your conversations accordingly.]
\p
\v 11 . Therefore thus saith the Lord of Hosts the God of Israel behold I will set my face against ye for evil and to cut off all Judah [to wit mine angry face as if God should say as they obstinately set their face against all commandments so will I set my face against them for their destruction compare Leviticus 7 on verse 10 and Psalms 21 on verse10]
\p
\v 12 . And I will take away the remnant of Judah that will set their faces to go into the land of Egypt [see above chapter 42 on verse 15] to sojourn there and they shall all be consumed in the land of Egypt they shall fall by the sword they shall be censed by the famine from the least unto the greatest they shall die by the sword and by the famine and they shall become a cursing [see above chapter 42 on verse 18] an astonishment and curse and reproach.
\p
\v 13 . For I will visit them that dwell in the land of Egypt according as I have visited Jerusalem by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence.
\p
\v 14 . So that the remnant of Judah which are come into the land of Egypt to sojourn there shall have none to remain nor to escape or remain [Hebrew none escaped or remaining as above chapter 42.17] to wit to return into the land of Judah as hither their soul longeth [Heb wither they left up their soul see above chapter 22 on verse 27] to return to dwell there but they shall not return thither saving those that shall escape [Heb the escaped ones to wit some few godly persons that were carried a against their will into Egypt or else whom it shall please God graciously to convert and let them remain that they may be witnesses of the truth of those prophesies compare below verse 28.]
\p
\v 15 . Then all the men that knew their wives burnt incense unto their gods and all the women that stood by being a great company together with all the people that dwell in the land of Egypt in Patros answered Jeremiah saying :
\p
\v 16 . As for the word that hast spoken unto us in the name of the Lord we will not hearken unto thee.
\p
\v 17 . But we will not do altogether [or certainly Hebrews doing do] all that [[Hebrew word thing matter ] which is gone forth out of the mouth [that is we will perform our vows see Numbers 30.2 Judges 11.36 and below verse 25]burning incense Melecheth of heaven [see chapter 7 and the annotate on verse 18]an offering drink offerings unto her like as we have done we and our fathers our kings our princes in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem then we were satisfied with bread and were merry[Heb good that is merry see Judges 16 on verse 25] and saw no evil [that is no mischief or adversity befell us see above chapter 7 on verse 7.]
\p
\v 18 . But from that time that we left off to burn incense of Melech of heaven and to offer drunk offer unto her we have wanted all things and we have been consumed by the sword or by the famine .
\p
\v 19 . Also when we burn incense to Melecheth of heaven and offer drink offerings and do we make her pictured cakes[see above chapter 7 on verse 18] to represent her [ to wit curiously and painfully the Hebrew word signifieth properly pain and sorrow from whence consequently idolatrous images have their name because they bring men to pain and sorrow see 1 Samuel 31 on verse 9 and 2samuel 5 on verse 21and moreover the word that is here used is taken for the picture curiously to form or frame an idol compare job 10 on verse 8 others to honor her also to move to grief trouble and consequently to compassion]and do we offer drink offering unto her without the will and consent or company and help our men as if that could excuse them but their man understand their lawful husband as verse 15.25]
\p
\v 20 . Then spake Jeremiah unto all people to the men and to the women and to all the people that had answered him so [Heb or the word ]saying:
\p
\v 21 . the burning of incense which ye have burnt in the cities of Judah and in the street of Jerusalem and ye your fathers your kings your princes and the people in the land did not the Lord remember it and came it not up into his hearts / [ that is did he not lay to heart so as that he hath punished you so sorely for it ? compare above chapter 7 on verse 31.]
\p
\v 22 . So that the Lord could hear it no more because of the wickedness of your dealings because of the abominations which ye have committed therefore your land has become a desolation and astonishment[see above chapter 18 on verse 16]and a cure that no man dwelleth in it as it is at this day.
\p
\v 23 . Because you have burnt incense and because ye have sinned against the Lord and have not been obedient unto the voice of the Lord and have not walked in hi law and in his statutes and in his testimonies therefore this evil hath happened unto ye as it is on this day.
\p
\v 24 . Moreover Jeremiah saith unto all the people and unto all the women hear ye the word of the Lord all Judah that are in the land of Egypt :
\p
\v 25 . Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts the God of Israel saying as for ye and your wives they [your wives see above verse 16c. ] have spoken with your mouth and ye have fulfilled with your hands [that is actually performed as if the Lord should say ye are agreed together in this business the one saith it the other doth it ye help one another others, ye and your wives ye have .] saying we will altogether keep[Heb. Performing perform doing do that is without default put in practice perform]our vows which have vowed burning incense to Melecheth of heaven an offering burnt-offering unto her now they [your wives] have fully confirmed perfectly established[Heb confirming confirm see above chapter 35.14 with the annotations ]your vows perfectly and fully kept[Heb doing done ] ratified your vows.
\p
\v 26 . Therefore hear ye all the word of the Lord all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt behold I swear by my great name saith the Lord if my name shall anymore be named with the mouth of any man [see Job 12 on verse 10so in the next verse]of Judah in the land of Egypt that should say as true as the Lord liveth [an abrupt kind of speech very usual in oaths [see Deuteronomy 1 on verse 35.]
\p
\v 27 . Behold I will watch [or be vigilant or wakeful see above chapter 1.11,12] over them for evil not for good and all the man [Heb all every men ] of Judah that are in he land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword by the famine until they be at an end.
\p
\v 28 . But they that escape from the sword [Heb. The escaped ones of the sword]shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah few in number [Heb. Man in number see Genesis34 on verse 30and compare above verse 14] and all the remnant of Judah that are come into the eland of Egypt [others were come meaning those that escape] to sojourn there shall know [that is find by experience perceive so in the next verse whose word shall stand mine or theirs [Heb of me or of them that is that which proceeded from me or that which proceeded from them.
\p
\v 29 . And this [that is related in the following verse ] shall be the token unto ye saith the Lord that I will visit ye [that is will punish ye see Genesis 21 on vesre1 ] in this place that ye may know that my words shall stand ]against ye for evil.
\p
\v 30 . Thus saith the Lord behold I will give Pharaoh Hophra [called by the heathen writers Apries by other Vaphres this man was the grand child Pharaoh-Necho as Herodottus affirmeth in his second book] the king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of that eek hi soul [that seek to take away his life see Exodus 4 on verse 19 and 2Samuel 4 on verse 8 and Herodotus writteth that he being vanquished by his own subject Amasis was the last delivered unto Egyptians that made an insulation against him and was strangled by them so conceive that this Apries caused Jeremiah to be killed peradventure because of this prophesy and at a request of these wicked Jews whom it may be delivered unto them to be stoned ]like as I have given Zedekiah the King of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babel his enemy and that sought his soul.
\c 45
\s Baruch being grieved and fearful because of these prophesies is reproved of God for it by the prophet and comforted.
\p
\v 1 The word that Jeremiah spoke unto Baruch the son of Neriah when he wrote these words in a book from the mouth of Jeremiah ]see above chapter 36.2,4&c] in the forth year of Johoiakim the son of Josiah the king of Judah [it appeareth plainly that in placing and gathering of these prophesies the order the order of time is not exactly followed [ compare above chapter 35 on verse 1and see in the next chapter c] saying:
\p
\v 2 . Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel concerning thee O Baruch:
\p
\v 3 . Thou sayeth Wo is me for the Lord hath added grief to my sorrow [for the godly were very few wickedness prevailed and present miseries were exceeding great but the future were far greater] l am weary of my sighing and find no rest[by following answer may be gathered that Baruch as a godly man believing all these prophesies concerning the destruction of Jerusalem and the whole land,& c was exceedingly grieved and troubled at it but in the meanwhile through humane frailty was too much dismayed and perplexed at the condition of the people of the Jews in general and of his own person in particular for which he reproved of God and yet nevertheless comforted.
\p
\v 4 . Thus shalt thou say unto him. Thus saith the Lord behold that which I have built I will break down [that is I go about to break down I will do it forth with so in the sequel ] and that which I have planted I will pluck up even this whole land.
\p
\v 5 . And shouldest thou seek great things for thyself [that is shouldst thou desire a quiet, prosperous and the flourishing estate of the Jews and for thine own self]seek them not for behold I bring evil [of punishment ] upon all flesh [that is a general calamity upon all sorts and conditions of men see Genesis 6 on verse 12] saith the Lord but I will give thee thy soul [that is thy life ] for a prey in all places wither thou shalt go [as if God should say let my grace with this mercy be sufficient that thou art be preserved in general deluge compare above chapter 38.2 & 39.19.]

\p
\v 3 . Make ready the shield and the butlers and draw near to the battle [to give birth thus the prophet speaketh to the Egyptian soldiers in the deriding way as if he had said prepare yourself as well as ye may it will be but in vain ye shall not withstanding the smitten compare below chapter 5.11.]

\p
\v 7 Who is this that marcheth up as a stream whose waters are moved as rivers ?[ this similitude hath respect to the situation of Egypt that hath many rivers or streams of water understand hereby the multitude of soldiers with whom Pharaoh came marching on mostly proudly.]
\p
\v 8 . Egypt [that is the Egyptians] marched up like a stream and his waters are moved like rivers and he saith I will march up I will cover the earth [with the multitude of my soldiers as with a cloud I will destroy the city and them that dwell therein ] if by the city here be meant Cachermis whereof above verse 2 then he had not yet taken this city but intended now to subdue and conquer it others understand by the city cities and the inhabitants in general see below chapter 47.2.]

But this day as the Lord the Lord of hosts [see 1Kings 18 on verse 15] a day of vengeance that he may avenge himself of the adversaries and the sword shall devour by the satiate and made drunk with their blood for the Lord of hosts hath slay offering [or slay ]that is he will cause his enemies to be slain and his righteous judgments shall be so acceptable unto him as a slay offering for his name shall be thereby glorified compare Isaiah 34.6 Ezekiel 39.17 with the annotate] in the land of the north[for Carchemis lay northwards from Egypt] by the river Phrath.
\p
\v 11 . Go up to Gilead [see Genesis 37 on verse 25 with the annotate ] and fetch [ Heb take see above chapter 37on verse 17] balm [ to cure the wounds of the given compare above chapter 8.22 and below chapter 51.8] thou virgin daughter Egypt [that is ye people or inhabitants of Egypt that boast of your power prosperity and conquerableness as if none were able to master of force you as a virgin is proud of her beauty or virginity compare 2Kings 19 on verse 21] in vain dost thou multiply medicines there is no cure for thee[ or plaster &c Heb rising coming up c see above chapter 30 on verse 13 and 17 so that all your talking physic will not help you.]

\p
\v 5 . For in the going up of Lubith weeping upon weeping shall go up [compare Isaiah 15.5] for in the going down of Heronaim [where man go down of Heronaim lying to the low ground close to Lubith [the adversaries of Moab have heard a cry of calamity [Heb cry of a breach or of breaking that is murder or wailing cry of the Moabites crying to one another as followeth so Isaiah 15.5 others the enemies that cried breach were heard.]

Flee deliver your soul [that is save yourselves as we use to say or your persons] and be as the teeth in the wilderness [as dry waste and bare solitary and the heath or Tamarisk Shrub in the wilderness see above chapter 17 on verse 6 Heb Aror which also suiteth to the city of Aroer whereof below verse 19.]
\p
\v 7 . For thy confidence in thy works [thus we also use the word works for all manner of buildings and fortification wherefore Moab as inhabiting for the most part a plain and even land seemeth to have well provided and to have trusted therein against all invasions as is here exprest ]and in thy treasures thou shalt also be taken and Camos [Heb Chemosch the idol of Moabite see Numbers 21. 29 as also the Ammonites see Judges 11.24 ] shall go forth into captivity [or among the captives or those that are carried away captive so below verse 11compare Isaiah 46.1 with the annotate ] his prince and his princes together [ his to wit the idol Camos his priest that honored and adhered unto this idol as their Lord and king to whom his princes are also added so below chapter 49.3 compare Hosea 10.5and Ezekiel 43.7.]
\p
\v 8 . For the destroyer [the king of Babel ] shall come upon every city so that not a city shall escape and the valley shall perish and the plain [or flat land ] shall be destroyed for the lord hath saith it.

\v 9 . Give feathers unto Moab [spoken in a deriding way] for she shall go forth flying [instead of making resistant the prophet say they shall seek to flee with away with all speed like a bud] and her city shall become a desolation that no man shall dwell in them.
\p
\v 10 . caused be he that doth the work of the Lord [to wit the cutting off of the Moabites which was commanded and enjoined by God unto the Babylonians ] deceitfully ] Heb with deceit that is slothfully slow so that he doth not perform his master’s charge compare Proverbs 10 on verse 4and 2 on verse 24,27] yea cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood [the blood of the Moabite that he should not shed it by the sword compare above chapter 47.6,7.]
\p
\v 11 . Moab hath been quiet [that is secure and careless living at ease and in pleasure compare Amos 6.10 not fearing any violence compare Proverbs 1.32,33 and above chapter 6.27 where another kind of quietness is promised unto the people of God ] from his youth and he hath lien still on his lees [or dregs] hath not been emptied from the vessels into vessels [or let off drawn off the lees from one vessel into another a similitude taken from wine the meaning is that Moab having continued in his country from the beginning was grown rich luxurious mighty and insolent as the following words declare] and hath not walked into captivity therefore his taste remained [Heb stood ] in him and his sent is not changed.
\p
\v 12 . Therefore the day is come saith the Lord that will send unto him strand guests that shall carry him into strange places [or wanderers walkers that shall cause him to wander and straggle abroad in the strange countries compare above chapter 2.20 with the annotation ]and empty vessels and beat or scatter see Judges 7 on verse 19 ] their bottles [meaning wine bottles see above chapter 13.12] in pieces .
\p
\v 13 . And Moab shall be ashamed because of Chamos [see above verse 7] like as the house of Israel was ashamed because of Bethel [that is for the idolatrous golden calf of Bethel and the idolatry which they committed therewith see 1Kings 12.28, 29&c.] their confidence [that is wherein they put their confidence.]
\p
\v 14 . How will ye say we are champions and valiant man [Heb man of valor and courage battle?

\p
\v 16 . Moab’s destruction [as above chapter 46.21] is near to come and his evil [of punishment is ruin] hasted greatly.
\p
\v 17 . Bemoan him all ye that are around him and all ye that know his name[that knew how famous and renowned he hath been see Genesis 6 on verse4] say how is the strong slate the beautiful stick[ Heb the staff of strength the stick of beauty or of ornament that is the mighty or magnificent people or kingdom] broken?

\p
\v 19 . Stand by the way and espy thou inhabitants of Aroer [ Lying by the brook Amon Deuteronomy 2.36.] ask the fleeing men and to escape woman say what is there done ?[ because ye flee thus amazed a lively description of that which is done at such time and that which is done there.]
\p
\v 20 . Moab is confounded for he [Heb she ] is cast down [or afraid astonished] howl and cry [ see Isaiah 16.7] publish it at Amon [ a city lying by the mountains where the original of both the brooks Arnons was having the same name ] that Moabis destroyed.
\p
\v 21 . And the judgment [that is punishment see Deuteronomy 19 on verse 6 and Proverbs 19 on verse 29 so below verse 47] is come upon the plain land [that is flat land there was such a country in Moab so called the following names are all names of the cities of the Moabites it is conceive that the Moabites took them all again either by force or with the consent of the kingdom of Assyria after that the ten tribes were carried away captive for they being subdued in David’s time 2Samuel 8.2 and afterwards rebelling were conquered again by Joram &c 2Kings 3.4 c] upon Holon and upon Jahazah and upon Mophath.

\v 22 . And upon Dibon and upon Nibo and upon Bethdeblathaim.
\p
\v 23 . And upon Kariatham and upon Beth-gamuland upon Beth-meon.
\p
\v 24 . And upon Kerioth and upon Bozra [not of the Edomites as below chapter 49.13 and elsewhere often but of the Moabites some conceive it to be Bezer Josiah 21. 36] yea upon all the cities of the land that are far off and that are near.
\p
\v 25 . The horn see Deuteronomy 33 on verse 17 and in particular psalms 75.11] of Moab is cut off and his arm [see job 22 on verse 8 and in particular Psalms 37.17] I broken saith the Lord.
\p
\v 26 . make him drunken [ye Babylonian to wit with the cup of Gods wrath see above chapter 25.15,16 and Isaiah 63.6] because he hath magnified himself against the Lord [hath insulted against God and his people both in words and deeds compare Psalms 35.26,27 with the annotate and below verse 42] therefore Moab shall clap with the hands in his vomit [ like mad drunkards that fallings down to the ground clap hands and keep a stir with their own vomit others wallow themselves &c] and he himself also shall be derision [as he formerly did use to deride the people of God as followeth.]
\p
\v 27 . For was not Israel derision unto thee? [ yea certainly will the Lord say meaning when Israel was punished and carried away captive ] was be found among thieves [discovered and taken in the very act of theft who are wont to be deride ? see above chapter 2.26 and job 30.5] that thou wast so moved from the time that thy words were of him? [or didst shake for joy when thou didst talk of him mocking at his miseries as Edom did at Judah.]
\p
\v 28 . Forsake the cities and dwell in the rock [some conceive this to be a fortress lying in the south and to the wilderness of Moab which was also destroyed Isaiah 16.1 and is meant above verse 1 others take it to be meant in general of rocks and shelves] ye inhabitants of Moab and be like a dove that maketh her nest in the passages [that is in the sides in the cliffs carnies holes] of holes mouth.
\p
\v 29 . We have heard the pride of Moab he is very proud his stoutness his arrogance his pride and the haughtiness of his heart [compare Isaiah 16.6,7.]
\p
\v 30 . I know his wrath [or rising overflowing anger ] saith the Lord but not so his bars [that is his vain empty counsels his imaginary confidence compare psalms 7.15] do not effect it so [compare Isaiah 16.6such kind of phrase we do also use in our language of a man that presumptuously intended to go through with his own design not so he shall not go through with it so it will not be done so lies will not do it &c others because the Hebrew particles ken and baddin also admit to other signification thus but there is no firmness his bars whereon he relied make no firmness both in good sense to wit that Moab with all his pride and vain confidence shall find himself deceived in the end.]
\p
\v 31 . There will I howl over Moab yea I will cry for all Moab for the man of Kerheres [some conceive this of the name of another city in Moab so called because it had brick-wall compare Isaiah 16.7,11] shall they sigh [or grumble mutter peep as men used to do in the unexpected mischance grief wonder c others shall may heart sigh]
\p
\v 32 . Above the weeping of Jaezer will I weep for thee [that is more yet then Isaiah wept for Jaezer see Isaiah 16.9 others from or with the weeping of Jaezer that is as Isaiah did I will take my weeping from his join myself with him in it c] thou vine of Sibma thy branches[ or young grafts twigs plants] are gone beyond sea they have reached unto the sea of Jaezer [as men are wont to deal with noble vines thus the prophet speaketh because there were many vines in the country of the sibma and not far off lay the city of Jaezer by the brook Arnon which from thence ran along through the sea that is the lake of Jaezer between Jaezer and Acor and beyond this lake is the north-east some say that there be also vines whose plants peradventure wee carried over thither from Sibma or else transported out of the land ]but the destroyer [the Babylonian ] is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.
\p
\v 33 . So that joy gladness is taken away [Heb gathered see Psalms 26 on verse 9] out of the fruitful field [Heb camel see above chapter 2 on verse 7]namely out of the land of Moab for I have caused the wine to cease [that is I will make that there shall be no wine these are Gods words ] from the tubs [ or wine-fat see Joel 3 on verse 18] men shall not tread grapes with shouting Heb Kedad see above chapter 25 on verse 30] shouting shall be no shouting [but rather like a cry murder.]
\p
\v 34 . Because of the cry of Hebon unto Eleale unto Johas have they lifted up [Heb given] their voices from Zoar unto Horonaim that heifer of three years old [ which cities are so full bodied fat lusty strong and wanton as young lusty heifer of here years old compare Isaiah 15.5above chapter 46.20] for the waters also of Nimrim [see Isaiah 15.6 some place the city of Nimrim with these waters by the dead sea between the brook Arnon and the brook Zered in the south end of Moab compare Numbers 32.3 ,36 Josiah 15.22] shall become desolations.
\p
\v 35 . And I will cause to cease [that is make that there shall be no more] in Moab saith the Lord him that offereth on the high places [the idolatrous tremble of Baal Poer was upon an high mountains at the foot whereof the city of Banoth-Baal lay that is Baal high places ] and him that burneth incense to his Gods.
\p
\v 36 . Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like flutes [or pipes whereon they played lamentations ]also mine heart shall make a noise for the men of Kir-heres like flutes because [so are the Hebrew particles also elsewhere fitly taken for because or for that see Genesis 38.31 Numbers 10.26 and 14.43 Psalms 42.7 see also Psalms 45 on verse 3 and 8] the over plus he [namely Moab] had made [or the plainly to wit of all kind of riches which he had gotten ] is lost [Heb are lost to wit good plentiful gotten and plentiful riches which is included in the meaning of those words .]
\p
\v 37 . For all heard are bald and all beard shortened upon all hands are incision and upon the loins is a sack [Heb every heard is baldness also beard &c these were all token of grief and mourning see above chapter 16 on verse 6 and Genesis 37 on verse 34 Isaiah 15.2,3 and above chapter 47.5.]
\p
\v 38 . There is lamentation upon all the house-top of Moab [which were flat in those countries see Deuteronomy 22 on verse 8] and in the streets thereof everywhere [Heb by whole] for I have broken Moab like a vessel when in a man hath no pleasure [as above chapter 22.28] saith the Lord.
\p
\v 39 . How is he [Moab Heb she] smitten? [That is beaten in pieces bruised dismayed astonished] they howl [others thus howl or they howl saying how is he smitten? others how is he smitten how do they howl?] how hath Moab turned the neck [fleeing from the enemy] with shame? [Others how hath Moab turned the neck? is he ashamed or how is he ashamed?] So shall Moab be derision and astonishment to all that are around about him.
\p
\v 40 . For thus saith the Lord Behold he shall fly swiftly as an eagle [see Psalms 18 on verse 11and compare above chapter 4 on verse 13 and below chapter 49.22 Ezekiel 17.3 Hosiah 8.1 he the enemy the Babylonian shall suddenly come upon you] and shall be spread out his wings over Moab .
\p
\v 41 . Everyone of these cities is won [Heb the cities is won or taken that is everyone of the city shall be c as followeth others Kerijoth as above verse 24] and everyone of the strong holds [or towers castles] is taken and heart of Moab champions shall be that day as the heart of a woman that is in pain [o children beating or what is in travail as above chapter 22,23 and below chapter 49.22c.]
\p
\v 42 . For Moab shall be destroyed that he be no people [as above chapter 33 .24 and in this chapter verse2] because he hath magnified himself against the Lord [see above verse 26 .]
\p
\v 43 . Fear and the pit and the snare [here are the words in the Hebrew that are very like to one another patched pacheth and patch with elegancy we can not imitate our language so Isaiah 24.17 ] upon thee thou inhabitants of Moab saith the Lord.
\p
\v 44 . He that fleeteth away from the fear [Heb form the face of the fear] shall fall into the pit and that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare for I will b ring upon her upon Moab he year of their visitation saith the Lord.
\p
\v 45 . They that fled from the enemy forces stayed in the shadow of Hesbon [that is betook themselves for refugee in royal of Hesbon thinking to be safe or secured there]but a fire came forth out of Hesbon and a flame from Sibon [that is from the midst of the city which Sibon had taken from the Moabites and had reigned there as King Numbers 21.26] and consumed the corners of Moab and the cry of the head of the children of Tumult ] of the Moabites that made so great a tumult and boasted and bragged so highly compare above chapter 43.17 with the annotate see Numbers 21.228 the meaning is as at that time the subduing of the land of Hesbon began so shall it likewise happen so that none shall be able to hide himself.]
\p
\v 46 . Wo unto thee Moab [see Numbers 21.29 and above chapter 7] the people of Camos [see above verse 7.13] is lost for thy sons are taken away into captivity thy daughters are also lost in captivity.
\p
\v 47 . But in the days I will away captivity of Moab [ or bring again the captives of Moab this indeed maybe in some sort also applied to some temporal and corporal restoration but it hath principal respect to the spiritual redemption which they by the preaching of the gospel should with or other nations be made partakers of compare below chapter 49.6,39]saith the Lord thus far is the judgment of Moab [that is as we use to say thus spoken of the punishment of Moab see above on verse 21.]
\c 49
\s A prophesy against the Ammonites verse 1c Edoites 7 Damascus and the Syrians 23 Kedar and Hazor 28 against Elam with a promise annexed 34.
\p
\v 1 Against the children of Amon [compare Ezekiel 21.33 and 25.2 Amos 1.13 Zech.1.8,9] thus saith the Lord hath Israel then no children ?[ that Amon thus possesseth his land as if he were heir of it ? will the Lord say] hath no heir? Why then is malcam [or their Melech meaning the idol of the Ammonites otherwise called milcom and Molech 1kings 11.5,7 and Levites 18.21 see there and compare chapter 48 on verse 7 and below verse 3 and Judges 11.24 some render it their king to wit the king of the Ammonites which may also be understood of the idol for they called their idols their kings compare Ezekiel 43.7 Amos 5.26 with the annotate] heir of Gad?[that is of land that was allotted and given to God by Moses to the tribe of Gad see Numbers 32.33,34 Deuteronomy 3.12,16compare the phrase with Judges 11.23,24 and here in the next verse ]and why do this people [the idol Malcoms people compare above chapter 48.46.]dwell in his cities ?[namely Gads cities like as the Moabites hath taken the rest see above chapter 48 on verse 21.]
\p
\v 2 . Therefore behold the days come saith the Lord that I will cause a cry of war [meaning an alarm of soldiers or a sound of trumpet ] to be heard over Rabba of the children of Ammon [the chief city of the Ammonites see 2 Samuel 11.1 and 12.29,30,31 also Amos 1.14] and he shall be a desolate heap [Heb heap of desolation that is Rabba shall lie all on a heap like an heap of stone compare Deuteronomy 13.16] and her dependent places [Heb daughter that is the little towns and cities that belong to her jurisdiction see 2kings 19 on verse 21 ] shall be set on fire and Israel shall inherit them that inherited him saith the Lord [see on the former verse but for as much as we do no where read that the ten tribes that were carried away were brought again to their temporal possession though some particular men of those tribes returned with Judah therefore this must be understood spiritually so that God indeed first maintained and executed the right of inheritance which he had given his people even against the Ammonites as unrighteous possessors expelling them out of the people’s land and thereby declaring Israel to be the right heir and thereof but afterwards brought the true Israelite to their perfect possession in their head the messiah under whose kingdom he hath put all nations and made the faithful to be his brethren and co-heirs see Psalms 2.8 Revelations 11.15 and Romans 8.17c compare Isaiah 11.14 Ezekiel 25.14 with the annotate.]
\p
\v 3 . Howl O Hesbon [as neighbor city which also appertained unto Gad Josiah 21.39] for at [another at then Josiah 7] is destroyed cry ye daughters of Rabba [thereby may be meant here the women and maids that dwelt at Rabba compare Luke 23.28. ] put on sacks [see Genesis 37 on verse 34] lament and run to and fro by the hedges [or fences like the dismayed or perplexed men persons not knowing where to hide yourselves or whither to flee] for Malcham shall walk into captivity [see the like Phrase of Camos the idol of the Moabites above chapter 48.7 and Amos 1. On verse 15] his priest and the princes together.
\p
\v 4 . Wherefore gloriest thou in thy valleys?[or depth deep places wherein thou thinketh to be shut up and secured ] thy valley is flown away [that is thy low grounds valleys and depth serve thee not for valley that thou shouldest be able to hide thyself in them or all the fruits of the valleys are as light as water that is flown away or the inhabitants of the valley are like water that is run away neither valley nor mountain can help thee will God say ] thou back-sliding daughters[ see Amos 1.13 and Zeph 2.8 there where indeed of lots of springs therefore should also be formerly spared them but afterwards they became most bitter enemies of God’s people and as much as we most severely punished ] that trusted in their treasures [others hidden concealed places ] saying who should come against me ? [tat is who should be so bold or so strong that he should dare to venture upon me compare above chapter 21.13.]
\p
\v 5 . Behold I will bring a fear upon thee saith the Lord the Lord of hosts from those that are about thee [or from all places round about thee] and ye shall be driven out every men right forth [Heb before his face that is right forth abroad where he may only flee or shift for himself] and none shall gather up the wandering person[that is have pity on him as to take him up or in to harbor him.]
\p
\v 6 . But afterwards I will turn the captivity of the children of Amon[as above chapter 48.47 and below verse 39] saith the Lord.
\p
\v 7 . Against Edom [that is the posterity of Esau] thus saith the Lord of hosts is there then no wisdom more at Theman? [compare Obadiah verse 8, 9 them in and Dedan where two cities of the Edomites lying upon mountains by the east end of the mountain of Esau behind the forth end dead sea as some maps do shew .Theman was Esau’s grandchild by Eliphaz from whom this city no doubt hath the name see genesis 30.10, 11] is counsel perished from he prudent ? [Others from their children] is their wisdom become unprofitable? [The Hebrew word signifieth commonly to become excessive superstitious redundant and consequently to become unprofitable vain empty or unserviceable.]
\p
\v 8 . Flee turn back dwell in deep places [Heb deepen yourselves to dwell or by dwelling or abiding meaning to hide yourselves so verse 30] ye inhabitants of Dedan [see on the former verse of a country in Arabia so called see above chapter 25.23it may be that both city of Edom and the country in Arabia have one original because they lay not far from one another compare above chapter 25on verse 23] for I have brought [that is I will surely bring ]the destruction [ or ruin]of Esau upon him the time that I visited him [ that is the time of visitation as God elsewhere speaketh that is of his punishment see Genesis 21 o verse 1.]
\p
\v 9 . If there were come unto thee wine gatherers [or grape cutters] would they not have left a gleaning ? if they were come thieves by night would they not have destroyed [that is have taken away or stolen from thee compare Obadiah verse 5 which is commonly done by the destroying and rifling of the house and goods ] as much as would suffice them ? [Heb. Their sufficiency leaving something would the Lord say or taking no more or they could conveniently bring away or carry along with them but I will deal otherwise with him making him bare and empty that he shall have nothing remaining as is shewed in the following words.]
\p
\v 10 . But I have made Esau bare I have uncovered his secret places that he shall not be able to hide himself his seed is destroyed also his brethren and his neighbor he is no more [some join these words to the next verse with some addition thus he is not that should say then the meaning of that which is followeth is plain to wit that there shall be none that shall have pity on his fatherless children or widows others conceive that god in the following words speaketh in a deriding manner unto Esau as he had said thou needest not to think that thy fatherless children and widows shall find favor with me if thou leavest behind I will consequently execute my judgments upon thy seed and that all that may be left of thee]
\p
\v 11 . Leave the fatherless children behind I will preserve them alive and let thy widows trust in me.
\p
\v 12 . For thus saith the Lord they whose judgment it is not to drink the cup [or of my wrath that is they that have not so deserved it as thou hast to wit the godly among mine own people compare above chapter 25.29 and see Deuteronomy 19 on verse 6] shall altogether drink [Heb drinking drink that is shall not go scot free they smart be punished ] and shouldst thou any ways beheld guiltless ?[Heb or being held guiltless he held guiltless that is my ways go unpunished see 1 Kings 2 on verse 9 and above chapter 25 on verse 29 ] thou shalt not be held guiltless but thus halt altogether drink [Heb drinking drink.
\p
\v 13 . For I have sown by myself saith the Lord that Bozra [the chief city of the Edomites often mentioned in scripture ] shall become an astonishment [or solitariness, desolation, as above chapter 25.9,18c] a reproach a desolation and a curse and all the cities thereof [places that belong unto Bozra] shall become everlasting desolations [Heb desolation of eternity.]
\p
\v 14 . I have heard a report or rumor tiding Heb. Properly heard an hearing compare Obadiah verse 1,2,3c] from the Lord[that is the Lord hath revealed these tidings into me or which fame or rumor God sent raising up the king of Babel against Edom as followeth ] and there is an ambassador sent among the heathen [that is I have ordered by my divine providence that is as it were by express charge and by my instigation they shall do as followeth compare above chapter 25 on verse 9 with the annotate as stone the king of Babel hath sent forth an ambassador to stir up the nation c against Edom as followeth which was so ordered of God ] for to say gather ye together and come against her [Bozra or Edom as here all along mention is made of this nation and land sometimes in the feminine and sometimes in the masculine gender compare above chapter 48 on verse 4] and get you up to the battle.
\p
\v 15 . For lo I have made [Heb given appointed] thee small among the heathen despised among men [that is I have ordained that thou shalt be brought to such a miserable and despised condition that thou shalt not be able to compared with the other nation.]
\p
\v 16 . Thy terribleness [wherewith thou makest others afraid to shake quake and tremble before thee in regard of thy pride and thy fearful hilly country which none durst approach unto ] hath deceived thee[ for thou hast in vain relied thereon ] and the insolence of thine heart thou dwellest in the cleft of the rocks [ Heb rock] that keepest on the top of the hills [Heb keepest the top of the hill ] though thou shouldest make thy nest as high s the eagle yet will I thrust thee down from thence saith the Lord [compare Obadiah verse 4.]
\p
\v 17 . So Edom shall become an astonishment [others desolation] whosoever goeth by her shall be astonished and whistle [p or his pipe see above chapter 18.16] at all her plagues.
\p
\v 18 . As the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorra and their neighbors [Adma and Zeboim and the places round about the whole country they that lay near unto them compare below chapter 50.40 Genesis 19.25 Amos 4.11] shall it be [to wit with Edom this other branch of the comparison is inserted to supply and ill up the sense as some also do in the beginning of the next verse ] saith the Lord no man shall dwell there [in the land of Edomites which being subdued by the Babylonian shall thenceforth from time to time be so wasted and destroyed that it shall at length become utterly desolate and uninhabited ] nor any child of man converse it.
\p
\v 19 . Behold he shall come up like a lion from the lifting up of Jordan against the strong habitation [or rough hard habitation that is the hilly country of the Edomites others pleasant habitation of the strong meaning that there I spoken of the bold attempts of the Edomites who were more pushed up hen Jordan in their marching up against people and the house of God but in vain with a ridiculous event like a lion c who must leave his usual resting place and in a rage roaring get up speeding to the mountains when the Jordan over floweth on every side and chasteth the lion away from thence see above chapter 12 on verse 5 and compare Zach. 11.3 so shall the king of Babel with incense mind marched up to the mountains of the Edomites or as a lion getteth up higher because of the swelling of the Jordan so shall he come up against c. all to one sense compare chapter 50.44of Cyrus his coming against Babel others for this place is diversely rendered and expounded as a lion shall be marched up from the proud o proud Jordan against c. that is Nebuchadnezzar shall march up against Edom when he shall have subdued the land of Judah which Edomites could not imagine but rejoiced at the miseries of Judah ] for I will in a moment [that is suddenly unaware so in the Hebrew word taken Proverbs 12.9] make him [Edom] run from thence [Heb. From her that is from country or land Idumea see above on verse 14 so in the following words others when I shall have made him to rest that is after the Edom shall have rested a long while I will &c] and he that is chosen for it him I will appoint against her [or give charge commission command concerning her meaning king Nebuchadnezzar whom god therefore calleth his servant see above chapter 25.9 others he that is chosen him c that is I shall not want serviceable instruments whom I may take from whence I please to curb and cut off the insolence Edom ] for who is like me and who should summon me ? [Or sue me at law or appoint me at the time or season to plead against him? Or shall limit or appoint me measure and time in my works? See Job 9.19 with annotate] and who is the shepherd [that is king ruler or protector compare 2Smuel 5.2and above chapter 6.3 and 10.21 and 12.10&c] that should stand before my face? Others against my face its all to one sense that is one what king or monarchy should be able to be my adversary?]
\p
\v 20 . Therefore hear the counsel of the Lord that hath counseled against Edom and his thoughts that he hath thought [that is resolution decree that he hath made compare below verse 30] against the inhabitants of Theman see above verse 7] if he meanest the flock [the least Nebuchadnezzar’s soldiers compare above chapter 6.3 ] shall not pull them down [that is level their strong holds with the ground compare 2Samuel 17.13 or drag their bodies along on the ground as above chapter 15.3 and 22.19] if he [the enemy or everyone of them or if men c] shall not make their inhabitation desolate upon them [as we use to say that man’s house is pulled down or burnt down upon his head compare 1Kings 17.18 with the annotate others with them these two abrupt sentences very usual I making of oaths others Deuteronomy 1 on verse 35.]
\p

Thus saith the Lord of hosts that broad wall of Babel [which was fifty royal cubits or ells thick and broad so that two carets could conveniently ride a beast upon it and yet a good space remain between both as histories testify Heb walls in the plural number because this wall was so exceeding thick as if it had been many walls as behemoth beast as an elephant see Psalms 73.22 Job 4.10] shall be utterly bare [to the very foundation compare Psalms 137.7 others broken ] and her high gates shall be burnt with fire so that the people[ whole labor the Babylonians had used in the making of the wall] shall have labored in vain [or for emptying that is all that should be again taken away destroyed and scattered abroad what was brought and piled up together for it] and the nations of the fire [or for the fire that is that their labor might be burnt with fire not that this was the intention of the fame of the builders but that their labor so fell out of the providence of God and served for that end and purpose compare Habakkuk 2.13 ] that they grew saint.

The word or the matter which the prophet Jeremiah commanded Seraia the son of Neriah the son of Mechseia when he went from [or by reason of the Hebrew particle is sometimes taken for from by reason for out of as apeareth Genesis 4.1 and 44.4 Exodus 9.29 Ezekiel 6.9 Micah 3.8 and in this place] Zedekiah to Babel in the forth year of reign [others with Zedekiah &c but this is nowhere else mentioned in the scripture and it seemeth not every credible that Zedekiah having rebelled against the king of Babel should have adventured to go in person to Babel but rather that should mediate a reconciliation and peace by means of this peaceable pious ambassador ] and Seraia was the peaceable prince [ the Heb prince of rest that is a godly quiet and peaceable man whom Jeremiah might have trusted with his business whereat another man in those times would have mocked and refused to do it as being full of danger and trouble others chief of the king rest that is high chamberlain some conceive it to be a name of some certain country whereof see 1Chronicles 2 on verse 52.]
\p
\v 60 . Now Jeremiah wrote all the evil should come upon Babel on a book [meaning a special book, or duplicate, transcript which he delivered to this Seraia to take along with him ] to wit all the words that are written against Babel.
\p
\v 61 . And Jeremiah said unto Seraia when thou comest unto Babel then thou shalt see [ or behold or look upon view it namely Babel to compare this prophesy with the present estate Babel or when thou shalt see it &c ] and read all these words.
\p
\v 62 . And shall say O Lord thou hast spoken against this place that thou wilt cut it off so that there be no inhabitant in it from man to beast it shall become everlasting desolation [Heb desolation of eternity as above verse 26.]

\v 64 . And shalt say thou shalt Babel sink and not rise again because of the evil [Heb from the face of the evil that is from or because of the evil punishments mischief calamity destruction &c] that I will bring upon her Babel they shall grow weary [namely the Babylonians they shall grow faint and feeble and fail so that they shall not be able to rise and come up again though the labor and toil exceedingly about it] hither to are the words of Jeremiah [compare above chapter 48.47 to wit concerning Babel punishment or concerning the prophesies of Jeremiah in general which are contained and gathered together in this book hence is gathered by some that the next chapter is added thereto by some other men of God s a seal and further exposition of the former prophesies compare the annotate on the thirty forth of the chapter of Deuteronomy.]

\s A repetition of the reign of Zedekiah when taking the siege and destruction of Jerusalem with the causes thereof and that which further happened there verse 1c Jojachin is delivered out of prison by evil Morodach and friendly entreated by him 31.
\p
\v 1 Zedekiah was one and twenty years old [Heb a son of one and twenty years ] when he became king and reigned eleven years at Jerusalem and his mothers name was Hamutal a daughter of Jeremiah of Libna [see 2kings 24.18,19,20 and also chapter 25.1 the sequel also above chapter 39.1,2 &c where this whole history is first related which is here related for reason mentioned in the last verse of the former chapter see the annotate of the chapter aforesaid of the second book of the Kings.]
\p
\v 2 . And did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord according to all that Jojakin had done.
\p
\v 3 . For it came to pass because of the anger of the Lord at Jerusalem and Judah till he had cast them away from his face and Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babel.
\p
\v 4 . And it came to pass in the ninth year of his year in the tenth month on the tenth day of the month that Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babel came unto Jerusalem he and all his army and they camped themselves against it and they built sorts against it round about .
\p
\v 5 . So the city was besieged unto eleventh year of the king Zedekiah.
\p
\v 6 . In the forth month on the ninth day of the month when the famine waxed strong in the city and the people of the land had no bread.
\p
\v 7 . Then the city was broke through and all the soldiers fled and marched forth by night out of the city by the way of the gate which where between the two wall by the kings garden now the Chaldeans where against the city round about and they went by the way of the plain.
\p
\v 8 . But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king and they over tokk Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho and all his army was scattered from him.
\p
\v 9 . They took the king and carried up to the king of Babel to Ribla in the land of Hamath the same spake judgments against him [passed sentence upon him and his from the perjury rebellion and unthankful o above chapter 39.5.]
\p
\v 10 . And the king of Babel slew the sons of Zedekiah [that is caused them to be slain as frequently] before his eyes and he slew also the princes of Judah at Ribla.
\p
\v 11 . And he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah [that is he caused his eyes to be out to be spoiled as that he could not see] and he bound him with two copper chains so the king of Babel brought him to Babel and put him to the prison-house [Heb house of visitation and punishment oversight wards c where he caused him to remain until the day of his death.]
\p
\v 12 . After that in the fifth month on the tenth day of the month this year was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babel when Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard who stood before the kings face [who served the king wanted upon him was continually about him see Deuteronomy 1 on verse 38 and 1Kings 1 on verse2 for this is said 2kings 25.8 the servant and minister of the king of Babel one doth expound the other ] was come to Jerusalem [its said 2kings 25.8 that he came to Jerusalem on the seventh day of the month the reconciling of the difference is he came into the city of the seventh day and he began to execute his charge on the tenth day whereof in the sequel.]
\p
\v 13 . Then he burnt the house of the Lord and kings house together with all the house of Jerusalem and all the houses of the great ones [or to wit so that the former word all expounded by the all houses of the great one [Heb every house of the great one every great house that is all the house of the great ones and all great houses the sense agreeing together the houses do commonly belong to might an great man see 2Kings 25 on verse 9] burnt he with fire.
\p
\v 14 . And all the army of the Chaldeans that was with the captain of the guard brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.
\p
\v 15 . Now the poorest[Heb. thinness or poverties see 2kings 24 on verse 14so above chapter 40.7 and in the beginning of the next verse ] of the people and the residue o the people that were left in the city and revolters that were fallen to the king of Babel the residue of the multitude [Heb. Amon which 2king 25.11 is used the word Hamon that is multitude company of people by changing of one see also above chapter 46on verse 25] did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away captive.
\p
\v 16 . But of the poorest of the land did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard leave some for vinedressers and for husbandmen.
\p
\v 17 . Moreover the Chaldeans brake the copper pillars that were in the house of the Lord and the bases and the copper of the sea that was in the house of the Lord and he carried away all copper therefore to Babel .
\p
\v 18 . And they took the pots the shovels and the flesh-hooks and the sprinkling basins and the incense plates and all the copper vessels wherewith they performed the ministry [Heb with which they ministered that is wherewith they were wont to perform the ministry in the house of the Lord or which they were to use the ministry.]
\p
\v 19 . And the captain of the guard took away the bowls and the incense vessels and the sprinkling basins and the pots and the candle sticks and the cups [see of this last word Exodus 25.29 and Numbers 4.7 ]what was wholly gold and what was wholly silver [others and those that were all gold and those that were all silver Heb gold silver.]
