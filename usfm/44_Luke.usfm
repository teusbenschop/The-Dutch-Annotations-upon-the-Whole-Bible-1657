\mt2 THE HOLY GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE DESCRIPTION OF
\mt LUKE
\p Luke was by practice or possession a physician Colossians 4.14 and a continual companion of the apostle Paul in his travel even when being taken prisoner he brought to Rome as many be gathered out of Acts 20.6 and chapter 21.15 and chapter 27.1 and chapter 28 verse 14, 16 some of opinion also that he is the person of whom the apostle speaks 2 Corinthians 8.18, 19 mention is made of him likewise 2Tim 4 verse 12 and Philemon verse 24 he wrote two books namely this gospel and the Acts of the apostles .
\s THE ARGUMENT OF THIS BOOK
\p This book is of the same kind of the argument of the foregoing saving that Luke sets down some other special matter which were omitted by the other evangelists after the preface he describes the parents and conceptions of John the Baptist and the conception of Christ declared to Mary by the angel Gabriel who treats with the angel thereabout and speaks with their kinswoman Elizabeth thereof

\s The preface of Luke to his gospel 1 the parentage and life of Zachary and Elizabeth 5 an angel appears to Zachariah in the temple 8 who foretells him the conception and birth of John whose office he describeth 13 Zachary not believing this is therefore punished with dumbness for a season 18 Elizabeth conceiveth 24 the angel Gabriel declares to the virgin Mary that shall conceive and give birth to the son of God 26 afterwards she goeth to Elizabeth who receiveth her with joy and pronounceth her blessed 39 Mary praiseth the Lord with a hymn 40 Elizabeth brings forth her son 57 who is circumcised and called John 59 Zachary recovers his speech again and sings a song of praise to the Lord prophesying of the office of Christ and his fore runner John 64 who goeth up in the wilderness and becomes strong in the spirit 80.
\p
\v 1 Forasmuch as many has taken in hand [many ancient teachers think that by these are understood some persons who of their own motion had undertaken to set down some parts of the evangelical history which were not received of the Christian church or which they have not perfected but others think that Matthew and Mark may be understood hereby forasmuch as Luke seems to put himself among them and sets down many histories and particulars which either are not at all or in few words touched by them ]to set in order a relation of things which have perfect certainty amongst us [namely Christians .]
\p
\v 2 . According as those have delivered over unto us who from the beginning where themselves beholders [namely the apostles and disciples of Christ see 1 John 1.1 ]and ministers of the word [that is of the matter that is here described Hebraism although some think that here by Christ himself is understood as he is so called John1.1]
\p
\v 3 . So have I also thought good having diligently searched all things [Gr followed after searched after endeavored after that is having gotten a grounded knowledge of all things all which was done of him by a special motion of the holy Ghost Acts 15 verse 25,28, 2 Peter1.21 ]from before onwards [Gr even from above for he begins from the conception of John the Baptist ]accordingly to write unto thee most excellent [Gr most mighty] Theophilus [Gr who is Theophilus was is uncertain yet it appears by this title which here is given to him that he as an honorable and eminent man seeing the same title is also given to the Roman governors Felix and Festus Acts 24.3 Acts 26.25 to the same also Luke dedicated his second book of the Acts of the apostle Acts 1.1]
\p
\v 4 . That thou mightiest know the certainty of the things whereof thou art instructed [the Greek word many times signified to instruct with a lively voice but is also sometimes taken for all manner of instructing Acts 18.25 Romans 2.18 1Corinthians 14.19 Galatians 6.6]
\p
\v 5 . In the days [that is in the times] of Herod [namely the great see concerning him Matthew 2.1 ]the king of Judea there was a certain priest by name Zachariah of the daily order [Gr Ephemeria which here signifies a certain order or class which stood under one head and some days of the year their course where to take care of the worship of God in the temple of which the order of Abia was the eight according to the first instruction see 1 Chronicles 24.10]of Abia and his wife as the daughter of Aaron and her name Elizabeth.
\p
\v 6 . And they were both righteous before God [that is not only before men as the hypocrites sometimes are but in all uprightness before God ]walking in all commandments and rights of the Lord unblameably [namely by men without giving offence for that Zachariah was not without sin appears out of verse 20]
\p
\v 7 . And they had no child because Elizabeth was barren and both were gone far onwards in their days.
\p
\v 8 . And it came to pass that he administered the priest office of God [namely as his special function together with others for as much as he was common priest and no high priest as some think for he might not lot with any man ] in the course of his daily order .
\p
\v 9 . According to the custom of priestly administration it was fallen to his lot that he should enter to his temple of the Lord to offer incense.
\p
\v 10 . And all the multitude of the people was without [namely in the court of the temple 1 Kings 7.12 2 Chronicles 4.9] praying at the hour of offering incense.
\p
\v 11 And there was seen of him an angel of the Lord standing at the right side of the altar of incense offering [this altar stood in the holy place behind which the holy of holies separated by the vail here incense was to be offered everyday morning and evening Exodus 30.7,8]
\p
\v 12 . And Zachariah seeing him was troubled and fear fell upon him.
\p
\v 13 . But the angel said unto him fear not Zachariah for thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name John [which is to say in the Hebrew the grace of God or graced of God or God hath graciously given]
\p
\v 14 . And joy and gladness shall be to thee and many shall rejoice at his birth.
\p
\v 15 . For he shall be great [that is excellent in respect of his gifts and office whereby he excelled all other foregoing prophets Matthew 11.9, 11] before the Lord he shall not drink neither wine nor strong drink [like the Nazarites were to abstain from it see Numbers 6.3 Judea 13.4, 7] and he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mothers womb.
\p
\v 16 . And shall turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.
\p
\v 17 . And he shall go forth before him in the spirit and power of Elias [see hereof Matthew 11.14] to convert the hearts of the fathers [namely of his ministry] to the children and the disobedient of of the just to make ready a prepared people for the Lord [that is fit and ready to receive the Lord]
\p
\v 18 . And Zachariah said unto the angel whereby shall I know that? For I am old and my wife is far gone on her days.
\p
\v 19 . And the angel answered and said unto him I am Gabriel which stand before God [that is continually serve God before his throne like as the servant stand before their kings to receive his command see Revelations 8.2] and I am sent forth to speak unto thee and to declare these things unto thee [Gr evangelize that is to bring glad tidings]
\p
\v 20 . And behold, thou shalt hold thy peace, and not be able to speak until the day that these things shall be come to pass, because that thou shalt not believed my words, which shall be fulfilled at their season.
\p
\v 21 . And the people were waiting for Zacharias, [Namely, that he should come forth to give them the usual blessing. See Numb. 6. 23, & c.] and marveled that he tarried so long in the Temple.
\p
\v 22 . And when he came forth, he could not speak unto them; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the Temple. And he beckoned to them, and remained dumb.
\p
\v 23 . And it came to pass when the days of his ministration were fulfilled. [That is, were come to an end: which time was about half a month in the year, 1 Chro. 24. 7, 18.] at each time from the one Sabbath to the other, 1 Chronicles 9. 25. and 2 Chro. 23. 8. during which time they they remained in the Temple, in certain dwellings in the Courts of the Temple erected for this purpose: See Jerem. 35. 4] that he went to his house.
\p
\v 24 . And after those days his wife Elizabeth became with child, [Gr. Conceived] and she hid her self five months, [ namely; until it might fully appear that she was with child] Saying:
\p
\v 25 . Thus hath the Lord done to me, in the days in which he hath looked upon [me] to take away my reproach amongst men. [That is, barrenness, which was reproachful with the Jews.]
\p
\v 26 . And in the sixth month, [Namely after that Elizabeth was with the child, and had conceived John the Baptist, as appears out of v. 36.] the Angel Gabriel was sent by God unto a City in Galilee called Nazareth.
\p
\v 27 . To a Virgin in which was betrothed to a man, whose name was Joseph, of the house of David: [That is, linage. See Luke 2. 4.] and the name of the virgin was Mary.
\p
\v 28 . And the Angel being come in unto her, said, hail, thou that art much graced [That is hast found grace with the Lord, as the Angel expounds it afterwards, v. 30.] the Lord (is) with thee, thou (art) blessed among women [namely, because by Gods grace thou shalt have the honour and blessing, that thou shalt be the mother which shall bring the Messiah into the world. See v. 42. 43.]
\p
\v 29 . And when she saw (him) she was so troubled at this his word, and considered what kind of salutation this might be.
\p
\v 30 . And the Angel said unto her, fear not Mary, for thou hast found grace with God.
\p
\v 31 . And behold thou shalt be with child [Or conceive in the womb] and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. [That is Saviour, as the Angel expounds it Matth. 1. 21]
\p
\v 32 . He shall be great, and he called the son of the most high, [That is: shall be indeed, and be so acknowledged by all believers; as afterwards also v. 35.] And the Lord God shall give unto him the throne [that is, the royal authority; whereby here is understood the spiritual Kingdoms of Christ, whereof Davidâ€™s wordly Kingdom was a type] of his Father David. [Namely: according to the flesh. See Mat. 1. 1]
\p
\v 33 . And he shall be King [Namely a spiritual King See John 18; 36.] over the house of Jacob [that is the Church of God, which is the spiritual house of Jacob and the Israel of God, Gal. 6. 16.] For ever, and of his Kingdom there shall be none end.
\p
\v 34 . And Mary said unto the Angel, how shall that bee? [ This she asks, forasmuch as the Angel had told her this she being a Virgin, without making mention of her future husband: and she understood by the Angels words that this should really come to pass, so that this question of Mary proceeded not from any unbelief as the question of Zacharias, v. 18. but only out of a desire to be further instructed herein] seeing I know no man.
\p
\v 35 . And the Angel answering said unto her, the holy Ghost shall come upon thee, [Namely, so to work by his power in thee, that thou shalt conceive without the help of man] and the power of the most high shall overshadow thee. Therefore also that holy (thing) [that is, that holy person] which shall be born of thee, shall be called the son of God. [Hereby it is not said, that Christ should be the son of God, because he was conceived by the Holy Ghost, for so she should be the son of the Holy Ghost, but because his conception by the Holy Ghost is a certain argument, that the eternal son of God hath assumed the true human nature of the flesh and blood of Mary by the operation of the Holy Ghost into the unity of his person, Phil. 2. 7. Heb. 2. 14. according as Esay prophesied of both, Isa. 7. 14.]
\p
\v 36 . And behold Elizabeth thy cousin [Hereby appears that Elizabeth by her Mothers side was of the tribe of Judah, howsoever her father was of the shock of Aaron or Levi, v. 5. For the Priests indeed married wives out of other Tribes, because they had no inheritance] is also her self with child of a son in her old age; and this month is the sixth with her that was called barren.
\p
\v 37 . For nothing [Gr. Word] shall be impossible with God.
\p
\v 38 . And Mary said; behold the hand-maid of the Lord: Be it unto me according to thy word. And the Angel departed from her.
\p
\v 39 . And Mary being risen up in those days [Namely, after that she was become with, as appears from that which followeth] travelled with hast into the hill-country into a City of Juda [that is, lying in the Tribe of Juda. This City seems to have been the City Hebron, first called Kiriath-arba, which being situate in the Tribe of Judah, was fallen to the part of the Levites and Priests, and lay in the hill-country south-wards from Jerusalem. See Josh. 21. v. 9, 10, 11.]
\p
\v 40 . And came into the house of Zacharias and Saluteth Elizabeth.
\p
\v 41 . And it came to pass when Elizabeth heard the Salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb: [This came to pass by a supernatural and extraordinary motion of the holy Ghost.
\p
\v 42 . And cried out with a great voice, and said, blessed (art) thou among women; and blessed (is) the fruit of thy womb.
\p
\v 43 . And whence (happeneth) this to me, that the mother of my Lord cometh to me.
\p
\v 44 . For behold as soon as the voice of thy salutation came into mine ears the babe leapt for joy in my womb.
\p
\v 45 . And blessed is (she) that believed: For the things which were told her from the Lord [That is, in the Lords name by the Angel; see v. 31. 32. 33.] Shall be accomplished.
\p
\v 46 . And Mary said, my soul doth magnify the Lord: [That is, glorifies and praiseth him in the highest degree.]
\p
\v 47 . And my spirit rejoiceth in God my Saviour.
\p
\v 48 . Because he hath regarded the lowness of his handmaid, [that is, the low and mean estate; for it is repugnant to the virtue of humility to boast thereof] for behold from henceforth, all the generations shall pronounce me blessed.
\p
\v 49 . For he that is mighty hath done great things unto me, and holy [is] his name.
\p
\v 50 . And his mercy is from generation to generation, [Gr. To generations of generations.] Upon them that fear him.
\p
\v 51 . He hath done a mighty work [Gr. Might] by his arm: that is, by his power] he hath scattered the high-minded [namely, as the chasse is scattered by the wind, Psa. 1. 4.] in the cogitations of their heart.
\p
\v 52 . Mighty (ones) hath he plucked down from the thrones, and lowly ones hath be exalted.
\p
\v 53 . Hungry ones hath be filled with good things and rich ones he hath sent away empty.
\p
\v 54 . He hath taken up [The Greek word signifies to reach forth a helping hand to him that is fallen or forsaken] Israel his servant, that he might be mindful of his mercy.
\p
\v 55 . (As he spake to our Fathers [namely] to Abraham and his seed) for ever.
\p
\v 56 . And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her house.
\p
\v 57 . And the time of Elizabeth was fulfilled, that she should bring forth, and she brought forth a son.
\p
\v 58 . And those that dwelt there round about, and her kinsfolk heard that the Lord had greatly showed [Gr. Magnified] his mercy to her, and rejoiced with her.
\p
\v 59 . And it came to pass that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and called it Zacharias, [Namely, according to the custom of the Jews, who gave the children their names when they were circumcised, Gen. 21. 3. Isa. 8. v. 1. 2. Luke 2. 21. as therefore the like is also done with us in baptism] after the name of his father.
\p
\v 60 . And his mother answered and said, not [so:] but he shall be called John.
\p
\v 61 . And they said unto her, there is no man in thy kindred [or linage] who is called by this name.
\p
\v 62 . And they beckoned to his Father, how he would that he should be called.
\p
\v 63 . And when he had asked for a writing-table, [There were little tables or boards done over with wax, whereon men wrote with pins, or gravers.] he wrote, saying, John is his name. And they marveled all.
\p
\v 64 . And straightway his month was opened, and his tongue [made loose] and he spake praising God. [Gr. Blessing]
\p
\v 65 . And there came fear upon all, that dwelt round about them; and in the whole hill-country of Judea, there was much spoken of all these things. [Gr. Words.]
\p
\v 66 . And all that beard it took it to heart, [Gr. Laid it in their hearts. i.e. retained and considered of these things carefully] saying, what shall this child be pray. And the hand of the Lord was with him. [That is, a special power and grace of the Lord.]
\p
\v 67 . And Zacharias his father was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied saying,
\p
\v 68 . Praised [Gr. Blessed.] [Be] be the Lord the God of Israel, for he hath visited [namely in mercy] and brought to pass redemption for his people.
\p
\v 69 . And hath created a horn of Salvation [That is, a strong Redeemer, namely Christ, as Psal 132. 17.A similitude taken from beasts that have horns, wherewith they put forth great force] for us in the house of David his servant.
\p
\v 70 . As he spoke by the mouth of his holy Prophets, which [were] from the beginning of the world [Gr. From the age i.e. since that the age or world was.]
\p
\v 71 . [Namely, deliverance from our enemies, and from the hand of all those that hate us.
\p
\v 72 . That he might show mercy to our fathers, and might remember his holy covenant: [That is, might really show that he was mindful of it.]
\p
\v 73 . [And ] of the Oath, [Gr. The oath; which some interpret, according to the oath, or of the oath.] Which he swore to our father Abraham to give unto us.
\p
\v 74 . That we being delivered out of the band of our enemies, might serve him without fear,
\p
\v 75 . In holiness and righteousness before him, all his days of our life.
\p
\v 76 . And thou child shalt be called a prophet of the most high: for thou shalt go fourth before the face of the Lord, [Namely, of the Messiah Jesus Christ. See Matth. 3. 3.] To prepare his ways.
\p
\v 77 . To give his people knowledge of Salvation, in [Or to, by.] the forgiveness of their sins.
\p
\v 78 . Through the inwards moving of the mercy of our God, [Gr. Bowels of mercy, a similitude taken from men, whose bowels are moved and yern when the heart is strongly affected with mercy] wherewith the (Sun) rising out of the height, [Hereby is signified the Messiah, because he is called, A star out of Jacob, Numb. 24.17. and the sun of righteousness. Mal. 4. 2. Otherwise the Greek word signifies also, a rising shoot or sprout, as the Messiah is so called. Jer. 23. 5. Zach. 3. 8. and 6. 12. but the following verse showeth that here it is more sitly taken in the first signification] hath visited us.
\p
\v 79 . To appear [Or to enlighten] to those that are set in darkness, and the shadow of death : to direct our feet on the way of peace.
\p
\v 80 . And the child grew up, and was strengthened in the spirit, [Or, by the spirit i.e. by the operation of the holy Ghost] and was in the wilderness, [See the Annotations, Matth. 3. 1.] until the day of his showing (exhibition) to Israel. [that is, that he came forth, to administer and execute his office amongst the Israelites.]
\c 2
\s 1. Christ is born at Bethlehem. 8. land his birth made known by an Angel to the Shepherds. 13. for which the heavenly hosts praise God with an hymn. 15. the shepherds go to Bethlehem to see the child, and having spread abroad that which was told them thereof, return again. 21. The child is circumcised and called Jesus. 22. Presented to the Lord in the Temple. 25. where Simeon received him in his arms, and after an hymn prophesied of him. 36. The like doth Anna the Prophetess. 41. Christ being twelve years old, goeth with his parents to Jerusalem. 45. Is found by them in the Temple among the Doctors. 51. returned to Nazareth, and is subject to his parents, and increased in wisdom, stature and grace.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in those same days [Namely, while Mary went with child] that there went forth a command from the Emperor Augustus, [this was the second Roman Emperor succeeding Julius Caesar the first: and under his government the Roman Empire was in its greatest power and quiet: he reigned about fifty six years; and this came to pass about the two and fortieth year of his empire] that the whole world, [Gr. All the inhabited: namely, world, which must be understood as far as the Roman Empire then extended itself] Should be enrolled. [namely, thereby to know the multitude of subjects of the Roman Empire, and their abilities, that every one might be taxed according to the same.]
\p
\v 2 . This first enrolling happened [ This enrolling is called the first, in respect of another which happened afterwards; whereof mention is made, Act. 5. 37. and by Josephus Antiquit. Lib. 18. cap. 1.] when Cyrenius [This man in the Roman histories is called Zutrinus, who was governor over whole Syria, whereof Judea at that time was a part] was governor of Syria.
\p
\v 3 . And they went all to be enrolled, every one to his own City. [Namely, from whence he descended, and where those of his family dwelt.]
\p
\v 4 . And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the City Nazareth into Judea, into the City of David which is called Bethlehem, [Of this City see Micah. 5. 1. Matth. 2. 1. and is called the City of David, because there David was born and brought up. 1 Samuel 17. ver. 1. 2. John 7. 42.] (Because he was of the house and family of David.)
\p
\v 5 . To be enrolled with Marie his betrothed wife, [It is very credible that Joseph had now taken her to him, according to the command of the Angel Matth. 1. 20. but is now notwithstanding here still called betrothed, because she lived so with him, as if she had been but betrothed] who was with child.
\p
\v 6 . And it came to pass while they were there, that the days were fulfilled that she should bring forth.
\p
\v 7 . And she brought forth her first-born son, [See hereof Matth. 1. ver. 25.] and swathed him, [Gr. Or wrapped him in swathing-hands] and laid him down in the manger, because there was no place for then in the Inn.
\p
\v 8 . And there were shepherds in that same country, abiding in the field, and kept the night watch over their stock.
\p
\v 9 . And so, an Angel of the Lord stood by them, [Namely unexpected and suddenly, as the Greek word imports] and the glory of the Lord [ that is, a divine luster and brightness] shined round about them, and they feared with a great fear.
\p
\v 10 . And the Angel said unto them fear not, for behold I publish unto you [Gr. Evangelize that is, declare glad tidings] great joy, which shall be to all the people. [Namely, Gods people, see Matth. 1. 21.]
\p
\v 11 . [Namely] that to day is born to you the Saviour, which is Christ [ or, the anointed] the Lord, in the City of David.
\p
\v 12 . And this shall be the sign unto you, [ Namely, whereby ye shall know the child, and find that to be true which I declare unto you] ye shall find the babe wrapped in swathing bands, and lying in the manger.
\p
\v 13 . And immediately [there] was with the Angel a multitude of the heavenly host [That is, of the angels which are as an host of the Lord, by which he defends the good and punisheth the bad. Psal. 34. 8. and 103. 21.] praising God and saying,
\p
\v 14 . Honour [Or, glory] [be] to God in the highest [heavens] and peace on earth, [namely, with God, Rom. 5. 1.] in men a good pleasure. [That is, the good pleasure of God be fulfilled by him towards men. 2. Thess. 1. 11. Others of the good pleasure. i.e. in the men which God hath chosen according to his good pleasure. Eph. 1, 5.]
\p
\v 15 . And it came to pass when the Angels were passed away from them [Gr. Gone-away] towards heaven, that the shepherds, [Gr. The men the shepherds] said one to another, Let us now go unto Bethlehem, and let us see the word, [That is, the whole matter. Hebr.] that there is come to pass, which the lord hath made known unto us.
\p
\v 16 . And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger.
\p
\v 17 . And when they had seen it, they made known all about, the word that was told them concerning this child.
\p
\v 18 . And all that beard it wondered at that which was told them by the shepherds.
\p
\v 19 . But Mary kept these words all together, pondering [them] in her heart. [or, Comparing them with the other, namely, which before was revealed to her, and came to pass hereabout, chapter 1.]
\p
\v 20 . And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, as it was spoken unto them.
\p
\v 21 . And when eight days were fulfilled [That is, when the eighth day was come. See Act. 2. 1.] that the child should be circumcised, his name was called Jesus. [See hereof and of the interpretation of this name, Matth. 1. ver. 21.] which was named by the Angel, before he was conceived in the womb.
\p
\v 22 . And when the days of her [Namely, marries] purification were fulfilled, according to the Law of Moses. [See concerning this law, Levi. 12. 2. 4.] they brought him to Jerusalem, that they might present [him] to the Lord.
\p
\v 23 . As it is written in the Law of the Lord, All that is male [Namely, as well of men as of beasts. Exod. 13. 2. Numb. 18. ver. 15. 16. 17.] which opened the matrix, shall be called holy to the Lord.) [namely, either to be offered up, if they were clean beasts, or to be redeemed for five Shekels, if it might not according to the law be offered up.]
\p
\v 24 . And that they might give offerings, according to that which is said in the Law of the Lord, [see Levit. 12. 6. 8. where thus it is ordained for mean persons: for the rich must offer up a Lamb of a year old, with a turtle dove or young pigeon: the lamb for a burnt-offering, and the dove for a sin offering] a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons.
\p
\v 25 . And behold, there was a man at Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and fearing God, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the holy Ghost was upon him. [Namely, the Spirit of (Prophesy)]
\p
\v 26 . And to him a divine revelation was made by the holy Ghost, that he should not see death, [That is, not die] before he should see the Christ of the Lord.
\p
\v 27 . And he came by the Spirit into the Temple: And when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do with according to the custom of the Law: [Gr. According to the usual (manner :) whereof is spoken before.]
\p
\v 28 . Then took he the same in his arms, and praised god. [Gr. blessed] and said,
\p
\v 29 . Now Lord lettest thou [Gr. Loosest, lettest loose, namely from this miserable life according to thy promise. See the like, Phil. 1. 23.] thy servant go in peace, according to thy word.
\p
\v 30 . For mine eyes have seen thy salvation [Or, thy saving i.e. Savior, and that whereby Salvation is brought about. See Esa. 52. ver. 10. and Luk. 3. 6.]
\p
\v 31 . Which thou hast prepared before the face of all the Nations. [Namely, as well Gentiles as Jews, as followeth.]
\p
\v 32 . A light for enlightening [Gr. Revelation.] of the Gentiles, and for the glory of thy people Israel.
\p
\v 33 . And Joseph and his mother marveled at that which was said by him.
\p
\v 34 . And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, behold this (child) is set [That is, ordained, namely by God. These words are taken out of Isa. 8. verse 14. and are expounded by Paul, Rom. 9. ver. 32. 33. 1. Cor. 1. ver. 23, 24. and 2. Cor. 2. ver. 16. 1. Pet. 2. v. 6. 7. See the Annot. There] for a fall and resurrection of many in Israel, and for a sign [namely, as a mark at which every one aymes and shoots] that shall be spoken against.
\p
\v 35 . And also a sword [That is, bitter pains especially for the suffering and death of this thy Son] shall go through thine own soul) that the thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed. [That is, their belief, or unbelief shall be brought to light see 1 Corinthians 11.19]
\p
\v 36 . And there was Anna a prophetess a daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of the Asar she was come to great age [Gr to many days] who had lived with her husband seven years from her virginity.
\p
\v 37 . And she was a widow for about eighty four years who stirred not out of the temple [that is continually or daily in the temple] with fasting and prayer serving God night and day.
\p
\v 38 . And she coming to them at the same hour b in like manner confessed the Lord [that is acknowledged and witnessed that he was the expected Messiah ] and spake of him unto all that looked for redemption [namely which was promised should com to pass by the Messiah] in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 39 . And when they had finished all things that according to the law of the Lord was [to be done] they returned again into Galilee unto their city Nazareth
\p
\v 40 . And the child grew up and was strengthened [the same Luke 1.80 is also said by John but Christ received these gifts not by measure John 3.34] in the spirit and filled with wisdom and the grace of God was upon him.
\p
\v 41 . And his parents traveled every year to Jerusalem [namely according to the command of God Deuteronomy 16.16] at the feast of the Passover.
\p
\v 42 . And when he was become twelve years old and they were gone up to Jerusalem according to the custome of the feast day.
\p
\v 43 . And had finished the days there when they returned the child Jesus carried at Jerusalem and Joseph and his mother knew it not.
\p
\v 44 . But thinking that he was in the company [namely of those that returned with them to Nazareth for the Jews went up to the great feast and returned in great companies together Psalms 42.5] on the way the went a days journey and sought him among the kindred and among the acquaintance
\p
\v 45 . And when they found him not they went to Jerusalem seeking him.
\p
\v 46 . And it came to pass after three days that they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the teachers hearing them and enquiring of them.
\p
\v 47 . And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers
\p
\v 48 . And they [namely Joseph and Mary] seeing him were struck with amazement [namely because they say that he being a child had yet undertaken to speak and to deal with such great doctors] and his mother said unto him child why hast thou done thus to us behold thy father [namely Joseph Mary speaks according to the opinion of the Jews Luke 3.28 or because a foster-father useth to be called by the name father] and I have fought thee with grief [Gr being grieved or distressed]
\p
\v 49 . And he said unto them why is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be in the things of my father [namely which God my heavenly father hath commandeth me and for which I am sent by him into the world .]
\p
\v 50 . And they understood not the word that he spake unto them.
\p
\v 51 . And when he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was subject unto them [namely like as the children are bound to be obedient to their parents according to the law to which he had subjected himself] and his mother kept all these things [Gr word] in her heart
\p
\v 52 . And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature [or in age of the Greek word signifies both Luke 19.3 John 9.21,28] and his grace with God and man .
\c 3
\s The time when John the Baptist entered in his office 3 the sum of his preaching 7 his exhortation to repentance to those that came to him to be baptized 10 his answer to the question of the multitude 12 of the publicans 14 and of the soldiers what every one of them ought to do 15 his testimony of Christ and of baptism 19 his imprisonment 21 Christ is baptized by John 23 his genealogy is rehearsed even to Adam.
\p
\v 1 And in the fifteenth year of the reign of Emp. Tiberius [that was the third Emperour in the Roman Empire who succeeded Augustus in the Empire under whose reign also Christ died ] when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea [after that Archelaus the eldest son of Herod the great who reigned over Judea Matthew 2.22 because of his ill government was banished by the Romans the Romans Emperours caused that land from thenceforth to b governed by their own Lieutenants amongst whom this Pilate was the fifth the remainder of the land of Canaan was governed by the sons of Herod ] and Herod a Tetrarch of Galilee [of these Tetrarch see the annotate on Matthew 14.1] in whose countries which are here named Christ preached much as also in Abtlene which lay in Decapolis Matthew 4.25 Mark 5.20] and his brothers Philip a Tetrarch of Iturea and of the alnd Trachonitis and Lisanias a tetrarch of Abtilene .
\p
\v 2 . Under the high priest Annas and Cajaphas [Annas was the father in law of Cajaphas John 18 verse 13 and they are put here as two a high priest either because the high had always a deputy which supplied their place while they were unclean or sick see Numbers 3.321 Kings 4.4 2 Kings 23.4 and 25.18 or because at that time they administered the priest office the one the one year and the other the other year see John 11.49,51 and Acts 4.6 forasmuch as the suceession of the night high priest which were descended from Aaron had ceased and that office was now become a benefice or gift of the Romans ] came the word of God unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness [of this wilderness see Matthew 3.1]
\p
\v 3 . And he came into all the land lying about Jordan preaching the baptism of the repentance for the forgiveness of sins
\p
\v 4 . As it is written in the book of the words of Esias the prophet saying the voice of the one crying in the wilderness [of this prophecy see the annotation on Matthew 3.3 and Isaiah 40.3,4] prepare ye the way of the Lord make his paths straight.
\p
\v 5 . Every valley shall be filled and every mountain or hill shall be brought low and the crooked ways shall become a straight way and the uneven shall become plain ways
\p
\v 6 . And all flesh [that is all forths of man see Joel 2.28 Acts 2.17] shall see the salvation of God.
\p
\v 7 . He said therefore to the multitude which came forth to be baptized of him ye [see chapter 2.30] breeds of Adders [these are a sort of serpents which are very venomous [see Acts 28. 3,6] who hath shewed ye to flee from the wrath to come
\p
\v 8 . Bring therefore fruits worth of repentance [or becoming or agreeable unto true repentance] and begin not to say with yourselves [Gr in yourselves] we have Abraham for a father for I say unto ye that God even of these stones can raise up children of Abraham
\p
\v 9 . And the axe lyeth also already at the root of the trees [that is the judgment of God is ready and drawing near for those which hearing the preaching of the gospel bring forth no fruits] every tree therefore which bringeth forth no good fruits is hewen down and cast into the fire.
\p
\v 10 . And the multitude asked him saying what shall we do then? [Namely to escape this punishment and be saved.]
\p
\v 11 . He answering said unto them he that hath two coats let him impart to him that hath none [that is let him that is shew love to his poor neighbour that before he should let him suffer want he should rather give him one of his coats and a part of his necessary food] and be that hath meat let him do likewise.
\p
\v 12 . And there came also publicans to be baptized and said unto him master what shall we do?
\p
\v 13 . And he said unto them ask no more then that which is appointed ye [namely by the supreme magistrate]
\p
\v 14 . And the soldiers asked him also saying and we what shall we do? and he said unto them offer violence to no man [the Greek word properly signifies toss or shake any man hither or thither so that here all manner of spoiling insolence and wrongful violence is forbidden to soldiers] neither deprive any man of his own by fraud [the Greek word signifies indeed to accuse any one false but Luke useth this word in such sence as it is here translated as appears Luke 19.8] and be ye content with your wages.
\p
\v 15 . And while the people expected [or stood in expectation namely of the coming of the Messiah] and all reasoned in their hearts concerning John whether it may be he wee not the Christ.
\p
\v 16 . John answered them all saying I indeed baptize ye with water but he cometh that is stronger then I to whom I am not worthy to unloose the latchet of his shoes he shall baptize ye with the holy ghost Gr in and with fire [see Matthew 3.11]
\p
\v 17 Whose fan [or winnowing shovel see Matthew 3.12] is in his hand and he shall thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor and the wheat he shall bring together into his garner [or corn lost] but the chaffe he shall burn into unquenchable fire.
\p
\v 18 . He therefore exhorting yet many other things published the gospel to the people
\p
\v 19 . But when Herod the tetrarch [see more largely of this history Matthew 14.3] was reproved by him for Herodias sake and bother Philips wife and for all wicked practices which Herod did
\p
\v 20 . He added yet this also above all that he shut John in prison.
\p
\v 21 . And it came to pass when all the people were baptized and Jesus also was baptized and prayed that the heaven was opened.
\p
\v 22 . And that the holy Ghost [see hereof Matthew 16.3] descended upon him in a bodily shape like a dove and that happened a voice out of heaven saying thou art my beloved son in thee I am well pleased .
\p
\v 23 . And he Jesus began to be about thirty years old [this age the priest were to be of before they mightful execute their office Numbers 4.3 1 Chronicles 23.3] being as was suppose the son of Joseph the son of Heli [Joseph Matthew 1.16 is said to begotten or born of Jacob but is here called a son of Heli because as many think he had married Mary which was the daughter of Heli like as Ruth is called the daughter of Naomi because she had the son of Naomi Ruth 1.11]
\p
\v 24 . The son of Matthat the son of Levi the son of Melchi the son of Jonna the son of Joseph.
\p
\v 25 . The son of Mattathia the son of Amos the son of Naum the son of Elsi the son of Naggai
\p
\v 26 . The son of Maath the son of Mattathia the son of Semei the son of Joseph the son Juda
\p
\v 27 . The son of Joana the son of Resha the son of Zerubabel the son of Salathiel some think that this Zerubabel and Salathiel are the same which Matthew rehearseth chapter 1 verse 12 holding that the progeny of Solomon was extinct in Jachonia from Jeremiah 22.30 yet others think that this place of Jeremy may be understood that he is said to be withput children which as King should sit upon his throne seeing the regal dignity ended in Jachonia and think that out of 1 Chronicles 3.17 it appears that Jachonia had children of his own and that for this cause it is likely that this Zerubabel and Salathiel of the line of Nathan were other persons then those of which Matthew speaks like as divers families which are descended from one stock it often happens, that the same name are given to the posterity of which there is an example here in this very chapter verse 24.29.where the name of Matthew or Mattath and Levi are found in several persons twice one after another] the son of Neri.
\p
\v 28 . The son of Melachi the son of Addi the son of Cosam the son of Elmodam the son of Er
\p
\v 29 The son of Jose the son of Eliezer the son of Jorim the son of Matthat the son of Levi
\p
\v 30 . The son of Simeon the son of Juda the son of Jolseph the son of Jonan the son of Eliakim
\p
\v 31 . The son of Molea the son of Mainan the son of Mattatha the son of Nathan the son of Dvaid [Matthew relates this genealogy of David by Solomon unto Joseph the husband of Mary but Luke here relates the genealogy of David by Nathan who was a brother of Solomon and another son of David by Bethsheba also 2 Samuel 5 .14,1Chronicles 3.5 and 14.4 unto Helii the father of Mary whose son Joseph is called verse 23 because he had married his daughter therefore it is not strange that here are other names found from David unto Joseph then are in Matthew because they describe several lines as also that Matthew rehearseth fewer persons then Luke seeing the leaves out of divers to confine himself within the number of fourteen see the annotation on Matthew 1.17]
\p
\v 32 . The son of Jess the son of Obed the son of booz the son of Salmon the son of Nasson
\p
\v 33 . The son of Aminadab the son of Aram the son of Esrom the son of Phares the son of Juda

\p
\v 36 . The son of Cainan [the name is not found in genealogy related by Moses Genesis10.24and 11.12 nor yet 1 Chronicles 1.24 but is found in the Greek translation which was in use among the Jews at that time wherefor some think that this also well agrees with that which Moses realtes Arphaxad should have been gotten Sala by his son Cainan as the like may be seen also 1 Chronicles 2.50 and 4.1] the son of Arphaxad the sonn of Sem the son of Noe the son of Lamech

\s Christ fasteth in the wilderness for forty days and is tempted of the devil 14. returneth into Galilee and teacheth in the synagogue at Nazareth out of Isa 61. That he was the promiseth Messiah 23. and sheweth by the examples of Elias and Elizeus wherefore he did no miracles there 28 wherefore they being angry endeavored to kill him 31 teacheth at Capernaum on the Sabbath 33 and there driveth out a devil 38 cureth Peterâ€™s mother in law of fever and many other sick persons and possessed persons 42 Goes from thence and preacheth in the other cities from Galilee.
\p
\v 1 And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was by the spirit [Gr in the spirit namely of which he had before spoken] led into the wilderness.
\p
\v 2 . And was forty days tempted of the devil [but especially near the end when satan tempted him most vehemently as appears out of Matthew 4.3] and ate nothing at all in those days [of this fast of the Christ together with the temptation see the exposition on Matthew 4] and when they were ended he was a hungered at last.
\p
\v 3 . And the devil said if thou art the son of God say to this stone that it became bread.
\p
\v 4 . And Jesus answered him saying it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God.
\p
\v 5 . And when the devil had led him up on a high mountain [Matthew relates this for the third temptation Matthew 4.8 from whence it appears that the evangelist do not so much bind themselves to the method as to the matter itself ] he shewed all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time [Gr point of time .]
\p
\v 6 . And the devil said unto him I will give thee all this power and the glory of these same kingdoms for it is delivered over unto me and I will give them to whosoever I will [although the devil ascribe this to himself contrary to the truth as being a liar John 8.44 yet not withstanding through Godâ€™s permission and righteous judgments against the sins of men he always abuseth the honor and the riches of the world to seduce mankind carrying himself as a prince and God of this world John 12 verse 31 Ephesians 6.12 2 Corinthians 4.4]
\p
\v 7 . If thou therefore wilt worship me [or fall down before me namely to worship me] it shall be thine .
\p
\v 8 . And Jesus answering said unto him get away from me [Gr get away behind me] Satan for it is written thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and serve him alone
\p
\v 9 . And he led him to Jerusalem and set him to the pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the son of God cast thy self from thence downwards.
\p
\v 10 For it is written thou shall he give his Angels charge concerning thee that they shall keep thee
\p
\v 11 . And that they shall take thee on the hands least at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
\p
\v 12 . And Jesus answering said unto him it is said thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
\p
\v 13 . And when the devil had finished all his temptations he departed from him for a time [for it appears that towards the time of suffering he set violently upon him again John 14 verse 30]
\p
\v 14 . And Jesus returned by the power of the spirit [Gr in the power] into Galilee and the fame of him went out through the whole country round about.
\p
\v 15 . And he taught in their synagogues and was praised [Gr glorified by all]
\p
\v 16 . And he came to Nazareth where he was brought up and according to his custome went into the synagogue on the day of the Sabbath [Gr of the Sabbaths] and stood up for to read.
\p
\v 17 . And there was given unto him [that is handed to reach unto him see Acts 13.15] the book of the prophet Esay and when he had opened the book [Gr had unfolded or unrolled like as often in old time books were written on parchment or paper rolls Psalm 40.8 Hebrews 10.7 Revelation 6.14] he found the place where it was written [here Christ seemed to have joined two places of Esay together for some of these words are Esa 61.1 and some Esa 42.7.]
\p
\v 18 . The spirit of the Lord is upon me therefore he hath anointed me he hath sent me to preach the gospel to the poor to heal those that are broken in heart
\p
\v 19 . to preach releasment to the captive and sight to the blind [or obtain of sight] to dismiss the smitten [or wounded] in libertie [Gr in releasment ] to preach the acceptable year of the Lord [so the time of the coming of the Messiah and the preaching of the gospel is called because the acceptable year of the jubilee was a type thereof in which all goods that were alienated came to first owner and all servant of the Israelites were set at liberty Leviticus 25.8]
\p
\v 20 . And when he had shut the book and given it again to the minister [namely of the rulers of synagogue] he set down and the eyes of all in the synagogue were cats upon him
\p
\v 21 . And he began to say unto them today is this scripture fulfilled in your ears [that is ye hear with the ears that today comes to pass that which is this prophecy was foretold.]
\p
\v 22 . And they all bare with him witness [namely that he was an excellent teacher see Mark 6.2] and wondered at the acceptable words [Gr at the words of grace or acceptableness see Psalms 45.3 John 1.14] which proceed out of his mouth and said is not this the son of Joseph ?
\p
\v 23 . And he said unto them ye will doubtless say unto me this proverb [Gr this parable] physicians heal thyself all that we have heard that was done at Capernaum [where Christ before this had taken his dwellings and done many miracles Matthew 4.13 and 11.23] do that also here in thine own country.
\p
\v 24 And he said, Verily I say unto you, that no Prophet [That is, teacher of God's word] is acceptable in hiw (own) country.
\p
\v 25 . But I say unto ye in truth they were many widowers in Israel in the days of Elias the heaven was shut [that is without raining 1 Kings 17.1, 7] three years and six months so that there was great famine over the whole land
\p
\v 26 . And unto none of them was Elias sent save to Sarepta of Sidon [that is lying under the command of the city of Sidon] unto a woman that was a widow
\p
\v 27 . And there were many Leapers in Israel in the time of Elizeus the prophet [or under the prophet Eliseus] and none of them were cleansed saving Naaman the Syrian
\p
\v 28 . And they in the synagogue were filled with wrath when they heard this
\p
\v 29 . And rising up they cast him out without the city and led him up to the top of the hill upon which their city was built to throw hi down from the precipice
\p
\v 30 . But he being gone through the middest of them [namely holding their eyes by his divine power thus they saw him not restraiying them seeing his hour was not yet come John 7.30] went away
\p
\v 31 . And he came down to Carpenaum a city of Galilee and taught them on the Sabbath days
\p
\v 32 . And they were amazed at his doctrine for his word was with power [Gr in power that is of great regard and power Matthew 7.29]
\p
\v 33 . And in the synagogue there was a man having a spirit of an unclean devil [that is which was an unclean devil] and cried out with a great voice.
\p
\v 34 . Saying forbear what have we to do with thee thou Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art namely the holy one of God [that is the savior which by God was sanctified or separated thereunto John 10.36]
\p
\v 35 . And Jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace [Gr he muzzled see the annotation on Mark 1.25] and go out of him and the devil having cast him in the midst went out of him without doing any hurt [or wounding him]
\p
\v 36 . And there came an amazement upon all they communed with one saying what word is this that with authority and power he commanded the unclean spirit and they go out?
\p
\v 37 . And the same of him went forth in all countries round about
\p
\v 38 . And Jesus being risen up out of the synagogue went into the house of Simon [namely Peter see Matthew 8.14] and Simons wives mother was taken with great fever and they besought him for her.
\p
\v 39 . And standing above her and [or over her namely with his head bowing over her to speak unto her] he rebuked the fever and the fever left her and she arising immediately served them
\p
\v 40 . And as the sun went down [ that is when the as the Sabbath was over see Mark 1.32] all that had sick ones taken with divers disease brought them unto him and he laid his hands upon every one of them and healed the same
\p
\v 41 . And they went forth devils also out from many crying and saying thou art the Christ the son of God and rebuking them he suffered them not to speak [or say that they knew that he was he Christ the reason hereof see Mark 1.25] because they knew that he awd the Christ
\p
\v 42 . And when it was become day he went out and went into a desert place [that is a solitary place to be alone] and the multitudes sought him and came unto him and detained him that he should not go away from them.
\p
\v 43 . But he said unto them I must also publish the kingdom of God [Gr evangelize the kingdom of God unto other cities] for therefore am I sent forth [namely by God the father]
\p
\v 44 . And he preached into the synagogue of Galilee.

\s Christ teacheth the multitude out of Peters ship 4 and after a miraculous drought of fish promiseth to make him and his companions fishers of men 12 cleanseth the leaper 18 cureth one sick of the Palsie 21 and proveth thereby that he hath power to forgive sins 27 calleth Levi sitting at the custome 29 eats with him and other publicans 31 gives reasons for it 33 defends his disciples by divers similitude for not fasting.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass as the multitude pressed upon him [Gr lay upon against him] to hear the word of God that he stood by the lake Gennesareth [it is otherwise called the sea of Galilee and the sea of the Tiberias being an inlandish meer and lake having no issue into the sea ]
\p
\v 2 . And he saw two ships lying by the shore of the lake [Gr standing by the lake] and the fisher were gone out of them and rinsed the nets.
\p
\v 3 . And he went into one of those ships which was Simons [namely Petrs see verse 8] and preyed him that he would put off a little from the land and sitting down he taught the multitude out of the ship
\p
\v 4 . And when he left off speaking he said unto Simon launch forth unto the deep and cast out your nets for to take [Gr for a taking]
\p
\v 5 . And Simon answered and said unto him master [Gr Epistata which denotes anyone which is set over other for which the other evangelists use the Hebrew word Rabbi and the Greek word Didascale ] we have laboured all the night long and taken nothing yet on thine word [that is command wherein there stood a promise also to be contained ] will I cats out the net.
\p
\v 6 . And when they had done that they enclosed the net multitude of fishes and their net rent.
\p
\v 7 . And they beckened to their comforts [that is which where in the fellowship or company with them] which were in the other ship that they should com to help them [Gr take with them or draw up with them] they came and filled both the ships so that they were ready to sink.
\p
\v 8 . And Simon Peter seeing that fell down at the knees of Jesus [for as much as by the miracle he discerned the God head of Christ ]saying Lord go out from m [ namely as whom am worthy to abide in company as the centurion also said Matthew 8.8] for I am sinful man homo Gr man vr
\p
\v 9 . For astonishment had seized him and all were with him at the draught of fishes which they had taken.
\p
\v 10 . And likewise also James and John the son of Zebedee which were Simon comforts and Jesus said unto Simon fear not from hence forth thou shall catch man [namely by the preaching of the gospel which is compared to a net Matthew 13.47 see of the Greek word the annotation on 2 Timothy 2 verse 26.]
\p
\v 11 . And when they had steered the ships to the land they forsook al and followed him.
\p
\v 12 . And it came to pass when he was in one of those cities [although the leapers might not dwell in the cities yet it seems notwithstanding that they might come into the same so as they cried the unclean Leviticus 13.45 Luke 17.12] behold there was a man full of leprosy and seeing Jesus he fell on the face and besought him Lord if thou wilt thou canst cleanse me
\p
\v 13 . And he stretching the hand forth touched him and said I will b thou cleansed and straightway the leprosy went away from him
\p
\v 14 . And he commanded him that he should not tell it to no man but go thy way say he shew thy way to the priest [see the reason hereof Matthew 12.16] and offer for thy cleansing like as Moses hath commanded a testimony unto them
\p
\v 15 . But the fame [Gr the word] of him went forth the more and the multitude came together for to hear and to be healed by him of their sickness
\p
\v 16 . But departed into the wilderness and prayed there [Gr he was departing and praying wherebyhere is given to understand that he did thus often see afterwards chapter 6.12 chapter 9vesre 18. 28]
\p
\v 17 . And it came to pass in one of those days that he taught and there sate Pharisee and teachers of the law which were come from all towns of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem and the power of the Lord was there for to heal them [namely of whom is spoken verse 15 which power here shewed itself because they came to Christ with a firm as it is to be seen verse 20]
\p
\v 18 . And behold certain men brought in a beda man that had the palsie [Gr whose sinews were become loose or lither as those that are palsie â€“struck commonly are] and sougyt to bring him in and lay him before him
\p
\v 19 . And not finding where they might bring him in by reason of the multitude they climbed upon the roof [of the condition of the roofs among the Jews see Matthew 10.27] and let him down through the tiles or coverings with the bed in the midst before Jesus
\p
\v 20 . And he see [or knowing] their faith [namely both of the sick of the palsie and those that brought him ]said unto him man thy sins be forgiven thee.
\p
\v 21 . And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason saying who is this that speaketh blasphemy who can forgive sins but God alone?
\p
\v 22 . But Jesus knowing their reasoning answered and said unto them what reason ye in your heart?
\p
\v 23 . Which is easier to say [see Matthew 9.5] thy sins are forgiven thee or to say arise and walk?
\p
\v 24 . But that ye might know that the son of man hath power on the earth to forgive sins he said to the sick of the palsie I say unto thee arise and take up thy bed and go thy way to thy house.
\p
\v 25 . And he straightway rising up before them having taken up that wherein he had lain [namely the bed with that which belonged to it] went away to his house glorifying [or praising] God.
\p
\v 26 . And astonishment [or destruction of senses] took hold of them all and they glorified by God and were filled with fear saying we have seen incredible things today [the Greek word signifies things which are beyond common opinion and expectation]
\p
\v 27 . After this went forth [ namely towards the sea at Capernaum see Mark 2.1 ,13] and saw a publican name Levi [otherwise also called Matthew a son of Alpheus of this whole history see Matthew 9 verse 9 Mark 2.14 ] sit in the custom house and said unto them follow me .
\p
\v 28 . And he forsaking all rose up and followed him
\p
\v 29 . And Levi prepared him a great east in the house and there was a great multitude of publicans and of others which sate down with them
\p
\v 30 . And their [namely the multitude there] scribes and the Pharisees murmure against the disciples saying wherefore do ye eat and drink with publican sinners?
\p
\v 31 .And Jesus answered saying unto them they that are whole have no need of the physician but they that are sick [Gr they are ill at ease or ill disposed ]
\p
\v 32 . I am not come to call righteous ones but sinners to repentance
\p
\v 33 . And they said unto him why do Johns disciples fast often [namely with extraordinary strict fasting and which is done at set times] and make prayers likewise also the disciples o the Pharisees but thine eat and drink [that is live like other ordinary man]
\p
\v 34 . But he said unto them can you make the marriage children [Gr sons of the marriage chamber see Matthew 9 verse14]fast while the bridegroom is with them
\p
\v 35 . But the days shall come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them then shall they fast in those days
\p
\v 36 . And he said also a similitude [Gr a parable the application whereof see Matthew 9.15] unto them no man set a patch of a new garment upon an old garment otherwise that new rends also the old and the patch of the new agrees not with the old
\p
\v 37 . And no man put new wine into old leather bottles otherwise the new wine will make the lather bottles burst and the wine will be spilt and the leather will perish
\p
\v 38 . But new wine must be put into new leather bottles and they both are preserved together
\p
\v 39 . And no man drinketh old straightway desireth new for he saith the Lord is better [that is more acceptable by reason that men are used to it or because it is more wholesome.]

\s The disciples pluck ears of corn on the Sabbath and are by Christ defended for it against the Pharisees 6 Christ cureth a withered hand on the Sabbath and justifies his so doing 12 prayeth on the mountain and choseth out of his disciples twelve to be apostles 17 healeth divers sick &possessed persons 20 teacheth what man are blessed and what are not 7 exhorts to love even towards our very enemies 36 to mercy to an equal judgment of our neighbor 38 as also to bountifulness 41 teacheth that a man must look at himself when he will reprove another 43 and that the tree is known by his fruits 46 finally he teacheth by the similitude of a house built upon a rock and on the sand that it is not enough to consol him with the mouth only but that we must also do his will.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass on the second first Sabbath [this Sabbath is called the second first because as men learnt think it was the first Sabbath after the first Passover from whence seven Sabbath were to be reckoned into the feast of Pentecost Leviticus 3.15 of which seven Sabbaths which was the first which the Jews yet at this day call the first Sabbath after the second day for that even about that time in Judea the ears were great appears Luke 23.10 Deuteronomy 16.9 others think that it was the last day of the feast of the Passover which was the special day of the feast as well as the first Numbers 28.5 like as the last day of the feast of the tabernacle is called the great day of the feast John 67.37 but others think that it is so called because it was the Sabbath in the second great feast namely of Pentecost on which the first ripe fruits were offered up Exodus 34 verse 22] that he went through the sown fields and the disciples plucked ears and did eat them rubbing them with the hands.
\p
\v 2 . And some of the Pharisees said unto them wherefore do ye that which is lawful to do on the Sabbaths
\p
\v 3 . And Jesus answering them said have ye not read that which David did when he was hungered and those that were with him?
\p
\v 4 . How he went into the house of God [see concerning the house of God and concerning shewbred the annotations on Matthew 12.4] and did take and eat the shew bread and gave to them that were with him which are not lawful to eat but only for the priest
\p
\v 5 . And he said unto them the son of man is a Lord also of the Sabbath [see the exposition hereof Matthew 12.8]
\p
\v 6 . And it came to pass also that on another Sabbath he went to the synagogue and taught and there was a man and his right hand was withered
\p
\v 7 . And the Scribes and the Pharisees observed him whether he would heal on the Sabbath that they might find some accusations against him [Gr his accusation that is any matter or occasion of accusation thereby to make suspected of the people as transgressors of the law]
\p
\v 8 . But he knew their thoughts and reasoning and said to the man with the withered hand rise up and stands in the midst and he being risen stood up
\p
\v 9 . Then said Jesus unto them I will ask you what is lawful on Sabbaths? To do good or to do evil? to save a man or to destroy him ?
\p
\v 10 . And having looked upon them all round about [namely with anger see Mark 3.5] he said to the man stretch forth thy hand and he did so and his hand was restored whole as the other
\p
\v 11 . And they were filled with madness [that is with a raging hatred] and communed with one another what they should do to Jesus
\p
\v 12 . And it came to pass in those days that he went forth into the mountain to pray and he continued all night in prayer to God [Gr in the prayer o God namely by prayer to prepare himself for the choosing of his apostle as the apostles also did after the example Acts 13.3]
\p
\v 13 . And when it was day he called his disciples unto him and chose twelve out of them when he also called apostles [that is sent forth or ambassadors because they were to be sent forth by him first through the land of Judea Matthew 10.6 afterwards into the whole world to preach the gospel]
\p
\v 14 . Namely Simon whom he also called Peter [wherefore he so surnamed see Matthew 3.16 and this saved also to distinguish him from the second Simon who is likewise therefore here surnamed Zelotes verse 15 see Matthew 10.4 ]and Andrew his brother James and John, Philip and Bartholomew .
\p
\v 15 . Matthew Thomas and James the son of Alpheus and Simon called Zelotes [that is Zealot see Matthew 10.4]
\p
\v 16 . Judas of James and also Judas Iscariot who also became the traitor.
\p
\v 17 . And being down with them he stood on a plain place with him the multitude of his disciples and a great multitude of the people of Judas and Jerusalem and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon
\p
\v 18 . Who were come to hear him and to be healed of their disease and they that were vexed by unclean spirit and they were healed
\p
\v 19 . And all the multitude sought to touch him for there went power out of him [that is he shewed his divine power on them where by he healed them see Mark 5.30] and he healed them all
\p
\v 20 . And lifting up his eyes upon his disciples he said blessed are ye poor [namely in spirit see Matthew 5.3] fro yours is the kingdom of God
\p
\v 21 . Blessed are ye hunger now [namely after righteousness Matthew 5.6] for ye shall be satisfied blessed are ye that weep now [namely suffering for Christ and his gospel sake as appears out of the following verse] for ye shall laugh
\p
\v 22 . Blessed are ye when man hate ye and when they separate ye [or cut you off namely from their assemblies or companies see John 6.2] and reproach ye [namely as ungodly or hereticks ] and reject your name as evil [or put out Gr cast out] for the son of man sake
\p
\v 23 . Rejoice ye in that day and be cheerful [Gr leap namely for joy] for behold your reward of this reward see Matthew 5.12] is great [Gr much] in heaven for their fathers did in like manner to the prophets.
\p
\v 24 . But woe unto ye rich [that is which put confidence in your riches and seek your comfort therein Mark 10 verse 24] for ye have away comfort
\p
\v 25 . Woe unto ye that are satisfied [Gr filled that is which take your delight in filling up your body with meat and drink see James 5.5] for ye shall hunger woe unto ye that laugh now [that is which have your recreation in all manner of wordly joys John 16.20 and in the oppression of the upright Revel 11.10] for ye shall mourn and weep [namely eternally James 5.1]
\p
\v 26 . Wo unto ye when ye all man speak well unto ye [namely wordly man when ye shall seek to please them and be like unto them John 15.19 Galatians 1.10] for their fathers did the like to the false prophets
\p
\v 27 . But I say unto ye this love your enemies but do good unto those that hate ye
\p
\v 28 . Bless them that curse ye and pray for them that offer violence unto ye [ or revile you as 1 Petr 3.16]
\p
\v 29 . To him that smite thee on the cheek offer the other also [namely rather then that that thou shouldst revenge thyself or recompense evil for evil] and him that taketh away thy cloak hinder not to take away thy coat also
\p
\v 30 . But give to every one that desireth of thee [this must be understood of the true poor which suffer want to when we must also according to our power see hereof the rule of Paul 2 Corinthians 8.12, 13, 14] and of him that taketh away that is thine ask is not again [namely is thereby the love of our neighbour should be violated or offence given to others1 Corinthians 6 verse 7]
\p
\v 31 . And as ye will that men shall do unto ye do ye also unto them the like
\p
\v 32 . And if ye love them that love you what thank have ye ?[ or grace that is gracious benefit or recompence from God ] for sinners [ that is notorious and great sinners such as the publican were accounted such as the publican were accounted which are put instead of them Matthew 5.46,47] also love those that love them
\p
\v 33 . And ye do good to them that do good to ye what thank have ye? for siners also do the same
\p
\v 34 . And if ye lend to them o whom ye hope to receive again [namely the money lent or the like friendship when ye should have need thereof as appears from the following words in the end of the verse] what thank have ye? For even the sinner lend to the sinners that they may receive as much again
\p
\v 35 . But love your enemies and do good and without hoping for anything again [or without hoping for anything from it that is not only to them which ye hope will give it ye again and do ye the lke courteous again but also to them of whom ye have not this hope like as he here command also to love not only our friends but also our enemies ] and your reward shall be great[ Gr much] and ye shall be [that is really shew that ye be ] children o the highest for he is kind [or bountiful] towards the thankful and wicked
\p
\v 36 . But ye therefore merciful as your father also is merciful
\p
\v 37 . And judge not [namely rashly or perversely as Matthew 7.1] and ye shall not be judge condemn not an ye shall not be condemned release and ye shall be released [or forgive and ye shall be forgiven]
\p
\v 38 . Give and it shall be given unto ye a good measure pressed down and shaken and running over[ a similitude taken from measuring of dry wares when one is ready to give every one his full measure ] shall man give into your lap [ a phrase taken from the manner of the oriental people who wore long wide garments wherein they could receive that which was given them Psalms 79.12 Jeremiah 32.18] for with the same measure wherewith ye mete it shall be measured t ye again
\p
\v 39 . And he spake a similitude unto them whether can a blind man lead a blind man on the way? Shall they not both fall into the ditch?
\p
\v 40 . The disciple is not above his minister [Gr teacher or teaching master] but every perfect disciple [that is a right true and faithful disciple] shall be as his master
\p
\v 41 . And why seest thou the splinter [what is understood by the splinter and the beam see Matthew 7.3] that is thy brothers eye and takest no notice of the beam that is in thine eye?
\p
\v 42 . Or how canst thou say to thy brother suffer me to put out [Gr cast out] the splinter that is thine eye whereas thou thyself seest not the beam that is in thine eye? Thy hypocrite first put out the beam out of thine eye and then shall thou discern to put out the splinter that is thy brotherâ€™s eye.
\p
\v 43 . For it is no good for tree that brings forth [Gr maketh] evil fruit nor an evil [Gr corrupt] tree which bringeth forth good fruit
\p
\v 44 . For every tree is known by his own fruit for men do not gather figs of thorns neither do men cut grapes from brambles
\p
\v 45 . The good man brings forth the good out of good treasure of his heart and the evil man bringeth forth evil [namely commonly or for the most part for otherwise hypocrite often speak that they do not mean although their hypocrisie many time comes to light] out of the evil treasure of his heart for out of abundance of his heart his mouth speaketh.
\p
\v 46 . And what call ye me Lord Lord and do not that which I say?
\p
\v 47 . Every one that cometh into me and beareth my words and doth the same I will shew you whom he is like
\p
\v 48 . He is like a man which built an house and digged and made deep[that is digged deep namely to lay the faster foundation ]and laid the foundation on a rock now when the high stood came [Gr the full stood whereby as also by the streams are understood seduction s temptations afflictions and persecution Matthew 13.21] the water stream beat[ Gr brake] against that house and could not move it was founded on a rock
\p
\v 49 . But he that heareth them and shall not have done them is like a man who built a house upon the earth without a foundation against which the water stream beat and it fell immediately and the fall [Gr the breach or rent] of that house was great.

\s Christ healed the servant of a captain in Capernaum whose faith he commend above all 11 raiseth from the dead a widows son at Naim 18 answereth the question of John disciples and proveth by his on doctrine and works that he is the Messiah 24 gives a glorious testimony of the person an office of John 29 for which the people praise God but the Pharisees condemn the council of God 31 upbraid the Jews with their impenitency under the similitude of the practice of children on the street 36 eateth with Simon the Pharisee where a sinner moistens his feet with her tears whereat Simon is offended and Christ defendeth her by the similitude of two debtors.
\p
\v 1 Now after that he had finished [Gr fulfilled] all his words in the hearing [Gr into the hearings] of the people he entered into Capernaum
\p
\v 2 . And a certain centurion which was very dear to him [precious namely by reason of his faithful services] being sick lay at the point of death
\p
\v 3 . And having heard of Jesus he sent unto him the elders of the Jews [these elders were man of the best repute among the people which at that time were employed in every city in the government of the church or common wealth see Matthew 6.3] beseeching him that he would come and heal [Gr save namely alive] his servant.
\p
\v 4 . Now these being come to Jesus besought him earnestly [Gr diligently carefully] saying he is worthy that thou shouldst do that for him [or to whom that shalt do that] otherwise to whom that should be done]
\p
\v 5 . For beloveth our people [namely the Jews whereby it appears that he was one of the gentiles as also by the ninth following verse] and hath him self built us the synagogue [of the synagogue see Matthew 4.3]
\p
\v 6 . And Jesus went with them and when he was now not far from the house the centurion sent some friends unto him and said unto him [that is caused to be said in Matthew chapter 8 verse6 &c that he himself did that which he caused to be done by his friends] Lord take not the trouble for I am not worthy that thou shouldst enter under my roof.
\p
\v 7 . Therefore also have I not esteemed myself worthy to come unto thee but say it with a word [that is bid or command with one word onely that my servant be healed see Matthew 8.8] and my servant shall be healed?
\p
\v 8 . For I also am a man set under power of others [what he meaneth hereby see the annotate on Matthew 8 verse9] having soldiers under me and I say to this go and he goeth and the other came and he cometh and to my servant do that and he doeth it
\p
\v 9 . And Jesus hearing this he marveled at him and turning him about said unto the multitude that followed him I say unto ye I have not found such great faith even in Israel [that is amongst the Israelites]
\p
\v 10 . And they that were sent being retuned into the house found the sick servant whole.
\p
\v 11 . And it came to pass on the day following that he went to the city called Naim [this was a city in Galilee situate at the foot of the mount Hermon by the brook Kison which unneth into the sea of Galilee ] and many of his disciples went with and gave him great multitude
\p
\v 12 . And as he drew near to the gate of the city [before time both among the Jews and amongst nations the dead were buried without the city Job 19.41 and as it is done yet in some places see also Genesis 23.19 and chapter 50 verse 13] Loe there a dead man was carried out which ws a widow and a great and a great multitude of the city was with her
\p
\v 13 . And the Lord seeing her was inwardly moved with compassion toward her and sid unto her weep not. [Thereby Christ would not forbid al kind of weeping for the dead 1 Thessalonians 4.13 but give to understand that he will take away all the cause of hr weeping]
\p
\v 14 . And he went near and touched her [or coffin] now the bearers stood still and he said young man I say unto thee arise
\p
\v 15 . And the dead sate upright and began to speak and he gave him to his mother
\p
\v 16 . And fear ceased on them all and they glorified [that is praised thanked] God saying a great prophet is risen up amongst us and God hath visited his people [namely for good to redeem them Exodus 4.31]
\p
\v 17 . And this fame of him [Gr this word] went forth into all Judas and into ll country round about
\p
\v 18 . And the disciples of John made report to him [Gr and to John his disciples made report] of all these things
\p
\v 19 . And John having called unto him certain two of his disciples sent them to Jesus saying art thou should come [that is the Messiahs the cause of this demand see Matthew 11 verse 3 ] or do we look for another?
\p
\v 20 . And when the men were come unto him thy said John the Baptist has sent us to thee to say [that is to cause to be said to thee and be demanded of thee] art thou he that should come or look we for another.
\p
\v 21 . And in the same hour he healed many of the sicknesses and pains [Gr scourges see Mark 3 verse 10] and evil spirit and too many blind he gave the sight [Gr he gave graciously the seeing]
\p
\v 22 . And Jesus answering said unto them go your way and tell John again the things which ye have seen and heard namely that the blind become seeing the creepled walk the leapers are cleansed nd deaf hear the dead are raised to the poor the gospel is preached
\p
\v 23 . And blessed is he that shall not be offended at me [Gr in me see Matthew 11 verse 6]
\p
\v 24 . Now when the messengers of John [or the sent of this whole testimony of Christ concerning John the Baptist see the annotate Matthew 11.7 and the following] were departed he began to say to the multitude concerning John what went ye out in the wilderness to be hold? A reed that is moved to and fro by the wind.
\p
\v 25 . But what went y out to see ? a man clothed with soft garment? Behold they that are in glorious clothing and voluptuousness are in the kings courts
\p
\v 26 . But what went ye out to see? a prophet? Yea I say unto ye much more also then a prophet
\p
\v 27 . This is he of whom it is written behold I send mine Angel before thy face who shall prepare thy way before thee
\p
\v 28 . For I say unto ye amongst them that are born of women there is no man a greater prophet then John the Baptist but the least[ Gr the lesser] in the kingdom of God is greater then he.
\p
\v 29 . And all the people hearing him the publican who were baptized with the baptism of John justified God [that is acknowledged and praised his righteousness goodness faithfulness and truth as verse 35]
\p
\v 30 . But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected [or disannulled or made no force namely by their willful despising of the means which God hath ordained for the salvation of men ] the counsel of God [ that is the means which God according to his wife counsel hath ordained in the new covenant whereby to bring mankind to salvation see Proverbs 1.25,30 Acts 20.27 Hebrews 12.25 otherwise the counsel that is the decree of God concerning the salvation of his elect abides always firm Matthew 4.24 Romans 8.28,29 Hebrews 6. verse17 & c ] against themselves [that is to their own hurt and destruction ]being not baptized of him
\p
\v 31 . And the Lord said to whom then shall I liken the men of his generation and to whom are they like
\p
\v 32 . They are like to the children [the exposition of this similitude see in the annotate on Matthew 11.16] which sit on the market and call one another and say we have played on the pipe to you and ye have not danced we have sung lamenting songs to you and ye have not wept.
\p
\v 33 . For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine [that is using no ordinary meat and drink like as other men for he did eat locusts and wild honey Matthew 3 verse4] and ye say he hath the devil
\p
\v 34 . The son of man is come eating and drinking and ye say lo there a man who is a glutton and winebibber [Gr an eater and wine drinker] a friend of publican and sinners
\p
\v 35 . But wisdom is justified [see Matthew 11.19] of all her children
\p
\v 36 . And one of the Pharisees entreated him that he would eat with him and being entered into the Pharisees house he sate don
\p
\v 37 . And behold a woman in the city which was a sinner [that is of a dishonest life and known in the city for such a one] understanding that he sate at meat in the Pharisees house brought an alabaster jar with ointment [see the like Matthew 26.7 Mark 14.3]
\p
\v 38 . And standing behind at his feet weeping [namely being grieved for her sins as Peter Luke 22.62] she began his feet wet with hr tears [these are tokens of repentance and love of Christ springing from the sense of her sins and remission of the same appears verse 47] and she dried them with the hair her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with ointment
\p
\v 39 . And the Pharisees which had invited him seeing this spake with himself saying this man if he were prophet would know well what and what manner of woman this is that touched him for she is a sinner
\p
\v 40 . And Jesus answering said unto him Simon I have somewhat to say to thee and he spake master say it
\p
\v 41 . Jesus said [what is Christ scope in this similitude he sheweth himself when he applies it to this woman verse 47] a certain creditor [or lender out bank-keeper] had two debtors the one was indebted five hundred pence [Gr Denari see the value therof Matthew 18.8] and the other fifty
\p
\v 42 . And when they had nothing to pay he acquitted them both of it say then which of these shall love him more
\p
\v 43 . And Simon answering said I hold it that it is he to whom he hath acquitted most and he said unto him thou hast judged right
\p
\v 44 . And he returning him about the woman said unto Simon seest thou this woman? I came into thine house thou gavest me no water for my feet but this woman hath moistened my feet with tears and dried them with the hair of her head
\p
\v 45 . Thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since she came in [otherwise since I came in] hath not ceased to kiss my feet
\p
\v 46 . Thou didst not anoint mine head with oil but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment[ with these three expressions of friendship an ancient in those countries received their guests and friends as it to be seen Genesis 18 verse 4 and 19.2 Exodus 4.27 and 18.7 Psalms 23.5 and Ecclesiastes9.8 Romans 16.16 and elsewhere ]
\p
\v 47 . Therefore I say unto thee her sins are forgiven her with which many for she loved much [hereby is not shewed that this great love of hers was the cause of the forgiveness of her sins but that it was a fruit argument and token that many sins were forgiven her and that therefore now she was no more to be reckoned for such a sinner as appears from the word next following and the whole cop of this similitude from whence may clearly be seen that the forgiveness of sins is put for the cause of the love and not the love for the cause of remission of sins as it is also said in the 50 verse that the faith and not love saved her] but to whom little is forgiven he loveth little
\p
\v 48 . And he said unto her thy sins are forgiven thee
\p
\v 49 . And they that sate down with him began to say with themselves [or amongst one another] ho is this that forgiveth sins also
\p
\v 50 . But he saith to the woman the faith hath saved thee that is by thy faith in me thou hast receive this benefit of forgiveness of thy sins whereby thou art preserved to salvation see Acts 26.18]go thy way in peace.

\s Christ travelleth through cities and villages preaching the gospel accompanied with certain women which minister unto him of their goods 4 propoundeth to the multitude the similitude of a sower whose seed fall on divers places 9and explains the same to his disciples in private 16 compares his word to a candle which is set on a candle stick to give light 18 teacheth that to him that hath yet more shall be given 19 and who are his mother and brethren 22 stilleth th stormy wind on the sea 6 casteth out a legion devil 31 which he suffers to enter into the swine 41 goeth with Jairus to help his little daughter 43 by the way cureth a woman of twelve year bloody issue 49 and coming to the house of Jairus raiseth up his daughter from the dead .
\p
\v 1 And came to pass afterwards that he journeyed from one city and village to another preaching and publishing the gospel and kingdom of God [Gr evangelizing the kingdom of God ] and the twelve [namely apostles ]were with him .
\p
\v 2 . And some omen which were healed of evil spirit and infirmities namely Mary called Magdalene [of this Mary see Mark 16.9] from whom seven devils were gone out,
\p
\v 3 And Joana the wife of Chusa Herods Bayliffe, [or Steward Gr. Epitropau. See Matt 20 v.8.] and Susanna, and many others, which ministered to him of their goods.[that is gave him assistance , for the maintenance of him and his Disciples, in thinkfulness for the benefits received from C hrist, 1Cor.9.9 2Cor. 9.11. Gal. 6 .6]
\p
\v 4 Now when a great multitude gathered together, and they came unto him from all Cities, he said by a similitude.
\v 5 .A sower went forth to his field: [Of this similitude of the sower see Matt 13.3,etc.] and as he sowed the one fell by the way[side] and was trodden down, and the Fowels of heaven did eat up.
\p
\v 6 . And the other fell on a rock, and being grown up, it withered, because it had no moisture.
\p
\v 7 . And the other fell in the midst of the thornes, and the thornes growing up with it chocked the same.
\p
\v 8 . And the other fell on the good earth, and being grown up, it brought fruits an hudrendfold. [That is, very abundantly, forasmuch as the greatest fruitfulness seldom exceeds that, Gen.26.12] This saying, he cryed, he that hath ears let him hear.
\p
\v 9 . And his Disciples asked him saying, what might this similitude be? [This, import or signifie, as also v. 11. and so forward.]
\p
\v 10 . And he said, To you it given to understand mysteries [or hidddennesses] of the kingdom of God,[See herof Mark4.11.12.] but to the others [I speak in similitudes, that they seeing may not see, and hearing may not understand.
\p
\v 11 . Now this is the similitude the seed is [that is, signifieth] the word of God.
\p
\v 12 . And they that [are sown] by the way [side] are those that hear: afterwards cometh the Duvel, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, that they should not believed and be saved.
\p
\v 13 . And they that [are sown] on the rock, are they, that when, have heard it, receive the word with joy : and these have no root, which believe but for a time, and in the time of temptation they turn
\p Away.
\p
\v 14 . And that which falls in the thornes, these are they which having hear, and going away are choked by the cares, and riches, and pleasures of [this] life., and bear no [fruit] to perfection.
\p
\v 15 .And that which [falleth] in the good Earth, are they which having heard the word, keep the same in an honest and good heart, [That is, opened, excited, and made fit by the spirit of God, to embrace the word of God and obey it Jer. 31.33. Ezek.36.26, 27. Acts.16.14.] and in perseverance [or in patience, whereby, notwithstanding all temptations, and tribulations for words sake they preserve constantly.See Matt 24.13. Heb. 10.36.
\p
\v 16 . And no man that lighteth a candle covers the same with a vessel, or sets it under a bed: [Or bedstead] but setteth it on a candlestick, that those that come may see the light.
\p
\v 17 .For there is nothing hid [Namely of those things which I have revealed unto you. See Matt 10.27. and Mark 4. 22] that shall not be revealed :nor secret , that shall not be made known, come to light.
\p
\v 18 .Look thereof how you hear, [That is, with what inclination of heart yee come to the haeringof the word and having heard, how you may make a right use of the same] for whoso hath, to him shall be given : and whoso hath not, even that he thinketh he hath [or seemth to have. See the annot on Matt13.v.12.] shall be taken from him.
\p
\v 19 .And his Mother and his Brethren [That is , kinsmen or cousin. See Matt12.46.] came unto him and could not come at him by the reason of the multitude.
\p
\v 20 .And it was told him [by some] which said, thy Mother and Brethren stand there without, desiring to see [That is, to speak with thee.
\p
\v 21 But he answered and said unto them, my Mother and thy Brethren are those that hear the word of God and do the same.
\p
\v 22 . And it came to pass in one of those dayes, [Of this whole story, See Matth 8.23.] that he went into a ship, and his Disciples [with him] and he said unto them, let us pass over to the other side of the lake.And they launched forth.
\p
\v 23 . And as they sailed, he fell asleep, and there came [Gr. Descended] a storb [or whirlwind] of the wind, on the lake; and they [That is, the ship on which they were] became full [of water] and were in distress.
\p
\v 24 . And they went to him and raised him up, saying Master, Master, we perish. And he being risen up, rebuked the wind, and the water-bellows, and they ceased [Namely, the winds and waves] and there was a calm.
\p
\v 25 . And he said to them, where is your faith? But they being afraid, wondered saying to one another, why who is this, that he commandeth even the windes, and the water, and they are obedient to him?
\p
\v 26 . And they sailed forward unto the Land of the Land of the Gadarens. [Matthew faith Gergeseren, whereof, see Matth 7.28.] which is over against Galilee.
\p
\v 27 . And he was gone forth on the Land there met him a certain man out of the City ,which of a very long time had been possessed of Divels:[G.had had Divels] and was cloathed with no cloaths, and abode [or dwelt Mark5.3.] in no house, but in the graves.
\p
\v 28 . And he seeing Jesus, and crying out loudly,[Namely the evil spirit out of the man that he had possessed ] fell down on him, and said with a great voice, what have I [to do] with thee, [Gr.what is to mee and thee] Jesus thou son of God the most high ?I beseech thee that thou torment me not. [namely before the time of the last judgement. See Matt8 29.]
\p
\v 29 . For he had commanded the unclean spirit, that he should pass out [go forth] from the man, for he had caught him [Gr.laid hold on him. Or drawn together,like as [in falling sicknesses, the members ost- times are drawn together] many a time and he was bound with chaines and letters to be kept [namely that he should do himself or others no hurt.] and he brake the hands,and was driven by the Divel into the desarts. [That is into the waste and solitary places: into wilderness.]
\p
\v 30 . And Jesus asked him saying, what is thy name? And he said Legion, [What a Legion is, See Matth 26.53.] for Divels were entered unto him.
\p
\v 31 . And they brought him [Or he besought. As Mark 5.10.] that he would not command them to go away into the Absse.[That is, a deep without bottome, Gen. 17.11. so hell is called, or the place where the unclean spirits and ungodly men shall be tormented forever. See Revel. 9.1.2 .]
\p
\v 32 . And there was a herd of many Swine [See concerning them, Matt 8.30.] feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into the same. And he suffered them.
\p
\v 33 . And the Divels going out of the man, passed into the swineâ€™s : and the herd rushed down headlong into the lake, and were choked.
\p
\v 34 . And they that fed them seeing that which was done fled: and going away reported into the City, and in the Country.
\p
\v 35 .And they went forth to see that which was done, and came into Jesus, and found the man from whom the Devilles were gone out, sitting at the feet of Jesus.[Namely as a Disciple of Christ hearing his words , as Luke 10.39. ] cloathed and well in his wits : and they were afraid.
\p
\v 36 , And they also that had seen it, related unto them, how the possessed was delivered.
\p
\v 37 .And the whole multitude of the Land of Galilee round about, besought him that he would depart from them,] Namely for fear of receiving any more, seeing they loved more gains then Christ and his words] for they were taken with great fear. And he being gone into the ship returned back.
\p
\v 38 . And the man from whom the Devils were gone forth, besought him that he might be with him:[That is, continually abide with him as one of his Disciples] but Jesus let him go from him, saying.
\p
\v 39 . Return to thine house, and tell what great things God hath done unto thee.And he went his way through the whole City [Namely Gadara , Gergessa, which were Cities of Decapolis, in which Mark faith that he published it] publishing what great things Jesus had done unto him.
\p
\v 40 . And it came to pass when Jesus returned, that the multitude received him, for they were all looking for him.
\p
\v 41 . And behold there came man whose name was Jarius, and he was a Ruler of the Synagogue [Of this Ruler of the Synagogue, see Mark 5.22.] and he fell at Jesus feet, and intreated him that he would come unto his house.
\p
\v 42 . And he had an only daughter, [Gr. Begotten] of about twelve years, and she lay dying [Gr.and she died] and as he went, the multitudes thronged him: [Gr. choaked him.
\p
\v 43 . And a woman who had an issue of blood twelve years long, who had spent all her livelihood [Gr. All her living, that is, all her means whereon to live] upon Physicians, and could be healed of no man.
\p
\v 44 . Coming unto him from behind touched the hemme of his garment: and straightaway the issue of her blood stayed [Gr. Stood .i.e ceased.]
\p
\v 45 . And Jesus said, who is it touched me? And when they all denyed it said Peter they that were with him, master, the multitudes press and throng thee, and sayst thou, who is it that touched me?
\p
\v 46 . And Jesus said, some body touched me: for I have perceived [That is, I have been aware, or have known] that power is gone out of me. [See hereof Mark 5.30.]
\p
\v 47 . Now the woman seeing that she was not hid, came trembling: and falling down before him, declared unto him before all people, for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.
\p
\v 48 . And he said unto her, daughter is of good cheer thy faith hath saved thee: go thy way in peace.
\p
\v 49 . While he yet spake, there came one from [the house] of the Ruler of the Synagogue, saying unto him, thy daughter is dead: be not troublesome to the m Master.
\p
\v 50 . But Jesus hearing [that] answered him saying, fear not, believes only, and she shall be saved. [Or be delivered, namely from the dead.]
\p
\v 51 . And when he came into the house, he suffered no to come in, save Peter and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the child.]
\p
\v 52 . And they wept all, and misbehaved themselves for her, [Gr. smote themselves on the brest for her sake .See Matth 11. 17. And he said, weep not, she is not dead. [Namely, to remain dead as other people when they dy] but she sleepeth [that is, her death is like a sleep, from which she shall be raised up., John 11. v. 23.]
\p
\v 53 . And thy derided him, knowing that she was dead.
\p
\v 54 . But when he had driven them all out, he took her by the hand, and cryed, saying, child arise.
\p
\v 55 . And her spirit returned, and she arose straightaway, and he commanded that they should give her to eat.
\p
\v 56 . And her parents were Astonished, and he commanded them to tell no one of what which was done.[Why Christ would not have his miracles spread abroad for a time. See Matth 12. v 16. 17.]
\c 9
\s 1 Christ sendeth forth his Apostles to preach, and instructs them how to carry themselves on the way, 7 Herod having heard of Christ desires to see him, 10.The Apostles return, 11. Christ feedeth about five thousand men with five loves and two fishes, 18. various opinions of people concerning his person, 22. foretells his death and resurrection, 23. and exhort to constant confession of his words, 28. is glorified before his three Apostle son the mountain in presence of Moses and Elias,37 . casteth out a fierce unclean spirit, 46. teacheth who shall be the greatest amongst his Disciples ,49. forbideth to hinder himself which cast out Devills in his name, 51.journeying towards Jerusalem , the Samaritans refuses him lodging, which the Apostles desiring to avenge, are by him rebuked for it57. three desire to follow Christ , and receive each their several answers.
\p
\v 1 And having called his twelve Desciples together, he gave them the power and might [Or authority] over all the Devills [That is, against all Devills for to cast them out, Math. 10 .1.] And to cure diseases.
\p
\v 2 . And sent them to preach the Kingdom of God, [That is. the gospel of the coming of the Kingdom of God] and to heal the sick.
\p
\v 3 . And he said unto them ,take nothing with you on the way, [See hereof the annot. On Matth 10.10 .] neither staves [Otherwise staffe] nor scrip , nor bread, nor money: neither shall any one of you have two coats.
\p
\v 4 . And into whatsoever house ye shall abide there,and go out from thence. [That is. abide ther so long until ye depart, without going for ease to lodge from one house to another. seeing your abode there is not to continue long.
\p
\v 5 . And whoso shall not receive you, going out of the City, shake otf even the dust of the feet, [What this signified, See Mat. 10 14.] for a testimony against them.
\p
\v 6 . And they going forth went thorow all the Townes [Or went from the one Town to the other] preaching the gospel, and healing the [sick] every where.
\p
\v 7 . And Herod the Tetrach [Of the Tetrachs, see Mat14.1] heard of all the things that wrer done by him; and was of doubtful minde [namely not knowing what to think or do] because it was said to some, that John was risen from the dead .
\p
\v 8 . And of some that Elias had appeared: and [of] others, that one of the old Prophets was risen.
\p
\v 9 . And Herod said, John have I beheaded; [See hereof Mat. 14.10 and Mark. 6.27.] now who is this of whom I hear such things? And he sought to se him.
\p
\v 10 . And the Apostles being returned related to him all that they had done. And he took them with him, and departed alone into a dersat place of the City called Bethsaida [This was a City of Galilee, lying on the Lake of Gennesareth, over against Capernaum , Mark. 6.45. John 12. 21.]
\p
\v 11 . And the multitudes understanding [that] followed him: and he received them and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and those that heard need of healing, [Namely, those that desired it] he made whole.
\p
\v 12 . And the day began to decline: and the twelve coming to him said unto him, diamis the multitude, that they going their way into the towns round about, and into the villages [Gr. Fields , , ,i.e country houses] may take up lodging, [Gr. Unloose] and find meat : for we are here in a desert place.
\p
\v 13 . But he sid unto them, Give them to eat. And they said, we have no more but five loaves and two fishies: unless that we should go our way, buy the meat for all this people.
\p
\v 14 . For there about five thousand men. But he said unto his Desciples , Make sit down by sittings, [That is, companies that sit together , or parties: See Mark 6. 39. 40] each of fifties.
\p
\v 15 . And they did so, and made them all sit down. [Otherwise, they all sat down.]
\p
\v 16 . And having taken the five loaves and the two fishes, looked up to heaven, and blessed them, [Of this blessing, See Matth4. 19. ] and brake them, and gave them to the desciples to set before the multitude.
\p
\v 17 . And they did eat and all were satisfied: and there was taken up that which remained over into them of the fragments, twelve baskets.
\p
\v 18 . And it came to pass, as he was alone, [Namely separated from the multitude] praying, that that the disciples were with him, and asked them saying, Whom do the multitudes say that I am?
\p
\v 19 . And they answering, said, John the Baptist: and others Elias:and others, that Prohet of the old ones is risen again.
\p
\v 20 . And he said unto them, But ye, whom say ye that I am? And Peter answering, said the Christ of God. [That is, the Messiah, or Annointed, promised and sent by God.]
\p
\v 21 . And he charged them sharply, [Gr. Threatened] and commanded, that they should tell this to no man. [Namely, for that time.]
\p
\v 22 . Saying the Son of man must suffer much, and be rejected, [That is, not owned, nor received for the Messiah, but condemned as a seducer and a blasphemer. See Matth.21.42. 1.1Pet.2 verse 4.7.] of the Elders, and the chief Priests, and Scribes, and be put to death: and the third day be raised up.
\p
\v 23 . And he said unto all, If any man will come after me, [That is, will be my disciple] let him deie himself and take up his cross [That is, suffering, and tribulation, how grievous so ever it may be, which he calls the cross, because the suffering of the cross is the most grievous] daily, and follow me.
\p
\v 24 . For who so will save his life [Gr. Soul] he shall lose it, but who so shall lose his life for my sake, he shall save it, [namely, hereafter]
\p
\v 25 . For what doth it profit a man, that should gain the world, and lose himself, [That is, bring upon himself eternal destruction both of body and soul] or suffer damage [of himself:]
\p
\v 26 . For whosoever shall have been ashamed of me and my words, of him shall the son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his glorie, and [in the glory] of the Father, and of the holy Angels.
\p
\v 27 . And I tell you of a truth, there are some of those that stand here, which shall not taste of death;[See the exposition hereof Matth. 16. 28.] until they shall have seen the kingdome of God.
\p
\v 28 . And it came to pass about eight dayes after these words, [Matth. chapter 17.verse1. speaks of fix dayes, how this accords see the expolition there] that he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray.
\p
\v 29 . And as he prayed the fashion of his face was altered [Gr.other. i.e altered, Namely, ingl-y] and his clothing white [and,] very shining.
\p
\v 30 . And behold two, two men spake with him, which were Moses and Elias
\p
\v 31 . Who being seen in glory, told of his going forth, [Namely,out of this life. i.e. spake with him of his suffering death and resurrection] which he should accomplish [Gr.fulfill] at Jerusalem.
\p
\v 32 . Now Peter and they that [were] with him, were heavier with sleep, and being awake, they saw his glorie, and the two men that stood by him.
\p
\v 33 . And it came to pass, as they departed from him,[That is, as they were upon parting] Peter said unto Jesus, Master, is it good for us to be here: and let us make three Tabernacles, one for thee, one for Moses, and one for Elias :not knowing what he said.
\p
\v 34 . Now as he said this, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they were afraid, as they [Namely, Moses and Elias] entered into the cloud.
\p
\v 35 . And there happened a voice out of the cloud, [Namely from God the Father, as appears by thay which follows] saying, this is my beloved son, hear him.
\p
\v 36 . And while the voice hapned, Jesus was found alone: and they held their peace, and related to no man in those dayes, [That is, at that time namely before his resurrection; seeing he had forbidden it them, Matth.17.9. ] anything of that which they had seen.
\p
\v 37 . And it came to pass the day after, when they came down from the mountain, that a great multitude came to meet him.
\p
\v 38 . And behold a man of the company cried out saying Master, I beseech thee look upon my son,[Namely with an eye compassion] for he is mine onely begotten.
\p
\v 39 . And behold a spirit taketh him[Namely , an evil of unclean spirit] and immediately he crieth out , and he teareth him that he fometh, and hardly departeth from him, and bruiseth him. [That is indeavous to bruise him, as these things use also to happen in grievous falling sickness.]
\p
\v 40 . And I besought thy disciples that they would cast him out, and they were not able.
\p
\v 41 . And Jesus answering, said, O un believing and perverse generation [Or wrested that cannot well be brought to right, Phil.2.15.] how long shall I yet be with you, and bear with you? Bring thy son hither.
\p
\v 42 . And while he yet came [towards him] the Divell tare him and rent [him:] but Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the childe, and gave him again to his father.
\p
\v 43 . And they were all amazed at the great virtue of God, [That is, the exceeding great power of God where by the miracles were done] and while they all wondred at all things which Jesus had done, he said unto his disciples.
\p
\v 44 . Let ye these words into your ears: [That is, take good notice of those things and remember them: for they may serve to confirm you against the offence of my sufferings] For the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.[namely, of the unrighteous. See Acts. 2.23.]
\p
\v 45 . But they understood not this word, and it was hid from them; so that they comprehend it not:[Gr. were not sensible,] and they feared to ask him concerning that word.
\p
\v 46 . And there arose a reasoning among them; [Or confererence. See Mark 9.33.34.] Namely which of them was greatest. [Gr. Greater or more [pottor]
\p
\v 47 . But Jesus seeing the reasoning of their hearts, took a little childe, and set it by him.
\p
\v 48 . And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name, he receiveth me, and whoso shall receive me, he receveth him that sent me. For he that is the least [Gr. the less .i.e the humblest] among you all he shall be great. [Namely, in the Kingdome of heaven, Matth.18.12.]
\p
\v 49 . And John answered and said, Master, We saw one, which cast out divels in thy Name, and we forbad it him, [Or hindred, &c.] because he follweth [thee] not with us.
\p
\v 50 . And Jesus said unto him, Forbid [Or hinder] it not. For he that is not against us, is of us, [see Mark 9.40.]
\p
\v 51 . And it came to pass, when the dayes of his taking up: [Namely, out of this world into heaven; Mark 16.19. Act.1.11] were fulfilled, [that is, began to be fulfilled, and to draw near] be directed [Gr.confirmed, i.e. purposed boldly to go to Jerusalem, notwithstanding, that he knew what should befall him there] his face, to travel to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 52 . And he sent forth Messengers before his face, and they being gone away, came into a village of the Samaritanes , to make ready [lodging ] for him.
\p
\v 53 . And they received him not, because his face was [as] traveling to Jerusalem. [Namely, there to exercise Gods worship, which the Samaritans did on the mount Garizim. John 4.20. Joseph Antiq. lib.11. cap. 18. from whence great hatred and enmities arose between the Jews and the Samaritans. John 4.9.]
\p
\v 54 . Now when his disciples James and John saw [that,] they said, Lord, wilt thou that we say that fire came down from heaven, and devour these, as Elias also did.
\p
\v 55 . But turning him about, he rebuked them, and said, Ye know not of what manner of spirit ye are. [That is, that ye having my spirit ye are.[that is that ye having my spirit ought not to desire the ruine of man .or ye consider not that the spirit of revengefulness drives ye hereunto.]
\p
\v 56 . For the son of man is not come to destroy mans souls but to save them and they went to another town
\p
\v 57 . And it came to pass by the way as they traveled that one said unto him Lord I will follow thee whithersoever goest .
\p
\v 58 . And Jesus said unto him the foxes have holes and the fouls of heaven have nests but the son of men hath not where be may lay down the head [that is thou hast no wordly ease or riches to expect from me for I have them not of myself .]
\p
\v 59 . And he said unto another follow mw but he said Lord suffer me to go away and bury my father first.
\p
\v 60 . But Jesus said unto him let the dead bury their dead [see the exposition Matthew 8.22] but thy go thy way and preach the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 61 . And another also said Lord I will follow thee but suffer me first to take my leave of that are in my house.
\p
\v 62 . And Jesus said unto him no man that puts his hand on the plough and looketh after that which is behind is fit for the kingdom of God [a similitude taken from a husbandman who being at plough must always look forward or else he can not make straight furrows Philippians 3.14 ]
\c 10
\s Christ sendeth seventy more disciples to preach and informeth them how they shall fit themselves for the journey and carry themselves towards their hearer 13 threateneth the city Chorazin, Bethsaida and Capernaum with heavy punishment by reason of their impenitence 17 the seventy return and joyfully relate what they had performed what Christ teacheth wherein they ought most to rejoice given thanks to his father and teacheth from whom saving knowledge comes 25 answereth a lawyer questions what he must do to inherit eternal life 29 and who is his neighbour by the similitude of the one fallen among murtherer and bolpen by a Samaritan 38 is entertained by two sisters Martha and 	Mary and commends the godliness of Mary above the carefulness of Martha.
\p
\v 1 And after the Lord appointed yet another servants [namely besides the twelve whom he chosen the apostle and sent forth before] and sent them away before his face [that is before him to warn the Jews of his coming and to prepare him for the receiving and for his doctrine] two and two into every city and place where he would come
\p
\v 2 . He said therefore unto them the harvest is great indeed [Gr much] but the labourer are few therefore pray ye the Lord of the harvest that he would thrust out [Gr cast out that is being made willing and fit for it by power of the spirit send forth 2 Corinthians 3.5 [labourer] thgatis faithful teachers into his harvest
\p
\v 3 . Go thy way behold I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves
\p
\v 4 . Carry no purse, no scrip, no shoves and salute no man by the way [that is do not stay with saluting or speaking to those ye meet but make haste on your journey see 2 Kings 4.29 otherwise Christ doth not take away civil courtesy in saluting which he himself used towards his disciples]
\p
\v 5 . And into what house ye shall enter and say peace be unto this house [that is happiness and salvation that is the salutation with the Jews]
\p
\v 6 . And if there be a son of peace [that is which by Gods grace is worth peace as is expounded Matthew 10.11 so the word son is often taken see 2 Samuel 12.5 Matthew 23.15 Ephesians 2.3 ]your peace shall rest upon him but if not your peace shall turn to ye again
\p
\v 7 . And abide in that same house eating and drinking that which by them is set before for the labourer is worthy of his hire go not over from one house into another house [namely to seek more ease or better entertainment else where seeking ye are not to tarry there long.]
\p
\v 8 . And into what city ye shall enter they receive ye eat that which is set before ye [that is be content therewith]
\p
\v 9 . And heal the sick which are therein and say unto them the kingdom of God is coming nigh unto ye
\p
\v 10 . But into what town ye shall enter and they receive ye not going out into their street saying ye
\p
\v 11 . Even the dust of your city that cleavest to us we shake off against ye [Gr we wipe off see the annotations on Matthew 10.14] not withstanding know ye this that the kingdom of God is coming nigh to you
\p
\v 12 . And I say unto ye it shall be tolerable for those in Sodom in that day [namely of the last judgment as may be seen verse 14] then for that city.
\p
\v 13 . Woe to thee Chorazin woe to thee Bethsaida for if in Tyre or Sidon the power [that is powerful works or miracles hereby Christ would give to understand that the stiffneckedness of those heathen was not so great as these Jews see the like Ezekiel 3 verse 6, 7] had been done which have been done in thee they would long ago repented sitting in sackclothes and ashes
\p
\v 14 . But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment then for ye
\p
\v 15 . And thou Capernaum which art exalted unto heaven [see Matthew 11. 23] thou shalt be thrust down even to hell
\p
\v 16 . He that heareth ye he heareth me and he that rejected ye rejected me he rejected him that sent me
\p
\v 17 And the seventy [namely which were sent forth by Christ verse 1] returned with joy saying Lord even the devils are subject to us in thy name
\p
\v 18 . And he said unto them I saw Satan as lightning [that is swiftly] fall [that is loose his power and dominion seeRevelations 12.9 c.] out of heaven [that is out of the air as Matthew 6.26 see Ephisians 6.12]
\p
\v 19 . Behold I give ye the power to tread upon the serpents and scorpions [see hereof Mark 16.18] and over all the power of the enemy [that is of the devil see Matthew 13.30 1 Peter 5.8] and nothing shall in any wise hurt ye [Gr injure ye see also Revelations 6.6]
\p
\v 20 . Yet rejoice not therein [that is not so much hypocrites had sometimes done this also see Matthew 7 .22 ,23] that the spirit [ that is the unclean spirit ]are subject unto ye but rejoyce much more than your name are written in the heaven [namely in this book of life see the expositions thereof Philippians 4.3 ]
\p
\v 21 . In that hour Jesus rejoiced in the spirit [that is inwardly and from the heart ]and said I thank thee [Gr I Confess ] O father Lord of the heaven and of earth that thou hast hid these things from the wise and understanding [namely of this world 1 Corinthians 1 verse 26] and hast revealed the same unto little children [that is despised the little ones according to the world of the mean in understanding and knowledge 1 Corinthians 1.27] yea father [ namely thus thou hast done ] for so it was wel-pleasing before thee
\p
\v 22 . All things are given over unto me of my father [that is the power over all things in heaven and on earth see Matthew 28.18] and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will reveal it [namely by his word and spirit 1 Corinthians 2.11, 12]
\p
\v 23 . And turning him unto the disciple he said unto them alone blessed are the eyes which see that ye see [namely the Christ or Messiah now manifested in the flesh and executing the office John 8.56 Acts 2.25 1 Peter 1.8 &c]
\p
\v 24 . For I say unto ye that many prophets and kings have desire to see [Gr would have seen] that which ye see and have not seen it and that which ye hear and have not heard it.
\p
\v 25 . And behold a certain lawyer stood up tempting him and saying master by what doing shall I inherit eternal life?
\p
\v 26 . And he said unto him what is written in the law? how readest thou?
\p
\v 27 . And he answering saith thou shalt love the Lord thy God from thy whole heart and from thy whole soul and from thy whole strength and from thy whole understanding and thy neibhour as thy self
\p
\v 28 . And he said unto him thou hast answered right do that and shalt live [namely eternally as he had demanded verse 25 this Christ saith not that any man can perfectly keep the law and so inherit eternal life but by the law to bring him to the knowledge of his imperfections Galatians 3 verse 18,24]
\p
\v 29 . But he willing to justify himself [that is to give out of righteous as Luke 18.9] said unto Jesus and who is my neighbor
\p
\v 30 . And Jesus answering said a certain man came down from Jerusalem lay high upon hill Psalms 125.1 so that those that traveled towards Jerusalem are said to go up and they that came from thence to come down] and fell among murderer [Gr high may men robbers] which having both stripped him and moreover given him more strokes or wounds went their ways and let him lye half dead.
\p
\v 31 . And by chance that is without fore thinking namely in respect of these man for otherwise in respect of the providence of God nothing comes to pass by hence Matthew 10.29, 30] a certain priest came down the same way and seeing him he passed over against him
\p
\v 32 . And likewise also a Levite when he was by that place he came and saw him and pass by over against him
\p
\v 33 . But a certain Samaritan [which Samaritan where otherwise accounted enemies by the Jews John 4.9] the cause whereof see Luke 9.53journing came by him and seeing him he was moved with inward compassion
\p
\v 34 And he going to him bound up his wounds pouring there into oil and wine and lifting him up his own beasts carried him into the inn and took care of him.
\p
\v 35 . And the next day going away he reached two pence [Gr Denari whereof see the value on Matthew 18.28] and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever that shall spent upon him more that I will give thee when I return
\p
\v 36 . Who then of these three thinkest thou to have been the neighbour [that is which discharge the duty of a neighbour] of him which was fallen among the murderers
\p
\v 37 . And he said he that shewed mercy on him then said Jesus unto him go thy way and do thou the like
\p
\v 38 . And it came to pass as they journeyed that they came to town [namely Bethany see John 11.1] and a certain woman named Martha received into her house
\p
\v 39 . And she had a sister called Mary who also [namely amonst their hearers] sitting at Jesus feet heard his word
\p
\v 40 . But Martha was very busy with much serving [namely to make ready meals as Matthew 8.15] and coming neer she said Lord dost not thou care that my sister lets me serve alone? say to her therefore that she help me [Gr that she undertake it together with me ]
\p
\v 41 . And Jesus answering said unto her Martha Martha thou troublest and disquetest thy self by many things
\p
\v 42 . But one thing is needful [namely to take care of spiritual things before all Psalms 27.4 Matthew 6.33] but Mary hath chosen the good part which shall not be taken away from her.
\c 11
\s Christ prescribeth his disciples a form of prayer 5 and teacheth by the similitude of a friend and a father that they shall be heard which persevere in prayer 14 casteth out a dumb devil and confutes the blasphemy of those that said he did this by Bezelbul 24 relates the miserable state of that man into which the unclean spirit returns again 27 a woman pronouneth a womb that blessed that bare Christ 29 Christ testifieth that the sign of Jonas shall be given to the Jews 31 oppeseth to their stiffneckedness the example of the south and of the Ninivite 33 teacheth by the similitude of a candle that the light of the gospel must not be hidden 37reproveth the Scribes and the Pharisee hypocrisy ambition and cruelty against all the prophets and apostles and threateneth the judgment of God unto them 53 whereupon the Pharisees lay knew snares for him.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass when he was in certain place praying as he ceased that one of his disciples said unto him Lord teach us to pray [that is give us pattern of prayer which we may use and according which we may frame our prayers] like us John also taught his disciples
\p
\v 2 . And he said unto them when ye pray say ye our father which art in the heavens [see the exposition of this prayer in Matthew chapter 6 verse 9&c ] thy name be hallowed thy kingdome come thy would be done as in heaven so also on the earth .
\p
\v 3 . Give us every day [or from day to day or all days] our daily [or sufficient see Matthew 6.11] bread
\p
\v 4 . And forgive us our sins for we also forgive everyone that is indebted to us and lead us not into temptation and lead us from evil one
\p
\v 5 . And he said unto them which of ye shall have a friend and shall g to him at midnight [ that is even at the most inconvenient time ]and say unto him friend lend me three loaves
\p
\v 6 For as much as my friend is come to me from his journey [Gr from the way] and I give not that I may set before him
\p
\v 7 . And that he from answering should say do not trouble me the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed and chamber [or a bed] I cannot arise to give thee .
\p
\v 8 . I say unto ye although he would not arise and give him because he is his friend nevertheless for his impudence sake [that is because of his troublesome and unseasonable persistence which indeed is sometimes acceptable to men but not to God Luke 18.1 1 Thessalonians 5.17] he will arise and give him as many [namely loaves] as he had needed thereof.
\p
\v 9 . And I say unto ask and it shall be given to ye [see the exposition hereof Matthew 7.8] seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto ye
\p
\v 10 . For everyone that asketh he receiveth and he that seeketh he findeth and he that knocketh it shall be opened unto him
\p
\v 11 . And what father among ye whom the son asketh fro bread will give him a stone or else for fish will give him a serpent?
\p
\v 12 .. Or else he should ask for an egg and ye give him a scorpion ?
\p
\v 13 . If ye then who are evil know to give gifts to your children how much more shall the heavenly father [Gr which is from heaven] give the Holy Spirit to those that pray to him?
\p
\v 14 . And he cast out the devil and the same was dumb [that is made the man dumb that was possessed and also blind as it to be seen Matthew 12.22] and it came to pass when the devil was gone out that the dumb spake and the multitude wondered
\p
\v 15 . But some of them said he casteth out devils by Bezelbul [otherwise Bezelbul see thetreof Matthew 10.25] the prince of the Devils
\p
\v 16 . And others tempting him desired [or sought] of him a sign from heaven [see Matthew 16.1]
\p
\v 17 . But he knowing their thoughts [or reasoning said unto them every kingdom that is divided against itself becomes desolate and a house being divided against itself [Gr house against house against itself as may be seen Matthew 12.25] falleth
\p
\v 18 . Now if also Satan be divided against himself how shall his kingdom stand? Seeing ye saying that I cast out devils through Beezelbul
\p
\v 19 . And if I cast out devils by Beezelbul by whom do your sons [see Matthew 12.27] cast them out therefore these shall be your judges [that is by their actions and testimony condemn you]
\p
\v 20 . But if I by the finger of God [that is by the power of the spirit of God as it is Matthew 12.28 the like phrase see Exodus 8.10] cast out the devils them the kingdom of God is come unto ye
\p
\v 21 . When a strong man armed keepeth his court [or palace all that he hath [or all his goods] is in peace [that is in quietness and safety]
\p
\v 22 . But when one comes upon him that is stronger than he and overcometh him he taketh away all his armour wherein he trusteth and distribute his spoil [Matthew saith vessels that is household stuff]
\p
\v 23 . He that is not with me that is to promote the glory of God and salvation of man see Mark 9.40] he is against me and he that gathereth with me he scattereth
\p
\v 24 . When the unclean spirit is gone out from a man [see the exposition hereof Matthew 12.43c] he goeth through parched places [Gr waterless dry ] seeking rest and not find it he saith I will not return unto mine house whence I came out
\p
\v 25 . And coming he finds it swept with besomes or wiped and adorned
\p
\v 26 . Then goeth he his way and taketh with him seven other spirits worse then he is himself and being entered in they dwell and the last of that man is worse than the first
\p
\v 27 . And it came to pass as he spake these things that a certain woman of the multitude lifted up his voice said unto him blessed is the womb that bare thee and the breast which thou hast sucked
\p
\v 28 . And he said ye blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep the same [Christ doth not here deny that his mother is blessed but teacheth that hers and others salvation proceedeth not from their birth according to the flesh but by the hearing of the word of God embraced by a true faith .]
\p
\v 29 . And when the multitudes gathered close together he began to say this in an evil generation it desireth a sign and there be no sign given unto them but the sign of Jonas the prophet
\p
\v 30 For as Jonas was the sign of Ninivites [see the exposition hereof by Christ himself Matthew 12.40 ] so shall also the son of man be to his generation
\p
\v 31 . The queen of the south shall rise up injudgments with the man of his generation and shall condemn them [namely by her example] for she came from [Gr out of] the ends of the earth for to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold more then Solomon is here [that is one that is more excellent then Solomon as well in person as office]
\p
\v 32 . The man of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with his generation and shall condemn the same for they repent at the preaching of Jonas and behold more then Jonas is here.
\p
\v 33 . And no man lighteth a candle and set in secret nor under a corn measure but on a candle stick that they which come in may see the light [Gr the shining]
\p
\v 34 . The candle of the body is the eye therefore when thine eye is single thy whole body is also enlightened [or lightsome see Matthew 6.22] but if it be evil then thy whole body also is dark
\p
\v 35 . Look to it therefore that the light which is in the be not darkness [or see therefore whether the light that is in thee be not darkness]
\p
\v 36 . If therefore thy body be enlightened not having any part that is dark the whole [namely that is done by thee or proceed from thee shall be enlightened like as when a candle that is shining enlighten thee
\p
\v 37 . Now as he spake this a certain Pharisee entreated him [Gr asked him] that he would dine with him and being gone in he sate down
\p
\v 38 . And the Pharisee seeing that he marveled that he had not first washed [Gr was not baptized see Mark 7.4] before dinner
\p
\v 39 . And the Lord said unto him now ye Pharisee cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter but the inside of you [which may be understood either of the heart of the Pharisees or of their platters as is expressed Matthew 23.25] is full of rapine and wickedness.
\p
\v 40 Ye ignorant he that made the outside hath he not made the inside also.
\p
\v 41 . But agree for alms that which is therein, [Namely in the platter, or that which ye have, as Luke 19.8. or that which is in you, i.e. change your iniquity into righteousness, and bounty towards the poor, as Dan 4.27.] and behold all is clean unto you [that is, then may you make use of meat and drik with a good conscience, and thanksgiving, 1 Tim.4.4. Tit. 1.15. others, shall be clean unto you]
\p
\v 42 . But woe to you Pharisees, for ye tithe mint [See Mat. 23. 23. ] and rue, and all pot -herbs, [that is, all manner] and ye pass by judgement, [that is, justice and equity towards your neighbour] and the love of God. This ought to be done, and the other not left undone.
\p
\v 43 . Woe unto you Pharisees, for ye loved the fore-seats [Or. The foremost sitting, or foresitting] in the Synagogues, and salutations on the markets.
\p
\v 44 . Woe unto ye you Scribes and Pharisees, ye Hypocrites: for ye are like the graves which are not the manifest, [Or hidden, namely, in the earth] and the men which walk over them know it not. [or percerve them not.]
\p
\v 45 . And one of the Lawyers, [The Scribes indeed were also Lawyers, but it seems that they were some amongst them which excelled in knowledge, and they especially were known by this name] answering said unto him, Master, while thoust saisth these things, thou reprocheth us also.
\p
\v 46 . But he said, also unto ye Lawyers, ye load men with burdens heavier to be born, and yourselves touch not those burdens with one of your fingers.
\p
\v 47 . Wo unto you, for ye build the sepulchers of the Prophet, and your Fathers killed them.
\p
\v 48 . Therefore ye bear witness that ye also take pleasure of your Fathers: [Gr. And ye take pleasurealso.] for they killed them, and ye build their sepulchers. [that is , while ye build up their sepulchers, ye shew thereby that ye are true children of those that killed the Prophets , Matth 23. 31. And howsoever ye would seem thereby to discommend the deed of your Fathers, yet notwithstanding, it appears by the hatred, and the cruelitie which ye shew to the sound Teachers, that therein ye are like unto your fathers. And that if ye had lived at that time, ye would also have done the same to the Prophets.]
\p
\v 49 . Therefore also saith [Or sud] the wisedome of God. [this Christ speaks of Himself, seeing he is the eternall wisedome of the Father. Prov 8.1.22.and 1. Cor. 1.24. as appears from Matth.23.34.]I will send the Prophets and Apostles unto them, and of them [some] they shall put to death, and (some) they shall chase out.
\p
\v 50 . That from this generation may be required the blood of the Prophets, [See Matth.23.25.] that was shed from the foundation of the world.
\p
\v 51 . From the blood of Abel, to the blood of Zecharias [Of this Zecharias see Matth.23.35.] which was slun between the Alter and the Temple (of God.) [That is, the Temple as is declared Matth.23.35.] yea, I say unto you, it shall be required of this generation.
\p
\v 52 . Woe unto you ye Lawyers, for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: [This key is the right exposition of Gods words, whereby entrance into heaven is opened unto men; which being taken away, that entrance is as it were shut up. See Matth .23.13.] ye entred not in yourselves , and those that were going in ye hindred.
\p
\v 53 . And as he said these things unto them, the Scribes and Pharisees began to lie hard upon him, [Or vehemently to charge on him.] and to cause him to speak of many things. [Gr.To draw the words out of his mouth.]
\p
\v 54 . Laying snares for him, and seeking to catch somewhat out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.
\c 12
\s 1 Christ warneth his disciples of the leaven of the Pharisees. 4 Teacheth who ought to be feared. 6 Exhorts to dependence on Gods providence and to confession of his name, and warns them on the blasphemy against the Holy Gost. 13 Refuseth to arbitrate about the inheritance betwixt brethren. 15 Dehorts from covetousness by a similitude of a rich man, who would make his barns greater. 22 Teacheth by the example of the ravens and lillies, that the care of this life should be committed to God, and his kingdom sought before all. 33 Exhorts to give almes. 35 And to watch for his coming. 41 Describes the produce and the reward of a faithfull steward, 45 as also the practice and punishment of an unfaithfull servant. 49 Saith that he came to suffer, and to bring fire on earth. 54 Reproveth the Jewes that they observednot the time of their visitation. 58 and exhorts to reconciliation with adversaries.
\p
\v 1 .IN the meantime [Namely, while the Pharisees and the Scribes presled upon him with questions, as is to be seen in the former Chapter , ver.53.] when many thousands [Gr. Ten thousands] of the multitude were gathered together, so that they trod upon one another, he began to say unto his disciples: First take heed to your selves of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypoerisa. [namely, that ye be not deceived thereby, or do not follow their example.]
\p
\v 2 .And there is nothing covered, that shall not be uncovered, hid, that shall not be known.
\p
\v 3 .Therefore all that ye have said in darkness [That is, in secret] shall be heard in the light: and what ye have spoken in the ear, in the inner-chambers, shall be preached on the house tops. [That is the publique, before every one,. See the reason of this phrase in the Annot, on Matth.10.27.]
\p
\v 4 .And I say unto you my friends, be not afraid of them that kill the body , and afterwards are able to do no more: [Gr. Have nothing more abundantly to do.]
\p
\v 5 .But I will shew you whom ye shall fear: fear him , whom after that he had killed, hath power (also) to cast unto hell:[Gr. The Gehenna. See thereof Matth.5.22.] yea, I say unto you fear him.
\p
\v 6 .And are not five sparrows sold for two little pence? [Gr. Assarion; of the value of which peace of money, See Mat.10.29.] and not one of them is forgotten before God.
\p
\v 7 .Yea even the hairs of your head are all numbred. Fear not thereof: ye excel many sparrows. [Gr.ye differ from many sparrows.]
\p
\v 8 .And I say unto you, everyone that shall confess me before men , him shall also the Son of Man confess before the Angels of God
\p
\v 9 .But he that that shall denie me before men, he shall be denied before the Angels of God.
\p
\v 10 .And everyone that shall speak (any) word, [That is, any thing.] against the Son of man [that is, he that out of humane finalities, fear, or ignorance, speaks against a blasphemeth Christ person, office, and doctrine.] shall be forgiven him, but he that shall have blasphemed against the holy Ghost, [that is, he that willfully and out of malice against the conviction of the holy Ghost, shall have denied or blasphemed me. See a large exposition hereof Matth, 12 32.] to him it shall not be forgiven.
\p
\v 11 .And when they shall bring away into Synagogue, and (to) Magistrates, and Powers be not careful [See the exposition hereof, Matth10.19] how or what ye say for (you) loosens, or what ye shall speak.
\p
\v 12 .For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour. [Mat.10 19 it is give, i.e inpire] that which (ye) speak.
\p
\v 13 .And one of the multitudes said unto him, Master speaks to my Brother, that he divides the inheritance with me.
\p
\v 14 .But he said unto him, man, who hath me for a Judge or an Vmpire over you.
\p
\v 15 .And he said unto them, look to it, and beware of the convetousness ,[The Greek word signifies an unsatisfied desire, to have always more] for it (lyeth) not in the abundance, that any man liveth of his goods. [Gr. For not in the abundance of any man, is his life of his goods.]
\p
\v 16 .And he spake to them a similitude, and said a rich mans Land [Gr. country (region) i.e a great of Land which this man possessed] had born well.
\p
\v 17 .And he reasoned with himself, saying, what shall I do? For I have not wherein (to) I shall gather my fruits.
\p
\v 18 .And he said this will I do. I will break down my Barnes, and build greater and there I will gather all this my increase, and these my goods.
\p
\v 19 .And I will say to my soul, soul, thou hasth many goods, which are laid up [Gr. Lying] for many years, take rest, eat, drink and merry.
\p
\v 20 .But God said to him, thou fool, in this night thy soul shall be required for thee [Gr. They shall ask thy soul of thee, i.e. fetch away, or take away] and that which thou hast prepared, whose shall it be.
\p
\v 21 .So (is it with him) which gathereth treasure for himself [Namely, to use for his own ease and pleasure] and is not rich in God. [That is, which is not furnished with the true knowledge and fear of God, and with confidence in him. See Tim. 6.17.18]
\p
\v 22 .And he said unto his disciples, therefore I say unto you, be not careful [Namely with two great and anxious care, Mat. 6.25.] for your life, [Gr. Soul] what ye shall eat, nor for the body, wherewith ye shall cloath you.
\p
\v 23 .The life is more then the food, and the body then thereinment.
\p
\v 24 .Consider the ravens, that they sow not, neither reap, which have no storehouse nor barn ,and God feeds the same: how much do you excel the fowles. [Gr. How much more do you differ from the fowles.]
\p
\v 25 .Which of you I pray can with being carefull added one ell [Gr. One cubite. See Mat.6.27.] to his length?
\p
\v 26 .If therefore ye cannot (do) even the least, what are ye carefull for the other things? [Gr. remaining, [those that belong to the sustention of the body, and of this life.]
\p
\v 27 .Consider the lilies how they grow. They labour not, neither do they spin: And I say unto you, Aeven Solomon in all his glory was cloathed as one of these.
\p
\v 28 .Now if God so cloath the grass, that today is on the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven;[See hereof Mat. 6.30.] how much more you, O yee of little faith?
\p
\v 29 .And ye ask not (or seek not) what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink: and be not of wavering mind [Or of a doubtful mind. Gr. move not neither and thither, namely, with your care and thoughts. A phrase taken from the cloudes, which on high in the aire, drive this way and that way.]
\p
\v 30 .For all these things the Nations of the world, [Or heavens, i.e. worldly men] seek: but your father knoweth that ye have need of these things.
\p
\v 31 .But seek the Kingdome of God, and all these things shall be cast unto you [Gr. added, or adjoined.]
\p
\v 32 .Fear not thou little flock, for it is your Fathers good pleasure to give the Kingdome. [Namely, of God or of heaven.]
\p
\v 33 .Sell that which ye have [Namely, rather then that ye should forsake the poor in their necessity. See Acts 4.34.] and give alms. Make yourselves purses which waxe not old, a treasure that faileth not in the heavens, where the thief cometh not at it, nor the moth corrupteth.
\p
\v 34 .For where your treasure is, there will also your heart be.
\p
\v 35 .Let your loines be girded about, [That is , be ye prepared. A phrase taken from the manner of that Countrey, where both men and women wore garments, which they trussed up when they prepared themselves to travel or to do any thing ] and the candles burning.
\p
\v 36 .And be ye like unto the men, which wait for their Lord, [This is taken from the similitude of the weddings , which were kept by night, Mat 25 v 1,6.] when he shall return from the wedding, [Gr. shall part from the wedding, shall be loose, or discharged] that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open to him straight-way.
\p
\v 37 .Blessed are those servants, whom the Lord when he cometh shall find watching : Verily I say into you, that he shall gird himself about, and shall cause them to sit down, and coming neer he shall serve them.
\p
\v 38 .And if he come in the second (night) watch, [The night was divided into four watches, Mat . 14.25.] and come in the third watch, and findes them so, blessed are those servants.
\p
\v 39 .But know this that if the Lord of the house had known in what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have let his house be digged thorow.
\p
\v 40 .Ye therefore, are ye also ready: for in what hour ye think it not, shall the Son of man come. [Namely, to judgement, 1 Thes.3.13. 2 Pet.3.18. Revel. 3. 3. and 16.15.]
\p
\v 41 .And Peter said unto him; Lord saist thou this similitude unto us, or also unto all?
\p
\v 42 .And the Lord said, who is then the faithfull and prudent steward, whom the Lord shall set over his household to give (them) the appointed portion of meat [Gr. measured meat, or corn] in due season.
\p
\v 43 .Blessed is the servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing.
\p
\v 44 .Truly I say to you, that he shall set him over all his goods.
\p
\v 45 .But if that servant should say in his heart , My Lord delayeth to come, and shall begin to beat the men-servants and maid-servants, and to eat, and to drink, and to be drunken;
\p
\v 46 .The Lord of that servant shall come at the day in which he expected him not: and shall separate him [Namely, from his family. Others cut him in two. See Mat.24.51.] and shall appoint his part with the unfaithfull [or unbelieving, Mat.24.51. it is said hypocrites.]
\p
\v 47 .And that servant which knew the will of his Lord, and prepared not (himself) neither did according to his will, he shall be beaten with many (stripes)
\p
\v 48 .But he that knew not (the same) and hath done (things)that are worthy of stripes, he shall be beaten with few (stripes.) And every one to whom much is given of him shall much be demanded: and with whom men have entrusted much [or with whom men have laid up much] of him they will ask more abundantly.
\p
\v 49 .I am come to cast fire on Earth, [That is, the doctrine of the gospel, which in it self, and in respect of the faith full is a doctrine of peace, but through the wickedness of men which will not endure the same, it is a fire of perfection, and occasion of discord. See v.51. or 39.29. 1Pet.1.7.] and what will I more, seeing it is already kindled.]
\p
\v 50 .But I must be baptized with a baptism, That is, with grievous suffering. See Mat.20.22.] and how am I pressed, [namely, either with distress or with desire until it be accomplished] until it be accomplished.
\p
\v 51 .Think ye that I come to give peace unto the earth? No I say unto you, but much rather division.
\p
\v 52 .For from henceforward there shall five in one house be divided three against two, and two against three.
\p
\v 53 .The Father shall be divided against the Son, and the Son against the Father: the Mother against the Daughter, and the Daughter against the Mother: the Mother in Law against the Daughter in Law, and the Daughter in Law against the Mother in Law.
\p
\v 54 .And he said also to the multitudes, when ye see a cloud arise from the West, straightway ye say there cometh the rain: and it comes so to pass.
\p
\v 55 .And when ye (see) the South-wind blow, ye say, there will be heat: and it cometh to pass.
\p
\v 56 .Ye hypocrites, the face [That is, the state or appearance] of the Earth and of the Heaven ye know to try, [that is, distinguish, as it is expounded Mat.16.3.] and how do ye not try this time? [that is , the condition of this time, in which came to pass so many signes of the presence of the Messiah; which hereafter is called the time of visitation, Luke 19.44.]
\p
\v 57 .And why do ye judge even of your selves, [Namely, before ye are compelled thereto, as is it be seen in the following verse] that which is right.
\p
\v 58 .For as thou goest with thine adversary before the Magistrate, give diligence on the way to be delivered from him, [Namely by pacifying and satisfying thine adversary] lest perhaps he draw thee before the Judge, and the Judge deliver thee over to the Minister of Justice [Gr. Practor, i.e. Monitor, or exactor of the fine imposed by the Judge] and the Minister of Justice cast thee into prison.
\p
\v 59 .I say unto thee thou shalt not by no meanes go out thence, until thou shalt have paid even the last penny. [How much such a penny was worth? See Mark 12.42.]

\s 1 From the message that Pilate had mingled the blood of certain Galileans with their sacrifices and from the example of the eighteen of whom the tower in Siloam fell Christ takes occasion to exhort the multitude to repentance 6 and to that end also propounds the similitude of the barren fig-tree 10 healeth on the Sabbath a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years 14 and justifies the same against a ruler of the synagogue 18 compares the kingdom of heaven to a mustard seed and leaven 23 being asked whether few shall be saved he exhorts to enter in by the straight gate 31 answers the Pharisees who gave him warning of Herod 34 complains the cruelty and the stiffneckedness of those of Jerusalem and foretells their ruine .
\p
\v 1 And there were at the same time present which unto him of the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices [Josephus indeed Antiq lib 18 chapter 5 relates something like this but the circumstance both of the time and otherwise shew that it is not of the same history some ancient teachers think that this should have happened within Jerusalem and some Galileans would have hindred some sacrifices to be offered in the temple for the Emperor of Rome.]
\p
\v 2 . And Jesus answered them and said unto them think ye that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans because they suffered this?
\p
\v 3 . I tell ye nay but if ye repent not ye shall all perish likewise [that is be destroyed by God righteous judgment as also afterwards came to pass by the Romans.]
\p
\v 4 . Or those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell [that is which was built on or over the fountain or brook of Siloa of which brook see Isaiah 8.6 John 9.7] and killed them think ye that these were debtors [that is sinners which had more debt or sins see Matthew 6.12 and 18.24] above all man that dwell in Jerusalem
\p
\v 5 . I say unto ye nay but if ye repent not ye shall all perish like manner.
\p
\v 6 . And he spake this similitude a certain man a fig-tree planted in his vineyard and he came sought fruit therein and he found it not
\p
\v 7 . And he said unto the keeper of the vineyard behold I come three years seeking fruit on this fig tree and find it not cut it down to what purpose doth it also take up to the earth unprofitable [Gr make the earth unprofitable or barren in which somewhat else might be planted that should bring forth fruit]
\p
\v 8 . And he answering said unto him Lord suffer it yet this year also until I shall dig about it and laid dung
\p
\v 9 . And if it shall bring forth fruit let it stand but if not thou shalt afterwards cut it down
\p
\v 10 . And he taught on the Sabbath [Gr Sabbath days] in one of the synagogues
\p
\v 11 . And behold there was a woman which had had the spirit of infirmity [that is an evil spirit which made her infirm see verse 16] eighteen years and she was bewed together [Gr bended together] and could not at all lift up her self
\p
\v 12 . And Jesus seeing her and called her and said unto her woman thou shalt be released [Gr loosed or unbound] from thine infirmity
\p
\v 13 . And he laid hands on her immediately she was straight again [Gr made straight] and glorified God
\p
\v 14 . And the ruler of the synagogue [that is one of the rulers for every synagogue had more than one ruler see Mark 5.2 Acts 13.15] taking it ill that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath answered and said unto the multitude there are six days in which man must work [that is it is allowed and commanded to work] come therefore in them and be healed and not on the day of the Sabbath
\p
\v 15 . The Lord then answered him and said thou hypocrisy doth not every one of ye on the Sabbath unloose his oxen or ass from the manager and lead him away to make him drink?
\p
\v 16 . And this woman which is a daughter of Abraham [that is descended from the stock of Abraham and belonging to the covenant of God that made with Abraham and his posterity see Luke 19.9] who Satan had bound [that is who had distressed her with infirmities as with hands] loe now eighteen years must not she be loosed from his hand on the Sabbath day
\p
\v 17 . And as he said this they were all ashamed which set them selves against him and all the multitude rejoiced for all glorious things which were done by him.
\p
\v 18 . And he said to what is this kingdom of God like? [That is preaching of the gospel whereby the kingdom of God is set up] and whereunto shall I resemble it?
\p
\v 19 . It is like a mustard seed [see of these similitudes Matthew 13.31] which a man took and cast into his garden and it grew up and came into a great tree and the fowles of the heaven nestled in its branches
\p
\v 20 . And he said again whereunto I shall liken the kingdom of God
\p
\v 21 . It is like a leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal s until the whole was sowered
\p
\v 22 . And he traveled from city and village from the other teaching and directing [Gr making] his journey towards Jerusalem
\p
\v 23 . And one said unto him Lord are there but few that are saved / and said unto them
\p
\v 24 . Strive [that is use diligence and labour Ephesians 6.11 &c Philippians 3.12,13 .2 Timothy 4.7 &c ] to enter in through the straight gate [namely which leadeth unto life Matthew 7.14] for many I say unto ye shall seek to enter in and shall not be able [namely because it shall be too as appears by what follows]
\p
\v 25 . Namely after that the Lord of the house shall be risen up [this similitude is taken from the keeping of the weddings in those times whereof may be seen at large Matthew 25.1 &c.] and shall have shut the door and ye shall begin to stand and to knock at the door saying Lord, Lord open to us and he shall answer and say unto ye I know ye not whence ye are
\p
\v 26 . Then shall ye begin to say we have eaten and drunk in thine presence and hast taught in our streets
\p
\v 27 . And he shall say I know ye not whence ye are depart from me ye workers of iniquity
\p
\v 28 . There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when ye shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God [namely of glory of heaven] but yourselves cast forth without
\p
\v 29 . And there shall come from the east and west and south and north and shall sit down in the kingdom of God
\p
\v 30 . And behold they are last[ by the last are understood the gentiles which were yet strangers from the covenant of God and by the first the Jews and thereby we are given to understand that the gentiles shall be the first and the first shall be the last
\p
\v 31 . The same day there came certain Pharisees saying unto him get thee away [that is out of Galilee where Herod was tetrarch Luke 3.1 and 23.7] and depart hence for Herod will kill thee [this warning was given by them not out of love to Christ but because they would gladly be rid of him see the like warning Nehem 6 verse 10.11 Amos 7.13]
\p
\v 32 . And he said unto them go your way and tell that fox [so he calls him by reason to subtitle an craftiness ]behold I cast out devils and make whole [Gr perfect cures ]today and tomorrow [that is yet a little while see Hosea 6.2 ]and the third day [ that is after the accomplishment of the ministry in this short time ]I am consummate [or am perfected or consecrated or offered up Job 17.4 and 19.30 see more largely of signification of this word Hebrews 2.10 and 5.9]
\p
\v 33 . Nevertheless I must travel today and tomorrow and the day following [ that is I must yet little while walk here and there to execute mine office further and afterwards I will go to Jerusalem and there to be put to death by you yourself]for it happens not [that is hardly or very seldom ] that a prophet be put to death out of Jerusalem
\p
\v 34 . Jerusalem , Jerusalem [see the exposition hereof Matthew 23.37]thou that killest the prophet and stonest them that are sent unto thee how many times would I have gathered thy children together like as a hen gathereth her chickens [Gr brood or nest chicken ]under the wings and ye would not
\p
\v 35 . Behold your house [that is the temple and city] is left unto your waste and verily I say unto ye that ye shall not see me until the time the time shall become when ye shall say blessed is he which cometh in the name of the Lord [this was shortly after fulfilled in some assort see Luke 19.38 and shall perfectly be accomplished at the last day]
\c 14
\s Christ cureth one that had dropsy on the Sabbath and justifies the same 7 reproves the ambition of the Pharisees seeking the foremost seats in the feasts and exhorteth the humility liberality towards the poor 15 by the similitude of the great supper whereunto the invited excuse themselves from coming he upbraids the Jews with their gratitude and foretells their rejection and the calling of the Gentiles in their room 25 teacheth that he that be his disciples must deny himself and all that he is dear to him 28 by the example of one that would build a tower and a king that would go to battle against another king and exhorts his disciples to cast up their accounts well before hand 34 and teacheth that unfavoury salt is profitable for nothing
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass when he was come into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees [that is a ruler of the Jews of the sect of the Pharisees as also Nicodemus was John 3.1] on the Sabbath to eat bread that they observed him [namely whether he would say or do anything that they might reprehend him]
\p
\v 2 . And behold there was a certain man that had dropsy before him
\p
\v 3 . And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyer [or the lawyer see Matthew2.4 and Luke 11. 45] and Pharisees and said it is also lawful to heal on the Sabbath?
\p
\v 4 . They held their peace and he took him and healed him and let him go
\p
\v 5 . And he answering and said whose ass or ox shall fall into a pit and which shall not straightway draw him out of the Sabbath day ?
\p
\v 6 . And they could not answer him again thereunto?
\p
\v 7 . And he spake to the invited [Gr called namely to the feast so also in the following] a similitude [namely thereby to exhort them to true humility before God and man as may be seen verse 11 ]observing how they chose the chief seat saying unto them .
\p
\v 8 . When thou shall be hidden of any man to a wedding set not thy self in the first place least perhaps a worthier then thou [that is worthy of more honor or more respect ]be forbidden of him
\p
\v 9 . And he coming who invited thee and he say unto thee give this man place and then thou shouldst begin with shame to keep the last place
\p
\v 10 . But when thou shall be invited go thy way and set thee in the last place that when he cometh that inviteth thee he say unto thee friend go up higher [Gr ascend higher ]then shall it be honor to the before those that sit down with thee
\p
\v 11 . For everyone that exalteth himself shall be brought low and that he humbled himself shall be exalted
\p
\v 12 . And he said also to him that had hidden him thou shalt make a dinner or a supper call not thy friends nor thy brethren nor thy kinsmen nor thy rich neighbour [namely forgetting the poor and if thou wilt expect recompence from God as Christ expresseth verse 14 otherwise it is not unlawful to shew this curesy to our friends also see Genesis 21.8 and chapter 43 .25&c Job 1.4] left at any time the same also invite thee again and recompense be made thee
\p
\v 13 . But when thou shalt make a feast invite the poor maimed [or defective of members] cripples blind
\p
\v 14 . And thou shalt be blessed because they have not recompense thee for it shall be recompensed unto thee [namely by God of grace of this recompense see Matthew 25.26] in the resurrection of the just [namely to eternal life for otherwise the unjust also shall be raised up but to everlasting condemnation Daniel 12.2 Job 5.29 Acts 24.15]
\p
\v 15 . And when one of them that sate at meat with, heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that eateth the bread [Or shall eat] in the Kingdome of God.
\p
\v 16 . But he said unto him, A certain man prepared [Gr. made. By this similitude Christ sheweth that although these men seemed greatly to esteem the kingdom of God; yet notwithstanding, they and many others had these temporal things so rooted in their hearts , they despised or neglected the same] a great Supper, and he invited many.
\p
\v 17 . And he sent forth his servant at the house of the supper, to say to the invited, come for all things are now readie.
\p
\v 18 . And they all began unanimously, [Gr. out of one, i.e. out of one heart or mouth; for although they pretend severrall causes of refusal, yet they all excecute themselves from their temporal things] to excecute (themselves) The first said unto him, Ihave brought a field, and it is needful that I go forth and view it: I pray thee hold me for excused.
\p
\v 19 . And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, [That is, pair or couple] and Igo to prove them; I pray thee hold me excused.
\p
\v 20 . And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore Cannot come.
\p
\v 21 . And that servant being come (again) told his Lord these things. Then the Lord of the house was wroth. [Hereby is not given to understand that to buy a field, oxen, or such like goods , or to marry a wifeshould be unlawfull. 1. Cor. 7.29. But the Lord is therefore worth, that the Jews by these temporall things suffered themselves to be hindred from embracing the doctrine of the gospel. Wherefore he also rejected them and called the Gentiles in their room] and said to his servants. Goout speedily unto the streets and houses of the Citie, and bring in hither the poor and maimed, and cripples. And blind.
\p
\v 22 . And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded; and yet there is place:
\p
\v 23 .And the Lord said to the servant , Go out into the wayes and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be full. [Namely,with earnest and continual urging, 2.Tim. 4.2. See the like, Gen. 33. 11. Luke 24.29.]
\p
\v 24 . For I say unto you, that none of those men thet were hidden, [Namely, and refused to come] shall taste of my supper.
\p
\v 25 . And many multitudes went with him, and turning him about said unto them,
\p
\v 26 . If any man come unto me, and hate not his father and his mother, and wife and children, and brethren and sisters, [That is, he loves the same more then me, as it is expounded: Matth. 10.37.] yea, and his own life also, [Gr. soule, as Matth. 16.25.] he cannot be my disciple.
\p
\v 27 . And he that beareth his thy cross,[That is, he that is not minded and ready, after mine example ,and for my sake, to suffer persecution and affliction.] and followeth after me, [Gr. cometh after me] he cannot be my disciple.
\p
\v 28 . For which of you intending to build a Tower , sitteth not down first, and counteth the costs, [Or considereth, casteth up, as used to be done with counters] whether or not he hath that which is (needful) to the perfecting of it.
\p
\v 29 . Lest perhaps when he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that see it begin to mock him.
\p
\v 30 . Saying this man began to build, and was not able to finish.
\p
\v 31 . Or what King going to war, to fight against another King, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand men to meet him, which cometh against him with twenty thousand?
\p
\v 32 . Otherwise, he sendeth forth Ambassandours while he yet afarre off, and desireth with that which (tends) to peace.
\p
\v 33 . So therefore everyone of you, that forsaketh not all that he hath, [Gr. bids farewell to all. i.e. is not ready it need be forsake all and follow me. See Luke 9.61. and here verse 27.] he cannot be my disciple.
\p
\v 34 . Salt is good, but if the salt be become unsavory, [Or is become foolish. See Matth. 5.13.] wherewith shall it be made savorie?
\p
\v 35 . It [Namely, salt being spoyled. See M ark 9.50.] is fit neither for the land, nor for the dung hill: men cast it away. [Gr. without] He that hath ears to hear let him hear
\c 15
\s 1 The Pharisees murmure because Christ receiveth sinners. 3 which Christ defends by a similitude of a strayed sheep, 8 and of a lost penny, both which are sought with diligence, and found again with joy: 11 and further by the similitude of the lost sonne, whom returning with sorrow the Father receives joy fully, 25 and defends his so doing against the mur muring of the eldest brother.
\p
\v 1 And all the publicans [That is, from all the places thereabouts] and the sinners [that is, they that lived in publick gross sins. See Psalm 1.1. Matth. 9. 10.] drew near unto him for to hear him.
\p
\v 2 . And the Pharisees and the Scribes murmured, saying, This (man) receiveth sinners, and eat with them.
\p
\v 3 . And he spake unto them this similitude, [Gr. Parable] saying,
\p
\v 4 . What man among you having a hundred sheep, and losing one of them, doth not leave the ninietie and nine in the wilderness and goeth after that which is lost until he find the same?
\p
\v 5 . And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders rejoycing.
\p
\v 6 . And coming home , he calleth the friends and neighbours together, saying unto them, Rejoyce with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost:
\p
\v 7 . I say unto you, that so there shall be joy in heaven, [Namely, among the Angels of God, as is hereafter expounded, verse 10.] for one sinner that repenteth (more) then for the ninetie and nine righteous (ones) [that is, which are not so gone astray, as it is Matth. 18.13. and therefore need not to repent them of such gross going astray or sin. Although otherwise even the most holy have need to repent from their daily infirmities. James 3.2. 1 John 1.8. Others hereby the righteous understand those which wrongfully perswade themselves that they are righteous, and that they have no need of repentance. Matth.9.12 Luke18.9.] that have no need of repentance.
\p
\v 8 Or what women have ten pence [Gr. druchmes, the value whereof is all one with Romane denarius, or Spanish ryall, and the Dutch shilling. See Matth. 18 .28.] if she loses one pennie, doth not light a candle, and sweeps the house (with besomes) and seeketh deligently until she findeth (it)?
\p
\v 9 . And when she hath found (it) she calleth her she friends and neighbours together, saying rejoce with me, for I have found the pennie which I had lost.
\p
\v 10 . So (I say unto you) there is joy before the Angels of God for one sinner that repenteth.
\p
\v 11 . And he said a certain man had two sons, [By this as also the two former similitudes, Christ sets before our eyes the readiness and willingness of God, graciously to receive sinners when they repent, and would thereby prove against the murmuring of the Pharisees, that he then also did well when he conversed with sinners for to bring them repentance, and that they ought much rather to rejoice at it.]
\p
\v 12 . And the youngest [Gr. younger] said unto the Father, Father give me the portion of goods that belongeth to (me.) [That is, which should fall to me; namely after thy death. See v.30.31.] And he parted unto them the goods. [Gr. the living, or livelihood, i.e. the means whereof to live.]
\p
\v 13 . And not many daies after, the youngest son having gathered all together, traveled away into a Land (lying) afar off, and there wasted his goods [Gr. scattered or consumed] living prodigally.
\p
\v 14 . And when he had spent it all, there was a great, [Or strong, or violent] femine in that Land, and he began to suffer want.
\p
\v 15 . And he went his way and joined himself to one of the Cities of the same Country: and he sent him into his Land [Gr. Fields] to feed the Swine.
\p
\v 16 . And he desired to fill his belly with the draffe, [Or keratia, which properly signifies , the pilings, husks or shells of certain fruits, like as the pease and beanes have, which in those Landes they gave the hogs to eat, as here we give them draffes or swill. Or as others think a certain fruit in those Countries, which poor people and hogs eat, like as in some places arcnes are eaten] which the swine did eat, [that is used to eat] and no man gave them unto him.
\p
\v 17 . And being come to himself [or going into himself] he said, how many hirelings of my Father have bread in abundance, and I perish with hunger?
\p
\v 18 . I will arise and go to my Father, and I will say unto him, Father I have sinned against heaven, [That is God, which is in heaven, as Dan. 4.26. Mat. 21.25.] and before thee.
\p
\v 19 . And I am no worthy to be called thy Son: make me as one of the hirelings.
\p
\v 20 . And rising up he went up to his Father: And when he was yet farre (from him) his Father saw him, and was moved with inward compassion: and running (to him) fell upon his neck, and kissed him.
\p
\v 21 . And the son said unto him, Father I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no worthy to be called thy son.
\p
\v 22 . But the Father said unto his servants, bring forth (hither) the best garment, [Gr. the first stole. Stoles were long garments like gownes. See Mark 12.38.] and put it on him, and give a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet.
\p
\v 23 .And bring the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and be merry.
\p
\v 24 . For this my son was dead, and is become alive again: and he was lost and is found. And they began to be merry.
\p
\v 25 . And his Eldest son [Gr. Elder] was in the field, and as he came and approached to the house, he had the singing and dancing. [Gr. Choron, which signifies the company of people that daunce and sing together, or make other merriment.]
\p
\v 26 . And having called unto him one of the servants, he asked what that might be.
\p
\v 27 .And he said unto him , thy brother is come and thy father hath killed the fattest calf , because he hath received him again in health.
\p
\v 28 . But he was wrath and would not go in; therefore his father went out and in treated him. Or perswaded him that he would come in, or called him.]
\p
\v 29 . But he answering said unto his father, loe I (have) served thee (now) so many years, and have never transgressed thy commandments, and thou never gavest me a kid, that I might be merry with my friends.
\p
\v 30 . But when this thy son was come, which hath wasted [Gr. eaten up, or devoured] thy substance [Gr. living or livelyhood as v. 12.] with harlots ,thou hast slain for him the fattest calf.
\p
\v 31 . And he said unto him child, thou art always with me, and all that is mine is thine, [That is, will at last belong to thee, for the younest had away his substance.]
\p
\v 32 . I was therefore to be merry and glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is become alive again: and he was lost, and is found.
\c 16
\s 1 By the similitude of the prudence of an unjust Steward, Christ teacheth, that we must make friends of the unrighteous Mammon, 13 and that we must not serve Mammon , 14 reproveth the covetous Pharises hypocrisies and highmindednss, 16 teacheth that the Law and the Prophets continued untill John, and must be fulfilled to the least title, 28 treateth of divorce, 29 propounds the similitude of the rich man, and poor Lazarus, and the different estate of both, as well in this life as hereafter.
\p
\v 1 AND he said also unto his Desciples, there was a certain rich man which had a Steward, [Gr. house keeper or Baylie, who is appointed for the receiving in, and laying out of the means] and he was accused to him, as one that wasted his goods.[Gr. scattered or consumed.]
\p
\v 2 . And he called him, and said unto him, how do I hear of this of thee? Give account of thy stewardship, [Or administration of thine office] for thou canst no longer be Steward.
\p
\v 3 . And the Steward said with himself, what shall I do? Seeing my Lord hath taken this Stewardship from me? I cannot dig, to beg I am ashamed.
\p
\v 4 . I know what I will do, that when I shall be put off from the Stewardship, they [Namely, my Lord debtors] may receive me into their houses.
\p
\v 5 . And he called unto him every one of his Lords debtors, and said to the first, how much art thou indebted to my Lord.
\p
\v 6 . And he said, an hundred Vessels of oyl; [Gr. Bators, which signifieth a great measure of moist wares, whereof, see 1 Kings 7.26.] And he said unto him, take thy writing and sitting down, write quickly fifty.
\p
\v 7 . Afterwards he said to another, and thou, how much art thou indebted, and he said, an hundred brushels of wheat; [Gr, coros. Which signifies a great measure of dry wares, 1 Kings 4.22.] And he said unto him, take thy writing and write eighty.
\p
\v 8 . And the Lord [Namely, of this Steward] commended the unjust Steward [not because of his unjustice, but for this prudence, to make provisions for himself against the future] because he had done prudently, for the children of this world. [Gr. sons, i.e. that seek nothing else but the things of this world, as there are opposed to them the children of the light, that is, those that being enlightened by the holy Ghost, seek that which is in heaven, John 12. 36. Eph. 5.8. 1Thes. 5.5,8. 1 John. 1.5, 6.] are more prudent then the children of light in their generation.
\p
\v 9 . And I say unto you, make to yourselves friends, [That is take care by your liberality towards the poor especially the Faithfull, that they do not complain of you, but may bless you before God. See Duet. 24.13.] of the unrighteous Mammon, [of this word see Matth.6.24.] that when ye shall want, [or when ye shall faint, namely, by death, or when ye shall leave, namely, the Mammon] they may receive you [namely, as witnesses of your liberality and charity shewed towards them] into everlasting tabernacles.
\p
\v 10 . He that is faithfull in the least, he is also faithfull the great; [Gr. much] and he that is unjust in the least, [or the fewest] he is unjust also in the great.
\p
\v 11 . If therefore ye have not been fathfull in the unrighteous Mammon, [Because many times riches are either gotten unjustly or not rightly bestowed or used. Others translate it false or deceitfull, because it is opposed to the true good, verse 11.] who shall entrust you with the true? [that is, the true, unperishing, and heavenly riches, Matth.6.v.20.]
\p
\v 12 . And if ye have not been faithfull in others (goods) [Namely, which God lends you but for a time, to use not onely for your selves, but for others also] who shall give you, your own? [that is, which you shall keep always and forever.]
\p
\v 13 . No servant can serve two lords; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will adhere to the one, [That is keep close or stick to the one ] and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and the Mammon.
\p
\v 14 . And all these things the Pharisees heard also, who were covetous of money, and they derided him.
\p
\v 15 . And he said unto them, Ye are they which justifie your selves before men, but God knoweth your hearts. For that which is high amongst men, [That is, that which worldly and carnal men esteem highly] is an abomination before God.
\p
\v 16 . The Law and the Prophets (are) until John: from that time forward the kingdom of God [That is, the fulfilling of that, which the Law and the Prophets foretold concerning the Messiah] is preached;[Gr. is evangelized] and ever one presseth violently upon the same. [See Matth. 11.12.]
\p
\v 17 . And it is easier that Heaven and Earth pass away then that title of the Law. [That is, that should not be accomplished which said and taught in the Law and the Prophets.]
\p
\v 18 . Every one that forsaketh his wife, [To wit, other wife then fornication, as is expressed Mtth 5.32. and 19.9.] and marrieth other, he commiteth adultery: and every one that marrieth her that is forsaken her husband, he (also) commiteth adultery.
\p
\v 19 . And there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed with purple, [That is with purple garments. See Matth.27.28. Mark 15.17.] and very fine linen, [Gr. Byssos; this is a sort of very fine cloth or linen, which Pliny saith , was valued against gold, Hist. nat, lib.19. cap.10. and is expressly distinguished from silk, Revel 18.12.] living every day delightfully and stately.
\p
\v 20 . And there was a certain Begger named Lazarus, which lay before his gate, [Or portal, porch] full of sores.
\p
\v 21 . And desired to be satisfied with crums, which fell from the rich (mans) table; but even the Dogs came and licked his sores.
\p
\v 22 . And it came to pass that the Begger died, and was carried by the Angels into Abrahams bosoms [That is, into Heaven or into Paradise, where the faithfull with Abraham the Father of all faithfull shall be gathered , rest, sit down and be comforted, Matth.8.verse11. John 13.23.]
\p
\v 23 . And the rich (man) died also, and was buried [Namely with great pomp and state. Of Lazarusâ€™s burial there is no mention made, but instead thereof, all that happened to his soul.]And when in Hell he lift up his eyes, [these words, like as also some of the following. Must not be properly, for the soul being a spiritual being, neither hath eyes, nor tongue, nor fingers: but by the similitude, thereby to set forth both the greatness of the pains in Hell, and the unchangeableness of the state of the soul after this life, both of those that are in Heaven, and those that are in Hell.] being in torment, he saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosome.
\p
\v 24 . And he cried and said, Father Abraham have mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue: for I suffer pains in this flame.
\p
\v 25 . But Abraham said, Childe, Remember that thou receiveth thy good in life, and Lazarus likewise evil: and now he is comforted and thou sufferest pains
\p
\v 26 . And besides all this, between us and you is a great cleft (or gulf) fixed, [Or abyss, i. a vast and deep interval settled by Gods will and power.] so that they which would go over from hence to you, should not be able; nor yet they (that are there) come over from thence to us.
\p
\v 27 . And he said, I pray thee there Father, that thou wouldst send him to my fathers house.
\p
\v 28 . For I have five brethren, that he may testifie (this) to them, lest they also come onto this place of torment.
\p
\v 29 . Abraham said unto him, They have Moses and the Prophets, [That is the writings of Moses and the Prophets.] let them hear them. [That is, be obedient unto them.]
\p
\v 30 . And he said, no Father Abraham: but if any one went to them from the dead, they would repent.
\p
\v 31 . But (Abraham) said unto him, if they hear not Moses and the Prophet neither would they although any one arose from the dead, give credit to him. [Or be perswaded.
\c 17
\s Christ forewarns them of offences.1. Teacheth that we must forgive our brothers as often as he is sorry for his offences. 3. The Desciples pray for the increase of their faith, the whereof he describeth. 5. By the similitude of a servant coming from a field, he declareth, that a man doth not merit before God when he doth his duty. 7. He cleamseth ten lepers, whereof but one is thankfull. 11. Teacheth in what manner the coming of his kingdom shall be. 20. Describes the last times, which he compares to the times of Noe and Lot.26.
\p
\v 1 And he said unto the disciples and it can not be [Gr it is unchanceable that is it cannot happen see hereof Matthew 18.7] that no offence should come but wo to him by whom they come
\p
\v 2 . It would be more profitable for him [Gr it is profitable for him]that is it were less evil for him that punishment were inflicted on him before he gave offence given he should be punished with everlasting death as Christ here threatens] that a mill-stone were put about his neck and cast into the sea then that he should offend one of his little ones [that is even the least amongst the faithful see Matthew 18.6]
\p
\v 3 . Take heed to yourselves and if thy brother sin against thee rebuke him and if he is sorry for it [Gr if he repent that is acknowledge his fault and desire pardon and whereby not withstanding Christ meaneth not that we should not forgive them which yet do not thus for he hath us otherwise by his own example Luke 23.34 like as Stephen did also Acts 7.60 and Paul 1 Corinthians 4.2] forgive it him
\p
\v 4 And if he sin against thee seven times a day [that is often as Psalm 119 .164 Proverbs 24.16] and seven times a day turn again to thee saying I am sorry for it thou shall forgive him.
\p
\v 5 . He and the apostles said increase faith unto us
\p
\v 6 . And the Lord saith if ye have faith as the mustard seed [that is although it were never so little so it be but true see Matthew 17 verse 20] ye should say to this mulberry tree [Gr sycaminos which is a kind of mulberry tree or as some think of a fig tree] be thou rooted up [that is plucked out by the root or rooted out] and planted in the sea and he should obey ye
\p
\v 7 . And which of ye hath a servant [that is slave or bond man who owes his Lord all he can do] loughing or keeping cattle who will presently say to him when he commeth in from the field come near and sit down?
\p
\v 8 . But will be not say to him make ready that I shall eat at supper and gird thee about [namely after the manner of those countries were they wore long clothes see Luke 12.37] and serve me until I shall have eaten and drink afterwards
\p
\v 9 . Doth he also thank that servant [that is doth he con him thank for that as if were therefore beholding to him] because he hath done that which was commanded him? I think not
\p
\v 10 . so ye also when ye shall have all that is commanded you say we are unprofitable servants [that s which bring no benefit or profit to our master Romans 11.35 although there be no man which doth that which ought 1 Kings 8.46 Job 9.2,3 Matthew 6.12] for we have but done which is our duty to do
\p
\v 11 . And it came to pass when he traveled towards Jerusalem that he went through the midst of Samaria [that is off the Land of the city were Samaria was the chief city for from Galilee to Jerusalem the next way was through the land of Samaria ]and Galilee
\p
\v 12 . And when he came into a certain town there he met him ten leaper when which stood afar off [ that is separated from the people according to the law Numbers 5 verse 2]
\p
\v 13 . And they lift up their voices saying Jesus master [Gr forestander] have mercy on me
\p
\v 14 . And when he saw them he said unto them go your way and shew yourselves to the priest [the cause hereof see Matthew 8.4] and it came to pass that while they were away they were cleansed
\p
\v 15 . And one of them seeing that he was cured turned back with a loud voice glorifying God
\p
\v 16 . And he fell on his face before his feet thanking him and the same was a Samaritan
\p
\v 17 . And Jesus answering said was not the ten cleansed? And where the nine?
\p
\v 18 . And there none found who return to give glory to God but the stranger? [That is which is of another race then the Jewish for the Samaritan were descended from the Gentiles 2 Kings 17.24]
\p
\v 19 . And said unto him arise and go thy way thy father have saved thee
\p
\v 20 . And being asked by the Pharisees and the kingdom of God should come be answered them and saith the kingdom of God cometh not with out ward shew [Gr with observation that is in such manner that it can be taken notice of before as it is in the coming of wordly princes which by reason of the great out ward pomp may be observed as expected before hand]
\p
\v 21 . Neither shall man say Lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of God is within you [or in the midst of you which may be understood either of the Jews in general for sa much as the messiahs was now in the midst among them John 1.26 or else faithful among them in whose heart he set up his kingdom by his word and spirit]
\p
\v 22 . And he said to the disciples there shall come days when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man [namely to enjoy his bodily presence and to hear the word out of his own mouth] and ye shall not see it
\p
\v 23 . And they shall say unto ye Lo here or lo he is there go not your way neither follow them
\p
\v 24 . For as the lightning which lighteneth from one end under the heaven so shall the son of man be in his day [namely as well in the swift spread abroad the gospel through the whole world Romans 10.18 as his last coming to judgment 1 Corinthians 15.52 2 Peter 3.10]
\p
\v 25 . But first he must suffer much and be rejected [Gr disapproved] of this generation [namely of the Jews]
\p
\v 26 . And as it happened in the days of Noe so shall it be also in days of son of man
\p
\v 27 . They did eat they drank [that is they took care of nothing else but for these and such like wordly corporal things without taking notice of what of this was foretold] they took in marriage [namely the men] they were given in marriage [that is the women or maidens]until the day on which Noah went onto the ark and stood and came and destroyed them all
\p
\v 28 . In the like manner as it also happened in the days of Lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded
\p
\v 29 . But on that day in which Lot went on Sodom it rained fire and Brim storm from heaven and destroyed them all
\p
\v 30 . Even so shall it be the day [namely of vengeance and judgment which he shall execute as well in particular with the Jews and the city of Jerusalem as in general as over the whole world see Matthew 24.39] on which the son of men shall be revealed [Gr be revealed ]
\p
\v 31 . In that day he that shall be on the roof and his house hold stuff [Gr his vessels ]in the house let him not come down to take the same away and he that shall be in the field let him likewise not turn to that which is behind
\p
\v 32 . Remember Lots wife [namely that ye do not with your heart stick to earthly things and looking back to them as she did ye be not punished with her]
\p
\v 33 . Whosoever shall seek to save his life Gr soul see Matthew 10.39] he shall lose it whoso shall lose the same he shall preserve it alive [Gr begot it alive that is preserve it to everlasting life]
\p
\v 34 . I say unto ye in the night [namely when Christ shall come to judgment] two shall upon one bed the one shall be received [namely by God in grace] the other shall be left [namely to justly condemn]
\p
\v 35 . Two women shall gring together [see hereof the annotate on Matthew 24.41] the one shall be received and the other shall be left
\p
\v 36 . Two shall be in the field the other shall be receive and the other left
\p
\v 37 . And they answered and said unto him where Lord? And he said unto him where the body is there will the eagles be gathered together [see the exposition hereof Matthew 24.28]
\c 18
\s By the similitude of a widow and an unrighteous Jesus Christ teacheth that we must hold on in prayer 1 and another similitude of a Pharisee and a publican he teacheth that God hears and justifies the penitent sinner and not those which rely on their own righteousness 9 commands that the little children shall be suffered to come to him 15 answereth the question of a ruler what he must do to obtain eternal life and directs him to keeping of commandments 18 teacheth how hardly the rich are saved 24 promiseth both here and hereafter to recompence those who forsake all for his sake 28 foretells his sufferings death and resurrections 31 near Jericho he makes a blind man to see 35
\p
\v 1 And also he told parable into them tending to this that we must always pray [that is at all opportunities continue to pray until we obtain and not negligent and those our courage although we be not heard presently] and not grow weary
\p
\v 2 . Saying there was a certain judge in a city which feared not God and respected no man
\p
\v 3 . And there was a certain widow in the same city and she came unto him saying do me right [or avenge me as also verse 7] against mine advisory
\p
\v 4 . And he would not for a long time afterwards he said with himself I fear not God and respect no man
\p
\v 5 . Not withstanding because this widow is troublesome to me I will do her right left finally she come [Gr to the end or continually that is with continual running to me] and break mine head [or destruct me the Greek word properly signifies to strike under the sight or as it were with blows on the face to make ones head stupid and senseless.
\p
\v 6 . And the Lord saith hear what the unrighteous judge saith
\p
\v 7 . And shall not God then right his right his own elect which cry unto him day and night although he is long suffering concerning them? [That is seems slowly to com unto this by punishing the ungodly to deliver unto the elect]
\p
\v 8 . I say unto ye that he shall right them speedily [Gr in haste that is unexpectedly] yet the on of man when he cometh [namely to judge] shall he also find faith on the earth [that is the number of the faithful shall then be small yet shall be some then also 1 Thessalonians 4.15, 17]
\p
\v 9 . And he said unto some which were confident with themselves [or on themselves] that they were righteous and esteemed nothing of others this similitude
\p
\v 10 . Two men went up into the temple [for the temple was built on mountain Moria in the highest part of the city see 2 Chronicles 3.1] to pray the one was a Pharisee the other was a publican
\p
\v 11 . the Pharisee standing prayed this with himself [or standing by himself ]o God I thank thee that I am not as the rest of men extortioners unjust adulterers or even this publican
\p
\v 12 . I fast twice a week [Gr on the Sabbath that is in the week see Mark 16.9] I give tenths of all [or tithe all] that I possess
\p
\v 13 . And the publicans standing afar off from the altar and from the holy place in the first entrance of the court of the temple is token of shame for his sins would not lift up so much as his eyes towards heaven but smote on his breasts [in token of hearty furrow for the same sins] saying O God be gracious to me a sinner
\p
\v 14 . I say unto you this man went down [namely from the temple see verse 10] justified [that is accounted for righteous by God whereof see more largely Romans 3.20 c.]into his house more then he [namely the Pharisees seeing the publicans was justified before God and not the Pharisee although he accounted himself justified and was also accounted by man ] for everyone that exalteth himself shall be brought low and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted
\p
\v 15 . And they brought little children unto him that he should touch them [that is lay hands upon them to bless them see Matthew 19.13 Mark 10.16] and the disciples seeing that rebuked them [namely those that brought the children]
\p
\v 16 . But Jesus called those little children unto him and said let the little children come unto me and hinder them not [or forbid them not] for of such is the kingdom of God [see hereof Matthew 19.14]
\p
\v 17 . Verily I say unto you whoso shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child [that is in humility simplicity and up righteousness Psalms 131.1,2] he shall in no wise come into the same
\p
\v 18 . And a certain ruler asked him [see of history Matthew 19.16] saying good master what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
\p
\v 19 And Jesus said unto him what callest ye thou me good? None is good but namely God
\p
\v 20 Thou knowest commandment thou shall not commit adultery thou shall not steal thou shall not kill thou shall not bear false witnesses honour thy father thy and mother
\p
\v 21 . And he said all these things have I observed from my youth
\p
\v 22 . But Jesus hearing this said unto him but yet one thing thou lackest [namely whereby thou shall be able to understand how far thou art yet from perfection on that thou presumest of see further hereof Matthew 19.21] sell all that thou hast and divide it amongst the poor and thou shalt have a treasure in heaven and come hither follow me
\p
\v 23 . And when he heard this h became very sad for he was very rich
\p
\v 24 . Now Jesus seeing that he was very sad said how hardly shall they that have goods [that is they that are rich and put their trust in riches as is declared Mark 10.24] enter into the kingdom of God
\p
\v 25 . For it is easier that a camel [or cable of this proverb see Matthew 19.24] go through the eye of a needle then that a rich man should enter into the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 26 And they that heard this said who then can this be saved?
\p
\v 27 . And he said the things that are impossible with man are possible with God [see Matthew 19.26]
\p
\v 28 . And Peter said behold us have left all and followed thee
\p
\v 29 . And he said unto them verily I say unto ye that there is no man who hath forsaken house or parents or brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of God
\p
\v 30 Which shall not receive manifold in this time [this promise is always fulfilled by spiritual gifts or oftentimes also by temporal] and in the world to ciome eternal life
\p
\v 31 . And he took the twelve with him and he said unto them behold we go up to Jerusalem and it shall be accomplished on the son of man that is written by the prophets [otherwise that is written by the prophets concerning the son of man]
\p
\v 32 For he shall be delivered over to the Gentiles and he shall be mocked and reproached handled and spit upon
\p
\v 33 . And having scourged him they shall put him to death and the third day he shall rise again
\p
\v 34 . And they understood none of these things [for as much as they were yet possessed with the commoners rour concerning the wordly kingdom of Christ] and this word was hid from them and they understood not that which was said
\p
\v 35 . And it came to pass as he came nigh unto Jericho that a certain blind man [see Matthew chapter 20 verse30 speaketh of two blind man whereof see reconciliation Mark 10.464 although some because of the difference of the places where this came to pass think that it is another history but this difference is by others thus reconciled that these blind man indeed began to cry out in the entrance of Jericho but that Christ first restored them to their sight when he was gone through Jericho] sate by the way begging
\p
\v 36 . And hearing the multitude pass by asked what that was
\p
\v 37 . And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth passed by
\p
\v 38 . And he cried saying Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me
\p
\v 39 . And they that passed by rebuked him that he should hold his peace but he cried so much more thy son of David have mercy on me
\p
\v 40 . And Jesus standing still he commanded that he should be brought unto him and when he was come nigh him he asked him
\p
\v 41 . Saying what will thou shall do unto thee? And he said Lord that I may receive the sight
\p
\v 42 . And Jesus said unto him receive thy sight for thy faith have saved thee
\p
\v 43 . And straightway he received his sight and glorifying him and all the people seeing that gave glory to God
\c 19
\s Zacheus seeketh to see Christ 1 receiveth him into his house 6 testifieth his repentance and is comforted by Christ 8 by the similitude of the distributing of the pounds Christ teacheth that we ought to employ our gifts of advantage11 maketh his entrance into Jerusalem riding upon an ass 29 and is received with the multitude of acclamation 37 weepeth over the city of Jerusalem and foretelleth her desolations 41 driveth the buyers and the sellers out of the temple 45 the chief priest and the scribes seek to put him to death47.
\p
\v 1 And Jesus being come in [namely into the city see chapter 18 verse 35] he went through Jericho [of the condition of this city see Mark 10.46]
\p
\v 2 . And behold there was a man called by the name Zacheus and he as chief of the publicans [in every province or city there were divers publicans amongst whom one was the chief which was to be accountable for the tribute to the Romans see the like in Josephus antiq lib 12 cap4]and he was rich
\p
\v 3 . And he sought to see Jesus who could not by reason of the multitude because he was little of person [Gr stature or length]
\p
\v 4 . And running forth before climbed upon a wild fig tree [Gr sycomorea which was a tre in Syria and Egypt having the bigness and the leaves of a mulberry tree and fruit like figs but without kennel plin lib 13 cap 13 ] that he might see him for he was to pass by that way
\p
\v 5 . And then Jesus came to that place looking upwards he saw him and said unto him Zacheus make haste and come down for I must today abide in thine house [that is lodge as is expounded verse 7]
\p
\v 6 . And he made haste and came down and he received him with joy [Gr being glad]
\p
\v 7 . And all that saw it murmured saying that he is gone into a sinful man to lodge [Gr to unloose a phrase taken from unloosen of the horses being coming to inn]
\p
\v 8 . And Zacheus stood and said unto the Lord behold the halve of my good Lords I give to the poor and if I have deprived any man of anything by deceit [or have taken away by false and accusation see Luke3.14 have taken away by false information or accusation see Luke 3.14] I give that again four folds [namely according to the law of punishment for theft Exod 22.1,2 2 Samuel 12.6]
\p
\v 9 . And Jesus said unto him today is salvation happened in this house [that is household seeing that when the master of the family is also reckoned to be the covenant according to the promise Genesis 17.7 Acts 2.39 and 16.15, 31, 32,33 except that through their unbelief they rejected this grace] seeing that this man is also a son of Abraham [namely not only according to the flesh but also according to the promise Romans 9.8]
\p
\v 10 . For the son of man is come to seek and save for that which was lost
\p
\v 11 . And as they heard that he added and spake a similitude because he was nigh to Jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of God [namely which they imagined should be wordly kingdom should immediately be manifest
\p
\v 12 . He said therefore a certain noble man [man Gr bomo by this noble man he understands himself by the servant his disciples especially the teachers by these citizens and stiffnecked Jews by the land lying afar off from heaven by the pounds spiritual gifts by his return his last coming to judgment by the giving of cities and spiritual and eternal reward] traveled into a country lying afar off to receive for himself a kingdom and then to return
\p
\v 13 . And having called the ten servants he gave unto the ten pounds [Gr mna in Latin Mina which reckoned at sixty common sheckels or a hundred and twenty denarii or drachmes of silver see Ezekiel 45.12 and what a denarius is worth see Matthew 18.28 if we will understand with mina of gold then it is worth so much as old is more in value than silver] and said unto them negotiate till I come
\p
\v 14 . And his citizen hated him and sent his messengers after him saying we will not that this man the king over us
\p
\v 15 . And it came to pass when he came again when he received the kingdom that he said [that is commanded ] that the servants should be called unto him to he should give his money [Gr the silver ] that he might know what every one might gained by trading
\p
\v 16 . And the first came and saith Lord thy pound hath gained ten pounds besides
\p
\v 17 . And he said unto him well thou good servant seeing thou hath been faithful in the least thou hath the power [or command] over ten cities
\p
\v 18 . And the second came and said Lord thy pound hath gained [Gr made] five pounds
\p
\v 19 . And he said also unto him And thou be thou over five cities
\p
\v 20 . And another came saying Lord lo here thy pound which I had laid away in a napkin [or handkerchief or linen cloath]
\p
\v 21 . For I feared thee because thou art a severe man thou takest away that thou laidst not down and thou reapest that thou didst not sow
\p
\v 22 . But he said unto him out of thy own mouth shall I judge thee thou wicked servant thou knewest that I am a severe man taking away that I laid down and reaping that I did not sow
\p
\v 23 . Wherefore then didst not thy give my money into thy bank [Gr table that is to those that keep a table or bank to give out money on exchange or for gain ] and I coming might be able to ask he same with usury [that is gain not that the Lord commended unlawful usury [that is gain not that the Lord commendeth unlawful usury but that thereby he would teach that we ought to employ our gifts for the benefit and edification of our neighbor and for the glory of God see the like Matthew 25.27]
\p
\v 24 . And he said unto them that stood by him and give it to him that hath the ten rounds
\p
\v 25 . And he said unto him Lord he hath ten pounds
\p
\v 26 . And I say unto ye that to everyone that hath shall be given [this reason agrees not to the verse before but to the 24 verse whereof see Matthew 13.12] but from him that hath not from him shall be taken even that he hath
\p
\v 27 . But these mine enemies are[ hereby are understood the stiffnecked Jews which verse 14 are called his citizens and by their rebellion were become his enemies ]which would not that I should be kingdom over them bring hither and smite them dead [Gr slay them ]here before me
\p
\v 28 . And having said this he went away before them [or before to shew his willingness and readiness of undergoing his sufferings] and went up towards Jerusalem
\p
\v 29 . And it came to pass when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany [how far distant these places were from Jerusalem see Matthew 21.1] at the mount called Olive mount [Gr for the olives that he sent forth two of his disciples
\p
\v 30 . saying go your way into that town which is over against ye into which entering ye shall find a colt tied [namely of a she ass with his dam see Matthew 21.2 Mark 11.2 whereon no man ever sate unloose the same and bring it
\p
\v 31 . And if any one ask ye if ye loose that? Thus shall ye say unto him thus shall ye say unto him because the LORD needed of it
\p
\v 32 . And they that were sent forth being gone found it as he had said unto them
\p
\v 33 . And as they loosed the colt the masters of the same said unto them wherefore loose the colt?
\p
\v 34 . And they said the LORD hath need of it
\p
\v 35 . And they bought the same and [Gr led it] to Jesus and having cast their garments [that is upper garments or cloaks] they set Jesus thereon
\p
\v 36 . And as he went forward they [namely many of the multitude Mark 11.8] spread their cloathes under him on the way
\p
\v 37 . And when he now drew near to the descent of the mount of olives all the multitudes of the disciples [namely as well as they followed him as they that came out of Jerusalem to meet him John 12 verse 12, 13 ] began to rejoice and to praise God with a great voice because of all the mighty deeds [Gr the powers which they had seen
\p
\v 38 . Saying blessed is the King [see hereof Matthew 21.9]which cometh in the name of the Lord peace be in heaven and glory in the highest places that is God be pacified and reconciled unto mankind by the coming of this king and thereby glorified]
\p
\v 39 . And some of the Pharisees of the multitude said unto him master rebuke the disciples
\p
\v 40 . And he answering said unto them I say unto you that if these held their peace the stones will soon cry out
\p
\v 41 . And when he came near and saw the city and wept over it
\p
\v 42 . Saying o if thou also knewest even yet in this thy day [namely in which I know for the last time come unto thee and give thee warning for thy preservation and salvation this is an abrupt speech and to be completed how happy then shouldst thou be? Or somewhat the like] that which serveth for thy peace by now it is hid from thy eyes
\p
\v 43 . For there shall days come upon thee that thine enemies [namely the romances see the fulfilling hereof in Josephus de bello Jud lib 6] shall up a trench round about thee [or wall cast up of earth digged out] and shall compass thee round and distress thee on all sides.
\p
\v 44 . And shall cast thee down to the ground and thy children in thee [that is inhabitants as Matthew 23.37] and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another stone because that thou knewest not the time not the time of visitation [namely in which by the preaching of the gospel the grace of God is now offered unto thee.]
\p
\v 45 . And being gone into the temple he began to drive out them that sold in there
\p
\v 46 . Saying unto them it is written mine house [that is the temple] is a house of prayer but ye have made it a den of murders
\p
\v 47 . And he taught daily in the temple and the chief priest and the scribes and the rulers of the people [Gr the first or chiefest] sought to put him to death [Gr to destroy or ruine]
\p
\v 48 . And they found not what they should do for all the people hung upon him [Gr hung that is adhered to him of him or was very desirous to hear him] and heard him.
\c 20
\s Christ being asked by the chief priest and the Pharisees by what authority he did these things answereth by another question whence the baptism of John was ?1 threatens Gods judgment unto them by the similitude of a vineyard let out to husbandman which abused the servants of their Lord and killed his sons 9 answereth the question whether it were lawful to give tribute unto Cesar 20 proveth the resurrection of the dead out of the law of Moses against the seduces propounding seven brethren which had the self same wife successively 27 asketh how Christ is a son of David whereas David calleth him his Lord 41 warneth the people of ambition and hypocrisy of the scribes 45.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in one of those days as he taught the people in the temple and published the gospel [Gr evangelized] that the chief priest and the scribes with the elders came upon it
\p
\v 2 . And spake unto him saying tell us by what [Gr in what manner of] power [that is authority] thou dost these things? [Namely which are related in the former chapter] or who is that gave thee this power?
\p
\v 3 . And he answering said unto them I will also ask you one word [that is one thing or matter Hebrews] and tell it me
\p
\v 4 . The baptism of John [see hereof the annotations on Matthew 21.25] was that from heaven [that is from God as Luke 15.18] or of men?
\p
\v 5 . And they reasoned amongst themselves [or with themselves] saying if we say from heaven then he will say wherefore then did ye not believe him?
\p
\v 6 . And if we say of man then all the people will stone us for they hold it for certain that John was a prophet
\p
\v 7 . And they answered that they knew not whence that was [namely the baptism of John]
\p
\v 8 . And Jesus said unto them neither do I tell you by [Gr in] what power I do those things
\p
\v 9 . And he began to speak to the people this similitude [See the exposition of the similitude Matthew 21 .33] a certain man planted a vineyard and he let out husband men and departed for a long time [Gr sufficient or coven tent times] out of the land
\p
\v 10 . And when the times was [namely that the fruits being ripe are gathered in see Matthew 21.34] he sent to the husbandman a servant that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard but the husbandman beat him and sent him away empty
\p
\v 11 . And again he sent yet another servant [Gr and he added and sent Heb as also in the following verse] but having beaten and reproached fully handled him also they sent him away empty
\p
\v 12 . And again he sent yet a third but they wounded him also and cast him out
\p
\v 13 . And the Lord of the vineyard said what shall I do? [These are words expressing not any doubting but after the manner of man speaking a great inclination to bring them to the right as Hosea 5.4] I will send my beloved son it may be seeing him they will respect him
\p
\v 14 . But when the husbandmen saw him they reasoned among themselves and said this is the heir come and let us kill him that the inheritance may be ours
\p
\v 15 . And when they had cast him out without the vineyard they killed what therefore shall the Lord of the vineyard do unto them?
\p
\v 16 . He shall come and destroy these husbandman and shall give the vineyard to others [namely to the gentiles Matthew 21.43] And when they heard that they said that be far [namely that we should kill the son and that such a thing should come upon us as thou here saith]
\p
\v 17 . But he looked on them and said what is this then that is written the stone which the builders rejected [see the annotation on Matthew 21.42] the same is become an head of the corner
\p
\v 18 . Everyone that falleth on that stone [that is which stumble at him and are disobedient unto him 1 Peter 2.7,8] shall be broken and on whom it falleth [namely by the weight of the judgment and punishment Psalms 2.9] him shall he break to pieces
\p
\v 19 . And the chief priest and the scribes sought at that very hour to lay hands on him but they feared the people for they had understood that he had spoken this similitude against them
\p
\v 20 . And they observed him and sent forth spies [or layers of snares] which siegned themselves to be righteousness [that is as those that would deal uprightly with him and would not willingly do or suffer anything that was unjust and contrary to Gods command] that they might catch him [that is take or surprise or reprehend his speech] in his speech to deliver him over to the dominion and power of governor
\p
\v 21 . And they asked him saying master we know that thou speaketh and teacheth rightly and respectest not the person [Gr face see the exposition Matthew 22.16] but teacheth the way of God in truth
\p
\v 22 . It is lawful for us [namely we that are Jews and the people of God to an heathen emperour of this tribute see Matthew 17.24] to give tribute to ceasar or not?
\p
\v 23 . And he taking notice of their crastiness said unto them why tempt ye me?
\p
\v 24 . Show me penny [Gr Denarius whereof see Matthew 22.19] whose image and superscription hath it? and they answering saith Caesarsâ€™
\p
\v 25 . And he said unto them give therefore unto Cesar that which is Cesar and unto God that which is Gods
\p
\v 26 . And they could not catch him [or take lay hold or find fault with his word] in his word before the people and marveling at his answer they held their peace
\p
\v 27 . And there came to him some of the seduces [or the sect of the seduces see more at large Acts 23.8] who contradicting [namely the true doctrine of the article] say that there is no resurrection and asked him
\p
\v 28 . Saying master Moses wrote unto us [that is in his writing commanded us Deuteronomy 25.5] if any man brother die who hath a wife and he die without children that is his brother shall take the wife and raise up to seed his brother [that is beget a son by her which should bear the first brothers name and his heir ]
\p
\v 29 . Now were seven brethren and the first took a wife and he died without a child
\p
\v 30 . And the second took the wife and this also died without children
\p
\v 31 . And the third took the wife and the manner the seven also [that is to say the other four unto the seven]
\p
\v 32 . And at last after all the wife died also
\p
\v 33 . In the resurrection therefore whose wife of these shall she be? for those seven had the same to wife
\p
\v 34 . And Jesus answering said unto them the children of this world marry [by these are understood not worldly man as Luke 16.8 but those that live in this world for marriage is honourable among all Heb 13.4] and are given out in marriage
\p
\v 35 . But they that shall be counted worthy [namely by God of grace 2 Thessalonians 1.2,11 so this word is taken also in the following chapter verse 36] to obtain that world [that is everlasting life and the resurrection to glory in the world to come for the ungodly to arise also but the condemnation John 5.29] and the resurrection from the dead shall neither marry nor be given out in marriage
\p
\v 36 . For they cannot die anymore for they are little to the angels and they are children of God [namely manifested in glory seeing they are partakers of the blessed resurrection
\p
\v 37 . And that the dead shall be raised up even Moses [Christ proveth the resurrection of the dead out of the writings of Moses because the seduces had produced the same against it] set forth[or gave to understand shewed namely in the description of the appearing of the Lord in the thorn-bush] at the thorn-bush when he calleth the Lord the God of God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob[of the force of this consequences see Matthew 22.32]
\p
\v 38 . Now God is not a God of the dead but a God of the living for they all live unto him [namely not only according to the soul which is immortal but also according to the body because that shall be raised up again and with God all future things are as already present Romans 4.17]
\p
\v 39 . And some of the scribes answering said master thou hast said well
\p
\v 40 . And they durst [namely the scribes see Mark 12.34] no more ask him anything
\p
\v 41 . And h said unto them how says they that the Christ is Davids son?
\p
\v 42 . And David himself saith in the book of Psalms the Lord said unto my Lord sit at my right hand
\p
\v 43 . Until I shall have set thy enemies for a footstool of thy feet
\p
\v 44 . David therefore calleth him his Lord and how is he his son?[that is he be only a son of David that is a meer man from David how then doth David that was a sovereign king and acknowledged no Lord above him but God alone call him his Lord ? whereunto they could not answer because they held not the Messiah to be true God]
\p
\v 45 . And when al the people heard it he said unto his disciples
\p
\v 46 . Beware ye of the scribes which will walk in long garments [Gr stolas see Mark 12.38] and love salutations on the market and the foremost seat in the synagogue and the and the foremost places in fiests [Gr the suppers]
\p
\v 47 . Which cate up widows houses [that is the means wherewith they should sustain their families] and under a shew make long prayer these shall receive heavier [Gr more abundant] judgment [that is punishment in the judgment.]
\c 21
\s Christ commandeth the small gift of a poor widow 5 foretelleth the desolation of the temple and the city of Jerusalem 7 and relate the signs which shall precede the same 12 and the tribulations which should come upon his disciples against which he comforts them with his assistance and protection 20 Adviseth when the cit shall be besieged to a speedy flight to escape that grievous misery 25 foretells the signs of the last coming and exhorts by the similitude of the budding of the tree to take notice of the same 34 and to expect his coming with sobriety watching and prayer 37 teacheth the people daily in the temple
\p
\v 1 And looking up he saw the rich cast their gifts into the treasure chest [of this treasure chest see 2 Kings 12.9 Matthew27.6]
\p
\v 2 . And he saw also a certain poor widow cast thereinto two small pences [or very little ones see of the value of the same on Mark 12.42]
\p
\v 3 . And he said truly I say unto ye that this poor widow had cast in more than then all
\p
\v 4 . For they all have the abundance or over plus cast unto the gifts of God [that is unto the other gifts which were given and consecrated to God and kept in the treasure chest] but she of her want [that is of which is of that which wanted or had need for her to live upon] hath cast threinto all the livelihood which she had [Gr living see Matthew 12.44]
\p
\v 5 . And as some said of the temple, that it was adorned with beautiful stones, and oblations; [These were properly such gifts, which in the Temple were consecrated to God, and hanged up for ornament. See the like 2 Kings 11.10.] He said,
\p
\v 6 . As for these things, which ye behold, there shall be daies to come, in which not (one) stone shall be left upon (another) stone, which shall not be broken down.
\p
\v 7 . And they asked him saying, Master, when there shall these things be? And what is the sign when these things shall come to pass?
\p
\v 8 . And he said, see that ye not be seduced; for many shall come under my name, [Gr. in my name, i.e. falsify ascribing my name.] saying I am (the Christ) [Gr, I am, namely the Christ, is exprest Matth. 24.5.] And the time is coming: go not therefore after them.
\p
\v 9 . And when ye shall hear of wars, and commotions [Greek word signifies such commotions or confusion whereby nothing at all is left in state or place.] be not affrighted: For these things must first come to pass [namely, before the City and Temple of Jerusalem shall be laid waste] But (yet) the end is not presently.
\p
\v 10 . Then he said unto them; (one) Nation shall rise up against the (other) Nation, and (one) Kingdom against the (other) Kingdom.
\p
\v 11 . And there shall be great Earthquakes in divers place, and femine and pestilences: there shall also happen [Gr. be] terrible things and great signs from heaven. [See hereof the Jewish Historin Jos. De bello Jud. Lib.7 cap.12.]
\p
\v 12 . But before all these they shall lay their hands on you and persecute (you) delivering you over into the Synagogues [In which the faithfull were scourged also, as may be seen Act 5.40. and22. 19. and 26.11.] and prisons, and ye shall be drawn before Kings and Governors for my name sake
\p
\v 13 . And this shall come upon you [Gr. come down or descend, i.e. become tend] for testimony. [Namely, as well of the cruelty and stiffneckedness , as of your steadfastness in the confession of my name, and of the truth of my predictions.]
\p
\v 14 . Resolve therefore in your hearts [Gr. settle it, or set it therefore in your hearts] not to consider before hand (how) ye shall defend yourselves
\p
\v 15 . For I will give ye a mouth [That is, fitness and boldness in speaking by my spirit, See Nark 13.11.] and wisdome, which all that set themselves against you shall not be able to gain- say nor resist.
\p
\v 16 . And ye shall be delivered over [Or Betrayed] even of parents, and brethren, and kinsmen and friends: and they shall put (some) of to death.
\p
\v 17 . And ye shall be hated all [Namely, worldly men See John 15.18.] for my names sake.
\p
\v 18 . Yet not a hair of your heads shall perish. [That is, no man shall be able to hurt you in the least without the will of your heavenly Father. Like Phrases. See 1 Samuel 14.45. and 1 Kings.1.52.]
\p
\v 19 . Posses ye your souls in patience.
\p
\v 20 . But when you shall see that Jerusalem is compassed with armies, then know that her desolation is come nigh.
\p
\v 21 . Then they that are in Judea, let them flee to the mountains: and they that are in the midst of the same, let them depart out: and they that are in the fields, let them not come into the same. [Namely, to Jerusalem.]
\p
\v 22 . For these are the daise of vengeance [Namely, of God, upon the stiffneckedness of the Jewish people.] that all may be fulfilled which is written.
\p
\v 23 . But two [This word Christ useth, not threatening as he doth against the Pharisees Luke 11.42. &c but lamenting them by reason of the trouble which then should come upon them.] (to the women) that are with child and that give suck in those daise: for there shall be great distre in the Land, [Gr. on the earth] and wrath upon this people.
\p
\v 24 . And they shall fall by the edge, [Gr. the mouth] of the sword, and be carried away captives among all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles. Until the times of tha Gentiles shall be fulfilled. [Namely, appointed for the calling of the Gentiles Rom. 11.25. after the fulfilling whereof, those things shall come to pass which follow hereafter, or appointed for judgement and vengeance upon the Gentiles, when the measure of their sins shall be filled up.
\p
\v 25 . And there shall be signs in the sun, and Moon and Starrs, and on the earth, distress of Nations, with doubtfulness of the mind, when the Sea, and water-billows shall give great sound. [Greek, resound, or Echo.]
\p
\v 26 . And mens heart shall fail [Or men shall give up the Ghost, or be quite out if heart.] for fear, and for expectations of the things, which shall come upon the earth, [Gr. the inhibited, namely earth] for the powers of heavens shall be moved. [Namely up and down like the waves of the Sea. See Matth. 24.29.]
\p
\v 27 . And then they shall see the Son of man come in a cloud with great power [Gr. much] and glory. [namely in his heavenly Majesty, and accompanied with holy Angels. Matth. 25.31.]
\p
\v 28 . Now when these things begin to come to pass, then look on high [Or erect your selves, namely for the joy and longing, Mat. 24.33.] and lift up your heads, because your redemption is near; [namely your perfect deliverance from all the evil, Rom 8.23.]
\p
\v 29 . And he spake a similitude unto them, behold the fig-tree and all the trees.
\p
\v 30 . When they spring forth and yee see (that) yee know of your selves that the summer is now neer.
\p
\v 31 . Even so also when you shall see these things come to pass, know that the Kingdom of God [Namely of Glory. See 1 cor.15. 24. 2 Tim. 4. 18.] Is near.
\p
\v 32 . Verily I say unto you, that this generation [Namely of the Jewish people] shall in nowise pass away, until all shall come to pass.
\p
\v 33 . The Heaven and Earth shall pass away [See hereof 2 Pet. 3 10.] but my words shall in nowise pass away.
\p
\v 34 . And take heed to your selves , that your hearts be not in any time made heavy with gluttony and drunkenness and cares of this life, [Namely too great or immoderate, which hinder a man from watching for Christs coming] and that that day comes not (upon) you umaware.
\p
\v 35 . For as snare shall it come upon all those that are seated upon the whole Earth? [Gr. on the face of the whole Earth.]
\p
\v 36 . Watch therefore at all the times, praying that yee may be counted worthy, to escape all these things which shall come to pass [That is, all these judgement and miseries] and to stand before the Son of man. [that is, subsist and appear before him with boldness.]
\p
\v 37 . Now by day he was teaching in the Temple, but at night he went out, and abode all night on the Mount, called the (Mount) of Olives.
\p
\v 38 . And all people came to him early in the morning in the Temple for to hear him:
\c 22
\s 1 The Chief Priest and Scribes consult how they could put Christ to death, 3 Judas agrees with them to deliver him over, 7 Christ causeth the passeover to be prepared, 14 and eats the same with his twelve Apostles, 19 Afterward institutes his supper, 21 foretelleth the treachery of Judas, 24 admonisheth his disciples to take heed of ambition, and worldly domination, 28 promising them the communion of his Kingdom, 31 warneth the Apostles and especially Peter against the temptation of Satan,34 and foreteth him his fall, 35 and all the other Apostles their and his approaching troubles, 39 prayeth on the mount of Olives , and in his great distress is strengthened by an Angel, 45 exborteth his disciples who slept, to watching and prayer, 47 is by Judas betrayed with a kiss, 50 healeth the ear of a servant who was cut off, 54 is brought into high Priest house,where Peter denies him three times 61 whereof Christ looketh upon him, and he bewaileth his fall, 63 Christ is misused, and being set before the Jewish Council, acknowlegdeth that he is the son of God.
\p
\v 1 AND the feast of unleavened (bread) [Of this feast Exod. 12.14, and 23.14, etc.] called the Passover was nigh; [namely two daies after, Mat.26.2.]
\p
\v 2 . And the Chief Priest and the Scribes sought how they should make him away: for they feared people.
\p
\v 3 . And Satan entred into Judas [Namely not bodily, but by his stronger suggestions and instigation. See John 13.2, 27] which was surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.
\p
\v 4 . And he went his wayand spake with the chief Priests and the Captaines [That is the commanders of the soulders which kept the Temple without, see verse 52. Acts 4.1 and 5.24.26.] How he should deliver him over to them:
\p
\v 5 . And they were glad, and agreed that they should give him money. [Namely thirty silverlings, Mat. 26 verse 20.]
\p
\v 6 . And he promised it, and sought opportunity [Or fit time] to deliver him over unto them without uproar. [or without multitude, i.e. in the absence of the multitude which commonly followed him.]
\p
\v 7 . And the day of unleavened (bread) came, on which the Passeover must be killed. [Namely according to the Law on the fourteenth day of the first month, Exod. 12. v.6,18. which day Christ observed, but the Jews put it off unto the day following for the reason noted, Mat.26.verse 20.]
\p
\v 8 . And he sent forth Peter and John saying, Go your waies and make ready the passeover for us, that we may eat it.
\p
\v 9 . And they said unto, where wilt thou tat we prepare it.
\p
\v 10 . And he said unto them, Behold, when ye shall be entred into the City [Namely Jerusalem, where only the passeover was to be killed and eaten. See Deu 16.v.5.6.7.] there shall meet you a man, bearing a pitcher of water [or an earthen vessel] follow him into the house where he entreth in.
\p
\v 11 . And ye shall say to the father of the family [Gr. Lord of the house] of that house, the master saith unto thee [that is, causeth to be said to thee] where is the dining-room [Gr. unloosing] where I shall eat my passeover with my Disciples.
\p
\v 12 . And he shall shew you a great furnished [Gr. spread, i.e. prepared with Tables and with Couches on which lying used in former times to eat] upper room, there make it ready.
\p
\v 13 . And they going their way, found it as he had said unto them, and made the passeover.
\p
\v 14 . And when the hour was come [Namely on which the Paschal Lamb, was to be eaten, on the fourteenth day of the first Moneth, after sun setting: See Exod. 12.6. Deu. 16.6.] he sate down and the Twelve Apostles with him.
\p
\v 15 . And he said unto them, I have greatly desired: [Gr. with desire desired. An Hebrew phrase] to eat this passeover with you before I suffer.
\p
\v 16 . For I say unto you, that I will no more it thereof, until it shall be fulfilled [Namely that which was figured by the passeover, after which time we keep the spiritual passeover with Christ, 1 Cor.5.7.] in the Kingdome of God.
\p
\v 17 . And when he had taken a cup [This first cup seems to have been given by Christ for a conclusion of the Passover, after a custom the Jews, whereupon the institution of the supper immediately followed, in which after the distribution of bread, the cup was also distributed. See verse.19.20. and 1 Cor. 11.25.] and had given thanks, he said ,part it among you.
\p
\v 18 . For I say unto you, that I will not drink of the fruit of the Vine, until the Kingdome of God shall be come.
\p
\v 19 . And he took bread, and when he had given thanks brake it and gave it unto them saying, that is my body, [The exposition hereof, see Mat.26.26.] which is given for you [or given over, namely unto death] do that for remembrance of me:
\p
\v 20 . Likewise also the cup after the supper [Or supplying] saying, this cup [that is, this wine in the cup] (is) the new [ thus Paul joines the word is thereto, 1 Cor. 11.25.] Testament in my blood [That is a sign and a seal of the new Testament or Covenant, which is confirmed by the blood shedding of Jesus Christ, Heb.9.15,16,17.] which is shed for you. [that is, shall be, namely on the cross.]
\p
\v 21 . But behold the hand of him who betrayed me, is with me at the Table.
\p
\v 22 . And the Son of man goeth hence indeed, as it is concluded; [Gr. determined, namely the counsel and providence of God, Acts. 2.23. and 4.48.] but woe to that man, by whom he is betrayed. [or delivered, over]
\p
\v 23 . And they began to enquire one amongst another, which of them, it might be which should do that.
\p
\v 24 . And there was also contention amongst them, [Or strife, which seemes to be arisen, by reason that verse 18. Christ had spoken of the setting up of his Kingdome] which of them seemed to be [or should be esteemed to the greatest.
\p
\v 25 . And he said unto them: the Kings of the Nations [Or of the Gentiles] Lord is over them; [that is have and exercised worldly power, which is here forbidden the Ministers of the Church, 1 Peter 5.3.] and they that have the authority over them, are called bountiful. [Lords as now speak, gracious Lords i.e. great tittles are described to them.]
\p
\v 26 . But ye not so: but the greatest among you [That is, he that will be most esteemed among you, See Mat. 20.26.] let he be as the least; [Gr the younger, that is the youngest or last or least esteemed; for young persons for the reason of their youth, commonly have the less respect then the old] and he that is the leader, [that is, Lord or Master] as one that serveth.
\p
\v 27 . For who is greater? He that sitteth down [Namely at the Table] or that he serveth? Is not he that sitteth down? But I am in the midst of you as one that serveth.
\p
\v 28 . And ye are they that have abode continually with me in my temptations.
\p
\v 29 . And I ordain [That is, dispose, appoint or bequeath as by Testament, Heb. 9. 17.] unto you the kingdome, like as my Father hath ordained (it) me.
\p
\v 30 . That ye may eat and drink at my Table in my kingdome [That is, have communion joy and glory, as here ye have in my suffering and contempt, Rom. 8.7. 2Tim. 2, 11, 12] and sit on Thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. [See hereof Mat.19.28.]
\p
\v 31 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath greatly desired you [Or asked, or greatly sought] for to sit as wheat, [That is, to throw or shake you this way and that way, as the corn when it is winnowed sifted, without suffering you to have any rest, with one temptation upon another, 1 Pet. 5 8.]
\p
\v 32 . But I have prayed for thee that thy faith cease not, [Or fail not i.e. wholly perish, or be extinguished by the temptation of Satan who shall pursue thee. Thus he prayes also for all believers, John 17. 20. Rom. 8.32.] and thou when thou shall once be converted, strengthen thy brethren.
\p
\v 33 . And he said unto him Lord I am ready to go with thee, even unto prison, and into death.
\p
\v 34 . But he said, I say unto thee Peter, the Cock shall not crow to day, before thou shall thrice have denied that thou knowest me.
\p
\v 35 . And he said unto them, when I sent you forth, without purse, and scrip, and shoes, did you want anything? And they said nothing:
\p
\v 36 . He said therefore unto them, But now he that hath a purse let him take it, likewise also a scrip [That is, from henceforth, and hereafter when I shall send you forth a second time, such troubles shall purse you, that you must prepare yourselves to suffer much want, and to undergo many dangers in the administration of your office] and he that hath none [namely sword. Or he that hath no purse, or scrip, let him buy, &c. By which similitude Christ admonisheth he Apostles, that like as in a violent incursion and distress of enemies, every one is busy to provide himself of swords and other weapons to resist the Enemy: so they in the grievous times of persecution that are at hand, must provide themselves of spiritual weapons, thereby to make strong resistance, See 2 Cor. 10.4. Ephes. 6. 12. 1Tim. 1. 18. Which the Apostles then understood only of outward weapons as appears out of v. 38.] Let him set his garment, and buy a sword.
\p
\v 37 . For I say unto you that yet this which is written must be accomplished in me, namely, and he was reckoned with the Male factor; [Gr. the unrighteous] for even those things which (are written) concerning me have an end. [That is to come towards the end, to be speedily fulfilled.]
\p
\v 38 . And they said Lord, behold here two swords. And he said unto them, it is enough. [Namely spoken of the thing it self shall quickly shew of what swords I speak, John 18. 36.]
\p
\v 39 . And going out he departed as he wonâ€™t [Gr. according to custom] towards the Mount of Olives: and his disciples also followed him
\p
\v 40 . And when he was come, to that place, he said unto them, pray ye that ye come not into temptation.
\p
\v 41 . And he parted from them [Gr. he was pluckt away from them] about a stone cast, and kneeled down and prayed.
\p
\v 42 . Saying, Father thou wouldst take this cup away from me; [Otherwise thou wilt take away this cup from me. Of this prayer of Christ; see Mat.26.39.] yet not my will, but thine be done.
\p
\v 43 . And there was seen him an Angel from Heaven, which strengthened him.
\p
\v 44 . And being in a grievous conflict, [Or great anguish distress, as it is properly said of the perplexity which one hath before the conflict begin, which here in Christ was not so much because of the approaching bodily death, but by the reason of the burden of Gods wrath against the sins of men which he bare, Gal. 3 13. Heb. 5.7,8,9.] He prayed the more earnestly, and sweat was like great drops of blood, [The Greek word properly signifies drops of blood congealed, but is also taken for great thick drops] which ran down on the ground.
\p
\v 45 . And he was risen up from the prayer, he came to his disciples, and found them sleeping for sorrow.
\p
\v 46 . And he said unto them, why sleep yee? Arise and pray that ye come not into temptation.
\p
\v 47 . And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and one of the twelve which was called Judas, went before them And came nigh to Jesus to kiss him. [Namely according to the sign which he had before given them. Mat .16.48.]
\p
\v 48 . And Jesus said unto them, Judas, betrayest thou the son of man with a kiss.
\p
\v 49 . And they that were with him seeing what would happen, said unto him, Lord shall we smite with the sword?
\p
\v 50 . And one of them, [Namely Peter] smote the servant of the high Priest, [called Malchus, John 18. 10.] and cut off his ear.
\p
\v 51 . And Jesus answering said, suffer them (to be) even hitherto. And he touched his ear and healed him.
\p
\v 52 . And Jesus said to the Chief Priest and the Captaines of the Temple, and the Elders which were come against him, [Namely to some of them, which were sent forth by the rest to carry on this work, Mat 26.47.] are ye gone forth with swords and selves [Gr. woods] as against a murderer? [or high-way-robber.]
\p
\v 53 . When I was daily with you in the Temple, ye stretched not forth your hands against me? but this is your hour, and the power of darkness. [That is, the power that is given by God to the Divel, who is called a Prince of darkness, Ephes 6.12. and to his instruments over me, Col 1.13.]
\p
\v 54 . And they laid on him, and led (him away) and brought him into the High Priests house,[Namely first to Annas and afterwards to Cajaphas, John 18.13,24.] and Peter followed afar off.
\p
\v 55 . And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and they down together, Peter sate in the midst of them.
\p
\v 56 . And a certain maid-servant seeing him sit by the fire, [Gr. the light, i.e. fire, see v. 55 and Mark14.54.] and fixing her eyes upon him, said, this (man) also was with him.
\p
\v 57 . But he denied him saying, Woman, I know him not.
\p
\v 58 . And shortly, after another seeing him, said, thou also art of them; [Namely disciples of Jesus] But Peter said, man I am not.
\p
\v 59 . And when it was about an hour after, another confirmed (it) saying, In truth this (man) was also with him: for he also is a Galilean. [As appeareth by his speech Mat. 26.73.]
\p
\v 60 . But Peter said, man I no not what thou sayest. And immediately as he yet spake the Crock crowed. [Namely for the second time towards break of the day, See Mark 14.72.]
\p
\v 61 . And the Lord turning himself about, looked on Peter, and Peter remembered of the word of the Lord, how he said unto him, before the crock shall have crowed [That is, shall have made an end of his crowing] thou shalt deny me thrice.
\p
\v 62 .And Peter going out wept bitterly.
\p
\v 63 . And the men which held Jesus, mocked him, and smote (him.)
\p
\v 64 . And when they had covered him, they smote him on the face, and asked him saying, prophesie who is it that smote thee.
\p
\v 65 . And many other things they spake against him, blaspheming. [That is, blasphemously speaking of him and to him.]
\p
\v 66 . And when it was day there gathered together: [Namely the second time, to examine him more narrowly and deliver him to Pilate. Of the first assembling. See Mat. 26.57.] the Elders of the people. [Gr. the Eldership] and the Chief Priests, and the Scribes, and brought him unto their counsel. [Gr. Synedron, whereof see Mat.5.22.]
\p
\v 67 . Saying art thou the Christ? Tell us; [Or if thou art the Christ tell us] and he said unto them, If I tell it to you, ye will not believe it.
\p
\v 68 . And if I also ask, ye will not answer me or release me.
\p
\v 69 . From hence forth [Namely after that he being put to death, shall rise again from the dead, and ascend into heaven] shall the son of man set at the right (hand) of the power of God.
\p
\v 70 . And they all said, art thou then the Son of God: And he said unto them, yee say that I am. [Or yee say it, for I am so. See of this phrase Mat. 26.25.]
\p
\v 71 . And they said, what need have we any further witness? For us we have had it out of his (own) mouth.
\c 23
\s Christ is brought to Pilate, accused before him, and by him declared guiltless, 7 who sendeth him to Herod, who despiseth him, and sendeth him back again, 13 Pilate endea voureth to realize him, but by the hard pressing of the Jewes, he loooseth Barabbass, and delivereth Christ over to be crucified, 26 Simone of Cyrene beareth the cross after him. 27 The women of Jerusalem bewail him, to whom he foretells the mystery, which should come to them and their children. 32 HE is crucified between two murderers, and prayeth for his Enemies, 35 is reviled and mocked on the cross. 38 The superscription of the Cross. 39 One of the Malefactors revileth him, and the other is converted and comforted by Christ. 44 Darkness, comes upon the Earth, the wall of the Temple rendeth, and Christ giveth up the Ghost. 47 The Captain acknowledgeth that he is righteous, as also the multitudes. 50 He is buried by Joseph of Artmathea. 54 The women see where he is laid, and buy spices to anoint him.
\p
\v 1 AND the whole multitude of them [That is, the whole council, Luke 22.66.] arose and led him unto Pilate: [namely the Governmour for the Romans, of whom see Mat.27.2.]
\p
\v 2 .And they began to accuse him saying, we have that this (fellow) perverted the people, [Namely of the Jews] and forbiddeth to give tribute to the Ceaser, saying that he himselve is the Christ the King.
\p
\v 3 . And Pilate asked him saying: art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, thou saist it. [That is, yea, I am. See Mat. 26.25. John. 18. ver. 37.]
\p
\v 4 . And Pilate said unto the Chief Priests, and the multitudes, I find no fault [Gr. cause, namely, which should make him guilty of death] in this man.
\p
\v 5 . And they urged the more strongly [Or hardened themselves against it] saying, he stirreth up people, teaching throughout Judea, having from Galilee even hitherto.
\p
\v 6 . Now when Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether that man were a Galilean.
\p
\v 7 . And understanding that he was of Herods jurisdiction, [He was surnamed Antipas, a son of Herod the great, a Tetrarch over Galilee, who had caused Johnthe Baptist to be beheaded. See concerning him, Luke. 3. 1, 19.] he sent him away to Herod, [namely to keep the feast of the Passover with his people.]
\p
\v 8 . And when Herod saw Jesus he was very glad, for he had for a long time been desirous to see him, because he had heard much of him, and hoped to see some sign [That is, miracle : of meer desire of Novelty, which Christ would not cherish,] that should be done by him.
\p
\v 9 . And he questioned him with many words: but he answered him nothing.
\p
\v 10 . And the chief Priests and the Scribes [Namely which Pilate had sent with Christ unto Herod, ver 15.] stood and accused him vehemently.
\p
\v 11 . And Herod with his shoulders [Gr. armies, that is those of his guard] having despised [Gr. set at nought] and mocked him, put him on a glistering garment [Or gorgeous, such kind of garments as Kings and Princes used to wear, Gen 41. v 42. Esth 8. 15. which doth to scoffe at his Kingdome, as also the soulders did Mat.27.28. when they put him on a purple coat] and sent him back to Pilate.
\p
\v 12 . And on the same day Pilate and Herod became friends with one another: for before they were at enmity against each other.
\p
\v 13 . And when Pilate had called the chief Priests, and the Rulers, and the People, [Namely after that Herod had sent Christ again unto Pilate] he said unto them.
\p
\v 14 . Yee have brought this man unto me, as one that maketh the people averse, and behold I have examined (him) [The Greek word sometimes signifies rightly to question or examined. See the like Acts 12.19.] in your presence, and have found no fault in this man, concerning that wherewith yee accuse him
\p
\v 15 . Nor not yet Herod: for I sent you unto him, and lebell there is nothing done by him [Namely Christ, Others understand it of Herod: namely that he did nothing to Christ, whereby it might my appear that he judged him to be worthy of death] that is, scourged him as is expounded, John 19.1.] that is worthy of death.
\p
\v 16 . I will therefore chastise him [That is scourge him as is expounded, John 19.1.] and release him.
\p
\v 17 . And he must [Namely by a custome usual with the Jews. See Mat. 27.15. and Mark 15.6,8.] on the feast [ namely of the passeover. See John 18.38.] release one unto them.
\p
\v 18 . But all the multitude cryed out at once saying, away with this (man) [Gr. take away this (man) namely from the Earth, i.e. put him to death, as Acts 21. 38. and 22.22.] and unto us Barabas.
\p
\v 19 . Who for a certain uproar which was made in theCity, and (for) a murder, was cast into prison.
\p
\v 20 . Pilate therefore called unto (them) again, willing to release Jesus.
\p
\v 21 . But they cryed out against it, saying, crucifie, (him) crucifie him.
\p
\v 22 . And he said unto them the third time, what evil therefore hath this (man) done? I have found no guilt of death in him, I will therefore chastise him [That is, scourge him as ver. 16.] and set him free.
\p
\v 23 . But there were instant with great crying out [Gr. with great voices] requiring that he should be crucified, and the cries if them and of the chief Priests were more violent [that is, the longer, the stronger: prevailed more and more.
\p
\v 24 . And Pilate judged [Or gave way to them] that their demanded should be done.
\p
\v 25 . And he released to them him that for uproar and murder was cast into prison, whom they had required: but Jesus he delivered to their will. [Namely according to their will to be crucified by the soulders]
\p
\v 26 . And as they led him away, they took one Simon of Cyrene coming from the field and laid the cross upon him, [Namely after that Christ had born the same for a while. See hereof the annotation on Mat. 27. 32. and John 19.17.] that he should carry it after Jesus.
\p
\v 27 . And a great multitude of people and of women followed him, which [Namely women] also wept, and lamented him. [Gr. smote on their breasts, i.e. shewed themselves heavily afflicted.]
\p
\v 28 . And Jesus turning to them said, yee daughters of Jerusalem [That is, ye women which dwell in Jerusalem] weep not for me, [that is, not so much] but weep for your selves and for your children:
\p
\v 29 . For there comes daies, in which it shall be said; [Gr. they shall say] blessed (are) barren [namely because they shall not see such troubles on their children] the wombs which have not born, and the breast which have not given suck.
\p
\v 30 . Then shall they begin to say to the mountaines, [Namely out of great terrour and distress, as Hos.10.8. Revel. 6.16.] fall on us, and to the Hills, cover us.
\p
\v 31 . For if they do this o the green wood [Gr. moist, i.e. to me whom am innocent and righteous] what shall be done to the dry? [that is, what them shall befall the ungodly and guilty (persons) see the like 1 Pet. 4.17,18.]
\p
\v 32 . And there were also two others, being evil-doers led to put to death with him.
\p
\v 33 . And when they came on the place called Scul-(place) [The cause of this name, See Mat. 27.33.] they crucified him there, and the Malefactors, the one at the right and the other at the left (side.)
\p
\v 34 . And Jesus said, Father forgive it them, for they know not [That is, the greater part of them. For some of them knew it well, and sinned against the Holy Ghost Mat. 12.32.] what they do. [namely that they crucifie the true Messia, See Acts 3. 17. 1 Cor. 2.8.] And part his garments they cast the lot.
\p
\v 35 . And the people stood and beheld it: and the Rulers also with them, derided (him) saying, he delivered others, let him now deliver himself, if he be the Christ the chosen of God. [Namely, chosen of God to be the true Messias, 1 Pet. 1.20.]
\p
\v 36 . And the soulders also coming to (him) mocked him, brought him vinegar; [Namely the second time, whereof see Mat. 27.34,48.]
\p
\v 37 . And said, if thou art the King of the Jewes, deliver thy self.
\p
\v 38 . And there was also a superscription [Namely of his accusation, Mark 15.26.] written over him, [that is, over his head fastened on the cross, John 19.19.] with Greeks and Latine and Hebrew Letters, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWES.
\p
\v 39 . And one of the malefactors which were hanged, reviled him saying, if thou art the Christ deliver thy self and us.
\p
\v 40 . But the other answering rebuked him saying, dost thou not fear God, whereas thou art in the same judgement.
\p
\v 41 . And we truly justly: for we receive (punishment) worthy of that we have done; but this man hath done unfitting.
\p
\v 42 . And he said unto Jesus, Lord remember me, when thou shalt be come into thy Kingdome. [Namely of thy glory]
\p
\v 43 . And Jesus said unto him,; verily I say unto thee, today thou shalt be with me in Paradise. [That is, in heaven, 2Cor. 12.4]
\p
\v 44 . And it was about the sixth hour, [See for the reckoning of these hours, Mark 15. 25.] and there was darkness over all the Earth [or over all the Land] until the ninth hour.
\p
\v 45 . And the sun was darkened [See hereof Mat. 27.45.] and the vail of the Temple rent (thorow0 the midst [See Mat. 27.51.]
\p
\v 46 . And Jesus crying with a great voice said, father unto thy hands I commend [ Or I will commend, i.e. give in keeping as a pawn that is instructed with any man, to deliver it again in due time] my spirit. [That is, my soul] And when he had said that, he gave up the Ghost.
\p
\v 47 . Now when the Centurion saw what happened, he glorified God [Namely, publickly confessing that Christ was innocent and the Son of God, seeing God had given such clear signs of it, Mat. 27.54.] and said, truly this man was righteous.
\p
\v 48 . And all the multitudes which were come together to behold this, seeing the things which were done, returned smiting upon their breasts. [Namely in token of sorrow and astonishment]
\p
\v 49 . And all his acquaintance stood afar off, also the women had followed him from Galilee, and beheld this.
\p
\v 50 . And behold a man called Joseph, being a Councelour, a good and righteous man,
\p
\v 51 . (He had not consented into their counsel and dealing) of Arimathea, a City of the Jewes, and who also himself looked for [Or received, embraced] the Kingdome of God.
\p
\v 52 . He went unto Pilate and desired the body of Jesus.
\p
\v 53 . And when he had taken the same down, he wound it in a fine linnem-coth, and laid it in a grave hewn in a rock, wherein never yet any man was laid.
\p
\v 54 . And it was the day of preparation [Gr. the day was the preparation, namely of the Sabbath, and likewise of the passeover of the Jewes, see Mark 15.42. John19.14.] and the Sabbath come on. [Gr. lighted on, i.e. began to break with the rising of the stars. For with the Jewes the day took his beginning from the setting of the sun, and was reckoned from the one evening to the other.]
\p
\v 55 . And the women also, which came with him out of Galilee followed after, and beheld the grave and how his body was laid.
\p
\v 56 . And being returned thy prepared spices and ointments, and they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment. [Namely, according to the fourth commandments, Exod. 20.10.]
\c 24
\s 1 The women go to the sepulcher, and find the same empty 4 two Angels declare unto them the resurrection of Christ, 9 which they go and tell the Apostles and other Desciples, who do not believe it, 12 Peter runneth forth to the grave. 13 Christ revealeth himself to the two Desciples going towards Emmaus, and is there know to them in breaking of bread, 33 who return to Jerusalem, and relate it to the Apostles, 36 Christ himself appears to all his Apostles, sheweth them his hands and feet, and eateth in their presence, 44 opened to them the meaning of the Scriptures, appointeth them to be his witnesses among all people, and promiseth the his holy Spirit, 50 blesseth them, takes his leave of them, and acsendeth to heaven.
\p
\v 1 AND on the first (day) [Gr. one] of the week [Gr. of the Sabbaths. See Mat. 28.1. Mark. 16. 2] very early in the morning, [see hereof the annotation on Mark. 16.2. Gr. deep in the morning] they went to the grave, carrying the spices which they had prepared, and some with them. [namely, other women of whom see further v.10.]
\p
\v 2 . And they found the Stone rolled away from the grave.
\p
\v 3 . And being entred in they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
\p
\v 4 . And it came to pass as they were doubtful about it, [Or very troubled] behold two men [i.e. Angels in the shape of men, see Mat 28.2. who makes mention but of one because he spake to them] stood by them in shining garments. [Gr. lightning, i.e. glistering like lightning.]
\p
\v 5 . And as they were greatly afraid and bowed the face towards the Earth, they said unto them. What seek ye the living with the dead?
\p
\v 6 . He is not here, but he is risen. Remember how he spake unto you [Whereof see Mat. 26.21.] while he was yet in Galilee:
\p
\v 7 . Saying the Son of Man must be delivered over to sinfull men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.
\p
\v 8 . And they remembered his words.
\p
\v 9 . And being returned from the grave, they told all these things to the eleven, and to all the other. [Namely disciples, which were there gathered together.]
\p
\v 10 . And (these) were Mary Magdalen and Mary (the mother) of James and Joanna; [See concerning this Joanna, Luke 8.3. and Mary (the mother) of James [Namely the less. See Mark. 15.40.] and the other with them, which said this to the Apostles
\p
\v 11 . And their words seemed before them as idle talk. [Or madness dotage] and they believed them not.
\p
\v 12 . But Peter rising up ran to the grave [Namely with John. See John 20.3] and stooping down he saw the linen clothes lying alone, and away, wondering with himself at that which happened.
\p
\v 13 . And behold two of them [Namely not of the Apostles but of the other Disciples, as appears v. 18, 33.] went on that same day towards a village that was sixty furlongs from Jerusalem. [a furlong is an hundred pieces, so that eight furlongs make an Italian mile ; whereof three about an hours going, so that sixty furlongs make about two hours going and halt] whose name was Emmaus.
\p
\v 14 . And they spake together one with another, of all those things that had happened.
\p
\v 15 . And it came to pass while they spake together, and questioned with one another, that, Jesus himself came to (them) and with them.
\p
\v 16 . And their eyes were held [That is, withheld by the power Christ] that they knew him not. [or that they should not know him.]
\p
\v 17 . And he said unto them what discourses are these, which yee walking change with one another; and whereof are ye sad. [or sowre]
\p
\v 18 . And the one whose name was Cleophas, answering said unto him, art thou a stranger at Jerusalem [Or an inhabitant] and knowest not the things, which in these daies are come into pass therein?
\p
\v 19 . And he said unto them, which? And they said, the things concerning Jesus the Nazarite, who was a Prophet [Gr. a man, a Prophet] mighty in works [Gr. in deed, or in work and in word] and words, before Gode [Namely who witnessed thus much of him by many miracles] and all people. [namely who heard and saw this administration and commendation.]
\p
\v 20 . And how our chief Priests and Rulers delivered him over to the judgement of death, and have crucified him.
\p
\v 21 . And we hoped that he it was that we should redeem [That is, should have redeemed] Israel; [that is, the people of Israel or of the Jews] yea also, together with all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.
\p
\v 22 . But also some of us [That is, of our company] disturbed us, who early in the morning were at the grave.
\p
\v 23 . And not finding his body, they came and said, that they had also seen a vision of Angels which say that he is alive.
\p
\v 24 . And some of them that are with us, went away to the grave, and found it so even as also the women had said but him they saw not.
\p
\v 25 . And he said unto them O yee ignorant. And slow of heart, to believe all that which the Prophets have spoken.
\p
\v 26 . Must not the Christ has suffered these things, and (so) enters into his glory. [Namely after or by his suffering, Heb.2.9. 1 Pet.1.11.]
\p
\v 27 . And having began from Moseh and all the Prophets, he interpreted unto them all the Scriptures, that which was (written) of him.
\p
\v 28 . And they came near to the village whereunto they went, and he carried himself, [Or put himself into such a posture; which was done without dissembling to try them: seeing he would have done the same, except they had held him with entreaty] as if he would go further.
\p
\v 29 . And they constrained him [Namely with entreaty and pressing, See Gen. 33.11.] saying, abide with us, for it is neer the evening, and the day is declined. And he went in to abide with them.
\p
\v 30 . And it came to pass as he set down with them, he took the bread and blessed it [Namely by prayer and thanksgiving, 1Tim. 4.4, 5.] and when he had broken it [namely after the manner of the Jews in the beginning of their meals whose loaves were baked, that they could conveniently be broke, Acts 2.46.] he gave it to them.
\p
\v 31 . And their eyes were opened, and they knew him: and he got away out of their sight. [Gr. and ha became disappearing from them, i.e. he withdrew himself suddenly from their sight.
\p
\v 32 . And they said to one another, was not our heart burning in us, when he spake to us on the way, and when he opened [Or expounded or interpreted] unto us the Scripture.
\p
\v 33 . And they rising up the same hour returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those that were with them.
\p
\v 34 . Who said [Namely the eleven and they that were with them] the Lord is truly risen, and was seen of Simon.
\p
\v 35 . And they related that which happened on the way, and how he was made known to them in the breaking of bread.
\p
\v 36 . And as they spake of these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and said unto them, peace be unto you.
\p
\v 37 . And they being frightened and sore afraid thought that they saw a Ghost. [That is, an apparition, see Mat. 14.26: Or an Angel in human shape, Acts. 12. 9.]
\p
\v 38 . And he said unto them, what are you troubled? And why does (such) reasoning arise in your heart?
\p
\v 39 . Behold my hands and my feet: for it is my self: [Or that is I my self] feel me and see, for a spirit hath no flesh and bones: as ye see that I have.
\p
\v 40 . And as he said this, he shewed them (his) hands and (his) feet.
\p
\v 41 . And when they yet for joy believed it not, and wondred, he said unto them, have ye here anything for to eat? [Gr. eatable]
\p
\v 42 . And they gave him a piece of roasted fish, and of an bony-comb.
\p
\v 43 . And he took it and ate it before their eyes. [Not that he had need of this, seeing he was now become immortal: but to assure them that he had still the same body. See Acts 10.v 41.]
\p
\v 44 . And he said unto them, these are the words which I spake to you, while I was yet with you, [That is, converted publickly, and continually, with you before my death] (namely) that it must all be fulfilled, that is written concerning me in the Law of Moses, and the Prophets and the Psalmes.
\p
\v 45 . Then opened their understanding [Namely, by the illumination of his holy spirit, Acts 16.14. 1Cor. 2.13.] that they might understand the Scriptures.
\p
\v 46 . And said to them thus it is written, and thus ought the Christ to suffer, and arise from the dead the third day.
\p
\v 47 . And repentance and forgiveness of sins be preached in his name among all the Nations, beginning from Jerusalem. [Forasmuch as the Messiah was promised principally to the Jews, Rom. 1.16. and the Gospel was to go forth out of Sion and Jerusalem, Isa. 2.3.]
\p
\v 48 . And yee are witnesses of these things.
