\mt2 THE EPISTLE OF THE APOSTLE PAUL TO THE
\mt ROMANS
\s The Argument of this EPISTLE
\p THIS Epistle was written by the Apostle Paul from Corinth, to the church of Christ at Rome, to confirm in the doctrine of the Holy Gospel, against all Errours, Schisms and offences that rose up: and contains in it a short and exposition of the principal Articles of the Christian Religion, and all the benefits which in and through Christ we receive from God. Wherefore this Epistle is rightly accounted a key for the right understanding of all the Holy Scriptures; and especially for the right understanding of the fulfillment of the promise made to the people of Israel by Moses and the Prophets, for salvation both of Jews and Gentiles. And it had three parts (as also all the following Epistles) First an Introduction to the 16 verse. Secondly the handling of doctrine, from the 16 verse of the 1 chapter up to the 14 verse of the 15 chapter. Thirdly, the conclusion of the Epistle, from thence to the end. The handling of the doctrine salvation again hath several members. 1. Of mans justification before God, not by works but by faith in Jesus Christ, he treats from the 16 verse of the 1 chapter, unto the beginning of the 5 chapter. II. Of sanctification or renovation of man, he treats from the beginning of the 6 chapter, unto the beginning of the 7 in which he describes the Scribes in which they that are already renewed, still have against the flesh, as in the 8 chapter the victory which the regenerate by the Spirit have over the flesh, and the comfort and the assurance of their salvation which they obtain hereby, even in the midst of all crosses and persecution. III. Of Gods eternal Election, as the original and the fountain of all these benefits, He treats in the 9 chapter to the 24 verse of the same. IV. And from thence forward of Gods powerful calling according to this election, as well of Gentiles as Jews, unto the end of the 11 chapter. Upon which occasion he also treats of Reprobation, betwixt both. In the following 12.13,14,15. chapters he treats of the duties of love and of thankfulness, which we owe unto God for these benefits, as well in respect of obedience of Gods commandments in general in the 12 and 13 chapters, as in respect of the right use of indifferent things, and of bearing with those who are yet weak of the Christian Liberty, in the 14 chapter and in the 13 first verses of the 15 chapter. From whence follows the conclusion of this Epistle, consisting of an excuse of his boldness in writing and admonishing, with a promise of his coming unto them, and divers salutations to certain persons: and lastly with a thanksgiving and prayer unto God for them. So that the Apostle in handling of the doctrine, holds the same Order, which is held in the Catechism of the Reformed Churches.
\c 1
\s 1. The introduction of this Epistle, in which is declared who is the writer of the same, namely Paul, who briefly sets off his office, calling, doctrine of the person of Christ: 6 the persons to whom he writes with a commendation of their faith. 9 The inclination that he hath come unto them, to preach the Gospel unto them as well as others, to strengthen them, he strengthened by them. 16 Afterwards he propounds the true doctrine of mans justification before God by faith: and proves the same by a place of the Holy Scripture. 18 He confutes the perverse opinions of others, and proves that the Gentiles by the light of nature cannot be justified by God, 19, Forasmuch as they suppress that light, and abuse the knowledge which they have of God unto idolatry, 24 wherefore they were given over into a perverse sense. 29 and were full of abominations in their lives; which he relates in a long Catalogue.
\p
\v 1 Paul [Why Paul, who before was called Saul, held the name of Paul in all his Epistles, see the reason thereof in the annotations on Acts 13.9.] a servant of Jesus Christ, a called Apostle, [Or called unto an Apostle: which Title he gives himself, to straightaway in the beginning that the exhortations which he gives Romans in this Epistle, were made according as his calling requires. See Acts 9.15. 2 Cor.5.14.19] separated [namely, even from his mothers womb in Gods purpose Gal.1.15. and afterwards actually by the command of the Holy Ghost, to publish the Gospel amongst the Gentiles. Acts 13. 2.] unto the Gospel of God, [Namely, to preach the same.]
\p
\v 2 . (Which he had promised before by his Prophets, in the Holy Scriptures) [Namely, of the Old Testament.]
\p
\v 3 . Of his Son (who became [or was born as Gal.4.4.] of the seed of David [That is, postering] according the flesh: [that is, according to his humane nature, John 1. 14. 1. Tim.3. 16.]
\p
\v 4 . Who was powerful [Gr. In power or with power] showed [or declared. Gr. Defined] to be the Son of God, according to the Spirit [that is, according to the divine nature, which is also called an eternal Spirit, Heb.9.14. See also 1 Tim .3.16. and 1 Pet. 3. ver. 18. ] of sanctification [or of holiness, i.e. which is holy in himself, and by his merit and power maketh us holy Heb. 2. 11.] (by the resurrection of the dead) [that is, in that he raised up himself from the dead, John2. 19.21. and 10.18.] (namely) Jesus Christ our Lord:
\p
\v 5 (By whom we have received grace, and the Apostleship; or grace for conversion, and besides that, the Apostleship] unto obedience of faith among all the Gentiles, [that is, to bring the Gentiles, to the obedience of Christ, and to faith, Acts 26.16. etc.] for his name. [That is, that the name of Christ should be known to them and be glorified by them. Or in, of his name, 2 Cor.5.20.]
\p
\v 6 . Amongst whom [Gr. In] ye are also, the called of Jesus Christ) [That is, who not only by the word outwardly, but also by the power of Christ inwardly, are called and come unto the communion of Christ, and beloved of God. See Rom.8.28. and 1 Cor.1.2. For although in this Church also like a. Whereof also in the following verse he calleth them believers, Saints s in others, there might be hypocrites, yet nevertheless he always names them in the beginning of his Epistles, as charity requires, from the best part amongst them.]
\p
\v 7 . To all that are at Rome, beloved of God [Or by God, 1 John4.10.19.] and called Saints: grace be to you and peace [under these two words according to the phrase of the Hebrews is contained all spiritual and corporal welfare: and by the word grace is understood the original and fountain of all Gods benefits towards us, and by the word peace the fruits and sense thereof. See Psalm 63.4. John 16.33. Rom. 5. 1. Phil. 4. 7.] from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 8 . First I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is published in the world. [That is, is reported and made known in the whole world: a figurative phrase, which notwithstanding is not without ground here, forasmuch as there came out of all quarters or the world to Rome, who could relate this each in his own country.]
\p
\v 9 . For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit [Or with my spirit, i.e. with my whole heart] in the Gospel of his Son [that is, in publishing of the Gospel as ver.1.] how I remember you without omission,
\p
\v 10 . Always in my prayers beseeching, if possibly yet at any time good opportunity may be given me [Or, if yet at any time, a prosperous journey may be given me by the will of God, that I may come unto you] by the will of God [Gr. In the will of God. He adds this, because in spreading abroad of the Gospel he followed the order, which God by his spirit prescribed him, Acts16.7.9.10.] to come unto you.
\p
\v 11 . For I long to see you, that I might impart unto you the spiritual gift, to the end that you might be strengthened.
\p
\v 12 . That is, to be comforted together among, [Or, exhorted: for the Greek word signifies both, and both may be applied to Paul, seeing even the Angels themselves by the Church of God get further knowledge and experience of the manifold wisdom of God. Ephes.3.10. 1 Pet. 1. 12.] by the mutual faith, as well yours as mine.
\p
\v 13 . But I will not it be unknown unto you, Brethren, that I have many times purposed to come unto you, and have been hindered hitherto) [namely, either through troubles which happened, or by Gods command, as Acts16.7.] that I might have some fruit [namely, of my ministry, and calling to be an Apostle of Christ, or left to confirm in their faith more and more] among you also, like as also among the other Gentiles.
\p
\v 14 . Both to Greeks and Barbarians, [Under these two first all sorts of Gentiles are understood, Acts 28.2. and by wise and unwise all kinds of men in particular amongst the Greeks or Barbarians, and it seems that Paul would thereby procure the favour of the Romans, because they accounted themselves the acutest and wisest of all men] both to wise and to unwise am I a debtor, [that is, I am bound by verture of my calling, to preach the Gospel.]
\p
\v 15 . So what is in me, is very ready [Or what concerns me, I am very ready] to publish the Gospel to you also that are at Rome.
\p
\v 16 . For I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ:[Or I dread not, i.e. seek not to discharge or withdraw myself from publishing of the Gospel, as men do from things whereof they are ashamed] for it is a power of God unto salvation, to everyone that believeth [that is, a powerful means ordained by God for his purpose, as 1 Cor. 1.v.18.] first to the Jew, for the Gospel was first for the Jews, and afterwards to the Gentiles, Acts 13.v.46.] and also to the Greeks.
\p
\v 17 . For the righteousness of God [That is, the righteousness whereby we can stand before the judgment seat of God, which is only the righteousness of Christ, which is freely given, and by faith imputed to us by God] is revealed in the same from faith to faith, [that is, for daily increase, and strengthening in faith. See the like 2 Cor, 3.18.] as it is written, but the just shall live by faith. [or the just by faith shall live, which also agrees well with the Hebrew Text, Heb.2.v.4. and with the scope of Paul here.]
\p
\v 18 . For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven, [That is, the judgment which God sends from Heaven, as is further expressed, ver.24.26,28. which are not sent but upon the unrighteous persons] upon all ungodliness [whereby are understood all sins repugnant to the first Table, which are rehearsed in some verses following] and unrighteousness of men [hereby are understood the sins against the second Table, which are rehearsed from the 29 verse onward] (as) they that keep under, [that is, suppress offering violence to their own minds, seeing they know better than they act] the truth [that is, the knowledge of God and his honour which he hath revealed to men by nature itself, as appears from the following verse] in unrighteousness. [that is, contrary to all right and equity, which requires that men give that which belongs to him.]
\p
\v 19 . For as much as that which is knowable of God, [Namely, as much as a man can know of God, without Gods word, by nature] is manifest in them, [that is, in the inmost of their minds: Or among them, i.e. among their wise and learned men, who have left very many clear and wise sentences and discourses hereof in their writings, although they themselves did contrary thereunto] for God hath revealed it into them. [namely, partly, by the Law of nature in their consciences, John 1.9. partly, by holding of Gods creatures, whereby his properties are as it felt, Psa. 19.2. and 148. v. 4. 5, 6. Acts 14. 15. and 17. 24, etc.]
\p
\v 20 . For his invisible things [That is, divine properties] from the Creation of the world, are by the creatures [Gr. makements, or things made] understood and thoroughly seen, both his eternal power [hereby is understood the property of God, whereby all things were created, and had their beginning, which therefore, as also his essence must needs be eternal, because it was before all things, and a cause of all things] and Godhead, [hereby he understands the other properties of Gods Majesty, the footsteps and representations whereof are apparent in Gods creatures, as his goodness, wisdom , righteousness, etc.] that they might not be executed. [Gr. Might be inexcusable. Or so that they are not been excused: namely, before Gods righteous Judgment, as if they had not known what they ought to have done.]
\p
\v 21 . Because they knowing God, [Namely, in such manner as is before declared] glorified or gave (him)not thanks to God, [namely, as belong to his divine Majesty, even according to the knowledge they had of him] but became in their reasoning, [that is, they fell by their reasoning to the vain imaginations of God and of his worship, and ordered them not according to the knowledge which they had of God, but according to the inclination of their corrupt senses, in inventing vain worshipping of God and in saining of many fabulous and vain Gods, whereby the knowledge of God was more and more obscured amongst them] and their foolish heart was darkened.
\p
\v 22 . Giving themselves out for wise, [This he speaks of their learned men or Philosophers, who would have a show of wisdome, and sometimes indeed seemed to think and speak better, but nevertheless in act, foolishly imitated the perverseness and vanity of others, 2 Kings 17.29.] they become fools.
\p
\v 23 . And changed their glory of incorruptible God, [That is, who not only in essence but also in properties is unchangeable] into the likeness of an image of a corruptible man, and fouls, and four footed, and creeping (beast.) [or exchanged for similitude. [that is, for an image that is made after the similitude of a mortal man, yea even of fowls, etc. See Lev.27.10. Psal. 106. 20. Jer. 2.11. For that all these sorts of Idolatry were usually among the Gentiles, is manifest by their writings, See also Deu. 4.15. etc.]
\p
\v 24 . Therefore [Namely, for this Idolatry and dishonor which they did thereby unto God. See Psa. 106.20. Isa. 40.17,18. etc.] God also gave them over [that is, restrained not their evil desires, but let them have their swing, Psa. 81.13. Acts 14.16. and by his just judgment stripped them more and more of his gift which they despised and abused, Mat. 25.28. forsaking them gave them to Satan, who tempted and seduced them unto all wickedness, 1 Samuel 16.15. Mat.6.13.] in the lusts of their (own) hearts [v. 26. the same is rendered, unto dishonourable affections, not that God worked such dishonourable affections, for they are not of God, Jam.1.13. 1John 2.16. See hereof more at large, the annotations next before] unto uncleanness, to dishonour their bodies, one amongst other. [or in themselves]
\p
\v 25 . (As) who changed into a lye [Or exchanged, lying fictions of vain Gods and worships of Gods] the truth of God, [that is, the knowledge which they had of God. See v.18.] and honoured and served the creature above the Creator, [that is, more than the Creator himself, which sometimes indeed, but very little, they worshipped together with Idols, Acts 17.v.23. Or else passing by the Creator, whom the greater part of them neither knew or worshipped, Gal. 4.8.] who is to be praised for ever. Amen.
\p
\v 26 . Therefore God gave them over to dishonourable affections [Gr. Affections of dishonour, i.e. dishonourable or shameful affections. For as 1 Thes. 4.4,5. we are exhorted to posses a vessel of honour, that is, to withhold our bodies from uncleanness, so they that give themselves to uncleanness, they dishonour themselves and their bodies, 1 Cor.6.18. especially they that then committed such sins as are not to be named, whether they did it or suffered it] for their women also changed the natural use, into the (use) contrary to the nature.
\p
\v 27 . And likewise also the men leaving the natural use of women, were heated in their lust towards one another, men with men committing shamefulness, and receiving in them the recompense of their error which belonged (thereunto) [that is, the just punishment of their idolatry, or the reward. For idolatry which is spiritual where dome, is commonly punished by God with corporal, as we commonly see those two sins reign with one another. See Num. 25.1,2. Rev. 17.1,2, etc.]
\p
\v 28 . And even as it seemed not good unto them to hold [Gr. To have] God in acknowledgement, [namely, which they had received from the Law of nature, and beholding the things created, v. 20.] so God gave them over unto a perverse sense, [Gr. To a sense without right judgment, or a reprobate sense, i.e. which doth not prove nor discern good from evil, honest from dishonest] to do things which are not becoming.
\p
\v 29 . Being filled with all unrighteousness, [Here begin to be related, the sins which reigned among the Gentiles contrary to second Table of the Law, whereof unrighteousness is the fountain, from whence the rest as streams of flow] fornication, wickedness [or naughtiness] covetousness , illness, full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, ill-naturedness. [that is, perverseness of senses, when men take all things iu the worst part.]
\p
\v 30 . Whisperers, back-biters, [Gr. Speakers-against] haters of God. But seeing here is spoken of the reigning sins of the Gentiles, it is better taken in that sense, as Rom. 8.7. the wisdome of flesh is called enmity of God, who love that which hateth, and hate that which God commanded, Exod. 20.6.] revilers [that is, who do reproach or injure others in words or deeds] proud, self-conceited, [or vain-glorious, boasters,] finders out of evil things, disobedient to parents.
\p
\v 31 . Without understanding, Covenant-breakers, without natural love, [The Greek word signifies the affection or love which is betwixt parents and children. The sin also reigned among the Heathen, who sacrificed their children to Idols, exposed them for foundlings, made them away, without transgressing against the Laws] irreconcilable, unmerciful.
\p
\v 32 . Who were as they know the right of God, [that is, whereas a difference between good and evil, is implanted in their nature by God, and a sense of punishment which God will execute upon evil, Rom.2.14,15.] (namely, that they which do such things are worthy of death) not only do the same, but also take pleasure together in them that do same. [this the highest decree of wickedness, not only to do evil, but also to sake delight in this, that other does the same.]
\c 2
\s 1. Paul confutes on oblection of those that thought they were thereby righteous, because they did not openly commit such abominable sins, but condemned the same in others. 3 and who thought that they stood in the favour of God, because he did them good and blessed them in this world. 5 Contrarily declares that God shall judge all men without respect of persons, not according to their outward appearance or condition, but according to their works as well inward as outward. 12 And that as well the Jews who had the Law as the Gentiles who had not the written Law. 17 He takes from the Jews the opinion that they should be justified by the knowledge of the Law, and instructing the others in the same. 25 Or by circumcision and other outward advantages which the Jews had above the Gentiles, 27 teaching which are the right Jews, and the right circumcision.
\p
\v 1 There fore [Namely, seeing thou knowest Gods O man, whosoever thou art judges (others)[that is, reprehends, rebukes, or else punishes. Hereby the Apostle understand such among the Heathens, who were Judges among them, or those that held a stricter life, as some Philosophers did, and thereby seemed to condemn the doings of others: whereas not withstanding they were inwardly full of hatred, envy, pride, etc. and in secret committed the same sins, when they could hide from men, as also the Pharisees (did) amongst condemn thy self: for thou that judges (others) dost the same. [namely, inwardly or secretly.]
\p
\v 2 . And we know [That is, it is evident, even according to the common opinion of all men] that the judgment of God is according to truth, [that is, upright, not according to the outward show, but according as the thing is indeed] upon them that do such things.
\p
\v 3 . And thinkest thou O man who judges them that do such things, and dost the same [Namely, albeit that thou dost them secretly, or not as imputently as others] that thou shall escape the judgment of God?
\p
\v 4 . Or despisest thou the riches [That is, the greatness and multiplicity. Here he confutes those that thought their matters stood not ill with God, because God did them good, and blessed them as the world, as he did the Romans in an especial manner at that time] of his goodness [this is a property of God, whereby he blessed and doth good, yea even to them that are evil, Mat.5.45.] and forbearance, [namely, whereby he with connivance overlooks the sins of men for a time, (to see) whether they will yet repent, Luke 3.7,8, etc.] and long suffering, [whereby he defers the punishment which they deserve until the measure of the same is fulfilled, Rom. 9.ver.22.] not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance. [that is, gives thee time and reason to repent.]
\p
\v 5 . But after thy hardness [That is, being hardened in thy sins] and impenitent heart, gatherest thou to thy self wrath as a treasure, [ that is, provokes more and more the wrath and judgement of God, as a treasure to which men always daily add more and more] in the day of wrath, and of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God: [that is, against the last day, when God shall make manifest before every one, and punish the sins of men, even those that are secret, v.16. 2 Thes. 1.7. Rev. 20 v12, 13.]
\p
\v 6 . Who shall recompense every one according to his works: [He speaketh here of recompensing according to the promises and threatening of the Law, which were known to the Gentiles also by nature, v. 15, for of justification by faith he begins first to speak, Rom. 3.21. However this may well be applied also to recompensing according to the promises and threatening of the gospel, as 2 Cor. 5.10. it is so said in general: for as much as good works as fruits of faith, of grace, for Christ’s sake shall also be rewarded.]
\p
\v 7 . To them indeed, who by perseverance, [The Greek word signifies also patience, but is here more fitly taken for perseverance or constancy, as Mat. 10.22. Luke 8.15.] in doing good [gr. Of a good work] seek glory and honour and incorruption, [that is, a blessed immortality] eternal life.
\p
\v 8 . But to them who are contentious, [Gr. Contention, i.e. contentious or desirous of contention, as of faith, Rom. 3.26. i.e. circumcised] and who are disobedient to the truth, namely , which by God is made known to them by nature, Rom, 1 ver. 19.] but are obedient to unrighteousness, and indignation and wrath [namely, of God, who is justly incensed to judgement by reason of sin] (shall be recompensed.)
\p
\v 9 . Tribulations and distress [That is, hellish pains and torments, which by Gods righteous wrath shall be sent unto them] upon every soul of man which worketh good, first to the Jews and (also) to the Greek.
\p
\v 10 . But glory, and honour and peace [That is, eternal salvation which they have sought in their life, shall be given to them, ver.7.] to every one that worketh good, first to the Jews and (also) to the Greeks.
\p
\v 11 . For there is no accepting of the person with God. [Gr. Of the face, of the see more at large, the annotations on Mat. 22.16. and Acts 10. 34.]
\p
\v 12 . For as many as have sinned without Law [That is, the Gentiles, who had not the written Law of Moses.] shall also perish without Law: [That is, be condemned by the testimony of their own conscience ver.15.] and as many as have sinned under the Law [that is, the Jews, to whom the Law was given by Moses, Gr. In the Law] shall be judged by the Law. [That is, shall be judged , i.e. condemned according to the threatening of the Law.]
\p
\v 13 . For the hearers of the Law [That is, who only know the Law, and boast thereof] are not righteous before God [that is, are not acknowledged for righteous in Gods judgment, declared to be such Psalm 143.2. Mat. 12.37. Rom. 8.33.] but the doers of the Law [that is, the fulfillers of the Law, Gal 3.10. Jam. 2.10. ] shall be justified [namely, by the Law, or according to the promises of the Law, Rom. 10.5. But seeing no man perfectly keeps the Law by reason of the corruption that is in man, Rom. 8.3. Gal. 3.10. there no man is justified by the Law, or through his own works, but only by the righteousness of Christ imputed unto us by faith, Rom.3 ver. 21.22.23.]
\p
\v 14 . For when the Gentiles who have not the Law, [Namely, the written Law] by nature doe the things, which God hath commanded in his Law] which are of the Law, these not having the Law, are a Law to themselves. [Namely, in commanding or forbidding of that which Gods Law commands or forbids; or else in some parts of their lives.]
\p
\v 15 . (As) who show [Namely, by their Laws, and also sometimes by an outward observation of the same] the work of the Law [that is, a part of the contents of the Law of God] written in their hearts, their conscience witnessing together, and the thoughts one another accusing (them) [namely, when they do evil against their judgement] or else excusing. [Namely, when according to their conscience they do good.
\p
\v 16 . In the day [These words must be joined with the 12 verse, yet may also follow the 15 verse, if it be translated against that day, for then the testimonies of mens consciences, even concerning their secret sins shall serve to justify Christs judgment before the whole world, yea even before to those to whom the Gospel was never preached, Revel. 20.12.] when God shall the hidden things of men, even over to those to whom the Gospel was not preached ver.12.]
\p
\v 17 . Behold, thou art called [From henceforward he deals especially against the Jews, who boasted of and relied upon their pedigree, the knowledge of Gods Law, circumcision, and other outward advantages; and he proved that they shall thereby be no more righteous before God, then the Gentiles by the Law of nature] a Jew [Gr. Surnamed a Jew. Namely, by reason of your descent from Israel and Judah, from who the Messiah was proceed, whereof also the Jews were willing to be named after him, Revel.2.9.] and rests on the Law, [that is, puttest thy trust in the Law, which was given you by Moses as the Tables of Gods, Covenant] and boasts in God. [that is, boast yourselves that God is your God, and that ye are his people, John 8.ver.33.41.]
\p
\v 18 . And thou knowest (his) will and provest the the things which differ (from it) [Or which are excellent, choice, For the Greek word signified both, Mat.12.12. Phil.1.10.] being instructed, out of the Law, [Gr. catechized, i.e. from thy youth up, and diligently from mouth to mouth instructed Acts 18.25. 1 Cor.14.19.]
\p
\v 19 . And thou art confident, that thou thy self art a guide of the blind, a light of those that are in darkness.
\p
\v 20 . An instructor of the unwise, (and) a teacher of the ignorant, [Gr. Of infants or children i.e. those that are of small knowledge like children. Mat. 11.25. 1 Cor. 13.11.] having the form of knowledge [Gr. Morphosin, i.e. a set manner or form of knowledge: or a show and not a true being of knowledge. See 2 Tim. 3. ver. 5.] and of the truth in the Law.
\p
\v 21 . Thou therefore that teachest another, teachest not thy self? [Namely, to obey and doe that which teachest another, as appears from what follows] thou that preacheth that men shall not steal, stealeth thou? [that is, dost thou draw another’s goods to thy selves by legerdemain, and naughty practices, as the Jews have always been very infamous for this and still are, Matth. 23.14.]
\p
\v 22 . Thou that says that men shall not commit adultery, dost thou commiteth adultery? Thou that abominates Idols, dost thou not rob the Holy place? [Or, dost thou commit sacrilege? Namely, by taking a way Gods honour, or by withholding from him in his Temple, that which he will have consecrated or offered up unto him. See hereof Mat 1.6. etc.]
\p
\v 23 . Thou that boastest of the Law, dishonourest thou God by the transgression of the Law.
\p
\v 24 . For the name of God is blasphemed because of you, [That is, because of your, and your forefathers] among the Gentiles, as it is written;
\p
\v 25 . For circumcision is profitably indeed, if thou dost the Law: [He speaketh to the Jews who sought their righteousness in the observation of circumcision, and other ceremonies. They that are such must keep the whole Law, or circumcision cannot avail them, Gal.5.3. Although it may also be understood in general that outward worshipping avail not a salvation, if they not be accompanied with a true godly life. Isa.1.ver.11.12. etc. Jer.6.20.etc.] but if thou art a transgressor of the Law, thy circumcision has become uncircumcision. [that is, thou art, though thou are circumcised, in the same condition with an unbelieving uncircumcised person.]
\p
\v 26 . If therefore the uncircumcision [That is, those that are uncircumcised] keep the rights of the Law [or justifications i.e. that which the Law requires to justification] shall not his uncircumcision [that is, the seal of an uncircumcised person] be reckoned for a circumcision?[that is, be so accounted as he were circumcised as may be seen in Abraham before he was circumcised, who not withstanding was justified, not by the Law but by faith Rom.4.10.11. whereby he doth not at once rejects circumcision, while it was not yet abolished, but he deals here with the Jews who followed the doctrine of the Pharisees, and placed their righteousness in the observation of the outward worship of God. Otherwise circumcision in it self was a sign and a seal of the justification of faith, Rom.4.11. and is together with the other ceremonies and shadows fulfilled and done away by Christ: Col.2.17.]
\p
\v 27 . And shall (not) the uncircumcision which is by nature, [That is, the man which by nature is without circumcision] if it fulfill the Law, [that is, if he fulfill the Law: not that there is any man, who hath fulfilled the Law in all things, Rom. 2.9. but this he saith to convince the Jews, that they as well as the Gentiles, must seek their righteousness out of themselves in Christ, who only hath fulfilled the Law, Acts13.v.38.39, etc] judge thee, [ namely, by his example, as Mat.12 41.42.] who by the letter and circumcision [that is, the outward and literal circumcision: or which is done only according to the outward letter of command, 2 Cor.3.v6,7.] art Transgressor of the Law?
\p
\v 28 . For he is not a Jew [That is, a right or true Jew, which is heir of promise of the Covenant made to the fathers] who is so open: [that is, descendent from Abraham by Judah, and who makes an outward profession of Judaism] neither is that circumcision [that is, the right or true circumcision which God in his word principally requires, and is acceptable to him unto salvation] which is so openly in the flesh.
\p
\v 29 . But he is a Jew [That is, a right and a true Jew, as before] which is so in secret, and the circumcision of the heart [that is, true conversion and renovation of the heart, Colk2.v.11.] in the spirit, [that is, in heart and mind: or by the holy Ghost, who only circumciseth the hearts, which best agrees with the following word letter] not (in the) letter [thereby Paul understands the outward commands of the Law only: as by the spirit the inward operation of the Holy Ghost in the preaching of the Gospel. See 2 Cor. 3.6.] (is the circumcision) whose praise [namely, which Jews praise, whereby he boasteth , but whereby he is rightly praised or commended] is not of men, [that is, hath not its original from mans abilities or works] but of God. [namely, who hath wrought this in him by his spirit, Rom. 9.16. 1 Cor.3.7. and 2 Cor. 4.6.]
\c 3
\s 1 The Apostle sets forth what advantage the Jews have, 3 and answered certain blasphemous objections any one might from his former doctrine, 9 and he proves by clear testimonies of the Old Testament, that he said rightly, that even the Jews themselves are great transgressors of the Law. 20 Concludes therefore that by the works of the Law, no man can be justified before God, 21 but that God hath revealed another manner of justification in his words. 22 Namely, justification of grace by faith in Jesus Christ, who is become our reconciliation with God by his blood; 27 whereby boasting is excluded, 29 and that not only for the Jews but also for the Greeks or Gentiles.
\p
\v 1 WHAT is then the advantage of the Jews? [Or in the Excellency; namely, above the Gentiles, if so be the outward Judaism and circumcision, avails not before God unto righteousness, as is taught in the five last verses of the former chapter] or what is the profit of circumcision?
\p
\v 2 . Much in every manner. For this (is) indeed the first, [that is, the chiefest, which is the foundation of all other advantages, which the Apostle relates more at large, Rom 9.v.4, 5. Ephes. 2.v.11.12.] that the words of God [that is, the instruments of his covenant, contained in the writings of Moses and the Prophets, Psal. 147. v.19.20. Acts 7.38.] were trusted unto them.
\p
\v 3 . For what is it, though some have been unfaithful, [That is, a great part of them, namely, who by their own unbelief make the advantages granted them by God of none effect. See Hos.8.12. Heb.3.v.16,17,18.] shall their unfaithfulness [that is, of them, or the unfaithfulness of such] annihilated the faith of God? [that is, the faithfulness and truth of God, not withstanding the unthankfulness of many, would always preserve his own amongst that people, and still preserveth them, whom the promise of God especially respect, and on whom they have their force, Rom 9.v8.27. and 11.1, &c.]
\p
\v 4 . Farre be it: But let God be true, [Namely, in keeping of his covenant, and fulfilling of his promise, albeit that men are unworthy of the same] but all men liars: like as it is written, that thou mayst be justified in thy words, [that is, acknowledging to be just and faithful] and mayst overcome [that is, be found pure and without blame in thy judgments. David breaks forth into this acknowledgement, by considering of his sin committed against God and of the promise of forgiveness declared unto him by Nathan] when thou judhest. [or art judged; for the Greek word may bear both these translations: but the Hebrew text requires the first, which also best agrees with Pauls intent, which is to prove that God remains always pure and righteous, or overcometh when he judgeth, that is, punisheth the sins of men in the children of disobedience according to desert , or when according to his promises he hath compassion on the sins of his children, which is also done by Gods judgment, yet in his mercy, Mat.12.v18.20. and the truth of God in keeping of his promises, is also in the Scripture called the righteousness of God, Psa. 143.11. 1 John1 v9.]
\p
\v 5 . Now if our righteousness confirms [Or commend, i.e. make it laudable and apparent, Rom. 5.8.] Gods righteousness, [ that is, faithfulness and truth as before] what shall we say? Is God un righteous when he bringeth wrath upon (us?) [that is, either punishment properly so called from some, or else fatherly chastisements upon his, Psa. 6.2.] (I speak according to the thought or judgment of men, which might think that God should not punish that which furthers his glory.]
\p
\v 6 . Farre be it: [Gr. Let it not be, namely, that God, although he do thus should therefore be unrighteous, seeing judge of the whole world, who always doth things wisely and righteously, although all men cannot always comprehend it. See G en.18.25. Mat. 2.17.] otherwise how shall God judge the world?
\p
\v 7 . For if the truth of God by my lie [That is, faithlessness, disobedience, and is here opposed to the truth or faithfulness of God in keeping of his promises] is become more abundant [that is, more manifest, more apparent] unto his glory, why am I also yet judged as a sinner? [that is, accounted and punished v.5.]
\p
\v 8 . And (say we) not (rather) (as we are slandered, [That is, as such consequences are slanderously laid to our charge from that which we teach concerning Gods grace and righteousness] and as some we say) [namely, perverse men wrest our doctrine] Let us do evil that Good may come (for it?) whose damnation it just. [in these words is a short confutation of that which heretofore v.7.8. was brought against Paul doctrine, namely, that is so farre from that, that he should own such consequences, that he even threatens the judgment of God to those that say it.]
\p
\v 9 . What then? Are we [Namely, Jews] more excellent? [that is, better of our selves, more righteous, namely, them the Gentiles] Not at all: for we have before, [namely, in the two first chapters] accused [that is, proved by firm reasons, or convinced. The Greek word signifies often to accuse any one in judgement, and by good proof convince him] both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin.
\p
\v 10 . As it is written, [From all these places the Apostle proves that not only the Gentiles, but also the Jews are in themselves unrighteous before God] there is no man righteous, no not one.
\p
\v 11 . There is no man that is understanding, [Namely, to know God aright] there is no man that seeketh God. [namely, to serve him aright.]
\p
\v 12 . There all gone together, they are become unprofitable: [That is, unfit to do well, like rotten and stinking things which men cast away] there is no man that doth well, there is not (even) unto one.
\p
\v 13 . Their Throat is opened grave, [Namely, wherein is nothing but filthiness and nothing but stench comes out] with their Tongues they use deceit: the person of serpents is under their lips: [that is, deadly poison of evil speaking.]
\p
\v 14 . Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.
\p
\v 15 . Their feet are swift to shed blood. [That is, to commit all manner of cruelty and violence.]
\p
\v 16 . Destruction and misery [Namely, which they bring upon others] is in their ways.
\p
\v 17 . And the way of peace [Namely, to live in quiet themselves, & to let others be quiet] they have not known.
\p
\v 18 . There is no fear of God before their eyes. [Namely, which is the ground and fountain of all other virtues: whereby the Apostle concludes not that all these vices do always alike powerfully break forth in all natural men; but because the evil fountain of all these is in them, and that always some of them are manifest in their lives.]
\p
\v 19 . Now we know that whatsoever the Law saith, it speaketh that to those that are under the Law, [This reason the Apostle adds to show that he justly interprets this of the Jews, seeing God in his word by his Prophets unto the Jews] that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be damnable [that is, guilty of damnation, or of the righteous judgement of God] (before) God.
\p
\v 20 . Therefore [Here Paul concludes from all the former proof, from the 17 v. of the 1. chapter Hitherto, that by his works a man cannot be justified before God] by the works of the Law, shall no flesh [that is, no living man, Psa.143.2. Gal. 2.16.] be justified before him. [which doth not signify to infuse righteousness or holiness; for it would be no sense here, righteousness can be infuted into no flesh before God, but it signifies to be acquitted from condemnation before Gods judgment, and to be accounted just,. See Job 9.v.2.3. Psa.143.2. Rom. 8.33,34. Gal. 2.16,17. etc.] For by the Law is the knowledge of sin. [namely, when the Law sets before a man what God commands and forbids, and a mans conscience convinceth him that he hath offended against it, by thoughts, lusts, words and deeds, Rom. 7.7 Gal. 3.19.22.]
\p
\v 21 . But now the righteousness of God [That is, which avails before God, and which God freely gives] is made manifest, without the Law, [that is, not by the Law which requires perfect obedience of mans self, but by the Gospel, that directs us to the obedience of Christ, Rom.1.16.17.] having witness from the law and the prophets. [that is, from the writings of Moses. Which testifies of the righteousness of God through Christ, as also the Prophets. See John 5.46. Acts 15.11. and 26. 22, etc.
\p
\v 22 . Namely, the righteousness of God by the faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all that believe: For there is no difference. [Namely, betwixt Jews and Greeks, if they do but believe.]
\p
\v 23 . For they have all sinned, and fail the glory of God. [Gr. Hysterountai, which properly signifies to be behind, or to come short in the obtaining of any things, especially in running towards the prize, and for that be forced to want it, as all man come too short who seek to obtain the glory of God, that is, eternal life by their works.]
\p
\v 24 . And are justified [From hence forward the Apostle describe all the causes, and the properties of justification of faith, which is revealed to us in the Gospel. The supreme cause therefore is the undeserved grace of God, the moving and meritorious cause is the reconciliation and redemption made by Christ: the means whereby that is imputed to us, is faith in Christs blood: the end is the showing forth of Gods righteousness and the forgiveness of sins. The property is, that all boasting of man before God is hereby executed, and that the same is revealed not only for the Jews but also for the Gentiles] for nought , [Gr. Of gift, i.e. by meer gift without any desert] by his grace, by the redemption which is in Jesus Christ. [Gr.Apolystrosis, which although it may be sometimes taken somewhat more largely, for any kind of deliverance, yet notwithstanding it properly signifies a deliverance which is procured by bringing up or paying of a ransom, as Christ himself speaketh, Mat. 20.28. See also 1 Cor.7.v.23. 1 Pet.1.18.]
\p
\v 25 . Whom God hath set forth [Namely, firstly in his eternal counsel, and afterwards by the execution thereof in the fullness of time, and finally by preaching of the Gospel, 2 Tim. 1.9,10,11. 1 Pet. 1 20, 21,22.] (for) a reconciliation [Gr. Hilasterion, i.e. to be a reconciler, namely, of sinners. The Apostle here alludes to the mercy-seat or propitiatory made of pure gold, which covered the Ark of the Covenant, in which the Tables of the Law lay: which is also called hilasterion, Heb. 9. 5. and was a type that Christ by his purity and obedience should cover our transgressions against the Law, before the face of God; or with the word faith, because faith thereby we are justified, chiefly respects Christs obedience even to the death of the cross; and whereon relies and truths,.: which seems best to agree with the scope of the Apostle. See also 2 Cor.5.19.,20,21. Gal.2.20.] a demonstration of his righteousness, [that is, to show forth his faithfulness and truth in keeping of his promise, Luke 1.69,70. Or else to show that he is righteous, seeing he punisheth the sin in Christ himself: which in the Old Testament he forgave upon the account of this reconciliation which was to be accomplished, and in the new, daily forgiveth believers upon the account of the same satisfaction which now is accomplished, which the following words seem to import] by the forgiveness of sins, which were committed before, [namely, under the old Testament, which God first punished in Christ, the fullness of time, Heb.9.v.15. Or which men have committed before they are justified by faith. Although the sins also which are committed after conversion, are no otherwise forgiven then for the satisfaction of Christ, Phil, 3.9. Heb.10.14. 1 John 1.7. and chap.2.v2.] under the forbearance of God. [Gr. In. These words are by some joined to the following verse: but cohere better with the former.]
\p
\v 26 . For a demonstration of his righteousness [See the exposition of the former verse] in this present time: that he may be just, and justifying him that is of faith of Jesus.
\p
\v 27 . Where is boasting therefore? [That is, where of any may be able to boast, in his justification before God] It is excluding. By what Law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith; which by an Hebraism and by a similitude he calleth a Law, as Isa.2.3]
\p
\v 28 . We conclude therefore that a man is justified by faith, without works of the Law? [Namely, not only which are done before conversion: but also after conversion, as shall clearly be proved by the Apostle in the next chapter, by the example of Abraham and David.]
\p
\v 29 . Is God (a God) of the Jews only, [Namely, now in the new Testament, when the difference betwixt Jews and Gentiles taken away, Ephes.2.v.16,17,18.] And is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes; of the Gentiles also.
\p
\v 30 . Forasmuch as he is one only God, who shall justify the circumcision [that is, the Jews] by faith, and the uncircumcision [that is, the Gentiles by descent] through faith.
\p
\v 31 . Do we therefore abolish the law by faith? Farre be it: but we confirm the Law. [Namely because the doctrine of the Gospel teacheth that Christ hath fulfilled the law for us our justification: and that he also reneweth by the spirit those that are justified, that they seek to frame their lives according to all Gods commandments, Rom.8.v.1,2,3. Not to be justified before thereby, but to show due thankfulness unto God for this his benefit, to edify our neighbour and to be more assured of our own justification before God, as Paul will hereafter in the 6.7. and 8. Chapters more largely declare.]
\c 4
\s I The Apostle proceeds and proveth that a man is justified by faith, by the example of Abraham, 6 and by the example and testimony of David, 9 and declareth from the circumstances of the time in which Abraham received the sign of circumcision, that righteousness by faith is imputed not only to the Jews but also to the Gentiles. 13 He proveth the same also from the Original and firmness of the promises made to Abrahams, that he should be heir of the world, 17 Afterwards describes the power and the properties of Abrahams faith, 22 and testified that by this faith righteousness is imputed to him, 23 and that the same shall also after his example be imputed to them, who shall believe in God through Christ.
\p
\v 1 What shall we say therefore that Abraham our Father hath gotten [Gr. Hath found] according to the flesh? [Some take this word flesh for the state of unregenerated man: but that cannot be here, because Abraham was regenerated long before, and had served God, before this testimony, Gen.15.6. was given him. Others therefore join the word with the foregoing, our Father according to the flesh. But this word may also be fitly taken for according to the works which men see outwardly, and esteem praise worthy, as the following verse expounds this thus, and this word flesh is so taken, Phil.3.3,4.]
\p
\v 2 For if Abraham was justified by works, he hath boasting, [that is, cause to boast] but not with God; [namely, hath he caused to boast. From whence therefore it necessarily follows that he was not justified before God by works: which afterwards he proves more at large.]
\p
\v 3 . For what he saith the Scripture? And Abraham belied God, [That is, the promises of God, that he would be a shield and great reward to him, and is giving him an heir, and of multiplying his seed, Gen.15, 1,5,6. whereby not only a fleshly seed, but especially Christ is understood, the son of Abraham, in whom all the generations of the Earth should be blessed. See hereafter v.11,12,13. as Paul also expounds it, Gal.3.6. See also John 8.56.] and it was counted for righteousness. [the Hebrew Text, Gen. 15.6. saith, and be, namely, God. Counted it unto him: But the sense is all one, whereby is understood, that the righteousness which he had not in himself God gave him grace through faith ni the promised seed.]
\p
\v 4 . Now to him that worketh, [Namely, with opinion to obtain or merit righteousness by his works] the reward is not imputed according to grace, but according to debt. [namely, is given: for to give according to debt, and to impute grace, is here opposed one to another as repugnant to each other.]
\p
\v 5 . But to him that worketh not [That is, who cannot, nor dares not to bring forth such meritorious works] but believeth in him [that is, put his trust in the grace of God in Christ, v.24.25.] who justifieth the ungodly, [that is, who is yet unclean and defiled with the sin in himself, as all men, even the regenerate themselves are before God, according to the testament of David in the following verses] his faith [not that faith, as it is a work, deserves this, or is worthy of it in itself, as some perversely think, for this Paul hath immediately denied to all works, and therefore also to faith as a work: but because God of meer grace hath promised this to believers, and because faith is an instrument which received the righteousness of Christ, and interposeth the same betwixt God judgement and his own misdeeds. See Rom. 5.9. 2 Cor. 5.19. Phil. 9.] is counted for righteousness [the word count or impute is taken from the similitude of those who put any thing upon a mans account, Phil.v.18. So God is said to impute sin to any man, when he will have him to make satisfaction for the same by punishment: and not to impute them by when he forgives them, and acquits him from punishment, v.8. Likewise that he counts faith for righteousness, when he gives, ascribes and imputes to believers, the righteousness of Christ, by them apprehend by faith, and by this gracious imputation, counts it as if it were their own righteousness. Therefore it is also here laid that righteousness is imputed to them.]
\p
\v 6 . As David also pronounceth the blessed [Gr. Saith the blessedness of man] to whom God imputes righteousness without works.
\p
\v 7 . (Saying) [Namely, in the beginning of the 32. Psalm, which proveth of Paul is irrefragable. For he that is justified by his works, he needeth no remission of sins to be blessed: and that he prayeth that God would not impute his sins to him, he also prayeth that God would impute righteousness of Jesus Christ to him, seeing these two things cannot be separated in Gods judgement. See Rom.3.24. and 5.19. Ephes. 1.7.etc] blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven , and whose sins are covered.
\p
\v 8 . Blessed is the man to whom the Lord doth not impute sin.
\p
\v 9 . This speaking blessed therefore, [Or making blessed, from whence it appears that the word to speak blessed , or to made blessed, is here by David taken for the same that the Scripture Gen.15.6. concerning Abraham, calls the imputing of righteousness. The reason is, because the grounds of our salvation consist in remission of sins, and imputation of the righteousness of Christ] is it (only) upon the circumcision, or upon the uncircumcision also? For we say that Faith was counted to Abraham for righteousness.
\p
\v 10 . How was it therefore counted (to him?) when he was in circumcision, [That is, was it imputed to him when he was already circumcised] or uncircumcision? [that is, when he was not yet circumcised. For this promise to which Abraham’s faith had respect, was indeed made fourteen years before Abraham was circumcised: seeing Abraham had yet no hope of children when this promise was made, Gen. 15.2. And Ismael was now thirteen years old when Abraham being ninety and nine years old was circumcised, Gen.17.24, 25.] Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
\p
\v 11 . And he received the sign of circumcision [That is, circumcision for a sign and seal i.e. obsination and confirmation that he was justified by faith: in which words the nature and all Sacraments is briefly set forth, as also Gen. 17.11. Exod. 12.13. Ezek. 20.12. namely, that they serve not the first to work faith, but to seal and strengthen it, and therefore are not bare signs but seals also] (for) a seal of righteousness of faith, might be a Father of that believe [namely, whose example or footsteps God willeth as well Gentiles as Jews should be justified by faith] being in uncircumcision, to the end that righteousness might be imputed to them also.
\p
\v 12 . And a Father of the circumcision, to them (namely) who not only for the circumcision, but that walk also in the footsteps of the faith of our Father Abraham, which was in uncircumcision.
\p
\v 13 . For the promise (was) or to his seeds through the Law, [That is, through the keeping of the Law. Here Paul produceth yet another reason to prove that Abraham was not justified by the works for otherwise the promise made to Abraham, namely that he with his seed should be heir to the world, should be given in vain: for the Law worketh wrath, and giveth not the inheritance, because it is weakened by the flesh, Rom 8.3.] namely that he should be the heir of the world, [Here is held either to the promise to Abraham at the same time when this testimony was of his righteousness by faith was given, Gen.15 ver.6.7.8. namely, of the possession of the land of Canaan ,which was a type of the eternal rest of believers in heaven, whereof the Apostle speaketh, Heb. 4.3. and chap.11. ver.9.10. Or to another promise which expressed, Gen 22.ver 17,18. after that he would have up his Son, namely that all generations of the earth shall be blessed in his seed. For Abraham as a father of all believers was by God put into the inheritance, of the spiritual world, whereof all his spiritual children the faithful, shall also receive their part through Christ the promised seed, Psalm 2.8. Heb. 2.ver.5.] but by the righteousness of faith.
\p
\v 14 . For if they are of the Law [That is, they will be justified by works or keeping of the Law] be heir, [namely, of the spiritual world ver.13.] faith is become vain [that is, needless to no purpose] and the promise brought to nought. [that is, without virtue or fruit.]
\p
\v 15 . For the Law worketh wrath. [That is, revealeth, Gods wrath against transgressing of the same, by its threatening of punishments: and increaseth sin through the perverseness of mans nature, Rom. 7.8.] For where there is no Law, [namely, neither written in nature, nor given by God, as is proved before] (there) is also no transgression. [namely, which can be known or be punished.]
\p
\v 16 . There it is [Namely, the promise of this inheritance] of faith [that is, made or given of God upon condition of faith] that is according to grace: [for faith and grace go always together, and faith relies upon unchangeable grace of God, not on works, nor on mans selfe, ver5. Eph. 2.8.] to the end that the promise may be firm [for we can be assured of the inheritance only by faith, and not by the works of the Law, seeing no man keepeth the Law as is proved before. See also Gal.3.16.18.] to all the seed, not only that which is of the Law, [that is, of the Jews to whom the Law was given : for no man can be a heir by the works of the Law, is taught in the fourteen verse before going] but also that which of the faith of Abraham [that is, which imitate the faith of Abraham, although they may be not sprung from Abraham according to the flesh] who is the Father of us all. [namely, who believe.]
\p
\v 17 . (As it is written, I have set thee forth a Father of many Nations.) [Namely, not only of them which should proceed from him according to the flesh, but also of those which should by faith be ingraffed and received into his spiritual family, out of all other Nations] before him on whom he believed, [from henceforward Abrahams faith is described with all its props and properties unto the two and twentieth verse; from whenceforward is showed that the same is propounded to us for example] (namely) God, who quickened the dead, [this is the first prop of faith, namely, Gods omnipotency , which Abrahams faith had need of to believe, firmly, that now in his old age being as it were dead, he should get power to become a father of many Nations] and calleth [or nameth, i.e. by his word causeth to be, and have their being, Psalm 33.9. 2. Cor.4.6.] the things, which are not, as if they were.
\p
\v 18 . Who (namely, Abraham) against hope,[Namely, which a man could have conceived by own his understanding or reason] believed [that is, trusted] on hope, [namely, of Gods truth and power] that he should become a Father of many Nations: according to that which was said, so shall thy seed be. [namely, as the stars in heaven:]
\p
\v 19 . And not being weakened in faith, he considered not [Namely, by the consideration of his weakness ; to be weakened in his confidence. For otherwise himself set before God his old age and the old age of Sarah, Gen.17.17.] his own body that was already dead, seeing he was about an hundred years old, (nor) yet that the matrix in Sarah is dead. [Gr. The deadness of the womb of Sarah.)
\p
\v 20 . And he doubted not of the promise of God through unbelief : [ This is the other prop of Abrahams faith: namely, the certainty which he had of Gods faithfulness and steadfastness in his promise, Heb.6.ver.17.18.] but was strengthened in faith, giving God the glory: [that is, hereby showing that he believed that God could and would do that which he had promised; and to set his seal that God is true, John 3. ver 33.]
\p
\v 21 . And being fully assured that that which was promised, he was also be able to doe. [Namely, although it seemed to be contrary to all humane reason.]
\p
\v 22 . Therefore also it was counted to him righteousness.
\p
\v 23 . Now it was not written [Here the Apostle concludes the exposition of the former chapter, and testifieth that all believer shall so be justified even as Abraham was justified] for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him:
\p
\v 24 . But for our sake also, to whom it shall be imputed (namely) to them that believe in him [that is, trust in him, for this is also that on which our faith relies , after the example of Abrahams faith, namely first Gods ability and fidelity, which according to his promise he showed in raising up of Christ from the dead: and secondly the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, seeing by his death we are reconciled unto God, and by his resurrection we are made partakers of the reconciliation] who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead.
\p
\v 25 . Who was delivered over [Namely, by God his Father, Rom.8 32.] for our sins [namely, to expiate and do them away, 1 John 1.7. and 2.2.] and raised up for our justification. [namely, forasmuch as God showed by the raising up, that he received the death of his Son for a sufficient ransom of our sins, and will receive his obedience unto righteousness of all them that believe him. For if Christ had remained in death, then his satisfaction should not have been to apply the virtue thereof to us.]
\c 5
\s 1 Paul teacheth further what fruits comes forth in us by justification of faith, namely peace with God, patience, hope and assurance of Gods love, 5 Afterwards declares the foundations of this hope and assurance, namely the testimony of the Holy Ghost in our hearts, and the consideration, that God hath given up Christ unto death for us, when we were yet enemies, 9 concludes from thence that therefore we must also be assured of perseverance, and may boast thereof in God. 12 Afterwards makes an opposition betwixt Adam and Christ: and declareth that like as by transgression of Adam, sin and death came upon all men, so also by the obedience of Christ, righteousness and life shall come upon many. 20 Finally he declareth for what purpose the giving of the Law served.
\p
\v 1 WE therefore being justified by faith have peace with God [That is, the friendship of God, whereas before we were his enemies, ver. 8. and 10. and the assurance thereof in mind, whereby we are set at rest in God, John 16.33. Rom. 14.17.] by our lord Jesus Christ:
\p
\v 2 . By whom we have also adduction [Or, access to this grace, whereby it is given to understand that we went not to the grace of our selves, but that we were led thereto by Christ through his Spirit, Eph. 2.8. Heb. 8.10.] through faith, unto this grace [that is, unto this state of friendship and peace with God. From whence also proceeds that we may go unto him with boldness, and dare to call upon him as a Father, Eph. 2.18. and chapter 3.12. Heb. 4.16.] in which we stand, and boast in the hope. i.e. patient waiting for Christ] of the glory of God. [namely, which shall hereafter be revealed unto us, Rom.8.18.]
\p
\v 3 . And not only (this) but we boast also in tribulations: [That is, we rejoice our selves therein, and insult over the same, because of the assurance that we have of the good issue thereof, Rom8.34. etc.] knowing that tribulation worketh patience. [not that tribulation doth that of its own nature; but that Christ strengthens believers against it by his Spirit, John 16.33 Rom.8.37.]
\p
\v 4 . And patience proof, [Or experience, trying, namely of Christ help. [that the fulfilling of his promises also, and especially of eternal salvation shall follow thereupon, like as we herein find and feel the fulfilling of the promise.]
\p
\v 5 . And hope make not ashamed, [That is, doth not fail nor deceive us. For when we expect or hope for anything even to boasting, which afterwards we miss of; we are grieved at it in our selves, and shamed before others] because the love of God [that is, wherewith he loveth us in Jesus Christ, as is expressed ver.8. which in the time of tribulation most comforts and strengthens us, Rom. 8.38.39.] is poured out into our hearts [that is, abundantly witnessed, Rom. 8.16.] ny the Holy Ghost which is given us. [namely, for our comforter in our minds, and an earnest of our inheritance, john 14.16, 17 2 Cor.1.22. Eph.1.3. And this is the first why hope maketh not ashamed, because the Holy Ghost cannot lie herein.]
\p
\v 6 . For Christ, [This is the other foundation of our hope, the certainty of the love of Christ towards us, who reconciled us to God when we were yet estranged from him; much more therefore shall save us, now after that we are become his friends by faith] when we were yet without power, [or unable, namely to redeem our selves as being overcome by sin, like as of a mortal sickness in his time [or, at the right or fit time, i.e. in the time appointed by God, Gal.4.4] died for the ungodly [that is, who were sinners in themselves, and by their sins more and more provoked Gods wrath upon them.]
\p
\v 7 .For scarcely with any man die of a righteous (person) for a good (man) [Or, profitable (man) i.e. who is serciceable or profitable to himself or others] it may be [this the Apostle saith, because though very few, yet nevertheless some were found, especially in the Roman Histories, who have given up themselves to death to deliver their friends and citizens from trouble: but none of them dyed for his enemies, as Christ did.] some one will even adventure [gr. Dare ] to die.
\p
\v 8 . But God confirms [Or, commendeth, praiseth] his love towards us, that Christ dyed for us when we were yet sinners. [that is, when sin had yet dominion over us , John 9.32. Rom. 6.17. 19.20.]
\p
\v 9 . Much more therefore being now justified by his blood [Gr. in his blood i.e. by his obedience unto the death of the cross, Phil.2.8. which is the moving cause wherefore God justifieth us, and upon which faith relyeth Rom.3.25.] shall we be saved by him from wrath. [that is, from the punishment of the future judgement, 1 Thes,1.10. which is also called the day of wrath Rom.2.5.]
\p
\v 10 . For if we being enemies [Namely, because of sin which was in us, which God hates, and is enmity against God, Rom. 8.7. Otherwise he hath said that God loved us when we were yet sinners, ver.8. namely, in respect that we were elected by him, and given to Christ to be redeemed John17.ver.2.6. Rom. 9.13.] were reconciled unto God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled shall we be saved by his life. [Gr. In his life, i.e. by him who now liveth, and sitteth at the right hand of God, there intercedes for us, and had all things subjected unto him, Rom. 8.34. Eph. 1.20.21.22. etc. Heb.9.24.]
\p
\v 11 . And not only (this) but we boast also in God [Namely, hereof that we being now reconciled shall also be saved from the wrath to come, ver. 9.10. and that God, is our God, and shall forever continue] through our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom we have now gotten the atonement
\p
\v 12 . Therefore [In the following verses the Apostle declares how we are justified by Christ, with an apposition of Adam and his disobedience, by whom death pressed through, over all men, ver 12, 13,14. and afterward how on the contrary the obedience of Christ conduceth to our justification ver.15,16,17,18,19. by Gods imputation. And that therefore it is not absurd that we are all justified by one mans obedience, seeing we are all made sinners by one mans disobedience] as by one man [namely, Adam, 1 Cor. 15.21. under whom Eve is also comprehended for as much as these two were on flesh, and one common stock of all mankind Eph.5.31. 1 Tim2.14.] sin entered in the world, and by sin death :and so the death passed through unto all men, in which [namely, one man, as this Greek, particle, epi is also elsewhere taken for in, Mark 2.4 Heb. 9.17. etc. and this particle in, is also used by Paul about this matter, 1 Cor.15.22. Or for as much or because they have sinned, and that also necessarily imports the same sense; for all the men that die have not committed any actual sin in themselves, as appears in infancy; and therefore must have sinned in this one man in whose loins they were: as Levi is said to given Tithes, being in the loins of Abraham, Heb. 7.9. See a large exposition hereof in the following verses, and Job 14. ver.4. Psalm 51.7. John 3 ver 7. Eph. 2.3. etc.] all have sinned; [namely, lo also by one man Jesus Christ, righteousness and life is come upon all believers, as Paul conclude, ver.18.19.]
\p
\v 13 .For until the Law [Namely, given by Moses] sin was in the world: [that is, was also in the world, as appears by death, 14. which is the wages of sin, Rom. 6.23.] but is not imputed, [that is, not accounted or reckoned for sin] when there is no Law. [from whence the Apostle would conclude that therefore there was another law, by the transgression of which even that time all men were sinners: and that not only the law of nature, which infants did not transgress, but the law which God had given to the first man, the transgression whereof was imputed to all, yea even unto infants, as the following verse imports.]
\p
\v 14 . But death [Namely, not only the spiritual and eternal death, but also the corporal, of which in this verse he especially speaks, because that was apparent unto all, Rom 8.10. 1 Cor. 15.22.] reigned from Adam even unto Moses, over them also which had not sinned in the likeness of Adams transgression, [that is, who have yet committed no actual sin against the Law of God, as Adam and all grown persons after him have done, and yet nevertheless they dye. From whence therefore it appears that they are defiled with original sin.] who is a type [that is, a like pattern. Namely, that like as Adam in himself and by himself hath made all those sinners that are begotten of him in a natural manner, even so also Christ himself, and by himself, makes all those righteous, that are regenerated by him in a supernatural manner, as the following explications shows] of him which was to come. [that is, of Christ the promised seed, which should tread upon Satan’s head, Gen. 3.15. to which promise the Apostle seems here to allude. For there the second Adam is promised, as soon as the first was fallen.]
\p
\v 15 . Yet not as the offence, [Or fall, falling-away, i.e. Adams sin, which is more times in this chapter called by this name] so also is the gift of grace. [that is, the benefit which is obtained for us by Christ, and is freely given us] For if by offence of one many are dead: [that is, not he himself alone but many others, namely, all that come from him according to nature] much more of the grace of God, [that is, the mercy and undeserved favour of God] and the gift by grace [that is, the righteousness of Christ, which by God of grace through faith is imputed to us] which is of the man Jesus Christ, was abundant [that is, more powerful and manifold. A similitude taken from water which its power and flood quencheth the fire, that so also the power and abundance of Christs righteousness extinguished sin and guilt] upon many. [that is, all those that are engrafted to him by faith.]
\p
\v 16 . And not as (the guilt was) by the one that sinned [Namely, Adam as before] (so is) the gift. For the guilt [or judgement i.e. guilt, as 1 Tim. 5.12, namely, whereby we for sin are guilt before Gods judgment of temporal and eternal death, as appears by what follows] is indeed by one (offence) unto condemnation: namely, for them that are not delivered from this damnable state by faith in Christ] but the gift of grace is of many offences [namely, of them who have aggravate this common sin with many special sins, as all men do who are come to years] unto justification.
\p
\v 17 . For if by the offence of one, death reigned by that one, [Namely, first Adam as before] much more shall they who receive [or apprehend, namely, by a true faith, John, 1.12] the abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousness, reign in life, [that is, being partakers of spiritual life, have victory over sin and the guilt thereof, Gal. 2.19,20. Ephes. 2.5.6. and hereafter the partakers of everlasting declared v.21.] by that one, (namely)
\p
\v 18 . Therefore like as by offence (that came) upon all men to condemnation: [That is, hath brought them unto such an state, wherein they are condemnable before God, Rom. 3.19. Eph.2.1,3.] so also by one righteousness of [Gr.dikatoma, so he calls the obedience of Christ, because it hath the power to justify others also, as the Greek word here imports, and is opposed to the transgressions, in which also was the power to make other sinners, v.19.] (grace commeth) upon all men [namely, who believe in him, or who receive this gift.v.17.] to justification of life.
\p
\v 19 . For as by the disobedience of one man, [Here the Apostle concludes the likeness of Adam and of Christ, namely, that like as the disobedience of Adam is imputed to us, unto the guilt of condemnation, so Christs obedience imputed to us, for the discharging of us from that guilt. It is true that like as Adams first offence we became not only guilt of the same and of the punishment thereof, but also our nature was corrupted thereby, even so by Christs obedience we are not only freed from punishment, but also by the power thereof are by the spirit renewed and sanctified in our mind: but thereof the Apostle hath not spoken hitherto, but begins to speak of it in that which followeth. And this renovation also in this life is very imperfect, as he proved by his own example in the 7. Chapter, so that we cannot thereby be made righteous before God] many were made sinners. So also by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
\p
\v 20 . But the Law [Here the Apostle answers the objection: If we are made righteous only by the righteousness of Christ, to what purpose then was the law given to the Israelites by Moses, and declareth hat the law was not given to be justified thereby: but that sin and punishment we are liable by reason of sin, might be better known: and that so the grace of God in Christ, which justifieth us notwithstanding the grievousness of our sins, might be the more esteemed, and we might more diligently flee to the same refuge. See Gal. 3.19.] entered besides that, [namely, besides the guilt which we were subject to by nature: or besides the promise which was already made to Abraham, whereof is spoken in the former chapter, and Gal. 3.17.] that the offence might be the greater: [that is, the more apparent and also the stronger, not through the fault of the law, but of our corrupt nature, which always strives against that which is forbidden it. Rom. 7.v5.8.] and where sin became greater, (there) grace [see the annot. V.14,] was much more abundant.
\p
\v 21 . That like as sin reigned [That is, had subdued us, or brought us under its power] unto death namely, temporal and eternal death as appears from the following opposition] so also grace [namely, of God towards us] should reign by righteousness [namely, which is by him freely given us through faith] unto eternal life [namely, which begins us here, and hereafter shall be fully revealed upon us, John 11.25,26, Col. 3.3,4.] through Jesus Christ our Lord.
\c 6
\s 1 From whence forward the Apostle teacheth, that they that are justified by faith in Christ are also by the power of Christ death and resurrection renewed and sanctified, and proves the same by the signification of our baptism, 5 as also by our anton with Christ, whereby we are with him dead to sin, and raised up into a new life. 9 Testifies further that as Christ died but once and thence forward always liveth in glory, so we also when we believe dye to sin, that from thence forth we may live holily. 12. From hence draws a general exhortation, that therefore sin must not reign over us but we over sin, 15 and declareth that the grace of God. And the liberty in which we stand, must also move us thereunto, 21 Finally strengthens this exhortation by the consideration of the fruit of sin, which is death: and of the end of sanctification which is eternal life by grace given us through Christ.
\p
\v 1 What we say therefore? [This objection ariseth from that which Paul had said in the two last verses of the former chapter] shall we continue in sin [that is, under the dominion of corruption, which is yet remaining in us, chapter 7. ver.14. etc. Or in all manner of sin which hath the upperhand in the world] that grace may be more? [namely, as seems to be testified in the two former verses: which is there expounded.]
\p
\v 2 . For it be. [The Apostle by these words rejects any such consequences, as unworthy an answer, and proves the contrary that we must not continue in sin] we who are dead in sin, [that is, we who by the Spirit of Christ are delivered from the raging power of indwelling sin, ver.6.7. For to die to sin in the sin Scripture of the new Testament signifies, to let sin have no life in us: i.e. not to live under the power and dominion of sin,] how shall we still live in the same? [that is, leave sin its life and power, and let it have the upper hand in us.]
\p
\v 3 . Or know we not that as many of us as we are baptized unto Jesus Christ, [Namely, to testify our communion that we have with Christ by faith] we are baptized unto his death. [that is, are assured by baptism that we have communion in his death, whereby not only our sins are expiated before God, but also the Holy Spirit is procured, by whose working the corruption that is in us hath its life or reigning power taken away, which is the first degree of our regeneration, Tit.3.5.6. the Apostle seems here to allude to the manner of baptizing, much used in warm Eastern Countries, where men were wholly dipped into the water, and remained a little while under water, and afterwards rose out of the water : and to show that this dipping into, and remaining in the water is representationof Christs death and burial; and the rising up out of the water, of his resurrection. Which also may well be applied to our manner of baptizing by sprinkling.]
\p
\v 4 . We are therefore buried with him [This is the second degree of our regeneration, which is sealed unto us by baptism, namely the increasing and persevering in the killing of sin in us; as burial was a continuance of Christs death, ver, 6.] by baptism unto death, that in like manner as Christ was raised from the dead unto the glory of the Father, [Gr. Dia, which word most commonly signifies by, i.e. by the glory of the Father, yet is also sometimes taken for to, which fits best here. See 2 Pet. 1.3.] even so we also should walk in newness of life. [this is the third step of our regeneration, which we receive by the virtue of Christs resurrection, and is signified and sealed unto us by baptism: namely that we have received power from henceforth to walk in newness of life, that is in holiness and purity, Eph. 5. ver.26.27.]
\p
\v 5 . For if we are become one plant with him [Or, are planted together. A similitude taken from a graft which is engrafted into a young tree, and draws the sap of life and fruitfulness out of it. Even so, he should say, they that by faith are united to Christ as stock (whereof baptism is also a sign Gal. 3.27.) they obtain by the Spirit of Christ, the power not only to kill and by degrees to bury sin, but also to arise more and more in newness of life, and to live holily to the glory of God, John 15.1.] in the conformation of his death, we shall also (in the conformation of his) resurrection.
\p
\v 6 . Knowing this that our old man [So he calls the natural blindness and corruption of man, which we inherit from the first man, which he also elsewhere calls flesh, opposed to the new man which consist in knowledge, holiness and righteousness, Ephes. 4.32. Co;3.9.] is crucified with (him) [seeing Christ took our sins upon him on the cross, not only to expiate them, but also to abolish the same, as followeth. See also Heb. 9.14.26.28.] that the body of sin [that is, the whole mass or joining together of this corruption, which is as an impure body which hath many impure members, Col. 2.11. and 3.5.] may be abolished, [this body of sin is indeed wholly destroyed by Christ, as concerning his merits; and by his Spirit the reigning power thereof is also taken away in the regeneration ver 12.14. but must by degree be more and more abolished in us by the same Spirit, by closer application of the death of Christ, as Paul exhorts the regeneration thereunto, Rom. 8.13. and 12.2. Eph. 4.22. Col. 3.9. until the same shall hereafter be wholly abolished in us, Heb. 4.10.] that we may no more serve sin. [namely, as we did before our regeneration. See further exposition of this service of sin ver. 16,17,18,19.]
\p
\v 7 . For he that is dead, [This is reason taken from the similitude of a dead man, who doth no more the works of the living, nor is any more obliged to any services, whereto he was obliged in his life time] he is justifieth from sin. [that is, freed or delivered from its power. For here is not properly spoken of forgiveness of sin as in the forgoing chapters, but of the abolition of the power of sin: A similitude taken from a man who being justifieth or absolved by the Judge, is also with all released and set free from his bonds.]
\p
\v 8 . Now if we are dead with Christ [See the annot. On ver. 3.4.] we believe that we shall also live with him. [namely, a spiritual life in this life, and hereafter everlasting life. See Rom. 8.10.11. Eph. 2.5. Coloss. 2.13. and chapter 3.ver.1.2.3,4.]
\p
\v 9 . Knowing that Christ being raised up from the dead, dieth no more: death reigned no more over him. [That is, hath no more power over him.]
\p
\v 10 . For that he died, he died unto sin [Namely, for the expiation and abolition of the same] once: [for by one offering he hath forever perfected them that are sanctified, Heb. 10.40.] and that he liveth unto God. [that is, with God, and to the glory of God, being set down at his right hand.]
\p
\v 11 . Even so ye make also ye account, that ye are indeed dead unto sin [that is, have died unto sin. See the annotat. On ver. 2.] but are alive unto God in Christ Jesus our lord. [that is, have received the power by the Spirit of Christ, to live before God, and to the glory of God, and to kill sin more and more. From thence therefore flows the exhortation in the following verses. See also Rom.8.1. etc.]
\p
\v 12 . Let not therefore [That is, seeing ye are regenerate and delivered from the power of sin] sin [that is, the remainder of corruption which still remains in us for our exercise and humiliation] reign [that is, have the upper hand, namely, over the power and motions of the Spirit in you. See Rom. 8.13.14. Gal. 5.16.17.18.] in your mortal body, [this is said, not because sinful lusts are only in the body, or have their originally in the body and not from the soul: for that is repugnant for that which Christ saith, Mat 15.ver. 18.19. and Paul, Gal. 5.19.20. but because these sinful lusts mostly manifest themselves in the body and are executed by the body] to obey it [that is, to follow or to do that, whereunto sin inticeth us by divers lust James 1.14.] in the lust of the same (body.)
\p
\v 13 . Neither present ye your members unto sin [That is, to the service of sin which is yet in you] for weapons of unrighteousness: [that is, instruments, executioners of unrighteousness; even as soulder with his weapons executes that which his Governour commands him] but present yourself to God, [that is to the service of God] as being (become) alive from the dead, [that is, as being delivered from the death and power of sin, and endowed with the life of righteousness by Christ] and (present) your members [namely, as those that are instrument of the soul, to execute that which willeth or desireth] to God for weapons of righteousness.
\p
\v 14 . For sin shall not reign over you: [In the 12. ver. This was an exhortation, but here it is a promise that sin shall not reign in us, if we do but dully strive against it: whereof the reason is given in the following words] for ye are not under the law [namely, which commands indeed what me must do, but gives not the power to do what it commands: terrifieth us by its threatening ,but doth not quicken nor excite us to over come sin; by reason that we are more and more convinced of sin , Rom. 7. and 2 Cor. 3.] but under grace. [namely, of Jesus Christ, who hath not only redeemed us from the guilt but also from the power of sin, and by his sprit gives us the power to resist and overpower sin with the lust thereof. See Rom. 8.1,2,3,13. 2. Tim.1.7. 1 John 5.4.]
\p
\v 15 . What then? Shall we sin because we are not under the Law but under the grace? [This objection ariseth thence that someone might have ill interpreted words, not to be under the Law: namely, as if he had understood of the obedience of the Law, or of the rule of righteousness which is contained in the Law; and the word grace of a permission or freedom as everyone lifts: which the Apostle in the end of this verse rejects, and in the following verses powerfully confutes] Far it is.
\p
\v 16 . Know ye not that whom ye present yourselves for servants unto obedience, [That is, to obey and subject yourselves to him] ye are servants of him whom ye obey, either of sin [that is, of reigning sin as before] unto death, or of obedience [namely, which ye owe unto God for your redemption] unto righteousness. [namely, to exercise righteousness.]
\p
\v 17 . But God be thanked that ye were (indeed) [Namely, before ye believed in Christ] servants of sin, but (that now) ye are from the heart become obedient to the pattern of doctrine, [namely, of the gospel, which is a doctrine of godliness and righteousness; and like a pattern which leaves also such an impression in those that embrace it, so that they by the power Gods spirit give up themselves also to the imitation of the same doctrine] unto which we were given over:
\p
\v 18 . And being made free from sin, [That is, from the slavery of sin,] are made servants of righteousness.
\p
\v 19 . I speak after the manner of men, [That is, by the similitudes of things, which are known amongst men] because of the weakness of your flesh. [that is, that by the reason of the weakness of understanding in spiritual things, ye may better comprehend the same, John 3.12.] For as you have presented your members (to be)servants of uncleanness, [that is, to fleshly lusts] and to righteousness, [that is, of the lusts which tends to the oppression of your neighbour] unto unrighteousness, [that is, to the fulfilling of such evil lusts and desires] even so present your members (to be) servants of righteousness, unto justification. [namely, of your dealing and walking before God and men, as v. 22.]
\p
\v 20 . For when ye were servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness [Gr. Free to righteousness, i.e. destitute of all true righteousness: or not subject to righteousness, like a free man which is under no man.]
\p
\v 21 . What fruit therefore had ye then of those things, whereof ye are now [Namely, after that ye are come to better knowledge] ashamed? [that is, are sorry and ashamed of those shameful things, wherein ye took pleasure before] For the end of the same is death. [namely, except we had been justified from it by the blood and the spirit of Christ, 1 Cor.6.11.]
\p
\v 22 But now being made free from sin [That is, from the slavery of sin as before] and being made servants to God, [that is, fit and will to serve God] ye have your fruits unto sanctification, [namely, in this life, as v. 19. See 1 Thes. 4.3.] and the end everlasting life.
\p
\v 23 . For the wages [Gr. Stipends. A similitude taken from soulders, who at the end of their service get their pay or wage] of sin is death, [namely, not only, temporal but also eternal as appears from the following member] but the gracious gift of God [namely, which we obtain by Christ even in our sanctification, whereof he speaks] is eternal life. [that is, hath for its end the eternal life, as is spoken v. 22. not that it merits this (for then it should not be a gracious gift) but because Christ hath merited this for us, and shall of grace give it to us, as the following words through Jesus Christ show.
\c 7
\s 1 The Apostle having declared in the foregoing Chapter that sin reigns no more over those that are in Christ, like as it reigns over those that are under the Law, now proves the same by the example of the making free of a wife from the dominion of her husband by the death of her husband, 4 and applies that to the regenerate. 7 Teacheth further for what purpose the Law serves: and proves that the Law is no cause of sin in the unregenerate, although sin through the Law reigned over them. 14. Afterwards describes the strife betwixt the flesh and the spirit, and sets forth the power which the remainders of corruption still have against the spirit in the believers. 24. Concludes this declaration with a complaint and with a wish to be wholly delivered from their strife, and with a Thanksgiving to God for the deliverance already obtained.
\p
\v 1 Know ye not Brethren, (for I speak to them that understand the Law) [Namely, given by Moses, which not only the Jews but also Christians are bound to understand] that the law hath dominion over a man [ that is, obligeth man to obey it] so long time as he liveth? [namely, to whom the Law is given, for the Law properly commands not the dead but the living.]
\p
\v 2 . For a wife which is under the husband [Namely, by the band of marriage] is bound to the living husband by the Law: [namely, to be faithful and obedient to him as long as he liveth. For howsoever the husband was permitted in the Old Testament to give wife bill of divorce, yet notwithstanding such forsaking was never approved by God. See Mat. 19.8.] but if the husband be dead, she is made free [Gr. Made empty, that is, made loose and free] from the Law of the husband. [that is, from the obligation, whereby the Law binds her to the husband.]
\p
\v 3 . Therefore if she become another mans, [That is, marrieth to another man, and become his wife, as also in the end of the this same verse] while the husband liveth, she shall be called [that is, be indeed, and rightly be called, as this Greek word Chrematizein is also taken, Acts 11.26.] an adulteress: but if the husband be dead, she is free from the Law, so that she is no adulteress, if she become another mans.
\p
\v 4 . So then my Brethren, ye are also made dead to the Law [The opposition seemed to require that the Apostle should say the law is put to death, or is dead to you, seeing the reigning power of sin by the Law, or the Law itself is here put as the husband, which bears sway over us by its threatening against sin, and irritations to sin, by reason of the deprivation of our flesh, as he will declare hereafter v.8. but the Apostle rather inverted the same, because it would have seemed strange if he had said that the Law was made dead by Christ, whereas he means that the domineering power of the Law was made dead which by this manner of speaking, we are made dead to the Law, i.e. the Law hath no more this threatening and instigating power over us, seeing we are dead as to it, may altogether as fitly be understood] by the body of Christ, [that is, by the sacrifice of the body of Christ accomplished on the cross, whereby he did away the curse of the Law, and the power of sin under the Law, and delivered us from it: as in the former Chapter is more largely declared. See also 1 Cor. 15. v. 56. 57.] that ye should be another’s, [or for another, namely, Christ Jesus] (namely) his who was raised up from the dead, [namely, not only to live himself, but to cause us to live with him, and to unite us unto him] that we should bear fruits unto God. [namely, the fruits of this spiritual marriage with Christ, which are the fruits of holiness and righteousness, whereby God is honoured and praised by us, John 15. v. 8.]
\p
\v 5 . For when we were in the flesh, [That is, in the corruption of our nature and under the dominion of the same. See afterwards chapter 8.5. and the following verses] the motions of sin which are by the law, [that is, which are discovered and irritated by the Law, as ill vapours are discovered and raised by the Sun, which are hidden in the Earth. See v. 8.] wrought in our members, to bring forth fruits of death. [that is, corruption, which had seat principally in the soul, by its evil motions spread itself abroad through all members, and by the same brought forth those ill fruits whereof the end is death. See Mat 15.v18.19. Jam. 1.v14.15.]
\p
\v 6 . But now we are made free [See before the annot. On v.4.] from the law, forasmuch as the reigning power of the Law and sin, by the death and spirit of Christ, is abolished in us. Otherwise forasmuch as that is dead, namely, the law, in respect of its compelling, condemning and irritating power] under which [Gr. In which] we were held: so that we serve [namely, God] in newness of spirit, [that is, in true holiness, whereunto we are renewed by the Holy Ghost, through the preaching of the Gospel, which is called a ministry of righteousness and of the spirit, 2 Cor. 3.v.8,9.] and not (in) the oldness of the letter. [that is, in the corruption, which by the external letter of the Law is more and more stirred up to sin, seeing the law indeed condemns the sinner, but brings not with it the power to forsake sin: wherefore the law is called a killing letter, and a ministry of death, 2 Cor. chapter 3.v.6,7.]
\p
\v 7 . What shall we say therefore? Is the law sin? [That is, cause of sin: which objection ariseth from hence, that the Apostle hath said it before v.5. that sin was powerful in us by the Law, therefore he declared in the following verses how this must be understood] far be it: Yea I knew not the sin but by the Law. [namely, to the full, and as I though? For otherwise even nature itself teacheth a difference of good and evil in many things, Rom. 2.v.15.] For even Ihad not known concupiscence (to be sin) [here concupiscence is taken for the ground of all desires, and for the first motions of the same. For the concupiscence to which we consent, the Heathen also well knew that it was sin: but these first motions to evil they held to be no sin, as neither did the Pharisees, amongst whom Paul had been. See Mat. 5.20,22,28. and 23.25, & etc.] if the Law said not, thou shalt not covet.
\p
\v 8 . But sin [That is, the corruption that is in us] having taken occasion [or being set at going; For the law doth not only discover and condemn sin, as is testified in the former verse, but the corruption which is in man is by this knowledge stirred up and set a going against the commandment, when Gods spirit doth not hinder the same] by the commandment, wrought in me all concupiscence. [that is, all kinds of actual concupiscence] For without the law [that is, without the right knowledge of the law] sin is dead. [that is, doth not show its power.]
\p
\v 9 . And without the law I lived [Or I was alive, i.e. I thought that I was just. And thereupon was at rest. See the like example in that young man, Mat. 19.v. ,16,17,18. &c. and in the Pharisees in general, Mat. 23.28.] heretofore: [namely, being yet a Pharisee] but when the commandment came, [namely, to the right knowledge, and that I understood that even the inward desires against the law are sins] sin became alive again, [that is, I felt the multitude of sins which was awaked in me, to be alive] but I died. [that is, I was convinced in my mind that I lay in the midst of death, and lost the confidence of being able to be saved by the obedience of the law, Rom. 4.15. 2 Cor. 3. v.6,7,9.]
\p
\v 10 . And the commandment which was into life, [Namely, for those that should perfectly keep the law, Rom. 10.5. Gal. 3 12, &c. which is impossible to man, Rom. 8.v.3.] the same was found to me unto death. [namely, through my corruption and transgression.]
\p
\v 11 . For sin having taken occasion by the commandment, seduced me [See the annot. V.8.] and by the same killed me.
\p
\v 12 . So then the law is holy; and the commandment is holy, and just and good.
\p
\v 13 . Is therefore good become death [That is, a cause of death as v.7.] to me? Far be it. But sin (is become death unto me) that it might be manifest (to be) sin, working death to me by that which is good: that sin might become above measure sinful by the command. [namely, as is declared before on the 8. verse.]
\p
\v 14 . For we know that the Law [Hitherto the Apostle hath spoken of the power of the law and of sin, in the corrupt and unregenerate man; as he himself also had formerly experienced, when he was yet in such a state, v.9. but now he cometh and speaketh of himself as he then was, and declares what power the remainders of sinful flesh had still in him, now after that he was delivered from the dominion of sin, like as all his reasons which follow, speaks of the present time, and not of the time past] is spiritual, [that is, which requires not only an outward but also an inward obedience of the heart, and prescribes the perfect rule of a spiritual and holy life, as Christ expounds the sum thereof, Mat. 22.37.] but I am carnal, [namely, still in part, in respect of the remainders of the flesh which are yet in me, as he declares v.18.23. For that even the regenerate in respect of some defects which are still in them may be called carnal, appears, 1 Cor.3.1.] sold under sin [namely, not as a willing slave, which should in all things follow the desire of sin, as is said of Ahab 1 Kings 21.20. but (as one) against his desire and will is still subject the lusts and assaults of sin, without being able yet wholly to free himself from it, although he earnestly resist it, and for the most part by the Spirit of God which is in him, overcome it. See the like Gal.5.17.18.]
\p
\v 15 . For that which I do [Gr. Work or fulfill. The Apostle here takes the word do, as also in that which follows, not always of the outward act: for the regenerate walk not after the flesh but after the spirit, Rom.8:1. howsoever they have their failings which they with sorrow bewail, Job 9.2,3. Psa. 130.3. but he speaks here principally of the inward motions in sin which he hateth, and which corrupt nature causeth oft times to arise in him against his will, as he also speaketh of the lust of the flesh, Gal. 5.17. So that ye do not that which ye would; whereas notwithstanding he said before in the 16. verse, walk after the spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh] that I know not [namely, for good i.e. that I do not stand to, as he afterwards expounds it. See Psa. 1.6. Mat7.23.] For that which I will [that is, the good which I will, as v.19.] that I do not, [namely, in such perfection as gladly would, as v.18.] but that which I hate [that is, the evil which I am averse from, and that I would not, as v 19.] that do I.
\p
\v 16 . And if I do that which I will not, I consent unto the Law [Namely, seeing I do not will or approve concupiscence, which it forbids] that it is good.
\p
\v 17 . I therefore now [Namely, according to the inward man, as he expounds v,22.] no more do the same, but sin that dwelleth in me. [that is, the remainders of corruption which are still in me, as he declares, v.18.20.]
\p
\v 18 . For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good: for to will is (indeed) with me, [Gr. Lyeth by me. Namely, by the grace of God which worketh the same in me, Phil. 2.13.] but to do well [namely, in its perfection. See Phil. 3.v12,13,14.] that I find not.
\p
\v 19 . For the good that I will, I do not; but the evil that I will not, that do I.
\p
\v 20 . If I do that which I will not, I do it no more, but sin that dwelleth in me.
\p
\v 21 . I find wherefore [That is, have experience of] this law [so the Apostle here calls as also v.23. by a similitude, the remaining corruption in believers, because like as a law by its commands and prohibitions admonisheth and obligeth a man to the obedience thereof, so also indwelling sin instigates then thereunto by its lusts and provocations. See v.23.] (in me) when I am willing to do well, that evil lies by me. [or lies on me, i.e. adheres or hangs on me. Namely, by the remainders of corrupt nature.]
\p
\v 22 . For I have delight in the Law of God after the inward man. [ hereby is not understood mans natural reason, which sometimes also strives for moral virtue : for the Scripture throughout testifies that the reason of the natural is blind and perverse in spiritual things, accounts them foolishness, 1 Cor. 2.14. is enmity against God, and is not subject to the Law of God, neither can be, Rom. 8.7. but is to understood of a man as far forth as he is inwardly enlightened and regeneration by the Spirit of God, Rom. 2.29. 2Cor. 4.16. Ephes. 3.16. which inward man hath his delight in the Law of God, Psa. 1.2. Rom. 8.5. which is spiritual v.14.]
\p
\v 23 . But I see another law in my members, [That is, in my flesh, v.5.18.] which striveth against the law of my mind [or the law of my understanding, i.e. against the prescript and motion of the inward and new man: as is declared heretofore] and taketh men captive [that is, still adheres to me against my will, v.14.] under the law of sin which is in my members.
\p
\v 24 . Me! Miserable man, who shall deliver me out of the body of this death? [Or out of this body of death. Which may be understood of the remainders of sin and of the old man, which are called the body of sin, Rom. 6.6. Or of mans body which is mortal here, and by reason of sin subjected to death, Rom. 8.10. For we shall not be fully delivered from the remainders of sin, and from this captivity, before we shall have put off this mortal body.]
\p
\v 25 . I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. [Namely, that he had already so far delivered me through Christ from the dominion of sin, that now howsoever still cleaves to me, yet nevertheless I am no more a willing slave of the same, but strive against it; and by the spirit of Christ can overcome it: as the conclusion that follows, and the beginning of the following Chapters imports, See 1 Cor. 15.v. 55.56.57.]
\p
\v 26 . So then I myself [This is the conclusion of this whole conflict] serve indeed with the mind [that is, after the inward man, v.22. which the Apostle now acknowledgeth to be himself or to be his own, whereas the flesh after regeneration is but a strange hanger-on, which by little and little must be worn out and cast away] the law of God, with the flesh the law of sin.
\c 8
\s 1 From that which hath been hitherto declared, the Apostle draws this consolation, that there is no more condemnation of believers, 4 and exhorts them with divers motives, that they must not walk after the flesh but after the spirit. 17 Declares further that the lot of believers in this life, is to suffer with Christ, but strengthens them against it with the greatness of the glory which shall follow after, 19 sets before them the example of the whole creation, which had a natural longing after it. 23 Comforts them further by the hope which they themselves have thereof, 26 and by the help of the Holy Ghost in prayer. 28. Withall by the assurance which, notwithstanding all their sufferings, they hold fast of their election, calling, justification and glorification. 31 Concludes this comfort with a glorying in Christ against all that which might be able to accuse them through Christ they shall overcome in all things.
\p
\v 1 There is therefore [This therefore hath reference to that which the Apostle hath hitherto taught in this Epistle. Namely, the man is righteous not by the Law, but by faith in Christ: and that he is delivered from the dominion of sin by the spirit of Christ, although there still remains a strife in him] now no condemnation [ he said not nothing damnable, for sin in itself is always damnable, Rom.3.19. but it extends not to damnation of the faithful, because sin is forgiven to believers for Christs sake, and therefore he adds, for them that are in Jesus Christ, i.e. that are united him by a true faith, Ephes. 3.17.] for them that are in Jesus Christ; who walk not after the flesh [that is, who follow not the lusts of the flesh, or live not according to the same. This the Apostle opposeth to those that are Christians in word, as an evidence of those, who are truly united to Christ by faith, and consequently delivered from all condemnation, Job. 15.v2.3.] but after the spirit.
\p
\v 2 . For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus [That is, the quickening spirit which is in Jesus Christ] hath made me free from the law of sin [that is, the power of sin which formerly reigned in us. And this is a strong proof of the last part of the first verse, that believers walk not after the flesh but after the spirit] and of death.
\p
\v 3 . For [In these two verses he proves the first part of the first verse, namely, that there is no condemnation for believers] that which was impossible to the law, [Gr. The impossible of the law, i.e. because it was impossible to the law to do away sin, or to justify man before God] seeing it was powerless through the flesh, {or impotent, namely, through the corruption of our nature to justify us and give us life] God sending his Son in the likeness [Christs manhood was true humane nature, but no sinful nature, but had only the likeness of sinful nature, because he bare all our infirmities, in which we lay through sin, Phil.2.7.] of sinful flesh, [ Gr. Of the flesh of sin] and (that) for sin [that is, a sacrifice for sin, Heb. 10.6. Or for the expiation and abolition of sin, Rom. 4.25. 1 Cor. 15.3.] condemned sin [that is, punished, put to death, and took the power accusing it] in the flesh. [namely, of Christ, i.e. by the sacrifice of Christ, who suffered for us in the flesh.]
\p
\v 4 . That the right Law [That is, that which the Law required, which promised life to those which perfectly kept the Law, which demand Christ fulfilled for us, Gal. 3.13,14. and 4.4,5.] might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit.[this the Apostle repeats again out of the first verse, not as a cause of justification, which he had denied even of Abraham and David themselves, chapter 4.but as an evidence, whereby believers may be assured of the truth of their faith, and consequently of their justification: and he lays this evidence as a foundation whereto build the following exhortation.]
\p
\v 5 . For they that are after the flesh, [That is, in whom natural corruption hath yet its full power as before] think upon that which is of flesh, [or mind, consider, i.e. with their understanding and all their services are carried after fleshly things; the fruits wherefore are described at large, Gal. 5.19,20,21.] but they that are the spirit, [that is who are regenerated by the Spirit of God] (think upon) that which is of the spirit. [that is, give them to and are carried after the spiritual things; which are also at large described by the Apostle, Gal.5.22.]
\p
\v 6 . For the cogitation of the flesh is death; [That is, leads and brings a man to death] but the cogitation of the spirit is life and peace. [that is, the way to everlasting life and everlasting peace, Rom. 2.10.]
\p
\v 7 . For this cause that the bethinking of the flesh is enmity against God: [That is, hostile minded against God, not that the carnal mind always intendeth to hate God as an enemy, but because that which he take delight in, is odious and hateful to God, and he hereby makes himself hateful before God, Deu. 5.9. Rom.1.20.] for it doth not subject it self to the Law of God, and obey that from the heart: namely, by reason of the corruption and perverseness which is therein, and in the world, wherein it takes pleasure, 1 John 2.15,16.]
\p
\v 8 . And they that are in the flesh cannot please God. [Namely, as long as they are not delivered out of it by the spirit of Christ.]
\p
\v 9 . But ye [Namely, who have believed in Christ: For to them he properly writes, Rom. 1.7.] are not in the flesh [that is, after the flesh, as is expounded v.5.] if so be [or seeing, forasmuch as. So also v.17.] the spirit of God dwelleth in you; [namely, by his gracious operations, such as are illumination of the understanding, confirmation of faith, assurance of salvation, exciting us to prayer, moving to spiritual desires, consolation in crosses and temptations, etc. For where a man dwells as Lord, there he hath his command, and there he doth his ordinary work, John 14.16, 17. 1 Cor. 3.16.] but if any man hath not the spirit of Christ, [that is, the same spirit which in the foregoing verse is called the spirit of God, namely, the Father, and is here also called the spirit of Christ, because he also proceeds from Christ, and is procured for us by Christ, John 14.26. and16.7. Gal. 4.6.] he belongeth not to him. [namely, as a true member of his body, which liveth and hath its spiritual motion only by this spirit.]
\p
\v 10 . And if Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead [That is, still mortal or subject to corporal death as is expounded v, 11.] because of sin: [that is, because of the remainder of sin which are yet in you, 1 Cor. 15.56.] but the spirit [that is, your soul which is renewed by spirit of God, as appears by the opposition of the body] is life [that is, partaker of eternal life, and shall always be with God in glory, albeit the body must be put off for a time, 2 Cor. 5.1.8.] because of righteousness, [namely, whereby ye are justified, and whereupon sanctification follows also, which Christ begins in us here, and hereafter shall perfect in us, seeing he will not let the work stick, which he hath begun.]
\p
\v 11 . And if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead, shall also quicken [That is, raise up again to an eternal life, where no sin nor death shall have place no more] your mortal bodies, by his spirit which dwelleth in you. [ for as the Father raiseth the dead, so the Son also raiseth the dead, John 5.21. and here also the Holy Ghost as one and the same God with them, and of the same power.]
\p
\v 12 . So then brethren we are debtors [That is, bound and obliged by the benefit which we have already received, and yet expect] not to the flesh to live after the flesh.
\p
\v 13 . For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall dye: [Namely, eternal death, as appears by which is here promised. And this the Apostle saith not cause believers to doubt their salvation, for he will strongly prove the contrary from the verse following, to the end of the chapter: but he saith this to arm the more against the flesh, and to distinguish true believers, and are not such indeed, seeing they testify by their life, that they are not regenerated by the Spirit of God; whom by this grievous threatening he would bring to consideration and conversion] but if by the spirit [namely, which dwells in you, and hath already given you power of this purpose, if by prayers and other exercises of piety ye do but duely stir up the same, 1 Cor. 15.10. 2. Tim. 1.6.] ye do mortify [that is, resist, subdue, that they may not live or reign in you] the workings of the body, [that is, the lusts and motions of sin, which is yet remaining in you] ye shall live.
\p
\v 14 . For as many as are led [Or driven i.e. enlightened in their understanding; and governed and guided in their will and inclinations, to do that which is pleasing unto God] by the Spirit of God, they are children of God. [that is, they have the certain evidence, that they are received for children by God, through faith in Christ, John 1.12. Eph. 1.3. which also proves in the two following verses, by the proper operation of the Spirit which believers receive.]
\p
\v 15 . For ye have not received the Spirit of bondage [So he calls the operation of the Spirit of God by the Law, which affrights and terrifies the heart of men by the threatening against the transgressors; as we have a clear example thereof in the Israelites, when God spoke out the Law of the ten commandments before them from the mountain, Exod. 20. ver. 19. To which the Apostle here alludes, as also Heb. 12. 18.19.] again unto fear: but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, [hereby is understood the gracious operation of the Holy Ghost by the preaching of the holy Gospel, which revives the hearts of believers, and assures them of their adoption: to which purpose the following operation serve also See Gal. 4.6. Eph. 4.30.] by which we cry Abba Father, in the Sriack tongue which the Apostle here retaineth , because it is a word full of affection, which young children retain in almost in all languages: and he adds to it the word Father not only to expound the same, but also the better express the moving and singular affection of believers in this crying unto God: as Christ also used this doubling of the word Father for this end, in his greatest distress, Mark 14.36. and on the Cross the doubling of the words, my, God, my God, Mark 15. 34. See hereafter ver. 26.]
\p
\v 16 . The same spirit witnesseth with our Spirit [Or, witnesseth together with our Spirit, i.e. The Holy Ghost doth not only move us to call upon God for our Father, but witnesseth also inwardly into our spirit that we are Gods children: Or, witnesseth with our Spirit, i.e. together with our Spirit, which witnesseth unto us also, by observing the evidence of our being children of God, which our spirit, the Spirit of God finds in it self: which testimony although it may not always alike powerful in believers; yet not withstanding it manifest it self many times in their greatest humiliation and distress] that we are children of God.
\p
\v 17 . And if we are children, we are also heirs, heirs of God [Namely, as of our Father, who gives us part with him in his heavenly good things] and coheirs of Christ: [namely, as of our eldest brother, to whom the same belong by nature, and who makes us also partakers of the same by grace. See ver. 29. Luke 22.29. Heb. 1.2.] if so be we suffer with (him) [that is, are willing to suffer and patient in the same, if it please God to call us hereunto, Acts 5.41. 2 Tim. 2.12. And here the Apostle begins the second part of this chapter, propounding divers solid reasons of consolation, to strengthen believers in this suffering, and to assure them of the victory over them at last, after his own example] that we may also be glorified with (him) [namely, with Christ Phil. 3.20.21.]
\p
\v 18 . For I make account that the suffering of this present time [Gr. Of the time of now] is not to be valued against the glory [Or, is not worthy of the glory i.e. hath no likeness in worth with the glory, namely, both in respect of the greatness of this glory, as in respect of eternity thereof, whereas our suffering here is short and not laid upon us above that we are able, 2 Cor. 4 17. This is the first reason to move us to patience] which shall be revealed on us.
\p
\v 19 . For [Gr. For the longing or waiting of the Creature, expecteth with the head lift-up etc. See also Phil. 1.20.] the Creature [namely, of heaven and earth, which now contrary to the first institution of God is subject to vanity, i.e. must serve wicked men, and also in a great part is subject to destruction for mans sake ver. 21. from which it shall be delivered again at the last day, Acts 3 ver. 21. 2 Pet. 3.12.13. For whereas some hereby understand as like Mark 16.15. it cannot stand, forasmuch as the ungodly long not after it; and of believers he will specially dircourse ver. 23. And this example is the second reason to move believers to patience] (as) with head lift up, expecteth the manifestation of the children of God.
\p
\v 20 . For the creature is subject to vanity, not willingly [i.e. not of it self, or according to the order which God first appointed in the creation: for no creature seeks its own destruction] but for his sake who hath subjected it (to vanity.) that is, by reason of the sin of the curse came upon the (whole) earth, Gen. 3.17. and upon all other creatures, which must serve man in this state of corruption, Mat. 5.45. and are subject to the abuse of man.]
\p
\v 21 . In hope [Before he called it expectation, for hope is a perfect expectation of anything. And is so called here because God hath promised this universal deliverance of the creature from destruction and abuse of men, which the Angels and holy souls long for, revel. 6.10. and the other Creatures seem to have a natural inclination, to which in the following verse by similitude is called a groaning, and traveling, whereupon deliverance is expected. Some join those words in hope to the former verse; and begin this verse thus. For the creature also &c.] that the creature it self also shall be made free from the bondage of corruption, unto the liberty of the glory of the children of God.
\p
\v 22 . For we know that the whole creature groaneth together, and is ( as it were) in travel together until now.
\p
\v 23 . And not only (this) but we our selves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, [So he calls the regenerate because they have received the first gift of the Holy Ghost, and expect that the rest also which are promised us shall follow; like the first fruits, which being offered up unto God, hallowed the whole mass. Rom. 11. ver.16.] even we our selves (I say) groaning our selves [that is, in the inmost of our hearts. See possession of the inheritance which was promised us in the adoption] (namely) the redemption of our body. [namely, from corruption and vanity, 1 Cor. 15.42.43.44. and this is the third ground of comfort under the Cross.]
\p
\v 24 . For we are saved in hope, Now hope which is seen [That is, where the thing hoped for is present, or possessed already] is no hope; for that which a man seetth, why shall also hope for it? [ Gr. Why doth he also hope for it.]
\p
\v 25 . But if we hope for that which see not, [That is, do not yet fully possess, howsoever it be promised us by God, and shall follow in its time: and this belongs also to the third foundation of our comfort] we wait for it with patience.
\p
\v 26 . And in like manner the Spirit also cometh to help (together) [The Greek word synantlambanetai signifies properly such an help, when one that is strong taketh up a burden against the other who is too weak, and sets his shoulders against the others to lift up the burden, and to under prop the others shoulders] our infirmities ; [namely, which in crosses and suffering we are still subject to, as well in our spirit which oftentimes murmurs against it, as may be seen in Job and David, as in our body which strail and weak] For we know not [namely, of our selves, when we are in distress, and can have no refuge but to God by prayer] what we shall pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it self prayeth for us. [the Greek word signifies to pray for any man, and is spoken of Christ hereafter ver. 34. who is our advocate with the Father, and as mediator prayeth for us 1 John 2.1. which cannot in such manner be ascribed to the Holy Ghost, seeing he is not properly our mediator : but here it signifies that the Holy Ghost stirs us to praying with inexpressible groans, and as it were spells our lesson before us, how e must pray in our troubles, Luke 12.11.12. John 16.13. Gal. 4.6.] with unutterable groaning.
\p
\v 27 . And he that searcheth the heart [That is, God, who only knows mens hearts, 1 Kings 8.39. Revel. 2.23.] knoweth what is the meaning of the spirit: [or, consideration, meditation, namely of the prayer which the Spirit worketh in us] seeing he prayeth for the Saints according to God. [that is, according to Gods will, seeing he knoweth what God will upon for our salvation, how long he would have it to endure, how he will deliver us from it, and whether he will be glorified by our life or death etc. And this is the fourth foundation of our comfort.]
\p
\v 28 . And we know [Here begins the last ground of consolation, which believers in all their troubles oppose against all temptations and tribulations, taken from Gods eternal counsel or firm purpose, through the midst of troubles, by the following means to bring us to salvation] that to them that love God, all things [that is, all troubles and tribulations, whereof he had hitherto spoken. See also ver. 38.39.] work together for good, (namely) to them who are called [namely, to true faith, which is powerful by love, not only by an outward but also inward and powerful calling, whereupon obedience certainly followeth, John 6. ver.44.65. 1 Cor. 1.24.26.] according to (his) purpose. [namely, which he hath purposed in himself, to save mankind by grace through Christ. See Eph.1.v.9.12. etc.]
\p
\v 29 . For those that he foreknew [Namely, for his, as John 10.14.27. i.e. whom he chose in Christ from everlasting unto eternal life, Rom. 11.2. Eph. 1.ver.4. 1 Pet. 1.2. and hereafter ver.33.] them he also fore-ordained to be conformed to the Image of his Son, [namely, not only in suffering, but also especially in sanctification, and glorification, which shall follow after 2 Cor. 15.48. and2 Cor. 3. ver18.] that he may be the first born among many brethren.
\p
\v 30 . And those whom he fore-ordained, them he also called: [Namely, to faith and obedience of faith by a powerful calling. Ver. 28.] and these that he called, them he also justified: [namely, before him, through faith: like as the world is taken in this matter, in this whole Epistle, and the scope of the Apostle imports. For this justification is the next step to glorification] and whom he justified, them he also glorified. [namely, here in the beginnings by sanctification and adoption, and hereafter, by the full possession of the same glory, ver. 17.21. and 2 Cor. 3.ver.18.]
\p
\v 31 . What shall we say therefore [Here the Apostle concludes the handling of the foregoing doctrine of this Epistle hitherto, with an holy insultation and triumph in Christ against all accusations and tribulations, which the Divell and the world might be able to procure unto them] to these? [namely, which thus far, are before taught and declared] if God be for us [that is, be reconciled unto us by Christ, hath chosen, called, justified, and shall glorify us, ver. 29.30.] who shall be against us? [namely, that should be able to accuse us or hurt us, Psalm 56.12. and118.6.]
\p
\v 32 . Who also spared not his own Son, [Namely, and thereby, as by an undoubted testimony, hath shewth that he is with us, Rom. 5.8.] but gave him over [namely, to death, Rom. 4.25.] for us all, [namely, who believe in him, who love him, and are called according to his purpose] hoe shall also with him [namely, Christ Jesus, who is the most precious gift, in whom all treasures of wisdome and knowledge are hid, Col. 2.3. so that he which hath him, hath all that is needful for him to salvation] freely give us [namely, of grace as the Greek word imports: which therefore is opposed to all merits of men] all things? [that is, all that we have of for our eternal salvation.]
\p
\v 33 . Who shall bring in accusation [Namely, of sin, or guilt of sin. For that is it we might be accented before God by the Law, John 5.45. by our own conscience, Rom. 2,15. or else by Satan, Rev.12.10.] against the elect of God? It is God that justfieth. [that is, who absolves us from sin and the punishment of sin, and consequently prevents accusations by discharge.]
\p
\v 34 . Who is it that condemneth? [That is, who should execute the curse and punishment of sin against us] It is Christ that is dead, [namely, to set us free from the curse and punishment of sin, Gal. 3.13.] yea, which is more, who is also risen: [namely, to bring righteousness unto us, Rom. 4.v.25.] who is also at the right (hand) of God: [namely, to deliver us from all Enemies, and to give us the Holy Ghost for assurance hereof, John 16.7 Acts 2.ver.33] who also pray for us. [namely, to apply his righteousness unto us by his intercession, John 17.20. in these four things consists all our reconciliation with God.]
\p
\v 35 . Who shall separate us [That former triumph was against sin and the punishment of sin: this is against the violence of persecutions and tribulations of the world, and all things else which might befall them therein] from the love of Christ? [namely, with which he loveth us, as ver.37.39.] tribulation or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?]
\p
\v 36 . (As it is written, For thy sake are we killed [That is, persecuted even to death :or now one, then another made away] the whole day: [that is, continually, without ceasing] we are esteemed as sheep of slaughter.)
\p
\v 37 . But in all these we are more then conquerors through him who hath loveth us. [ Namely, Christ, God in Christ. For both are here expressed, the one ver. 35.and the other ver. 39.]
\p
\v 38 . For I am assured [Or, I am persuaded, namely, by the promises of the holy Gospel to all believers, John 5.24. and by the testimony of the Holy Ghost in the heart, ver. 16.] that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, for the good seek not to separate us from Christ: except we should take it for an impossible condition, as Gal. 1.ver. 8.9.] nor principalities, [ some take this also for names of Angels, as Colos. 1.16. although it may here be fitly understood of the tyrants ones of the world] nor powers, nor present, nor future things,
\p
\v 39 . Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God [Namely, wherewith he loveth us, when we are united in Christ by faith, as ver.35.] which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
\c 9
\s 1 The Apostle testifies his exceeding sorrow for the stiffneckedness of the Jews against Christ and his fore-going doctrine, 4 and reheaseth the privileges which God gave them in the old Testament above other Nations. 6 Proves that nevertheless Gods promises are not of none effect, forasmuch as they were properly made, not to the children of flesh, but to the children of the promise, that is to the elect: and that first by the example of Ismael and Isaac, 10 afterwards by the example of Esau and Jacob. 14 Declareth that God in the choosing of one and refusing of another, it always just, by the example if Moses and Pharaoh. 19 Answereth some objection of the flesh , and shows that God hath power so to do, by the similitude of a Potter. 24 He declares further that these elect ones, are also powerfully called by God, as well out of the Jews, as principally out the Gentiles, 25 which he proves by divers testimonies of the Prophets. 30 Concludes finally with a declaration of the next wherefore the Gentiles obtained righteousness by the Messiah, and the most part of the Jews were estranged from it.
\p
\v 1 Say the in Christ, [That is, either by Christ, as the word is taken Mat. 5.ver.34,35,36. And this is a form taking an oath, which the Scripture elsewhere useth in matters of importance. Or as it becomes him that is in Christ, i.e. that is a member of Christ. See Gen. 22.16. 2 Cor. 12.2.] I lye not, (my conscience also bearing me witness [namely, that I so think in my heart even as I speak or write, 2 Cor. 1.12.] by the holy Ghost.) [this the Apostle adds, to show that that which shall here say, proceeds not from any sudden inconsiderateness, or carnal motion, but from a serious mind, which is moved by the Holy Ghost.]
\p
\v 2 . That it is a great grief to me, [Namely, that I see that the people of the Jews give so many manifest signs, by despising, rejecting and persecuting the Evangelical doctrine, that they are rejected by God and Christ, as appears from the following verse] and a continual pain in my heart.
\p
\v 3 . For I myself could (indeed) with [Namely, if it were possible, or were Gods will, even as Christ in the like impossible petition, adjoins this condition, Mat. 29.v39.] to be banished [Gr. Anathema, i.e. to be a banning or a cursing. See Gal. 1.v8,9. and the annot. On Acts 23.12. Not that the Apostle should wish to be obdurate or hardened against Christ, like as they were: for this cannot be wished by any Godly man, but he wisheth through an overflowing love, which notwithstanding always subject it self to the will of God, that he might bear in their stead, the punishment which was to be expected by them, in Gods righteous judgement by reason of their hardness, that they might be freed from their hardness and banishment : as Moses also did for the Israelites, Exod. 32.32. See also 1 John. 3.16.] from Christ, [that is, from the face of Christ] for my brethren, who are my kindred according to the flesh. [that is, according to the outward and natural descent, Gen. 29.14.]
\p
\v 4 . Who [In these two verses he reheaseth the advantages which the Jews had in the Old Testament above the other Nations, to show that he did not without reason make such a wish: and that that which he should hereafter declare concerning the Jews and their rejection, proceed not from any ill will towards them, or disesteem of them; but only from the holy zeal for the maintaining of Gods honour, truth, and faithfulness in the fulfilling of his promise] are Israelites; [this is the Jews title of honour, that they were descended from Jacob, who by God himself when he had wrestled with him for the blessing, was called Israel i.e. an overcommer of God, Gen 32. ver. 28.] of whom is the adoption, [this is not to be understood of that adoption whereof the Apostle speaks, Rom. 8.ver15.29. Eph. 1.5. for that no man can deprive us of, Rom. 8 .ver 38.39. but for the assuming of this Nation above other Nations to be the people of God, Exod. 4.22. Deut. 4.7. and 7.6. Jer. 31.20.] and the glory [whereby is understood either all the glory whereby God exalted them above others by many miraculous deliverances: or the ark of the Covenant, which is called the glory of God, 1 Sam 4.21.22. because the Cherbims of glory covered it, and the same was a shadow and a sign of Gods glory and Majesty, Psalm 26.8. Heb. 9.5.] and the Covenants [ that is the Tables of the Covenant, or of the Law, Deut. 9.11. Heb.9.4.] and the Law giving [namely, which was made to them by God himself out of heaven, Deut. 4.8.32. Or the Law-giving, Law-making, and may be understood of the Judicial Law, as in the foregoing the moral Law and the services (of God) [namely, of the ceremonies which God would have used by the Priests, first in the Tabernacle, and afterward in the Temple] and the promises: [namely, of the Meffias and his benefits first made to Abraham and oftentimes rehearsed by Moses and other Prophets, Acts 2.39. Eph. 2.12.]
\p
\v 5 . Whose the Fathers [That is, who are descended from the Patriachs, and other forefathers, who were God friends and Prophets] and of which [namely, Jews, as the particle and shows. For Christ sprung from the stock of Judah, Heb. 7.ver. 44. Revel. 5.5.] Christ is, forasmuch as concerns the flesh, [or, according to the humane nature, Rom. 1.3.] who is God above, all [namely, things, namely, according to his divine nature] to be praised for ever [by this title is the true and eternal God distinguished from all other, to whom this name of God might be given, Rom. 1.25. So that thereby the Lord Jesus Christ is declared to be the true and eternal God with the Father and the Holy Ghost] amen.
\p
\v 6 But (I speak this) [Namely, of the rejection of the Jews ver.3,] not {or, But it is not possible that the word of God should be fallen to ground. Here the Apostle begins to answer a great difficulty, which might be brought forth against his foregoing doctrine. Namely, how it could be that righteousness and holiness should be obtained only by faith in Jesus Christ, whereas the Jews, with whom God had made his Covenant, and to whom the promises of righteousness by the Messiah were principally made, rejected Christ and faith in him: It might have then seemed, that the promises God were become of none effect. Whereunto the Apostle answers, that these promises were not properly made to the carnal posterity of Abraham, but to those whom God aswel out of his offspring as out of the Gentiles, should effectually call thereunto, according to his eternal election, leaving the other by a just and unsearchable judgement to be hardened in their corruption] as if the word of God [that is, the promises of God made to Abraham and his posterity, and related every where by the Prophets] were fallen to the ground, [that is, were made void or none of effect, like as an earthen pot left fall by any one, is broken in pieces] For they are not all Israel, [that is, true Israel to whom Gods promises properly had respect] which are of Israel. [that is, descended from Jacob.]
\p
\v 7 . Neither because they are Abrahams seed, [That is, begotten from Abraham according to the flesh] are they all children: [that is, true children and heirs of the promises] but in Israel shall the seed be called to thee. [that is, the true seed, that shall be an heir to the promises: and not in Ismael, who was excluded from the promised inheritance, although he was also carnally born of Abraham.]
\p
\v 8 . That is, not the children of the flesh, [That is, who are born of Abraham only according to he flesh] they are children of God: but the children of the promise [that is, who, as Isaac was born virtue of Gods promise, contrary to the course of nature, so also by verture of Gods election and promise, should be brought to faith] are reckoned for the seed. [namely, to which God promieth his spiritual blessings and inheritance.]
\p
\v 9 . For this is the word of the promise, about this time [Namely, of the year to come] I will come, and Sara shall have a son.
\p
\v 10 . And not only (shee) [Because in the former example there seemed to be disparity, whereof God had chosen Isaac be fore Ismael, as who was the son of a bondmaid, and now come to some years wherein he had shown some tokens of perverseness, therefore hath commeth now to the second example of Esau and Jacob, wherein no likeness between the persons could be found out, neither in their birth nor their works, but only by Gods gracious and undeserved choice] but Rebecca (is a proof thereof) when she was with child by one (namely) Isaac our Father.
\p
\v 11 . For when (the children) were not yet born [Namely, were yet in their mothers belly, Gen. 25.22.23.] neither had done any good or evil [namely, whereby they could be differenced one from another. For otherwise they were already conceived of sin, and alive in their mothers womb when this divine answer happened concerning them: So that God looketh not upon faith in them, Seeing true believers cannot be said to be like unbelievers, for as much as they being sanctified by the Spirit of God, are better then unbelievers, Rom. 5.19.] that the purpose of God [that is, Gods gracious degree of choosing in Christ from a man kind, Eph. 1.4. Or, that the purpose which is according election, might abide (firm) not of works but of him that calleth, [that is, of the undeserved grace and favour of God, who also powerfully those that he hath elected, and bringeth them to faith and godliness Rom. 8.30. 2 Tim. 1,9 See also Gal. 5.8. 1 Thes. 2.12. Therefore it is not of faith, for that is not in God that calleth, but in man that is called.]
\p
\v 12 . It was said unto her, the greater [That is, the elder: Esau should be the first born, and Jacob the last born, Gen. 25.ver25.26.] shall serve the lesser. [that is not understood of an outward service or dominion: for Esau did not serve Jacob, but of the eternal and spiritual dominion which the children of God shall have hereafter, whereof the inheritance and dominion in the land of Canaan was a type, Heb. 11. v.13,14,15,16. and from whence Esau was excluded.]
\p
\v 13 . As it is written, Jacob have I loved, Esau have I hated. [Because the word serve seem not clear enough to token the election of Jacob and the rejection of Esau in Gods purpose, therefore the Apostle brings this place, Mat. 1.2. yet more, for the exposition of the first, and proves that this service or subjection of Esau to Jacob, was joined with Gods eternal and undeserved love towards Jacob, and just hatred against Esau: as from that which followeth more largely appears.]
\p
\v 14 . What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? [Namely, that he deals so unlike with men, who like unto others, so that he loveth and chooses the one, and hates and rejects the other. This natural reason thinks strange. But the Apostle answers that here is no injustice, because those that God chooses, he chooses of grace, and those that he rejects he justly rejects: which he proves out of Gods word, the first by the example of Moses, and the other by the example of Pharaoh] Far be it.
\p
\v 15 . For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy {that is, I will really and steadfastly continue to have mercy, or more and more to have mercy] on whom I have mercy, [that is, on whom I have purposed to have mercy, or on whom I have begun to have mercy: so that by the doubling of these is understood the first original and perseverance therein. Is it therefore showing mercy? Then it is no injustice; for mercy respects mans misery, and is a benefit which is undeserved, and proceeds from meer benevolence, and can be accused of no righteousness, so it be joined with no mans injury] and I will be merciful to whom I am merciful.
\p
\v 16 . So then (it is) of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, [That is, of man who by his good will and good course of his life should move God thereunto, seeing no man hath this of himself, Rom. 11.35. Phil. 2.13.] but of God that showed mercy. [namely, who decrees and doth all this according to the good pleasure of his will, v.18. Eph. 1.1.]
\p
\v 17 . For the Scripture saith to Pharaoh, [By the example of Pharaoh he proves the second member of the answer to the former objection; namely, that neither is there any unrighteousness in respect of those that are left in their sins and rejected: seeing God doth that righteously, and directs it to the glory of his name] for this same thing have I raised thee, [this word raised may be taken either for the raising of Pharaoh to the Kingdome, or for his preservation in the midst of all the plagues which God had brought upon him and his people. And also with all under it is understood his hardening against the people of Israel, and against Gods command, as by the conclusion of Paul in the following verse appears: not that he stirred him up to sin, which cannot be, Jam, 1.13. but because justly let him in his sins, and gave him up to his own wicked and proud desires, whereby he so long wrestled against God and his command, until God executed deserved punishment upon him, and so showed his glory and power upon him before all the world. See Prov. 16.4. Hab. 1.12.] that I might show my power in thee, and that my may be declared on the whole Earth.
\p
\v 18 . Therefore he hath mercy on whom he will, and hardens [That is, taketh not away the hardness of heart which they have of themselves, but gives them up to the same. See hereof more at large in the annotation on Rom. 1.24.] whom he will. [the word will is not here is not here taken for that will that should have no reason of its actions. For the will of God is a rule of all righteousness, Deut. 32.4. and is never separated from his wisdome and righteousness, albeit that the reason thereof are nor revealed to us, or above our understanding, Rom. 11.v.33.34. wherewith also we must always hold our selves content. And this is Pauls conclusion from the foregoing examples of Moses and Pharaoh.]
\p
\v 19 . Thou wilt therefore say unto me, why (then) doth be yet complain? [Or why doth he accuse and wax angry yet? Namely, about them whom he hardens, for as much as they are hardened according to his will which is irresistible. This is a new objection of the flesh against the foregoing words of Paul; whereto the answer followeth] for who hath resisted his will?
\p
\v 20 . Yea, but O man [In this word man is the first reason of the answer, seeing a frail man ought not to dispute against God, as being too mean and unfit judge of Gods doings] who art thou answers against God? [or gainsays God] shall also the thing made say to him that made it, [this is the second part of Pauls answer, whereby he showed that it is unseemly for a man to ask God a reason for his actions, seeing God is his Creator, and he his workmanship or Creature. See Isa. 54.9.] wherefore have thou made me thus?
\p
\v 21 Or hath not the potter power over the clay? [This is the third reason of Pauls answer, taken from the right and power of God over all men, which is not less then the Potters power over clay] of the same lump, [whereby is represented the Original of all corrupt mankind out of one blood, Acts 17.26.] to make the one vessel unto honour, [that is, for an honourable use, 2 Tim. 2.20.] and the other of dishonour? [that is, for a meaner or more despicable use.]
\p
\v 22 . And if God intending to show (his) wrath, [This is the fourth reason of Pauls answer, taken from the laudable end wherefore God doth this, namely, to exercise wrath, that is, righteous punishment against the vessel of wrath, after that he hath with much long suffering born with them in their corruption and rebellion] and make his power known, with much long suffering bare with the vessel of wrath [that is, on whom God hath purposed to show his just wrath] prepared to destruction. [namely, partly by themselves, seeing they have a delight in their corruption and rebellion: and partly by Gods righteous judgement, who would leave them in the same. And bring them unto deserved punishment, as was done to Pharaoh.]
\p
\v 23 . And that he might make known the riches of his glory [This is the other end which God intended in the election of his; namely, the showing of his abundant grace and glory, of which he will make them partakers, Rom. 8.v29.] on the verses of mercy, to redeem them from destruction by Christ] which he hath before prepared unto glory? [that is, hath from everlasting ordained and elected unto eternal life, Eph. 1.v4,5,6.]
\p
\v 24 . Whom Hitherto the Apostle hath spoken of Gods purpose of electing some, and rejecting others: now he proceeds and speaks of the calling of them that are elected, partly out of the Jews, but for the greatest part out of the Gentiles: which calling is the means and evidence, whereby Gods elects are distinguished from others] he hath also called [namely not only outwardly by his words, but also inwardly by his spirit, as the particle out of also imports: for otherwise according to the outward calling, the Jews were called as well as the Gentiles, Mat. 22.14. Rom. *.28.30. 1 Cor. 1.26.] (namely) us not only of the Jews, but also of the Gentiles.
\p
\v 25 . As he also saith in Sea, I will call that which was not my people, [Namely, the Gentiles whom he had passed by in the Old Testament, and now by Christ would also receive his people, together with the Elect of the Jews, Ephes, 2.13. 1 Pet.2,10. Thus the Apostle proves that he taught nothing but that which was foretold by the Prophets should come to pass: namely, that Christ should gather the true Israel of God out of Jews and Gentiles, Rom. 11 26 1 Pet. 2.10.] and her that was not beloved (my) beloved.
\p
\v 26 . And it shall be in the place where it was said unto them; yet are not my people, there shall they be called children of the living God.
\p
\v 27 . And Esatas crieth concerning Israel, [In these three verse he proves that it was foretold, that God in his powerful calling should pass by his greatest part of the Jews, and saved only the remnant of them, together with the Elect of the Gentiles] Although the number of the children of Israel were as sand of the Sea, the remnant [that is, a small company which he hath left remaining out of the great multitude which perish, as Rom. 11.5.] shall be saved. [the Hebrew word in the Prophet, chapter 10.22. signifies properly shall return into , or unto him, namely, unto God, as is expressed in 21. verse. But the sense is the very same: although some think that Esay had respect to the return of a few from the captivity of Babylon, which was a type of the going forth of the Elect, out of the Babel of sin and the world.]
\p
\v 28 . For he finisheth a matter [Gr. A word, or speech Some take this for a threatening against the godly Jews, whom God will cut off, and reject, nevertheless always preserving his own among them. Others take it for the decree, or the steadfastness of the decree of God in saving his, notwithstanding the rebellion of the greatest multitude of the rest: which seems all as fitly to agree with the following verse] and cuts it off in righteousness, for the Lord shall make a concise matter on the Earth.
\p
\v 29 . And as Esaias said before, If the Lord of Sabbath had not left us remaining [That is, had not powerfully received to himself in the midst of all the ungodly and hypocrites. See Rom. 11.4.5.] a seed, [that is, a small company, as little seed that is over and above, is in the respect of the whole; which remnant God afterwards made use as a seed out of which to cause his Church both of the Jews and Gentiles to grow up again] we had become as Sodom, and had been made like unto Gomorrah.
\p
\v 30 . What shall we say then? [ Herewith the Apostle concludes this discourse of the electing and calling of some, and of the rejection of others, with a consequence which he draws from thence, of the fulfilling of the same both among Jews and Gentiles, as the Apostle custom is, so to conclude with such consequences , as may be seen Rom. 8.31.] That the Gentiles [that is, the elect among the Gentiles] which sought not after righteousness, [that is, who together with others gave themselves over to all unrighteousness and ungodliness, before they were converted unto Christ by virtue of this calling, Rom. 1.18. eph. 2.1,2,3,4.&c.] have obtained righteousness which is of faith. [that is, the righteousness of Christ, received by a true faith 2 Cor. 5.,21. Phil.3.9.]
\p
\v 31 . But Israel who sought after the Law of righteousness [Namely, in the outward observation of the Law and of the ceremonies] is not to come to the Law of righteousness. [that is, not to come to the obtaining, or the right possession of the righteousness which will stand before God.]
\p
\v 32 . Wherefore? Because they (sought it) not by faith, [Namely, in Christ, as is expressed in the verse following] but as by the works of the Law. [namely, wherein they came far too short, as the Apostle taught before, Rom. 3.20.] For they stumbled at the Stone of stumbling. [that is, they took offence at the mean outward state and cross of Christ. See 1 Cor. 1.23.]
\p
\v 33 As it is written, [Namely, in the Prophet Esay, chapter 8 .v14. and 28.v.16. which two places the Apostle joins together. And Christ is here called a stone of stumbling in respect of the disobedient and rebellious, as Peter declares 1 Pet. 2.7.8.] Behold I lay in Sion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence: and every one that believeth in him, shall not be ashamed.
\c 10
\s 1 After the testifying of his inclination to the Jews, the Apostle treats more at large of the nearest cause of their rebellion against Christ. 5 Afterwards pts a difference even in the very words of Moses, betwixt the righteousness of the Law, to which the Jews held themselves, and the righteousness of faith which their rejected, and describes them both with their properties.12 Declares further that God now by the preaching of the Gospel in the whole world, calleth both Jews and Greeks to faith in Christ: 16 but that the greater part of the Jews are disobedient to this calling; and that on the contrary the Gentiles obeyed the same, to which he proves to be thus foretold by the Prophets.
\p
\v 1 Brethren the inclination of my heart, and the prayer that (I make) to god for Israel, is for (their) salvation. [That is, that they may be converted, and so saved: which must be understood of them who erred out of ignorance, as appears from the following verse, not to those who sinned against the Holy Ghost of whom Christ speaketh, Mat. 12.31.]
\p
\v 2 . For I bear them witness that they have a zeal to God, [Gr. Zeal of God, that is, they have a fervent desire to maintain the Law of God, and the worship of God instituted by Moses, and to withstand those who seemed as if they would alter the same] but not with understanding. [Gr. Not according to knowledge, i.e. not with right knowledge, for what purpose the Law and the worship of God in the old Testament was instituted , as the following verse also imports.]
\p
\v 3 . For seeing they know not the righteousness of God, [That is, which God hath revealed in the Gospel, and which God through Christ freely gives us, 2 Cor. 5.21. Phil. 3.6.] and seek to set up [Gr. To set. Here is signified the arrogance of mans mind, that would uphold his own righteousness before God, as the Pharisees, Luke 18.11.12.] their own righteousness, [namely, by their own works, or by the obedience of the Law, wherein notwithstanding they come far short: as is proved of all men, chap.3. and of Abraham and David chapter 4.] they are not subjects to the righteousness of God. [that is, will not subject themselves to it: and therefore they cannot come to the righteousness which will stand before God: as Rom8.7.]
\p
\v 4 . For the end of the Law [That is, the aim of giving the Law by Moses, is, that men being thereby brought to the knowledge of their sins, should fly for their refuge unto Christ and his righteousness, as he that hath perfectly fulfilled the Law for us. See Gal. 3.19. etc.] is Christ, for the righteousness to every one that believeth.
\p
\v 5 . For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the Law, [In these seven verses following the Apostle puts a clear difference between the righteousness of the Law and of Faith, and proves both one and the other by the words of Moses himself (saying) the man that doth these things [namely, perfectly, and without omitting any thing Deu. 27.26. Gal.3.10. Jam. 2.10.] shall live by the same.
\p
\v 6 .But the righteousness which is of Faith speaketh thus, [That is, sounds thus, or thus it is spoken of it, Deu. 30.11.12.] Say not [some thinks that these words are properly spoken by Moses of the commandments of faith, seeing just before he had treated of the circumcision of the heart and true conversion, which properly are promises of the Gospel, and not of the Law. Others think because Paul saith not, Moses speaketh thus, but the righteousness of faith speaketh thus, that these three verses are by Paul applied to Faith by way of accommodation, seeing he also omits some words and some he adds, in this sense; if Moses said this of the commandments of the Law, much more may the same be said of the promise and commands of the Gospel, which are not only easy to be understood as the Law, but also are easier to observe by the power of Gods Spirit, which by the Gospel worketh faith in us, Gal. 3.2.] in thine heart [namely, to fetch us from thence the will of God, concerning our righteousness and salvation] the same is to bring down Christ (from some) [namely, with us Christians its as much as we denied that Christ was descended from Heaven to reveal that way unto us, and to procure us righteousness, and that he must once again come down for his purpose.]
\p
\v 7 . Or who shall descend into Abyss? [Namely, there to see how might be redeemed from hell, and to fetch that knowledge from thence] the same is to bring up Christ from the dead. [that is, even as much as if would that Christ should yet once more suffer the pains of death and hell to redeem us; and so arise from thence: which he hath done once already, and is sufficiently revealed unto us.]
\p
\v 8 . But what saith it? [Namely, the righteousness which of faith as before v.v6. where he did but answer what it said not, but now he answers what is faith] the word is nigh to thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart. This is the word of faith [that is, of the Gospel, by which we are exhorted and brought to faith, Rom. 1.16.] which we [namely, Apostle, as witness and messengers of Christ in his name, 2 Cor. 5.20.] preach.
\p
\v 9 . (Namely) if thou shall confess [Namely, uprightly, according to the belief of thy heart: and the Apostle here puts confession before, because that is first known by others] with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, [namely, of thy Lord and Saviour, after the example of Paul, Gal2.20. 1 Tim. 1.v15,16.] and believeth with thy heart, that God hath raised from the dead, [namely, after that he had died for the expatiation of your sins, Rom. 4.25.] thou shall be saved.
\p
\v 10 . For with the heart men believe unto righteousness, [Namely, as being a means whereby the righteousness of Christ is received, imputed and freely given unto us, Rom. 3.v.24,25. and 4.5.] and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation [true confession is here put as way, whereby we must come unto salvation, which is procured for us by Christ righteousness, Matth. 10.32. and as an evidence of true faith which is hid in the heart, 1 John 4.15.]
\p
\v 11 . For the Scripture saith, every one that believeth in him, [Namely, Christ, who is prophesied of by Esay, chapter 28.v16.] he shall not be ashamed the Hebrew word Isa. 28.16. signifies properly shall not make haste, but in Greek translation is rendered, shall not be ashamed, that is, deceived in his opinion: because he that makes overmuch haste without knowing whither he shall betake himself for refugee, is mostly commonly ashamed or deceived.]
\p
\v 12 . For there is no difference neither of Jew nor Greek, [Namely, now in the times of the new Testament, Ephes. 2.13.] For one (and the) same, is Lord of all, [namely, God in Christ. Or the same Lord of all is rich towards all, etc.] being rich [that is, abundantly gracious or bountiful] towards all that call upon him. [namely, through a true faith as followeth. And from hence appears that the word confess, v.9.10. containeth also invocation, which is a principal part of our confession before God and men, Dan. 6.10.]
\p
\v 13 . For everyone that shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved.
\p
\v 14 . How then shall they call on (him) in whom they have not believed? [In the rest of this chapter the Apostle declares the means whereby Faith in Christ is obtained. Namely, by the preaching of the Gospel, preached by them that are lawfully sent for this purpose: although the same hath not the fruit it ought in all] And how shall they believe (in him) of they have not heard? [That is, have no knowledge, whereunto they are brought by the hearing required to faith, John 17.3.]] and how shall they hear without one that may preach (to them?) [namely, the word of God. This Greek word Keryssein signifies properly to make proclamation or public declaration, which is made to the Citizens by the City Officers in the Magistrates name, and is here as also everywhere in the Scripture, taken for the publishing of the Gospel, which is made unto men by the Apostles and other teachers in the name of Christ. See Matth..3.1.andchep.4 v.17,23. Mark 1.4,7. and16.15. 2 Cor. 5.19.20.]
\p
\v 15 . And how shall they preach [Namely, rightly and duly, by Christ’s authority, and in Christ’s name as before. For otherwise there were also those that ran and prophesy before they were sent, Jerem. 23.21.] if they be not sent? [namely, by him whose word they publish; whether this is extraordinarily by God and Christ himself, or ordinarily by the Churches and their Ministers, who are authorized thereunto by God.] As it is written, how lovely [that is, acceptable. These words are taken out of Esa. 52.7. where is treated of redemption and enlargement of Gods Church by Christ, and of the publishing of that redemption] are the feet of those that publish peace? [namely, with God through Christ. See Rom. 5.1. Ephes.2.14.] of those that publish good?
\p
\v 16 . But they have not all [Namely, to him the Gospel was preached] been obedient to the Gospel. For Esay saith, Lord who hath believeth our preaching? [Gr. Hearing, whereof see John 12 38.]
\p
\v 17 . Therefore Faith is by hearing: and hearing by the word of God. [Namely, that is preached. Or by the command of God who sent them to preach.]
\p
\v 18 . But I say, have they not heard it? [Namely, Jews and Gentiles: for speaks for both severally afterwards] Yes truly [namely, they have all truly heard it] their sound is gone forth over the whole Earth, [this place taken out of the 19. Psalm, which all men may have, by beholding the Heavens and the Creatures which are therein, some think also a prophecy in it, of that which should come pass in the Apostles times. But seeing the Apostle doth not properly produce this as foretold by David, as he doth elsewhere, so may this very fitly be taken for a holy accommodation or application of these words to the Apostles purpose, as here before ver.6 the like was seen in the place, deu.30.11.12. and therefore he also changes a word or two therein, which agrees not to his purpose] and their words to the end of the world. [namely, by the Apostles and Evangelists amongst all Nations of the world, even amongst the Gentiles, according to the command of Christ Mat.28.19. Mark16.15. The fulfilling whereof then already came to pass, Rom. 1.8. and 15.19. Col.1.6.]
\p
\v 19 . But I say, hath not Israel [Here the Apostle proves by three several paces of the Scripture of the old Testament, that the Jews had also heard it as well as the Gentiles, but theat the Gentiles have embraced it, and the Jews for the most part rejected it; And so lays the ground of that which he had purposed to handle in the following Chapter, concerning the receiving of the Gentiles, and rejection of the Jews] understood it? [that is, not heard it? Namely, the word of the Gospel, or of the righteousness of faith] Moses saith first, [namely, to Israel, i.e. to the people of the Jews] I will provoke you to jealouse, [namely, because ye shall see, that I will give the Gentiles, which now are not my people, more advantage in embracing the Gospel in the times of Messiah, than to you Jews who are now my people: and that to punish your unthankful ness, and thereby to call and stir you up to repentance. For jealouse is properly a dissatisfaction which one hath for this, that he seeth another have more part in any ones love or benefit, than he hath himself, whereas he thinketh that it rather or only belongeth to him. See hereafter chap.11 v.11] by (them that are) no people, [namely, of God, as then the Gentiles were not] by a people of no understanding, [so he calls the Gentiles, because they had not the right knowledge of God and his judgments, Psa. 147.19,20.] I will provoke you to wrath.
\p
\v 20 . And Esias waxeth bold [That is, speaks yet more boldly concerning the conversion of the Gentiles and their calling, notwithstanding the Jews displeasure] and saith, I was found [namely, by the preaching of the Gospel, and powerful working of my spirit on the Gentiles, who did not seek God, but went on their ways of destruction. See Acts 14.26. and17.30.] of them that sought me not; I was made manifest to them which asked not after me. [that is, who carelessly followed after their ignorance and worldly lusts. See Ephes. 2.1. etc. Tit. 3. ver. 3,4,5.]
\p
\v 21 But against Israel he saith, the whole day have I stretched forth mine hands [namely, to call and invite them unto me and my righteousness. See the like phrase, Prov. 1 . v. 20. etc.] unto a disobedient and gain-saying people. [that is, rebellious, obstinate. See an example, Jer. 44.v.16. Ezek. 3.7.]
\c 11
\s 1 The Apostle having spoken of the rejection of the Jews, and of the calling of the Gentiles, teacheth further that this rejection is not is not universal over all the Jews, which he proves by his own example, 2 as all by the unchangeableness of Gods Election: and by the example of the times of Elias. 5 Yet that those that are saved of them, are saved not by their works, but by grace, 7 which he proves out of the Scripture. 11 Afterwards he admonisheth the Gentiles that they must not lift up against the Jews; seeing their rejection was an occasion of the calling of the Gentiles: by whom the Gentiles shall be stirred up, to be likewise after their example, seeing they belonged to the Covenant, 17 and the Gentiles before they were called, were strangers from it: but were called of mere grace, 19 That therefore the Gentiles must look well to it, that they be not likewise rejected of their disobedience. 25 For the same end he reveals a mystery, that after the conversion of the Gentiles, the Jews shall also be converted, 26 which he comfirmeth out of Scripture. 28 And because God still loves them for the Fathers sake. 30 So that the same God who hath been gracious to the Gentiles, will also do the same to the Jews. 33 Finally he concludes with an admiration at the great wisdome of God in the ordering of salvation of men. 36 The beginning, progress and end whereof is ascribed to him alone.
\p
\v 1 Say then [That is, that which I have said before concerning the rejection of the Jews, I do not mean thereby that God hath cast off all Jews, as one might conclude from thence] hath God thrust away [Gr. Thrust off, namely, from that dignity into which there were put, so that they should not be partakers of the blessings promised] his people? [that is, the Jews, whom he had especially chosen for his people] Far be it, for I am also an Israelite [that is, a Jew, by descent, and nevertheless not cast off by God] of the seed of Abraham, [namely, according to the flesh: and also according to the grace of the covenant, which God made with Abraham and his seed, Gen. 17.1.] of the tribe of Benjamin. [namely, the son of Jacob by Rachel, one of the honorable tribes of Israel; out of which King Saul sprung, 1 Samuel 9.1. and Queen Hester Hest. 2.5.]
\p
\v 2 . God hath not thrust away [See ver. 1.] his people, [Namely, that was truly his people, not according to the flesh only, but also according to the promise] which he foreknew [that is, acknowledged and elected for his own, Mat. 7.23. 1 Pet. 1.2,20.] Or knew ye not that is, I think that ye know well] what the Scripture saith of Elias? [or in Elias, i.e. in the History of Elias, which is set down, 1 Kings 17. and in the following Chapters] how he speaketh unto God [Gr. Comes towards, meets with; namely, with words] against Israel, [this may be joined either with the word speak, or with the word saying, namely, complaining of the apostasy of the Israelites] saying,
\p
\v 3 . Lord they have killed thy Prophets, and overthrown [Gr. Undermined i.e. by undermining cast far away] thinner alters: [that is, which had been formerly erected for thine honor and services] and I alone am remaining, and they seek my soul. [that is, they lay wait for my life, Mat.2.20.]
\p
\v 4 . But what saith the divine answer? [Or divine revelation. See Mat.2.v.12.22. Luke 2.26.] I have (yet) left remaining [that is, caused or made to remain, preserving them by grace, that they are not fallen into Idolatry] to my self, seven thousand [that is, some thousands, Hebr. Gen. 33.3. psal. 12.7.] men, [that is, (hominess) persons, amongst whom doubtless there were women also] who have not bowed the knee [namely, to yield religious or any other honour unto it, Exod. 20. v.5. Phil. 2,10.] before the (Image) Baal. [this word signifies one that hath power and command over others, as husband hath over the wife, and a master over his servant, and by this name was called an Idol of the Babylonians, Moabites and Samaritans, Num. 22.v41. 1 Kings 10.26. Jer. 11.v.13. Hos. 2.v.12.16.]
\p
\v 5 . Even so therefore also at this present time [Namely, of the preaching of the Gospel] there is become a remnant, [that is, God hath let some Jews remain, which do not reject the Gospel but embrace it and are effectually called; which may be reckoned but for a remnant or remainder, in respect of the great multitude of them reject it, and remain unbelieving] according to the election of grace. [that is, the gracious election; Namely, who of mere grace were chosen to salvation from everlasting, and effectually called in time, Rom. 8.30.]
\p
\v 6 . And if it be by grace, [Namely, that those are elected to salvation and effectually called] it is no more [Or then certainly it is not] of works, [that is, of the merits or dignity of their works] otherwise [namely, if it were of works only, or of grace and works together] grace is no more grace. [namely, forasmuch as grace excludes all debt, merit or worthiness, and cannot consist therewith: for grace is in no wise grace, if it be not every way grace, Rom. 4.4. And if it be of works, it is no more grace: [namely, but a deserved reward, i.e. then their election and calling was not done of grace] otherwise the work is no more work. [that is, no work of merit.]
\p
\v 7 . What then? [Namely, shall we say, as Rom. 6.1. and 7.7. and 8.31. This is an objection of some one, who thinks it should be absurd that the Jews should not obtain righteousness, whereas they laboured so earnestly after the same] That which [namely, this will we say] Israel [that is, Israelites, i.e. the greatest part of them, who were Israelites after the flesh only, Rom. 9.31. 2 Cor. 11.22.] seeketh, [that is, that which he endevours to obtain by his works, namely, righteousness in the sight of God, and eternal life] that it hath not obtained: but the Elect have obtained it, i.e. all the Elect among the Israelites, in respect and because they were elected of grace] and the rest [namely, who are not elected and not effectually called] were hardened, v.7. See also 2 Cor. 3.15.]
\p
\v 8 . (As it is written, God hath given them a spirit [That is, mind] of deep sleep: [or a groaning pricking spirit, as the Greek word also signifies. But the first agrees better with the Hebrew word, Isa. 29.10.] eyes not to see, [that is, which are unfit to see] and ears not to hear) until this present day. [these words may be joined with the word hardened, v.7. See also 2. Cor.3.15.]
\p
\v 9 . And David saith, [Namely, as a type of Christ, and prophesying of Christ] let their Table [that is, all their delight] be made for a snare, or of a trap, and for a stumbling-block, [that is, for their destruction: as also a trap wherewith wild beast are taken, and made stumbling-block, signify the same thing by a similitude] and for a recompense for them. [that is, for that which shall be recompensed unto them, which is eternal destruction.]
\p
\v 10 . Let theist eyes be darkened, not to see: and make their back crooked [Hebr. Cause their loins to shake, i.e. that their consciences may tremble upon them, which is eternal destruction.]
\p
\v 11 . I say therefore, [Or they therefore, I say, have they, etc.] have they stumbled that they might fall? [namely, unto unbelief, with rejecting of the Gospel without hope of conversion. Or fall down, perish as Revel. 18.2.] Far be it: but by their fall [that is, the rejection of the Gospel by the greatest part amongst them ] salvation (is come) [that is, was an occasion that the Gospel was preached to the Gentiles, and that and that thereby they were called and brought to salvation] to the Gentiles; to stir them up [namely, the Jews, who embraced not the Gospel] to jealous. [that is, may be stirred up by the example of the believing Gentiles, imitating the same, to embrace the Gospel also, and to turn Unto Christ, and thereby to obtain salvation also: for jealous is also passion of the mind, whereby one seeing another enjoy that good which he doth not, is inflamed with zeal and lusting to pursue and obtain the same good likewise.]
\p
\v 12 . And if their fall [That is, the Jews unbelief and rejecting of the Gospel. See v.11.] be the riches [that is, hath given occasion of a rich and abundant knowledge of Christ and the Gospel] of the world, [that is, of the Gentiles scattered throughout the whole world, as is expounded afterwards] and their diminishing [that is, that so few among them have embraced the Gospel, was an occasion that the same was so richly administered to the Gentiles] the riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fullness? That is, when the Jews in great numbers and multitudes shall embrace the Gospel. namely, shall the same be the riches of the Gentiles?]
\p
\v 13 .For I speak to you Gentiles, [He speaketh now to the part of the Church of Rome, which was called out the Gentiles] forasmuch [or seeing that : and therefore my ministry and exhortation ought to avail with the Gentiles] as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles, [namely, principally: otherwise he was also appointed to publish the Gospel to the Jews likewise, as he also did, and here doth] I make my ministry [namely, of the Apostleship] glorious. [Gr. Glorify, i.e. adorn it, by administering the same with all diligence and faithfulness to convert many of the Gentiles to Christ: which is an honour and ornament to my ministry, Phil. 4.1. 1 Thes. 2.19.]
\p
\v 14 . If by any means I might provoke my flesh [That is, my Kinsmen the Jews. See Gen. 29.14. Isa. 58.7. Rom. 9.3.] to jealousy, [see the annot. On v.11.] and might save [namely, by my ministry, bringing them to faith in Christ, by whom alone salvation is obtained. See 1 Cor. 3.5. and 1 Tim. 4.16.] some [namely, a few, seeing he knew that the time was not yet come, that they should be converted in great multitudes] of them. [namely, the Jews which are my flesh.]
\p
\v 15 . For if their [That is, of the most part of them] rejection, [or casting away, repulsing: namely, for contemning and rejecting of the Gospel] be the reconciling [that is, was an occasion that the Gospel which is the ministration of reconciliation, 1. Cor.5.18. was published to the Gentiles, Acts 13. v.46, 47.] of the world, [that is, of the Gentiles , who inhabited by far the greatest part of the world, and are scattered throughout the whole world] what shall the receiving [namely, unto the church of Christ, when the Jews in great multitude shall be converted unto Christ] be, other then from the dead? [this is a common proverb, whereby is signified a very great change for better, as if one being dead should alive again; which is done by the preaching of the Gospel, whereby they that were dead, Eph. 2.1. are made alive, John 6.68. Phil.2.16]
\p
\v 16 . And if the first fruits [That is, Abraham and the Patriaks, from the Jews were descended. The Apostle here takes a similitude from the first loaves, which were offered up according to the Law, for the sanctifying of the rest of the fruits, Lev. 23.v14,17. Num. 15.20.] be holy, [that is, belong to the covenant 1 Cor. 7.14.] the dough [that is, the posterity which are the descended from them, seeing God made covenant not only with them, but also their seed. Gen. 17.7.] is also (holy:) and if the root [that is, another similitude taken from the trees, to explain the same thing: and thereby also the Patriachs understood, from whom the Jews sprung] be holy, the branches [that is, the Jews which as branches sprung from this root] are also (holy.)
\p
\v 17 . And if some of the branches [That is, some unbelieving Jews. From hence forward the Apostle admonishes the Gentiles that were called, that they must not boast themselves against the Jews that are cast off: but look to it that they may be warned by their example, to beware that they also do not fall into unbelief, least the same should come upon them likewise] are broken off, [namely, from the root and stock, i.e. are cast off from the covenant] and thou [namely, called Gentiles. The Apostle here speaks to the whole body of the called Gentiles, not to this or that person in particular] being a wild olive tree, [that is, a sprout or graffe, taken from a wild olive tree, i.e. from among the Gentiles, which were unbelieving people] art engrafted [that is, incorporated into the church of God] in (place) of the same, [that is, in place of the branches which are broken off, which are the unbelieving Jews Gr. In the same] and art become co-partaker of the root, [that is, of the sap which comes forth out of the root, and spreads it self in the branches: which is here also called fatness, whereby are understood the advantages and promises made by God to the Jews] and fatness of the olive-tree. [that is, of the church of the Israelites.]
\p
\v 18 . Boast not against the branches, [that is, the Jews, who because of their unbelief are now broken off, namely, as if by nature ye were more worthy of this grace] and if thou boast against them, thou bears not the root, but the root thee. [namely, this shall be answered thee, that thou hast no cause to boast against them, forasmuch as thou are agraff, which bears not the root, but art born by the same.]
\p
\v 19 .thou wilt say therefore, [That is, this then wilt think and say, why thou mightiest boast against them] the branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.
\p
\v 20 . It is well: [That is, it is so: this the Apostle answers] they are broken off by unbelief, [that is, but this thou must know and think withal , that they are broken off through their infidelity, whereunto thou unto also art inclined by nature, and mighest likewise fall, if thou should imitate their example] and thou stands by faith; [that is, art engrafted, and hast hitherto continued standing] be not high conceited [namely, either of any worthiness of your own, for which ye should be ingraffed, or of your abilities of yourselves, to continue standing] but fear, [namely, lest ye also fall into unbelief, and thereby be also cut off. This fear is an holy carefulness to pre serve in faith, which can well stand with assurance of salvation, Phil 2.12.]
\p
\v 21 . For if God spared no: [Namely, but cast them out of the Church and Covenant] the natural branches, [Gr. Which are according to nature, i.e. the Jews, which are in a natural way a descended from the holy Fathers, with whom and their seed, God made his Covenant, Gen. 17.7. and who were born in the Jewish Church] (take heed) lest perhaps he spared not thee neither. [namely, who being taken out of a wild olive tree art graffed in as a strange branch, that he do not cast of thee also for the same cause]
\p
\v 22 . Behold therefore [That is, take notice therefore in this matter of both these properties of God, which show themselves therein] the graciousness [or good-naturedness, i.e. grace, mercy] and the severity [Gr. Cutting off, excision, as they that are severe out their words off short, i.e. strict justice] of God: severity indeed upon them that fell, [that is, upon the Jews, who fell into unbelief, and therefore were justly cast off by God. Namely, to be admonished and warned by their example to take to take heed to yourselves that you do not also fall into unbelief, and so with them be justly cast off] but graciousness towards thee [namely, who art graciously called out of the Gentiles, without any worthiness or merit: to be admonished thereby, that that ye ought not to boast against the Jews,] if thou continue in the graciousness [that is, in the state of grace and kindness of God thou art set. See the like phrase ver. 31.] otherwise thou [the Apostle speaks here also of the whole body, of the Gentiles that were called, as ver. 17.] also shalt be cut off. [namely, as unprofitable branches, John 15. v.2.6. that is, be cast off
\p
\v 23 . But they also, [Namely, the Jews or the Jewish nation] if they abide not in unbelief shall be graffed in: [that is, be brought again unto the Church of God] for God is able to graff the same again. [that is to change their hard hear, to endure them with faith, and thereby as it were to graff them in again.]
\p
\v 24 . For if thou [Namely, who art a called Gentile] art cut off [namely, not to be cast away, but to ingraffed] out of the olive-tree, which was wild by nature, [that is, out of the Gentiles who by nature were strangers from the Testament of promises, Eph.2.12] and contrary to the nature [namely, of thy descent, forasmuch as thou was wild olive-tree, and by the special grace of God art ingraffed into the right or genuine olive-tree] ingraffed into the good olive-tre: how much more shall these, who are natural (branches) [namely, Jews, which are descended from the Fathers, with whom God made his Covenant] be graffed into their own olive-tree? [namely, from whence they were cut off.]
\p
\v 25 . For I will not brethren that this mystery [That is, this thing, which hitherto hath been little known] be unknown unto you; (lest you be wise with yourselves) [that is, conceited or high minded in your own eyes, Prov. 3.7. Rom. 12.16.] that hardness [that is, disobedience as ver. 30.32. see ver.7.] in part [that is, not of all Jews but of some, though very many. For there was still always some remnant saved, and hereafter they shall in great multitude be converted] is come upon Israel, [that is, the people of Israel: the Jews] until the fullness of the Gentiles [that is, the full number: or the multitude of the Gentiles, and as it were the body of them. See the like ver. 12.] shall be come in. [namely, by confession of the Christian faith, into the Church of God.]
\p
\v 26 .And so [That is, then: namely, when the fullness of the Gentiles shall be gone in] All Israel [that is, not some few, but a very great multitude, and as it were the whole Jewish nation] shall be saved: [namely, being powerfully called by the preaching of the Gospel, and justified by faith] as it is written, deliverer [Gr. He that plucks out, namely, one out of any trouble. Hebr. Goel. Whereby the Messiah is understood, who was the next kinsman of the Jews shall pluck and deliver them out of destruction] shall come out of Sion, and shall turn away ungodliness [namely, turning them from them by the spirit of regeneration, and forgiving them unto them] from Jacob. [that is, which is posterity of Jacob.]
\p
\v 27 . And this is a Covenant unto them [Namely, to the Jews, who for the cause, seeing this Covenant is firm and unchangeable, shall yet be converted to the faith, that thereby their sins may be forgiven and taken away] from me, when I shall take away their sins.
\p
\v 28 . They are indeed [This is an answer to an objection, that it was not very probable, that the Jews should be received again; forasmuch as by their rejection of the Gospel they were hated of God. The Apostle acknowledgeth that indeed there were therefore hated, but that nevertheless for another reason they were also beloved, namely, because they were descended from the Fathers, whom God hath chosen for his people] enemies [that is, hated of God] concerning the Gospel. [that is, because at the present they reject and oppose the Gospel] for your sake: that is, because they hate and persecute you because of the confession of the Gospel. Or that you Gentiles might be called and ingraffed in their place] but concerning the election [that is, seeing God hath chosen this nation out of all other for his people, and hath still his elect amongst them] they are beloved [namely, of God, i.e. acceptable of God] for the Fathers sake. [that is, because of the Covenant that God made with Abraham and his posterity, and the other Patriachs , from whom the Jews are descended, Gen. 17.7.]
\p
\v 29 . For the Fre-gifts and the calling of God are not to be repented of. [That is, such that God doth not repent of the same i.e. is unchangeable: for with men change of purpose precedes from thence, that it repenteth them to have taken such purpose, 1 Sam.15.29. 2 Cor. 7.10.]
\p
\v 30 . For like as ye [That is, who are called of the Gentiles] also, formerly [namely, before Christ came, and was preached unto you] were disobedient unto God, [namely, not believing his word, nor keeping his commandments] but now have obtained mercy [that is, are called to faith, of Gods mercy, by the preaching of the Gospel] by the disobedience of these: that is, by occasion that the Jews were disobedient to the Gospel, God hath let the Gospel come unto you ver.11. Disobedience is more than unbelief, for it signifies a stiff-neckedness that they will not believe.]
\p
\v 31 . even so these also were now disobedient [Namely, since Christ came and is preached unto you] that they also by your mercy [namely, which is showed to you i.e. by the powerful calling and faith which God of mere mercy and grace hath given to you Gentiles] might obtain mercy. [namely, observing the mercy which is showed to the Gentiles, by the same grace might be stirred up to follow their example, and so to made partakers of the same mercy of God also.]
\p
\v 32 . For God hath concluded [Or, as it were bound together] them all [namely, as well Jews as Gentiles] under disobedience, that he might be merciful to them all. [that is, that as well Jews as Gentiles should be saved by Gods mercy and grace, and not by their own merits. So that the word all is not understood for every men in particular, for that is not done; but of that all are saved of the Jews or Gentiles: namely none of them is saved, but by mercy. See John 12.32. Gal3.22.]
\p
\v 33 . O depth [That is, exceeding great mystery os spiritual wisdom] of the riches both of wisdom and knowledge of God! [not which God worketh in us, but which is in God himself, by which he wisely disposeth and ordereth all things] how unsearchable are his judgement? [that is, the ways and courses which he takes in disposing and ordering of men’s election and reprobation] and his ways [that is, his reasons why he doth thus or thus] not to be found out.
\p
\v 34 . For who hath known the mind of the Lord? [Or, manning, thoughts, purpose counsel] or who was his counselor? [namely, who should have given him counsel, and on whom he should bring about salvation for his greatest honor. Namely, no man but himself according to his infinite wisdom.]
\p
\v 35 . Or who hath first given him, [Or, given before i.e. first had or done any good for Gods honor, whereby God should be obliged unto him] and it shall be recompensed unto him again? [namely, according to desert: to wit if thereby any man any recompense that therefore salvation is given by him not merit but of grace. Psalm 16.2,]
\p
\v 36 . For of him, [Namely, as the first cause, which orders and disposeth all things according to his wise counsel] and by him [namely, as who worketh all things that are necessary to mans salvation, and powerfully that which is ordained, according to his wise counsel] and to him, [namely, as to the outmost end, to whose glory all things must tend to end be brought, Prov. 16.4.] are all things; [namely, not only which concerns creation, preservation, and governing of all creatures, but especially which concern the salvation of men, which here is principally treated of] to him (be) glory for ever. Amen. [of this word see Matth.6.ver.13.]
\c 12
\s I The Apostle having thus far in the foregoing Chapters handled the principal articles of the Christian Religion, begins now according to his usual method in almost all his Epistles, that part of this Epistle which consist in exhortation to a godly Christian life, whereof the first is that we offer up our selves to God, and be not like into the world. 3 Afterwards he earnestly and in particular exhorteth those who had public Offices and especially gifts in the Church, that they should not be proud of their Offices or gifts, but faithfully administer and imply the same for the greatest edification of the Church, 6 as well the Teachers of the word, 8 as the Elders and Deacons. 9 Adjoins several exhortations to all manner of Christian virtues, as sincere brotherly love 11 fervent zeal of Gods glory, 12 hope, patience, prayer 13 communicativeness, 17 forbearance, 18 peacableness 20 lover to our enemies, 21 and steadfastness in that which is good.
\p
\v 1 Beseech [Or, I Exhort] you therefore brethren, by the mercies of God [that is, seeing then God hath showed us mercy in Christ, as was taught in that which goes before which the word therefore shows] that ye set [that is, offer up: as the sacrifices were presented before the Lord, and there set before him, and so appropriated to him] your bodies [that is, your whole selves. A Hebrew phrase, whereby a part is taken for the whole : as the time is interpreted, 1 Thes. 5.23.] for a living [that is, not corporally put to death by slaying, but spiritually slain by mortifying our lust to live to God, Rom. 6.11. 2.Cor. 5.15. Col. 3.3.5.] holy [that is, as the beast which were offered up in the old Testament, must without spot or defect; Exod. 12.5. Levit. 1,ver.10. Deut. 15.21. that we should separate selves from all unholiness] ] (and) well-pleasing sacrifices to God, [that is, proceeding from upright and contrite heart, purified by faith, without which no sacrifices are pleasing to God, Isa. 1.11. and 66.3. Jer. 6.20. and 7.20. Hos. 6.6. Hebr. 11.4.6.] (which is) your reasonable worship. [that is, a worship which consists not in outward offering up of unreasonable beasts, as in the old Testament, but in a spiritual offering up of a reasonable men, i.e. of your selves Heb. 13.15. 1 Pet. 2.5.]
\p
\v 2 . And be not comfortable [That is, take not upon you the form or fashion of this wicked world. Now what manner of form was, the Apostles describes, Rom. 13.13. Eph. 4.18.19. and Peter 1 Pet 4.3. and John 1. John 2.16.] to this world [Gr. To this age. Namely, which lieth the wickedness, 1 John 5.19.] but be ye changed [Gr. Altered in form or fashion: not according to the body, as the Poets in their fables, feign sometimes to have been done, but according to the soul and the faculties of the same, namely, according to the understanding and according to the will and affections] by the renewing of your mind [or understanding, See Eph. 1.18. and 2.3. and 4.23. Col.1.21.] that they may prove [that is, discern: or give proof by your godly life that ye understand what is the good will of God] what is the good, and the well-pleasing, and perfect will of God. [namely, according to which as the only and perfect rule we ought to frame our lives: which in his word hath perfectly revealed unto us.]
\p
\v 3 . For by the grace which is given unto me [That is, according to the Apostolical office which of grace committed unto me, according to the authority which as an Apostle and Ambassador of God is by him given me] I say [that is, I command] to every one [namely, who hath any public administration of free gift] which is among you, that he be not wise above that which men ought to be wise: [Gr. Be not overwise. Namely, beyond his capacity or calling . Or that he have not a conceit, that he hath more abundant wisdom than others] but that he shall be wise [namely, in divine things: for they may, yea must be searched into by us, with reverence and attentive diligence] unto modesty [namely, of the understanding, or of knowledge: as the Greek word imports: contenting himself with knowledge of the things which are necessary or serviceable to salvation] even as God [that is, considering that it is God that hath given you the knowledge which you have, 1Cor. 7.17. and that therefore you must not be proud of the same] hath dealt [namely, as an householder, who distributes to every one of his family a portion, to the one somewhat more, to the other somewhat less, to one this, to the other somewhat else] to everyone [that is, considering also thou hast not knowledge alone, but that the same, and oft-times also yet greater, is imparted to another] the measure of faith. [that is, according to the portion, which is by God distributed to each one of the faithful. For there is no man which hath a perfect knowledge of all things, but one hath lesser, another greater 1 Cor.7.7. and chapter 13.9. Eph. 4.7.]
\p
\v 4 . For as we have many members in one body [This he explains by the similitude of a body, and the members of the same: whereby he proves that all the Offices and gifts which the one or the other members of the Church hath, according to the communion of the Saints, must be employed for the common edification of the whole body of the Church. See of this similitude also 1 Cor. 10.17. and chap 12.12 Col. 2.19. and chap 3.15.] and all the members have not the same operation.
\p
\v 5 . Even so we being many are one body in Christ, but we are each one members one of anothers.
\p
\v 6 . Having now different [Namely, some extraordinary, of which the Apostle treats 1 Cor. chapter 12.14. some ordinary, which are principally treated of here: which are also divers, as is hereafter declared] gifts [Gr. Charismata; So the Ministry, and the gifts needful thereunto are called, because there are of grace freely given to men by God ] according to the grace which is given unto us.
\p
\v 7 . Let us bestow those gifts [Others supply this thus: whether it be prophecy, let us be wise according to the measure of faith etc.] whether it be prophecy, [that is, the gift or calling to the prophecy, whereby is understood not so much the gift to foretell things to come, as the Prophets of the old Testament had, and in the new, Agabus, Paul, Peter, John and others, as this word is taken, 1 Cor.12.28. Eph. 4.11. as of interpreting the true meaning of the holy Scripture, and applying it to the comfort and exhortation of the Church: See 1 Cor. 14. ver. 1.3.] according to the measure of faith [Gr. Analogian: whereby is understood either the measure of knowledge which given any man of God as ver. 3. and Eph. 4.7. Or the conformity and agreement of the chief points of Christian doctrine, plainly expressed in Gods word, and in the articles of faith, all interpretations of Scripture must be made] whether it be ministry, [Gr. Diakonian which word is here taken in common for the ministries, which are hereafter divided into particular sorts. See 1 Cor..12.5. Acts 1.17.] in ministering : whether it be he that teacheth, [that is, he that is called to be a teacher: which teachers seeing they are distinguished from the exhorters, therefore some think, that hereby are especially understood, those that are called principally to expounded Christian doctrine, and to defend the same against false teachers and gainsayers] in teaching:
\p
\v 8 . Whether it be he that hath exhorteth [Or, comforted: whereby may be understood the teachers who are called principally to apply Christian doctrine to the Church for exhortation and comfort: who are otherwise called Pastors Jer. 3. 15. and 23.4. Zach. 10.2. Eph. 4.11. 1 Pet.5.2.] in exhorting: he that distributed, [that is, he that is called to gather the alms and collections of the Church, and to distribute them to the poor according to their necessities, who are especially called Deacons. See concerning them, Acts 6.] in simplicity: [namely, of heart, not being harsh and high minded against the poor, not giving either of the favor or envy: but with a compassionate and single heart looking upon their necessity, and faithfully assisting them according to the same] he that is president [or, he that is set over others. Whereby may be understood the Elders which labor not in the word, 1 Tim. 5.17. but together with the Pastors have oversight of the Church, to rule the same, and keep it in Christian peace and discipline, which are otherwise called Governments, 1 Cor. 12.28.] in diligence: he that showed mercy [thereby may be understood a certain sort of Deacons and Deaconess, which had a special oversight and administration about the sick exiles, and strangers, 1 Tim5.9. which is one of the most special works of mercy] in cheerfulness. [that is, with a willing & propense heart, without growing weary of that troublesome service, or showing themselves forwards towards the poor.]
\p
\v 9 . Let love [Amongst the Christian virtues this is set foremost, because all other virtues are contained therein, and must be accompanied with the same, Rom. 13. ver.8.9.10. 1 Cor. 13.2. 1 Tim. 1.5.] but unfeigned. [that is, consisting not only in words and outward gestures, but chiefly in sincere inclination of the heart, 1 Pet. 1.22. 1 John 3.18.] Abhor that which is evil [he exhorts not only to avoid evil, but also to hate it as an abominable thing, Psal. 139.22.] and adhere to that which is good. [Gr. Cleave to, or be cleaved unto. Namely, as is were with glue, holding fast to that which is good, without being plucked off from it, 1 Cor. 6.16,17. In these two points consist the conversion of man, Psalm 34.15. Isa. 1.16.]
\p
\v 10 . Love one another heartily [The Greek word signifies such of a love, wherewith Parents naturally love their children, which is the greatest and most vehement]with brotherly love, [that is, such as becometh them, who are not only of the flesh, Isa. 58.7. but also by faith are brethren of one Father in heavens, 1 Thes. 4.9. Heb. 13.1. 1 Pet. 1.22. and chap 2. ver 17.] with honor one goes before the other. [that is, treat one another with all civil respect and courtesy, according to every ones condition, without expecting that thou be first so treated by thy brother.]
\p
\v 11 . Be not slow [Or, lazy] in giving diligence. [Gr. In diligence, i.e. in looking diligently after the works of your calling] Be fervent [that is, zealous, not lukewarm, Revel. 3.16.] in spirit. Serve the Lord: [that is, as servants of the Lord, diligently perform all things that are required to his service and honour, Psalm 2.11. Eph. 6.7. Others in the Greek for Kyrio, i.e. the Lord; read Kayrio, i.e. the time: in such sense as Eph. 5.16. and Col. 4.5.]
\p
\v 12 . Rejoice ye [In this verse are showed three remedies to be used in time of crosses and adversity] in hope. [namely, in deliverance and salvation] Be patient in tribulation. Persevere in prayer.
\p
\v 13 . Communicate [That is, take you also your part in giving to the relief of the poor. Or have communion in the necessities of the Saints] to the necessities of the Saints. [that is, of the poor Christians that suffer want] Pursue hospitality [Gr. Follow or follow after hospitality, hunt after it; as Abraham and Lot did. Gen. 18.1.2. and 19. ver.1.2.]
\p
\v 14 . Bless them which persecute you: bless [This word he rehearseth once more, to show how need full thee exhortation is] and curse nor. [namely, as commonly carnal men do 1 Cor. 4.12. 1 Pet. 2.23.]
\p
\v 15 . Rejoice with joyful: [that is, if it go well with your neighbour, that he hath caused to be glad for it, rejoice thou also for his prosperity: and if on the contrary he be in misery and adversity, and is sorrowful for it, let his misery also go to thy heart, as if it concerns thy self, 1 Cor. 12.26. Heb. 13.3.] and weep with them that weep.
\p
\v 16 . Be of one mind [This is understood, not only of unity of opinion and understanding, in the chief points of Christian doctrine, but also principally of unity of minds and inclinations one toward another] one amongst another. Seek not after high things [that is, which are above your capacity, abilities or calling: or think not, namely, of yourselves high things] but apply yourselves [the Greek word signifies to suffer one self to be conducted by any other, i.e. to be condescend to any other] to the lowly. [namely, things or matters, as before he expressed high things, i.e. things which look towards lowliness] Be not wise with yourselves. [See ver.3.]
\p
\v 17 . Recompense to no man evil for evil [The same Christ teacheth also, Mat. 5.39.] Take care for [that is, give diligence carefully to provide] that which is honourable to all men. [that is, not only in the presence of God, but also before all sorts of men, as well before unbeliever as before believers, 2 Cor. 8.21.]
\p
\v 18 . If it be possible [Namely, that it may be done with a good conscience: or except the weakness of men be so great, that it be impossible to keep peace with them] as much as in you is [that is, do not give any cause of discontent, and on your part contribute all that is serviceable to keep or make peace] keep peace with all men. [namely, not only with believers whereunto he exhorts us, ver.16. but also with unbelievers which are without.]
\p
\v 19 . Avenge not your selves’ beloved: but give place unto wrath. [Some understand this of the wrath of men, either of him that is wronged, that he gives his wrath for the injury done unto him, place, i.e. time of assuage; or of him who doth wrong, that it should not be withstood, that we do not embitter him more, but decline his wrath and so give place to it. But that which followed seemed to require, that this must be understood of the wrath, i.e. of vengeance of God, which he shall take of him that doth wrong, to which wrath men gave place, when they leave revenge to God] For it is written; Vengeance (belongeth) to me, I will recompense saith the Lord.
\p
\v 20 . If therefore thine enemy [That is, who carries himself like an enemy towards thee, not whom thou hates or art an enemy to, for that becometh not Christians] hunger, [that is, be in necessity, and therein hath need of thy help: a part taken from the whole] feed him: do him all offices of love in his necessity] if he thirst, give him drink: For in doing that, thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head. [that is, thou shalt thereby stir him up, to know his injury, to turn from it, and to cease to thee any evil, as any one that hath a coal of fire laid on his head, presently feels the same and shakes it off, as not being able to endure it.]
\p
\v 21 . Be not overcome [Namely, thereby to be brought to desire of revenge] of evil, [that is, of wrong that it done thee] but overcome evil [that is, take away, break off, mitigate] by good. [that is, with long suffering and bountry.]
\c 13
\s 1 The Apostle further exhorts believers to subject themselves to Magistrates with due obedience, seeing their calling is from God, and they that do not so, thereby draw down punishment upon their own heads, and wound their consciences. 6 And consequently commands also to pay them custom and tribute, and to give them all reverence . 8 Afterwards he exhorts them to the exercise of brotherly love with a rehearsal of the commandments of the second Table of the Law. 11 Finally he exhorts them, that seeing the night of ignorance is passed away, and the light of the Gospel hath shined to them, they would beware of drunkenness, whoredome, hatred, strife, and such like sins, and endeavor after the contrary virtues, 14 and to that end put on the Lord Christ, laying aside the providing for the flesh unto lusts.
\p
\v 1 LET every soul [That is, every men, of what linage, state, calling, or age so ever he be, and consequently the minutes of the Church also] be subject [that is, must not be only obedient to them, but also duly acknowledge and honor them] to the powers [that is, the Magistrates, which are by Fod set over others, with power and authority] set over (them) [Gr. Having or excellent, i.e. having supreme power: whereby are understood not only the highest Magistrates, but also that are set in any office of government under them. 1 Tim 2.2. 1 Pet. 2.13,14.] For there is no power [that is, no Magistrate clothed with power] but of God: [namely, who hath not only instituted the office of Magistracy, but who also chooses and appointeth the persons thereunto, although for the most part by the means of men, Prov. 8.15. Dan. 4.32.] and the powers that are [namely, be they high or low, be they ordained of God. [that is, instituted amongst mankind, to rule them with order in Gods stead: although some of them abuse their power, which God permitted to punish the sins of the people, Job. 34.30.]
\p
\v 2 . So that he that opposeth the power, [Not only by rebellion as Absalom, but also by obedience in thing: which are not contrary to Gods word] resisteth the ordinance of God, and they that resist it, shall bring [Gr. Receive] a judgement [that is, a punishment, as well from God as from the Magistrate] upon themselves.
\p
\v 3 . For Rulers [That is, the Magistrates set over us] are not (for) a fear [namely, that they will punish] to good works [that is, when thou dost well and art obedient to their commands] but to evil, and transgressed their commands] Now wilt thou not fear the power? [that is, wilt thou be free from fear of being punished by them] Do good and thou shalt have praise of them. [that is, be praised by them, and honored with recompense. For the offences of the magistracy is not only to punish evil, but also to reward that which is good, by which two things, as by sinews, the body politick is bound and kept together.]
\p
\v 4 . For it is Gods [That is, appointed by God, to serve thee as Gods instrument] for good to thee: [that is, to bring all good to thee by the same, and to take care for thy welfare. See the annot. On 1 Tim. 2.2.] but if thou doth evil, [that is, transgressed the good Law of the Magistrates] then fear: [namely, that thou shalt be punished by them for it] For it beareth not the sword [that is, hath received the power to punish evil doers even with death itself, Gen. 9.6. and causeth not the sword to be born before him without cause, and wears it by his side to give to understand that he hath such power, and will also execute the same against the evil doers] in vain. For it is Gods Minister, a revenge [namely, in Gods name to whom vengeance belongeth, Rom. 12.19.] for punishment [Gr. Wrath. See the like Mat. 3.7. Luke 21.23. Rom. 2.8.] to him that doth evil.
\p
\v 5 . Therefore it is necessary [Namely, to be true subjects, and especially true Christians] to be subjects, not only for punishment. [that is, for fear of punishment. Gr. Wrath] but also for conscience sake. [that is, because we know that God hath ordained and commanded this, and that this cause no man can have a good and conscience, which doth it not.]
\p
\v 6 . For therefore [That is, it appears that ye are and ought to be subject to Magistrates, because we pay tribute. See Mat. 22.21.] also ye pay [namely, to the Magistrates, or those that are appointed by them for this purpose] tributes [whereby are understood all burdens which era imposed on the subjects] for [this is a reason to prove it to be equal that we should be obedient to Magistrates, and pay tribute] that are ministers of God, [Gr. Lettourgoi. Which word we here see to be used, not only of the Ecclesiastical Ministries, as Acts 13.2. but also of politick and civil administrations. See also Rom. 15. 27. Heb. 1. 14.] being continually busied [Gr. Persevering to this same thing i.e. continually abiding labour, difficulty, trouble and care in this service. See of this word Acts 1.14.] in this same thing. [namely, to serve God in governing of the people.]
\p
\v 7 . Give therefore [Gr. Render or, recompense every one to their dues] to every one [namely, Magistrates, although it may also be taken in general] that which ye owe: tribute [it is properly that which is laid upon personal or real estate] to whom ye (owe) tribute: custom [it is that which is laid upon merchandise, or upon goods and wares that are imported exported] to who ye (owe) costume: fear to whom ye (owe) fear: [namely, to the Magistrates and their offices, whom they make use to punish evil doers] honour, to whom ye (owe) honor, [namely, to Magistrates, whether they be high or low, 1 Pet. 2.17.]
\p
\v 8 . Be not ought indebted to any man, [That is, pay every one that whereunto ye are engaged into him, whether is money, service or anything else; which when it is not done, the engagement and debt remained] but to love one another. [for that engagement can never be done away, or paid off, but remains always fresh, which must continually be paid] For he that loveth another, [that is, his neighbor] he hath fulfilled [that is, done and observed that , not only which was required of one or two commandments, but in all commandments together, in respect of all the parts of them: although in regard of the degrees of perfection, no man can fulfill the same in this life, seeing our love is still imperfect here, 1 Kings 8.46. Ps. 19.13. Pro. 20.9. Jam. 3.2.1. Job. 1.8.] the Law [that is, the commandments of the second Table of the Law, as is declared in the following verse.]
\p
\v 9 . For this, thou shalt not commit adultery , [The Apostle keeps not the order of the commandments, as they are propounded in the ten commandments, because that matters not so much, so that all the commandments be but well kept] thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not bear false witness, thou shalt not covet, and if there be any other commandment, it is comprehended as in a capital sum, in this word, [that is, in this one commandment] (namely) in this, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self.
\p
\v 10 . Love [Here he describes the nature of love, as also 1 Cor. 13] doth not ill to his neighbor, Therefore is love the fulfilling of the Law. [See v. 8. and 1 Tim. 1.5.]
\p
\v 11 . And this (I say the rather) seeing we know the opportunity of time, [that is, seeing we are now more unbelieving, as we were in former times, being in the dark night of ignorance, Eph. 4.18. Col. 1.13. 1 John 2.8. but seeing Christ the son of righteousness, Mal. 4.2. and the light of the world, John 8.12. hath now appeared to us] that it is the hour that we now awake out of sleep: [namely, of sin, Eph. 5.14. 1 The. 5.6.] for salvation [or our salvation is now nearer i.e. the price of our heavenly calling in Christ Jesus, which we run and pursue after, 1 Cor. 9. v24,25. Phi. 3.14. is now nearer to us [that is, we are now by our Christian course come nearer to the same, shortly to lay hold of it, Phi. 3.12. 1 Tim. 6.12. and therefore we must not faint before we have finished this Christian race, 2 Tim. 4.7. Seeing it would be great shame and loss, that being come so nigh through fainting or turning away we should not obtain the same, For by how much nearer any one cometh to the prize, so much that the faster he ought to run] then when we (first) believed. [that is, when we were first called and converted to the faith of Christ.]
\p
\v 12 . The night [Nam. Of ignorance, 1 The. 5.5.] is passed away, [the Greek word signifies that the most part hereof is passed. For all darkness is not yet perfectly done away out of our heart, 1 Cor. 13.9.10.] and the day [namely, of saving knowledge. V. 13. 1 Thes. 5.5] is come nigh, of Christ, yet not perfect as long as we are in this life, but have such a light as there is when the day begins to break and wax light] Let us therefore put off [namely, as men when it becomes day cast away cloathsand coverings, and have no more to do with them, Eph. 4.22.] the works of darkness, [that is, sins, which they are yet in ignorance are wont to commit, and especially those ugly sins which men are even ashamed to do publicly in the light, but which they commit by night in darkness, Job. 24.15,16. Jo. 3.20.21. 1 Thes. 5.7. whereof some are rehearsed in the following verse] and upon on [or draw on, as they do who arising from sleep draw on their cloths to cover their nakedness, and to walk honestly in the day] the arms [this word signifies all that wherewith the is covered against all wounding: & here are understood by all manner of Christian virtues, wherewith our soul are not only clad & adorned, but also as it were armed against the wounds & temptations of the devil, and the flesh See Ro. 6.3. 2 Cor. 6.7. Eph. 6.11,12. etc. 1 Th. 5.8.] of light. [that is, which proceeds from the true knowledge of God, and to his glory gives light before men, and which becomes those who are called to this light, and will walk honestly in the light.]
\p
\v 13 . Let us walk [That is, order our lives and converse amongst them] decently [that is, not only our piously before God, but also fairly and honestly before men] as in the day: [that is, as becometh those, to whom by the grace of God the light of saving the knowledge hath appeared] not in rioting [whereby are understood not honorable and moderate feasts, Gen. 21.8. Job. 2.1. but gluttonous and immoderate, in which all manners of excess, wantonness, dancing and immodest practiced] and drunkenness, [or immoderate swallowing of wine or strong drink, Isa. 5.22.] not in bed-chambers [that is, adultery and fornications, which are commonly practiced in bed-chambers] and immodesties, [that is, lascivious unchaste wantonness] not in strife and envying.
\p
\v 14 . But put on [ Or draw on, as your garment or armour] the Lord Jesus Christ, [namely, by faith receiving his righteousness, and imitating all his virtues, cloathing and adorning your soul therewithal, Gal. 3.27.] and take not care [Gr. Make no provision of the flesh] for the flesh [that is, the body, whereby it is not forbidden that men might provide the body of a decent garment, meat, drink, physic and other things necessary for sustentation of the same: for that is even commended, Eph. 5.29. 1 Tim. 5.8,23. but not satisfy the same in its sinful lusts 1 Cor. 9.27.] unto lusts. [namely, which tend to intemperance, pride, gluttony, unchaste ness, therein to feed it, and to give it its desire, 1 John 2.16.]
\c 14
\s 1 The Apostle now teacheth further how believers must carry themselves towards the weak who did not yet well understand the doctrine of Christian liberty, especially concerning the differences of meat and days , namely, that they must receive the weak, and therefore not contend with them, that the weak must not condemn the others. 5 That booth weak and strong must aim at one end to serve God thereby, 7 seeing we are always bound to promote his glory both in life and death, 9 even as also Christ therefore died and rose again, that we might give him as our Lord and Judge, an account of all actions 13 that therefore the strong take heed that they give no scandal to the weak. 14 That now indeed the difference of meats and daise ceaseth, but that this liberty must not be used to the grieving and weakening of others for whom Christ died also, 17 Seeing Chr. Rel consisteth not in mear and drink. 19 that in these things men must always seek after peace, 20 and rather not eat and drink that which would offend the weak 22 and further in these things do nothing on either side with a doubting conscience, seeing that is sin.
\p
\v 1 NOW him that is weak in the faith [That is, he that out of weakness doth not yet rightly understand the point of the abolishing of the ceremonies of the Old Testament: as they were many Jews at that time, who were converted to the Christian Religion, who because the ceremonies were instituted by God himself, and they were brought up in the same, could not then believe that they might or ought to be laid aside, and therefore took offence when the believers of the Gentiles did not observe the same. Therefore he doth not here speaks of those who out of obstinacy maintained and taught that the observation of the ceremonies was still necessary to salvation, against whom he deals in the Epistle to the Galatians] receive ye, [namely, as a brother, with all kindness, bearing the weakness in him. See Phil. V. 12.17.] (but) not to contentious [Gr. To contentious of conferences, or doubting of the thoughts, namely, they that do not bring him thereunto] conferences. [or reaspnings, disputations, i.e. that you do not too much and too eagerly dispute & strive with him thereabout, and so perplex him, and bring him to greater doubting: or that to please you, he doth nothing against his conscience.]
\p
\v 2 . One indeed [Namely, that he rightly understand the Christian liberty] believeth that all things [that is, all manner of meat that is to be eaten, without difference of clean or unclean, which was in the old Testament Levi 11.4. Deut. 14.7.] may be eaten, but he that is weak [i.e. in the faith.v.1.] eateth pot-herbs, [namely, rather than the herein he would not keep the Law, i.e. contents himself with meat food which was permitted in the Law, and abstains from flesh of swine, hairs, conies, and others forbidden on the Law, Lev. 11. 5. &c.]
\p
\v 3 . He that eateth [That is, he that believeth that a man may eat all manner of food, and doth so also] let him not despise him [Gr. Let him that account him as nothing. See of this word, Mark 9.12. Luke 23.11.] that eateth not : [namely, all manner of food, because he thinketh that this is not lawful] and he that eateth not, let him not judge [that is, condemn, namely, that he sins therein, or that therefore he is an irreligious man, or a condemner of the Law] him that eateth; for God hath received him. [that is, brought as well one as the other to the faith, and received him for one of his children in the communion of his church: and therefore he ought not be despised or condemned by men.]
\p
\v 4 . Who art thou [He reproves both the weak and the strong, that they despised and condemned one another] who judges [that is, condemns, v.3,] another servant? [that is, thy brother, who is not thine but Gods servant. Whereby he showed that such condemning is repugnant to the Law of nature itself, according to which no man may condemn another mans servant, over whom he hath no right] He stands [that is, if he do well] or he falleth [that is, if he sin] to his own master: [namely, to whom he belongs, and who only hath right to judge him; when therefore he doth not condemn him, his fellow servants ought not to condemn him] but he shall be set fast: [that is, more and more increase and be confirmed in faith] for God is able to set him fast: [that is, hath not only the will, for he hath received him, v.3. but also the power to strengthen him in the faith, so that you need not to or contend much with him thereabout.]
\p
\v 5 . The one [Namely, the believing Jew, who doth not yet understand Christian liberty] indeed esteemed [Gr. Judgeth, i.e. thinketh that the feast days of the old Testament must yet be observed, and that therefore one is holier then another] the one day above the (other) day: but the other [namely, the believing Gentile, who understandeth Christian liberty] esteemed all days [Gr. Everyday, or each day, i.e. holds that the difference of days now ceaseth, and that we are not obliged to the feast-days of the old Testament] (alike) Let every one [namely, whether he eateth or eateth not: makes difference of days, or makes no difference] be fully assured, [ namely, that in so doing sinneth not, and intendeth not to offend God, and wittingly to do contrary to his will, and that consequently he also search diligently which of the two is pleasing to God] in his own mind. [or in his own understanding.]
\p
\v 6 . He that taketh notice of a day, [That is, the feast days of the old testament, which the weak amongst the Jews thought must also be observed in the new Testament] he takes notice of (it) to the Lord: [that is, intendeth nothing else but thereby to give God service and honour: So that both the weak and the strong aim at all one end and scope, and therefore must not condemn one another] he that taketh no notice of a day, he taketh no notice of (it) to the Lord, He that eateth [namely, all kind of meat, and thinketh that this is lawful, v.2.] he eateth (that) to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; namely, the strong for his liberty, and for the meat which he enjoyeth with a good conscience] and he that eateth not, he eateth (that) not to the Lord, and he giveth God thanks. [namely, the weak one, howsoever he thinketh some meat to be forbidden, that nevertheless God afford him wherewith may be fed with a good conscience, 1 Tim. 4.5.]
\p
\v 7 . For no man of us [Namely, believing Christians, whether strong or weak] liveth to himself, [that is, must order his life not according to his own lust or profit: or as he will, seeing he is not his own, but is subject to another, namely, to the Lord, according to whose command, and for whose service he must frame his life] and no man dieth to himself. [namely, as if with his death it was wholly done with him.
\p
\v 8 . For whether we live, we live to the Lord, [That is, we are subject to the command of the Lord Jesus Christ, as being his proper servants, bought by his blood, and must therefore bestow our lives for his service and honour] whether we dye, we dye to the Lord. [that is, we must be ready to lay down our lives for the service and honour of our Lord, whensoever it pleaseth him: and after our death shall give an account of our doings] Therefore whether we live, or whether we dye, we are the Lords, [that is, we are Christ’s property & servants, which are subject to him, and according to his command must live and & dye.]
\p
\v 9 . For this purpose also Christ died, [Here he proves that Christ is our Lord; and that he got his right of dominion over us, by his death and resurrection, 1 Cor. 6.20. 1 Pet. 1.18.] and rose, and became alive again, that he might have dominion both over dead and living. [that is, over all believers, as well they are that are yet alive, as those that are dead in the Lord, and that shall be raised up by him again.]
\p
\v 10 . But thou [Namely, weak one] why dost thou judge [that is, condemn v,3.] thy brother? [that is, the believing Christians, which understand and use their Christian liberty] Or thou also [namely, strong in faith] why despiseth thou [see v.3.] thy brother? [namely, who doth not yet understand Christian liberty, no dares to use it because of his weakness] For we shall also be set before the judgement-seat of Christ. [that is, before the judgement of God, where Christ shall sit as judge, 2 Cor. 5.10. to whom alone also belongs to judge over the consciences, and to whom we must give an account of all that we have done or omitted, v.12.]
\p
\v 11 . For it is written, I live [That is, as truly as I live: manner of taking an oath which the Lord often useth, Num. 14.v.21.28. Isa. 49.18. Jer. 22.24. Ezek. 5.11. and 14.16,18. and 20.3.] saith the Lord: [that which is spoken by the Prophet of Jehovah the true God, is here ascribed to Christ, to show that he is also true God] every knee shall bow [that is, yield reverence and obedience as to their Lord. See Phil. 2.10.] before me, [namely, Christ the Son of God, and Saviour. See Eph.1.20,22. Phil. 2.10.] and every tongues and mouths confesses me to be true God, and their Lord Judge, Rom. 10.v.9,10.] shall confess [or praise, thank] God.
\p
\v 12 . So then every one of us [Whosoever he be, great or small, weak or strong] shall give an account [namely, how we have carried our selves in this life. See Mat.25. 2 Co. 5.10.] for himself, [that is, of his own actions and omissions, and not of another mans actions] to God. [that is, to the Lord Christ, who is true God, and shall transact the judgement of God.]
\p
\v 13 . Let us not therefore judge [That is, condemn, v.4,10. namely, seeing judgement belongeth to the Lord Christ] one another anymore: but judge this rather, [that is, esteem and acknowledge that this is best and most seemly, namely, that ye [namely, that are strong] give [Gr. Put or lay] no stumbling-block or offence [namely, that by your unreasonable use of Christian liberty, or rash condemning, he be not estranged from the Christian Religion. See 1 Cor. 8.9.] to your brother. [namely, who is yet weak.]
\p
\v 14 . I know [That is, although I know well] and am assured in the Lord Jesus, [that is, by the Lord Christ. See Acts 10.15.] that nothing [i.e. no meat] is unclean, [Gr. Is common. See Acts10.14. namely, now in the New Testament, since the coming of Christ] in it self [or by it self, i.e. of its own nature, Gen. 1.v31. and chapter 9.2,3. He speaks of meats to be eaten Howsoever therefore afterwards sow of them respect of Gods prohibition were unclean of time, yet now they are all to be accounted clean, forasmuch as those shadows now cease, Col. 2.16. 1 Tim.4.v.3.4.] but he that esteemed any thing to be unclean. [that is, who doth not yet believe that the difference of meat now ceaseth, but thinketh that this prohibition of God must still be continued. For indifferent things are such as we esteem the same, when they may not be done or omitted without offence] to him it is unclean [that is, he may not against his judgement eat such meat, for therein he should that which he himself holds to basin]
\p
\v 15 . But if thy Brother [That is, thy weak fellow-believer] be grieved [namely, when he seeth that thou who art strong, eats meat which was forbidden in the old Testament, thinking that therein thou sinest against God, which grieveth the godly. Or seeing that thereby thou dost as it were despise and condemn them] because of meat, [that is, because he seeth that thou eat meat which he holds to be forbidden by God to Christians] thou walkest no more according to love. [for that grieveth or offendeth no man, but seeks to condescend to the weak to yield to them, and strengthen them in faith, 1 Cor. 13.4, &c.] Destroy him not [namely, as much as in thee is, thereby estranging him from the Christian Religion. Or if he follows thine example against his conscience, thereby wounding the same, whereby his faith is brought to danger] with thy meat, [that is, eating meat before him which he thinks to be still forbidden] for whom Christ died. [namely, to save him, whom thou as much as lieth in thee, destroyest, which is an abominable sin, which is also committed against Christ, 1 Cor. 8.12. Otherwise according to the judgement of charity we must account all those that confess the faith of Christ, for such whom Christ hath redeemed by his death. For that they that are once truly redeemed by the death of Christ shall not perish, is taught, Mat. 24.24. John. 10.28. 1 Pet. 1.5.]
\p
\v 16 . Let not therefore your good [That is, your Christian liberty and the use of the same] be reproached. [as well by the weak Christians as by those that are without, when they shall see that the Christians contend one with another for such slight matter.]
\p
\v 17 . For the Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, [That is, the Kingdom of glory or eternal salvation, is not obtained by eating or not eating of meat, neither is the Kingdom of grace or true godliness promoted thereby. See 1 Cor. 8.8.] but righteousness, [namely, of God or Faith, which is described before, Rom. 4.5. wherewith holiness of life must be joined also] and peace, [namely, quietness in our hearts and consciences, by being assured that we and our actions are acceptable to God by faith, Rom. 5.3. and also outward peace and unity amongst brethren] and joy, [that is, a spiritual joy in heart, arising from a firm hope of salvation, and from observing the welfare of the Church flourishing in peace] by the Holy Ghost. [Gr. In the Holy Ghost, i.e. which is wrought and kindled by the Holy Ghost, and is a spiritual, not a worldly joy.]
\p
\v 18 . For he that in these things [That is, he that seeketh his righteousness by faith in Christ, strives after true holiness, and feels in himself the peace and joy of the Holy Ghost, and always endeavours after peace] serveth Christ, [that is, gives Christ the obedience and worship which he requireth of us] is well-pleasing to God, and acceptable [Gr. Approved, i.e. found and esteemed good and godly] to men [namely, who judge aright.]
\p
\v 19 . So then let us pursue [Gr. Follow after, i.e. seek all manners of ways. See the like Psa. 34.15.] that which (serves) for peace, [that is, let us use all means to keep peace among the faithful, and avoid whatsoever might break or hinder the same] and that which (serves) for edification, [a similitude taken from the building up of an House or Temple. i.e. let us seek after that whereby the church of God which is the House of the living God, 1 Tim. 3.15. Heb. 3.6. may be built up and edified, Mat. 16.18. 1 Cor. 3.9. 2 Cor. 13.10. Eph. 4.12. 1 Tim. 1.4.] one among other. [that is, on both sides, each contributing that which is serviceable for the edification of the Church, the weak by increasing in the knowledge of Christian liberty, and not condemning the others: and the strong in receiving of the weak, with avoiding of giving offence, and of despising of the weak.]
\p
\v 20 . Break not [Gr. Unloose not, or dissolve not, namely, as much as lies in you, by unreasonable use of Christian liberty, despising and scandal: this is opposed to the building up or edifying] the work of God [that is, the faith of the weak brother, which God hath begun to work in him for his salvation: for it is a great sin to break down that which Hod builds] because of meat. [that is, for such a slight matter as it is to eat this or that meat] All things indeed are clean, [that is, I acknowledge indeed that it is now lawful for Christians to eat all kinds of meats. See v.14.] but it is evil [that is, sinful and hurtful] to the man who eateth with offence. [namely, of the weak.]
\p
\v 21 . It is good [that is, useful for the edification of the weak in the Church] to eat no flesh, nor to drink neither wine, nor (anything) whereat thy brother [namely, is yet weak in faith] stumbleth, [that is, when that eating or drinking, &c. gives offence to the weak. So that the abstaining from such meat or drink is good for avoiding of offence. See 1 Cor. 8.13.] or is offended, or (wherein) he is weak.
\p
\v 22 . Hast thou faith [Namely, whereby thou knowest and art assured Christians have the liberty to eat all kinds of meat. See v.2.14. and 1 Cor. 8.1.] have (it) to thy self namely, in thine own conscience, without showing the same with offence before the weak brethren] before God, [namely, who knows nevertheless that thou hast that faith, although though show it not in such a manner, Or have it so, that the use of it may please God, to whom we must give an account, and to whom we must not provoke] Blessed is he who is judgeth not [that is, condemneth not, namely, so abusing his liberty with offence, that thereby he deserves to be reproved by brethren, and to be judged by God] himself, in that which he approveth. [that is, that which he understand and esteemed to be lawful, when it is done without offence. Gr. In that which he proveth.]
\p
\v 23 . But he that doubteth [That is, who is not yet perfectly assured, that all kinder of meats are now clean and allowed] if he eat [namely, any meat forbidden in the old Testament] is condemned, [that is, wounds his conscience and makes himself liable to damnation] because he (eateth) not of faith: and whatsoever is not of faith, [that is, is done without being assured that the works which we do is pleasing to God in Christ . Or that proceeds not out of a believing heart, without which neither our works nor our persons can please God. Heb. 11.6.] that is sin.
\c 15
\s 1 The further exhorts the strong that they condescend to the weakness of their brethren, 3 by the example of Christ, who sought not himself, but our benefit, which he confirms out of the Scripture of the old Testament, which are also written to our comfort, 5 and that they should serve God and the Lord Christ with united hearts. 7 Declares more largely the example of Christ, how he served, both the Jews, 9 as also the Gentiles, which he also proveth out of the same Scriptures, 13 thereto joining a wish that they may increase in all Christian virtues and knowledge. 14 Afterwards he begins to conclude this Epistle, executing his freedom in writing, 17 and relating how powerfully God hath administered the same, 22 promiseth that he will come to Rome in his journey towards Spain, 25 and gives them to understand that he must first travel to Jerusalem, to carry thither the alms of the Churches of Macedonia and Achaia. 30 Requesteth of them that they pray for him and his ministry, 33 and wisheth them all good from God.
\p
\v 1 BUT [The Apostle includes himself also, that the exhortation may be the more powerful] that are strong [namely, in faith, and knowledge of Christian doctrine, especially of Christian liberty] ought [ or are engaged, bound, namely, for the reasons with Paul shall hereafter declare] to bear [that is, to bear with as a burden to take it from them, and help them to bear it. See Gal. 6.1,2.] the weakness [that is, the ignorance and errors which through weakness are yet in them, especially of this point of doctrine] of the impotent; [that is, of the weak, See Rom. 14.1.] and not to please ourselves [that is, follow our fences, or seek our own ease and profit, indulge our selves.]
\p
\v 2 . Therefore let every one of us [Namely, whosoever he is. No man is here excepted] please (his) neighbour [much more then this weak brother] for good [or in good, i.e. in things that are not evil: for the good, benefit, and salvation of his neighbour] unto edification. [See Rom. 14. ver. 19.]
\p
\v 3 For Christ also [The example of Christ ought to prevail much with Christians, as being a rule according to which they ought to frame their lives, John 13. ver 15.34. Phil. 2.5. and it would be great shame for that they should do otherwise, then he that done and taught before them] pleased not himself; [that is, sought not his own ease, honour or profit, Mat. 20.28.] but [namely, he so carried himself: happened unto him] as it is written, he reproaches [that is, the sins whereby men cast reproach upon God, or all manner of content and injury of the ungodly] of them that reproach thee are fallen upon me. [that is, I have taken upon me, or laid upon me to expiate them, David speaketh here as a type of Messiahs, and prophesying of him, who took our sins upon him to satisfy for the same Isa. 53.4,5. 2 Cor. 5.21. Therefore seeing it appears from thence that Christ sought not his own ease and benefit, but ours, and did so much for our sakes, so ought we in like manner to seek the good of our Neighbour, and to do all that is serviceable to his salvation. See Phil. 2. ver.5,6,7,8. 1 John 3.16.]
\p
\v 4 . For whatsoever was written before, [namely, in the Scripture of the old Testament: which may now also be said of the writings of the new] that was written before our learning: [or, instruction, namely, in matters which concerns our eternal salvation. See John 5.39. 2 Tim.3.16.] that we are through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, [that is, which are obtained by reading, hearing, and meditation of the Scriptures] might have hope. [namely, that we shall certainly obtain salvation by Christ.]
\p
\v 5 . But the God of patience [That is, who worketh the same in us by means of the holy Scriptures ver.4.] and of consolation grant you that ye may be of one mind [namely, in opinions concerning the true doctrine, and in good inclinations of the heart one to another. See Rom. 12.16.] one amongst another, according to Christ Jesus. [that is, according to orthodox doctrine of Christ. Or after the example of Jesus Christ.]
\p
\v 6 . That ye may with one accord, [Gr. Unanimously, i.e. with one heart and soul, Acts 4.32.] with one mouth, glorifieth the God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. [that is, God who is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Eph. 1. ver. 3,17.]
\p
\v 7 Therefore receive [See Rom. 14. ver. 3.] one another, [that is, as well the strong the weak, as the weak the strong: accounting one another for brethren, and brotherly treating one another in love and peace] as Christ also [that is, after the example of Christ] hath received us [namely, so that he even died the death for us] to the glory of God. [that is, to make us partakers of the glory of God. Or, that thereby the glory of God might be declared.]
\p
\v 8 . And I say [Here he declares more at large how Christ received both Jews and Gentiles, thereby admonish both of them, that they must also receive one another] that Jesus Christ was a minister to the circumcision [that is, of the Jews who are circumcised, Rom. 4.12. to whom who, being Lord over all, as a minister published the way of salvation; and exercised his ministry amongst them alone, Mat. 15.24. and chapter 20.28.] because of the truth of God, [namely, that that might not be weakened: but that God may be found true in his promise] that he might confirm the promise of the Fathers. [that is, which were formerly made to the Fathers in the old Testament. See 2 Cor.1.2o.]
\p
\v 9 . And that the Gentiles [Here he proves the second part, namely, that Christ hath also received the Gentiles: according to Gods promises and engagements in the old Testament] might Glorify God [that is, being brought to the knowledge of true God and to faith, might praise honour and serve him, and finally be also partakers of his glory] by reason of the mercy: [ or, for the mercy, namely, which of mere grace is showed to them also, as was done to the Jews, Deut. 7. ver. 7,8.] as is written, [in all these places which are here produced for proof out of the old Testament, the word Gentiles must chiefly be taken notice off. The expositions, see upon each place] Therefore I will confess thee among the Gentiles, and sing praise unto thy name.
\p
\v 10 . And again he saith, be joyful ye Gentiles with his people.
\p
\v 11 . And again Laud the Lord all ye Gentiles, and praise him all ye nations.
\p
\v 12 . And again Esay saith, there shall be the root of Jesse, and he that ariseth to command over the Gentiles: in him shall the Gentiles hope.
\p
\v 13 . Now the God of hope [That is, in whom men must hope, 1 Tim. 6.17. and who worketh in us by his promises and Spirit, 1 Pet. 1.3.] fill you with all joy [that is, with a true and continually spiritual joy, Phil. 4.4.] and peace in believing, [that is, while ye believe in this life. Or together with your faith, which let it be always accompanied with joy and peace] that ye may be abundant in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost. [Gr. In the power of the Holy Ghost, namely, who works these spiritual gifts and virtues in men by his power, 1 Cor. 12.6,11.]
\p
\v 14 . But my brethren [Here the Apostle begins to conclude this Epistle, excusing himself that he had written so largely and so boldly unto them, and promising that he himself would come unto them] I my self also am assured of you, [that is, I trust, or assure my self firmly according to the judgement of charity which believeth all things, 1 Cor. 13.7. Seeing I know that ye really show this] that ye your selves are also full of goodness, [and that in this regard division risen up among you about the use of indifferent things, proceeds not from weakness or hatred against one another, but from weakness,] filled with all knowledge, [that is, all manner of knowledge, namely, of spiritual things necessary to salvation: for howsoever there were many weak and ignorant ones among them, yet there were also many godly, understanding, and well exercised in Christian doctrine, in respect of whom he speaks this. See the like, 1 Cor. 1.5.] able also to admonish one another.
\p
\v 15 . But I have written to you the more boldly [Namely, by showing you your faults and reproving them here and there] in part [that is, the more boldly in some sort, or partly] brethren, as again putting you in mind (of this) [that is, that those things which you your selves well know, but do not so well put in practice, you might diligently consider of and well weigh the same] for the grace which is given to me of God. [namely, of the Apostleship, Rom, 1.5. i.e. because I am appointed and called thereunto for God, and I must faithfully acquit my self in thy office. See following verse. Or, by the grace.]
\p
\v 16 . That I may be a minister of Jesus Christ [Gr. Leitourgo. See of this word Acts 13.2. Rom. 13.6. Heb. 8.2.] among the Gentiles, [See Acts 9.15. and 13.2. Rom. 11.13.] administering [or, offering up, i.e. administering as an holy work: as the Priests work was] the gospel of God, [that is, which God hath committed to by trust, and commanded me to teach by preaching and writing] that the offering of the Gentiles [that is, not which the Gentiles shall offer up, as Rom. 12.1. but which I shall convert to God from among the Gentiles, and shall offer up to God by my ministry. See the like, Mal. 1.11.] may be acceptable, [see Rom.12.1.] being sanctified [see there also] by the Holy Ghost.
\p
\v 17 . I have glorying therefore [Namely, by reason that I have brought so many Gentiles to the faith by my ministry] in Christ Jesus [who hath blessed my ministry, and who as the only author of their conversion, hath wrought by me as his instrument] in those things which concern God. [Gr. Which to God, namely, belongs, as the only author of the blessing and success of my ministry.]
\p
\v 18 . For I should not dare to say anything [Namely, not be able with a good conscience to bring forth anything] with Christ hath not wrought by me [that is, which Christ hath not powerfully wrought by me as well as by anyone of the other Apostle, Gal. 2.8.] for obedience of the Gentiles [that is, to bring the Gentiles whose Apostle I principally am, unto the obedience of faith and of the Gospel] by words, [Gr. By word and by deed, i.e. by the preaching of the Gospel] and deeds. That is, by much labour, difficulty, and trouble, or by woundrous works and miracles, as is declared in the following verse.]
\p
\v 19 . By the power of sins and wonder (and) by the power of the Spirit of God, [That is, the powerful working of the Holy Ghost in the hearts of men] so that Jerusalem, and round about [i.e. in the Countries round about, as namely in Arabis, Gal. 1.17. at Damascus, Gal.1.17. at Antioch, Acts 13.1. at Seleucea Acts 13.4. in Cyprus, Acts 13.4. in Pamphylia, Acts 13.13. in Pisidia, Acts 13.14. in Lycaonia, Acts. 14.6. in Cilicia, Acts 15.41. in Phrygia, Acts 16.6. in Galatia, Acts 16.6. at Toas, Acts 16.8. at Athens, Acts 17.15. at Ephesus Acts 16.10. in Achaia, Acts 18.1 in Macedonia, acts 16.10. and other places. Or in the circuit, journeying from one place to another, hither and tither] even unto Illyrium, [a Country lying on the Adriatick Sea, and bordering up Macedogia, now called Slavonia] I have fulfilled the Gospel of Christ. [that is, I have filled all the Lands with the preaching and knowledge of the Gospel of Christ.]
\p
\v 20 . And wise so every desirous [Gr. Ambitious, namely, with an holy and laudable ambition being more diligent then others, first to preach everywhere] to publish the Gospel not where Christ [that is, the knowledge and doctrine of Christ] was named, [that is, published or known] that I might not build on others foundations: [that is, that we first laid there by another. See 1 Cor.3.10.]
\p
\v 21 . But as it is written, to whom it was not told of him, they shall see it: and who have not heard it, they shall understand it.
\p
\v 22 . Wherefore I was so hindered many times to come unto you: [Namely, to spread abroad the Gospel in those lands, where it had not yet been published, and to plant new Churches there. See Rom 1. 13.]
\p
\v 23 . But now have no place more [Namely, where the gospel needeth to be preached anew] in these quarters, [namely, of Sryia, Greece and Asia. Gr. Climasi, mwhereby are signified Countries which lie on divers elevations of the pole] and for many years ago having a great longing to come unto you.
\p
\v 24 . Whensoever I travel towards Spain [Namely, which I have purposed to do, because the Gospel was not yet published there] I will come unto you: [namely, by Gods will, or if it shall please God ver. 32. Rom. 1.10.] for I hope [that is, I am not well assured thereof by any revelation, but nevertheless have hope of it, as appears, Rom. 1.10.] in traveling through to see you, [that is, so take my journey that I shall go over Italy, and through Rome: for otherwise the nearest and rightest way to go out of Sryia, yea or Greece towards Spain, is not over Italy, but through between Africa and Sicilia, leaving Sicily with Italy on the right hand] and to conducted titherwards by you: [that is, by some of your Church, to accompany me, as also to assist me in my service] when I shall first be somewhat [that is, a little as ver.15.] satisfied [Gr. Filled] of your (presence)
\p
\v 25 . But now I travel to Jerusalem, [That is, that I do not immediately set upon my journey to come unto you, because I must first of necessity travel from hence to Jerusalem] ministering to the Saints. [that is, to carry the poor and afflicted believers in Jerusalem the alms which are gathered for them: as is declared in the following verse.]
\p
\v 26 . For it hath seemed good [Namely, out of their own free motion, and compassion] (to them of) Macedonia [that is, the Churches in Macedonia] and Achaia, to make a common contribution [Gr. A certain communion or imparting] to the poor among the Saints [that is, believers ver. 25.] which are at Jerusalem.
\p
\v 27 . For it hath (so) seemed good to them: [This he rearhesth to commend this benevolence, and thereby tacitly to admonish the Romans, that their ought to imitate their own example, seeing they were no less in good prosperity then of Greece] they are also their debtors. [that is, are obliged to give them assistance. This he saith, not to admonish their benevolence, but thereby civilly to admonish Romans, that they are obliged thereunto, for the same reason which followeth] For if the Gentiles are become partakers of their spiritual (goods) [that is, the doctrine of the Gospel of Christ, in which are hidden all treasures of spiritual goods: which are called the goods of the Jews or of the Church of Jerusalem, because Christ was principally promised to the Jews, and because out of the Church of Jerusalem the Gospel was spread abroad throughout the whole world among the Gentiles, Isa. 2.3. Acts 1.ver.4.8.] they are indebted also [that is, obliged by the great benefit received from them, to recompense the same in some sort. See 1 Cor. 9.11. Gal. 6.6.] to serve them with temporal (good things.) [Gr. Carnal i.e. needful for the sustemtation of the flesh, i.e. of the body.]
\p
\v 28 . When therefore I shall have finished this, [That is, the journey, and its service] and sealed [that is, shall faithfully have brought it over, seeing it is instructed and as it were sealed in many hands, as a treasure is sealed in a chest, that nothing of it may be taken away] unto them this fruit [namely, of faith and of love which the foresaid Churches have brought forth. So their liberty is called, because true faith must bring forth such fruits, and be operative by the works of charity, Gal. 5.6.22.] I will come through your (City) [ Gr. Through you, i.e. through yours, or through your City] towards Spain.
\p
\v 29 . And I know [See hereof ver.24.] that I coming to you, shall come with the full blessing. [Gr. In fullness of the blessing, i.e. I shall bring with me, a full or abundant spiritual blessing to confirm you by preaching in the Christian doctrine, whereby the eternal blessing of God is published unto us.]
\p
\v 30 . And I beseech [Or, I exhort] you brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, [that is, as ye love Jesus Christ: or do it not so much, or only for mine, as chiefly for Christ’s sake] and by the love [namely, either wherewith God loves you, Rom. 5.5. Or wherewith you love God and your neighbour] of the Spirit [that is, which the Holy Ghost works and kindles in our hearts. Or wherewith he loves us] that ye strive [that is, that ye persist earnestly, vehemently and continually, as they do that strive, who stand by one another, and continue striving, until they obtain victory. See Gen. 32.26.] together with me, in prayers [namely, which are weapons wherewith the faithful fight against their enemies] to God for me.
\p
\v 31 . That I may be freed from disobedient [Namely, which reject and withstand the doctrine of the Gospel and me for the same. These sought to kill the Apostle at Jerusalem, but he was delivered out of their hands. See Acts 21.27,33. This Paul knew before should happen to him, Acts 20.22 See 2 Thes. 3.2.] in Judea, and that this service [namely, of faithfully carrying over the gathered alms] which I do to Jerusalem [that is, to the poor believers within Jerusalem] may be acceptable to the Saints. [ See ver.26.]
\p
\v 32 . That I may come unto you with joy, by the will of God, [That is, if it shall be Gods will. See Rom. 1.10. and Jam. 4.13,14,15.] Namely, by our mutual presence and conference] with you.
\p
\v 33 . And the God of peace [That is, which is the author of all blessing, good, prosperity: and who will always have peace kept among his children, Rom. 16.20. 20. 1Cor.14.13. 2 Cor. 33.11.13. Phil. 4.9. 1 Thes. 5.23. 2 Thes. 3.16. Heb. 13.20.] be with you all. Amen.
\c 16
\s 1 The Apostle recommends Phoebe of Church of Rome, 3 and salutes by name some of the chief’s brethren and sisters in the same Church, commending their godliness. 17 Admonisheth the Romans that they take heed of the causers of discord and offences, and that they be wise in that which is good, 20 promising that God shall tread Satan under their feet. 21 Salutes the Church in the same of certain brethren which were with him. 24. And finally he concludes this Epistle with a wish, and praising of God for the abundant revelation of the Gospel.
\p
\v 1 AND I commend [That is, recommend] unto you Phoebe our sister [namely, in Christ] who is a Minisiress [namely, not in the Ministry of preaching, for this is forbidden in women, 1 Cor. 14.34. and 1 Tim. 2.12. but either a Deaconess who took care of the sick, 1 Tim. 5.9,10. or which is more probable, which served the Church in receiving and habouring our Christians that were driven out of their Country, and also of the Apostles and teachers, as appears from the following verse] of the Church which is of Cenchrea. [A haven of Corinth. See of this place Acts. 18.18.]
\p
\v 2 . That ye receive her [That is, lodge and use her kindly] in the Lord, [that is, for the Lords sake, or in the Lords name] as it becometh the Saints: [that is, as it becometh her who is holy and godly woman, and you also are good Christians. Gr. Worthily of the Saints] and assist her [namely, with counsel and deed, to help her to dispatch her business which she hath to do in Rome] in whatsoever matter she may have need of you. For she hath been an assistance [Or. Habourer. Namely, who hath received many Christians that were driven away, into her house. See 1 Tim. 5.10. It seems therefore that she was a woman of quality] of many, yea of my self.
\p
\v 3 . Salute Priscilla [The wife of Aquila, who was very wise and godly woman] and Aquila [the husband of Priscilla a Tent-maker of Pontus. See of them both Acts 2.10 etc. 1 Cor. 16.19. 2 Tim. 4.19. These were before driven out of Rome, by the command of Claudius Ceasar, and were at Corinth when Paul came thither, Acts 18.2. and seeing it appears here that they were now at Rome again, therefore it seems that the Apostle was twice at Corinth] my co-workers [namely, in spreading abroad the doctrine of the Gospel, wherein according to their opportunity and calling they did their best] in Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 4 . Who for my life [Gr. Soul, Mat. 2.20.] have put their own neck, [Gr. Have put under their own neck, i.e. have hazarded their lives. This was done either in the uproar at Corinth against Paul, Acts 18.12 or in the uproar at Ephesus, Acts 18.23. where they were then with Paul, Acts 18.18.] to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the Churches of the Gentiles. [forasmuch as they have thereby obtained that benefit, that I remain yet alive to teach and confirm the same.]
\p
\v 5 . (Salute) also the Church, [That is, the faithful, which either belonged to their family: or which gathered together in their house. See Col. 4.15. Phil. V.2.] Salute Epenetus my beloved, [namely, for his singular godliness] who is the first fruits [that is, who is one of the first, which I have brought to the faith by my preaching, See Rom. 11.16. 1 Cor.15.20. and chap.16.v.15.] of Achaia, [that is, all the believers which are in Achaia] in Christ.
\p
\v 6 . Salute Mary, who hath laboured much [Namely, in habouring them, and doing them other services] for us. [that is, for the faithful, and especially for the teachers.]
\p
\v 7 . Andronious and Junil my kinfolks [That is, Jews of my kindred] and my fellow prisoners, [that is, who also as well as I, have been imprisoned for Gospel sake, Col. 4.10 Phil. V.23.] who are renowned amongst the Apostles, [that is, amongst them which preach the Gospel here and there: for this word is not only peculiarly ascribed to the Twelve Apostles, but sometimes also to the other teachers. See 2 Cor. 8.v.23. Or well known with the Apostles] who also were in Christ [that is, were converted to Christian Religion] before me. [that is, before I was converted.]
\p
\v 8 . Salute Amplias my beloved in the Lord. [That is, because he also believeth in the Lord.]
\p
\v 9 . Salute Urbanus our fellow-labourer in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
\p
\v 10 . Salute Apelles who is approved [that is, who being exercised by many perils and difficulties, is found to be upright] in Christ. Salute them who 9Are) of Aristobulus (household) [it seemed that this Aristobulus himself was no Christian yet, because the Apostle doth not cause him to be saluted: yet nevertheless it appears that he was a moderate man, who suffered Christians in his family.]
\p
\v 11 . Salute Herodian who is of my kindred. [See v.7.] Salute them who (are) of (the household) of Narcissus, those (namely) who are in the Lord. [That is, who are Christians. For they were yet Heathens in that household, those he salutes not.]
\p
\v 12 . Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa (women) which labour in the lord. [Seev.6.] Salute Persis the beloved (sister) who hath laboured much in the Lord.
\p
\v 13 . Salute Rufus the chosen in the Lord, [That is, who is a choice and singular man] and his mother [namely, by nature] and mine. [namely, according to love and affection. See 1 Tim. 5.2.]
\p
\v 14 . Salute Alyncritus, Phegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes and the brethren that are with them.
\p
\v 15 . Salute Philogus and Julia, Nereus and his Sister, and Olympus, and all the saints which are with them.
\p
\v 16 . Salute one another with holy kiss. [that is, with a kiss of peace and brotherhood, with which believers according to the use of those Countries and times, used to salute one another. And it is called holy because it must be given, not out of carnal but spiritual love, and without hypocrisy, Gen. 29.11.] The Churches of Christ salute you.
\p
\v 17 . And I beseech you brethren take notice of them who cause division and offences [He understand by such, as well other Hereticks, as those which having embraced the Christian Religion, taught that ceremonies of the Law must yet necessarily be observed for salvation. See Gal. 1.7. Phil. 3.2. 1 Tim. 4.1. 2 Tim. 3.1. etc. Tit. 3.10.] contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned (of us:) and depart from them.
\p
\v 18 . For they are such [He describes them, that they may not be known and the better avoided] serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, [namely, howsoever they give themselves out for ministries of the Lord] but their (own) belly: [that is, teach for filthy lucre’s sake, and to satisfy their belly, 1 Tim 6.5. Tit. 1.11.] and seduce by fare speaking and commening the heart of the simple. [Gr. Of them that are not evil.]
\p
\v 19 . For your obedience [Namely, which ye show in embracing the doctrine of the gospel, which he calls Faith, Rom. 1.8. See. 1 Thes. 1.8.] is come to (the knowledge of) all. I rejoiced therefore on your behalf: and I would that ye be wise in that which is good, but innocent in that which is evil.
\p
\v 20 . And the God of peace [See Rom. 15.33.] Shall bruise Satan [namely, who by his instruments seeks to seduce you] under fire, [that is, cause that through Christ you shall perfectly overcome him. The Apostle seems here to have respect to the first promise of the Gospel, Gen. 3.15. See also Rev. 12,11.] shortly, [which indeed begins here, but in the end of this world which is at hand, Rev. 21.12. shall be done perfectly] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. [this wish the Apostle useth in all his Epistles. See 2 Thes.3.17]
\p
\v 21 . Therefore salute you Timothy my fellow-labour, and Lucius and Jason, and Sosipater my kinsmen.
\p
\v 22 . I Tertius, who wrote the Epistle, [Namely, from the mouth of Paul] salute you in the Lord.
\p
\v 23 . Gaius, [Se concerning him, Acts 20.4. 1 Cor. 1.14.] mine and the whole Churches host, [that is, who haboured in the house the Apostle and other believers not inhabiting there. See.v.1.] saluteth you. Erastus the Treasurer, [or Steward, Receiver, See Luke 16.1.] of the City, [that is, of Corinth, from whence the Apostle wrote this Epistle] saluteth you, and the brother Zurtus.
\p
\v 24 . The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. [See v.20. The Apostle rehearseth this wish again, to show how needful it is, and that this Epistle was written by him, out of great affection.]
\p
\v 25 . Now to him that is able to confirm you according to my Gospel [That is, which is preached by me. See Rom. 2.16.] and the preaching of Jesus Christ, [that is, which is the preaching, namely, either which the Lord Christ himself preached, Heb. 1.1. or the argument of which the Lord Christ, 1 Cor. 2.2.] according to the revelation of the mystery [that is, of the doctrine of the Gospel of Christ, being now come in the flesh, which herefore was not so known, and in which the doctrine of such a wisdom of God is revealed, which could not be searched out by the understanding of any Creature, 1 Pet. 1.12.] which was kept secret [this is not so to be understood, as if in the old Testament, men had known nothing of the Gospel: for the following verse is declared, that the revelation of this doctrine was also made by the writings of the Prophets: but in respect of that clear revelation and publication made now in the New Testament, seeing Christ was yet come then: and the Gentiles were wholly ignorant thereof, Psal. 147.20. Ephes. 2.12.] (from) from the times of ages. [Gr. Eternal times, or from the times of the world, i.e. since that the world was created.]
\p
\v 26 . But is now revealed, [Namely, in the times of the new Testament] and by the Scriptures of the prophets [namely, in which the Messiahs is promised and described with all his circumstances and benefits, Acts 26.22. Rom. 1.2. and 3.21. 1 Pet.1.10. when they are compared with that which is set down in the New Testament to be fulfilled in Christ] according to the command of eternal God [Or ordinance of God, who thought good so to bring about the salvation of men, and who is not bound to give any man account thereof] is made known [namely, whereas before it was kept secret among them, ver.25.] amongst all the Gentiles, for obedience of Faith.
\p
\v 27 . To the (same) alone wise God [Or to the only wise God. Otherwise, to the only wise God through Jesus Christ, to him be the Glory forever] (be) through Jesus Christ, glory for ever. Amen.
\p (The Epistle) to the Romans (was) written from Corinth, (sent) by Phoebe, the Ministress of the church which is at Cenchrea. [This subscription is not found in some books. Yet howsoever we may not rely upon such subscriptions, as being set down by interpreters, nevertheless it appears that this is the agreeable to the truth, if we well observe that which is said, Acts. 20 .v.12. and 2 Cor. 12.14.]
