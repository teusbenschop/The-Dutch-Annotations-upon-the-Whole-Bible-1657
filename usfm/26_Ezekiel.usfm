\toc2 Ezekiel
\p Though God suffered king Jechonia ,or Jojachin ,with many Jews (amongst whom was also Ezekiel)to be carried away captive to Babel ,yet he forsook them not utterly ,but to shew that he would preserve his church among his them even in Babel ,and afterwards graciously deliver and restore it ,be raised up for her service this excellent Prophet ,by whom he made known unto those captive in Babel the very same ,in divers visions ,Prophesies and Sermons ,that he had caused to be declared by the Prophet Jeremia unto their brethren that remained in the land and at Jerusalem under Zedekia ;although by both sorts(as well by those that were at Jerusalem ,as by those that were in Babel)alike incredulity and obsimate impenitency was found .At Jerusalem they believed not the prophet Jeremia ,but mocked those that had surrendered themselves to the King of Babel ,and had suffered themselves to be carried away captive ,conceiving that they should now be sole beirs of the land ,and their brethren that were carried away captive ,conceiving that they should now be sole beirs of the land ,and their brethren that were carried away captive ,be shut out .In Babel they believed not the Prophet Ezekiel ,but murmured against God , and esteemed themselves much more unhappy then their brethren that remained in the land , unto whom not withstanding God foretold both by Ezekiel ,and by Jeremia ,much sorer plagues ,besides the utter ruine of the city ,Temple , and land a foresaid ;but everyway with additions of every fair promises ,and comforts ,unto the penitents and believing, of his future and sure mercy and favor ,both in things corporal ,and especially in things spiritual and ;and of his severe judgments upon all their enemies and persecutors . Here unto tendeth chiefly his whole book of Ezekiel ,wherein be in the first three chapters describeth a very rare and wonderful vision ,whereby God confirmed ,instructed ,and strengthened in hypothetical office .In the next place ,unto the 25 chapter are most likely represented and abominable fins ,especially of Jews that were at Jerusalem and in Juda ,as also their approaching judgments ,, by the divers devine tokens, visions ,and prophetical Sermons of reproof .Then to the 33 chapter God foretelleth to the neighbouring hosale heathens as the Ammonites ,Moabite ,Edomites ,(of whom is treated chapter 35 )Philiftines ,Tyrians ,Zidonians ,and Egyptians, their ruine. Moreover, from the 33 unto the 40 chapter ,are severely reproved by God the fins, murmurings and hypocrises of the Jews that were captives in Babel ,with exortations with true repentance ,and a faithful expectation of future deliverance ,gathering and blessing of his church ,not only by the deliverance from which the Babylonian captivity ,but also especially of the great work of grace which God would shew unto his catholike church of Jews and Gentiles,by teir only saviour and King Jesus Christ ;with an advertisement of the sore battel and enmity that should betfall them by Gog and Magog ,with all their adherence and with a promise of a joyful issue at last .In the nine last chapters God concludeth and sealeth up these prophecies in Babylon,with a very full and ample vision of the building of a new temple , new worship ,new government ofof the people of God ,new inheritance , and a new city ,all for Israel and the stranger representing under figures ,according as that time did require ,the future gracious and blessed estate of the church both militant and triumphant , under under their king of Messias ,Jesus Christ who with the father and the holy Ghost as the only true God of Israel is to be praised forever .Amen.

\s When and where Ezekiel prophesied , ver I, c. God sheweth him a wonderful vision , of four beasts , v 4 ,5,c.of four wheels ,15. and of a throne ,wherein the Lord did manifest himself in the form of a man,as Ruler and Jugde o all the world, 26.
\p
\v 1 In the thirtieth year ,[some count this year from the reign of Nebochodonosor the first other wife called Nabopolassar ,the father of Nebuchadnezzar the Great who subdued Syria and Judea ,under whose dominion the prophet Ezekiel lived at the same time when the book of law was also found in the temple ,to wit ,in the eighteenth year of King Josia ,2Kin.22.8.&23.21. others have accounts ]in the fourth moneth),[which for the most part agreeth with our June ,and is called by the Jews Tamuz :meaning the ecclesiastical year ,for the moneth of civil year is called Tebeth.The word moneth is here inserted from the following clause ] on the fifth day of the sameth moneth when I was in the midst of them bat were carried away [to wit ,as captives to Babel .Heb .carrying away .So 2 Kings 24 .15 .Ezra 11.11 So likewise captivity for captives .see Numb .31 on ver .19 .when l was in the midst c. for when jojachin was carried away captive to Babylon with much people ,the prophet Ezekiel was among them .See below chap 33.21and 40.1 ] by the river Chebar ;[some understand an arme of the river Euphrates, called Chabora from Chabora certain commanders divided the Euphrates .Others , a certain river in Mesopotania ,running from mount Masius into the river Euphrates towards a city of the same name]then it came to pass (that)that the heavens were opened,[to wit ,in a super natural manner whereby the prophet being in a trance ,was indued with a new fight ,to behold without any impediment that was shewed him .Compare Revil4.1. and 19.11]and I saw vision of God .[that is ,which God shewed unto me , or wherein God by certain forms caused himself to be seen by me in the spirit So below chap .8.3 and 40.2. seer of divine visions ,Gen .15 .on ver1.concerning this vision there be divers expositions of it in the church of God amongst which that seemeth to be the fittest is here followed .]
\p
\v 2 .On the fifth day of the same moneth ,(that was the fifth year of king Jojachin carrying away,)[if to these five years we add eleven years of Jojachins reign,3Kinbgs 23.36. the three moneth of Joahaz ,2kings 23.31. and the fourteen last years of Josias , we find the thirty years with three months whereof is spoken in former verse .)
\p
\v 3 .The word of the Lord came expressly [Heb coming to pass came to pass] unto Ezekiel [Heb Jechezkel .this name signifieth the strength of God or strengthened by God the son of Buzi ,the Priest in the land of Chaldeans ,by the river Chebar and the hand of the Lord was there upon him [that is ability to prophesy was given him of God .see 2kings 3 on ver 15 So below chap .11.5.. The meaning is one and the same .For the spirit of God giveth the ability and the gift for the prophesie ,1Cor .12.4]
\p
\v 4 . Then I looked and behold a whirlwind came [To wit ,not onely to up to prophet to attention but also to represent the teible power of the supreme Judge which he would put into practice against Jerusalem ,by the enemies thereof see of such similitude,Job 9.on ver 17] from the north , [to wit from whence the Jews enemies that is the Chaldeans should come compare Jerem 1.13 ,14, 15] a great cloud , understand hereby the army of the Chadeans . see Jerem .4.13 .Compare below c 30.18.and 38.9] and a fire that caught in it , or infolding itself to wit in that cloud or compassing it compare Exod 9.24 this fire fought in the cloud fignifieth the burning of the city of Jerusalem and the temple and brightness was round about that cloud [by the brightness here is meant the glory of justice which God geteth by his punishment and judgements .psal 51.6 isa5.16 ] and out of the midst thereof [that is of the fire as appeareth by the end of this verse ]was the colour [Heb eye ;that is colour or hue whereupon the eye hath its operation .So Levit13.55.Numb 11.7 .below vers .7.] of Hasmal ,[many understand hereby a kind of rosin called amber by the Latines Succinum .Others take it to be a kind of metal called electrum consisting of gold whereof fifth part in silver in colour like unto pale gold .Others understand the word of the purest burning copper or steel :some take it for the colour of very siery coles ; having the name some conceive from hasly cutting as under consuming & this furtheth well with burning steel and coles out of the midst of the fire .[That is thereof appearing when it lyeth and burneth in the midst of thee fire compare this vision with that which is recorded below chap 10.
\p
\v 5 . And out of the midst thereof [to wit of the fire wherein was the colour of Hasmal] came the likeness of the four beast [by these beasts are to be understood the holy Angels because they they are called Cherubims below chap 10 vers 15,20 .Now that these four beast are said to come out of the midst of the fire this fignifieth both the brightness of their nature and the servency of their operation herewith agreeth the name seraphims , being derived from Saraph ,that is, to burn , Isa .6.2,6]and this was their shape and they had the likeness of a man .[to wit , for the most part of their body;for they had the face ,legs and hands of a man , vers 7,8 .Angels are likened unto man because they have understanding and will ,but much more perfect than men 2Sam .14.20 Psal.103.20 1Pet.1.12]
\p
\v 6 . And everyone had four faces ;[whereof see below vers 10 so chap 10.14 ]likewise everyone of them had four wings .[to wit two for flie with not withstanding in this vision they lifted up towards the sirmament and in a manner covered their faces herewith; which wings signified partly their speediness in the exercuting Gods commands ,and partly teir willing and ready attendance and disposition to minister unto God their Lord and master .And two other wings they had for to cover their body therewith , which showeth both their reverence towards God ,and the invisibility of their nature and ssence unto man .in Isa6.2 and in Revel 4.8 are fix wings ascribed unto the angel to wit two more besides these four ,wherewith they cover their faces because they were before the throne of God whose brightness and majesty they were not able to endure .]
\p
\v 7 . And their feet [That is legged or shanks ]were straight feet [signifying the straightness of their work .Heb and their feet ,the foot was straight ]and the soles of their feet [meaning that part of the leg that is properly called the foot ] were like the soles of the calves feet [which are round and strong ,to signify the swiftness and readiness of the angels in the execution of their ministery ] and sparkled [to shew that the works which God performeth by the angels are clear and glorious ] like the colour of smooth copper [or polished scoured and cleansed copper ;signifying the purity of the angels compare Revel 1.15]
\p
\v 8 . And the hands of a man [understand by these hands the works of the holy angels which they do according to Gods commands and the aptness that is in them for those works were under their wings [to wit to signifie their works are invisible and unknown to men ]on their four sides ,[Heb four squares, wherby is represnted that they executed gods commands in and over all the corner of the world compare below chap 43 .16,17]and they had four faces and their wings.
\p
\v 9 . Their wings were joyaed together [understand this wherewith they flew ;and compare below vers 11 ]the one to the other ;[Heb the woman to their sister ;that is to, one another .so Exod 26.3 ,5,6 .below vers.23.and3.13.This joyning together seemeth to signifie the natural friendship and piece that is among the holy angels in the executing of their ministeries ] they turned not back when they went ;[that is they departed not from the way but went on equally in it .so below vers 12 and 17 ] they went everyone straight on before his face .[That is, they went straight forward ,keeping an equal pace toward the place that was before their face ,and unto which they they were to come .This signifieth that the holy angels go on in the work enjoyned them by God ,without any looking back ,and without being turned aside by any impediment ]
\p
\v 10 . Now the likeness of their face was the face of a man ;[To wit before see thesignification above on vers 5observe that every beast had four face before the face of a ,man behind the face of an eagle on the right side the face of a lion and on the left the face of an ox was followeth [and they four [to wit the four beast ] had the face of a lion [to wit for to signifie thereby that the angels are very strong.Of the strength of lion see Judg 14.18 Prov 30.30.Of the strength of the holy angels see 2Kings 19.35 Coloss.1.16.Who are also stronger than the devil because they overcome them when they encounter them ,Dan10.13 Revel 12.7 ,8,9]on the right side ;and they four had had the face of an ox [this signifieth the ministering perseverance of the holy angels in execution of the charges laid upon them by God ]on the left side :they four also had the face of the face of an eagle .[To wit behind opposite to the face of a man which was before .Understand hereby the quickness and activity of angels in working ]
\p
\v 11 . Also their faces and their wings [meaning the two wings wherewith they flew ,which they lifted up as if they would flie as followeth ]divided upwards [that is distinctly lifted up and stretched forth unto God that sate above the four beast on a high throne in the form of a man whereby is signified that the holy angels are active with all their minds and affection to receive and execute the commands of God .Others ,these or thus were their faces but their wings were spread upwards ]every one [to wit of the beasts ]had two [to wit wings joined together (the one)to the other [see above vers 9 and annotate ]and two covered their bodies [see above the annotate on vers 6]
\p
\v 12 . And they went everyone straight on before his face [see above on vers 9] whether the spirit was to go [meaning the spirit and the power of God which worketh from the Father by the Son ,Zach 4.6 and whereby these beasts were moved and governed .Compare below chap 2 on vers 14 and 8 .3 and 11.19,5 and 43..5] they went they turned not back as ,they went [see above on vers 9]
\p
\v 13 . As for the likeness of the beasts their form aws like burning cole of fire [which not only shewed unto to the prophet that here some divine things was done and that these beasts were no mean ordinary beasts but where angels of God ;moreover signifying the burning of Gods wrath whereof these angels where to be speedy and terrible executioners .Compare Psalms 18.9 and 140vers10 where burning coles signifie Gods judgments like the form of torches :Compare Dan 10.6]that fire went continually between those beasts :or caused itself to go & c That is went steadfastly on by darting out perpetually new flames of fire :whereby maybe understood the perpetual motion of the angels for to execute Gods wrath as likewise the constant purpose of God ready to punish the wickedness of the Jews ]and the fire had a brightness [signifying the purity of Gods justice which plainly appeareth in his judgments ]and out of the fire came forth lightning [understand hereby partly the dreadful terours that fall upon man by Gods just judgments, partly the uncomprehensible speediness which the angels use in executing those judgments .compare Matth 24.27.]
\p
\v 14 . Now the beast ran ,and returned as the shape of lightning .[To wit , not by withdrawing themselves from any work begun out of weariness but by presenting themselves again before God when their work is finished being ready again to receive new commands .Of the former they cleared above vers 9, and 12 and this latter is here ascribed unto them .]
\p
\v 15 . When I beheld those beasts ,behold there was a wheel upon the earth [ which wheel 9according to the opinion of some signified the world which is here upon the earth subject to many changes like a running wheel wherein often times the upper part cometh below and the lowermost cometh above .see below chap 10.13 ]by those beasts [understand that every beast had a wheel so that there where four wheels see below vers 16 and chap 10.9,12 ]according to the four faces that is sides or corners wherewith they look towards the four corners of the world .For every wheel was double ,being one wheel in another joined together overthwart ,so that so that those two wheels fastened together had the form of a bullet or ball and four sides whereupon they might be rolled and moved by the Angels to the four corners of the earth sometimes to one and sometimes to another quarter ]there of [To wit of the wheel or of every one of the beast .]
\p
\v 16 . The fashion of the wheels and their workmanship or work that is form and fashion so this word is taken 1Kings 7.17,19,26,33 .So likewise here in the sequel was like unto the color of beryl[ see cant 5 on vers 14] and they four had one manner of resemblance .[whereby is signified that the world is everywhere like unto itself to wit unstable and transitory some apply resemblance to the beast moreover their shape and their workmanship was as it where a wheel in the middle of a wheel .[see the former vers on the words four faces .The signification hereof is though the world by Gods ordering be very wisely governed yet many things in it everywhere [when so ever it pleaseth God in his just judgment ]are both in general and in particular as suddenly confound and turned upside down which he knoweth very well how to redress to his own glory and to the salvation of his people .]
\p
\v 17 . When they went upon their four sides [To wit either to their fore part where the face of a man was or to the hinder part where the eagles face flood or to the right sidewhich had the face of a lion or to the left side , where the oxes face stood so that in going there awsno turning back as followeth according to the face of the beast or Cherub the same is also said above of the beast nvers 9,and 12]they turned not back when they went[see above on vers 9]
\p
\v 18 . And their wings [ Heb bicks meaning the rands or the iron-work of every wheel which are the outermost and highest part thereof ;signifying the highest and ,greatest and fearful things of the world; and all these are under the power of God ,and are governed by him by the ministry of his Angels as followeth ]they were so high that they were so dreadful ;[Heb and they bad height and they had dreadfulness ;that is they were so high as they were dreadful or cause fear ]and their wings where full of eyes round about those four wheels these eyes point us to the providence of God ,who beholdeth and governeth all things upon the face of the earth compare 2Chron 16.9.Job 34.21 Psal33.18.Jerem16.17.Zach3.9 and 4.10
\p
\v 19 . Now when the beasts went the wheels went by them :and when the four beast where lift up from the earth the wheels were lift up .[ This signifieth unto us that the alteration that happen in this world are governed by God by the ministry of his holy Angels the ordering whereof though it be for the most prt incomprehensible that is just and righteous ]
\p
\v 20 . Whither so ever the spirit was to go ,[see above vers 12 and the annotate.]they to wit the wheels went withersoever the spirit was to go [he repeateth the same again to make the matter more plain and certain ]and the wheels where lifted up over against them;[to wit the beast with whose lifting up the wheels where also lifted up among them ] for the spirit of the beast [Heb of the beast the singular number for the plural. so below vers 21, and 22 ] was in the wheels .[The meaning is that the wheels where moved and driven namely by the spirit of God others a spirit of light was in the wheels.]
\p
\v 21 . When those [To wit the beast ]went these [to wit heels so in the sequel went and when those stood that is were no more moved nor went forward .Understand withal that the angels having finished their work do quietly wait for other charges that God may lay upon them ]they stood and when those were lifted up over against them [see above in the end of the 20 verse ]for the spirit [see above on verse 12] of the beast [Heb of the beast as vers 20 ] was in the wheels .
\p
\v 22 . And upon the heads of the beast [Heb of the beast as before was the likeness of a firmament ,what the firmament or expansion which was created of God in the beginning properly is may be seen Genes 1 on vers6 now here is spoken of the likeness of firmament which was shewed unto the prophet in this vision and consequently was not a thing on its own and essence perpetually remained but was only a shape and appearance thereof like the color [Heb eye see above on v 4 ]of the dreadful chrystal spread forth ever their heads above [or of dreadful ice ,& c. for the word Kerach is for the molt part taken for the ice but it is here by expositors rendered chrystals as the same is also like unto ice conglealed and hardned into a stone very clear bright o transparent so that the form or fashion of this firmament was like unto transparent ice of such clear brightness that was terrible thing to behold for which cause it is here also called dreadful or terrible .This firmament was above over the heads of the beasts or Angels intimating that the Lord could through it conveniently see all that was under it ,and that the Angels could be in some sort behold his majesty that was above it .]
\p
\v 23 . And under that firmament were their wings straight up ,[that is listed upwards see above on vers .6.and compare above vers 11 ] the one toward the other :[Heb. The woman toward her sister see above on vers .9.]and everyone had two [understand this of the other two wings which everyone had two[the repetition of one or more words is done according to the manner and custome of speaking used by the Hebrews when they make any division see genes .7. on vers .2.]which covered them thitherward .[that, is whereof the other wing covered the hinder side or part of their bodies .]
\p
\v 24 . And when they went I heard the noise like noise of many waters ,as the voice almighty ,[understand withal when he spoketh below chap .10 vers 5 .some understand it of the ratling or rumbling of the thunder see Psal 29.3 .]as the voice of a cry ,as the noise of an host :[this various sound signifieth partly an holy acclamation and thanksgiving of the Angels ;and partly ,that the judgement of God which he executeth upon the wicked by the ministry of his Angels are most dreadful and terrible so that everyone hath cause to be amazed threat ]when they stood ,[see above on vers 21] then they let down their wings
\p
\v 25 . And there came a voice [to wit whereby the prophet was summed up to attend ,and to receive the commands of God with reverence and obedience .Compare Exod.19.16. Revel .1.10 .] from above the firmament which was over their heads ;[to wit ,the heads of the four beasts ]when they stood and let down their wings
\p
\v 26 . And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne ,[This signifid a royal Majesty and power of a supreme judge Genes 41.40. 1Kings 1.13 and 7.7 Prov 20.8.] as the form of a Saphir -stone :[whose colour is skie-colour shining with golden pearls see Job 28on vers 16 it signified an heavenly throne full of majesty and glory compare Exo 24.10]and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the form of a man [which was the representation of the majesty of Gpd .compare Isa .6 on v 1.Some apply it especially to the majesty of our Lord Jesus Christ and God and man in unity of person the only mediator of all believes and the judge of all men ; who below chap 8.6 calleth his temple sanctuary and here vers 28.is called the Lord ]being above upon it [to wit as an everlasting King and supreme judge :2sam .7.13. Psal 45.7. matth25.31 Luke1.32,33. Job .5. 22,27 Acts 10.42 and 17.31 .]
\p
\v 27 . And I aw as the colour of Hasmal ,[Namely round about him that fate above the firmament on the throne .f Hasmal see above on vers4]as the form fire[whereby was signified the eternal Godhead who is called consuming fire Duet 4.24 see the annotate there]round about within it [that is round about within the color of Hasmal so that it seemed that he that fate on the throne was compassed with burning Hasmal from his lions upwards unto his head and downward into his feet ;as followeth ]from the form of his lions and upward and from the form of his lion and upward ,and from the form of his lions and downward I saw as it it were the form of fire and brightness round about upon him .[which signifieth that God dwelleth in a light which man can approach unto ,1 Tim .6.16 and yet not withstanding remaineth still a light of comfort and salvation to all those that are his ,that is ,to true believers ,Psal .27.1 Issa60.20 Mich.7.8]
\p
\v 28 . As the form of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of a great shower of rain ,so was the form of brightness round about :[the likeness of the rain-bow served to set out and magnifie the majesty of him that fate upon the throne ,and the reverent of the owe of the prophet toward the same .Thereby many be also understood a token of mercy and favor ,which God in punishing would shew unto true penitents ] This was the form of the likeness of the glory of the Lord ,[to wit ,whereby God manifested himself into this vision :whereof see also below ,chap3.23 and 8.4 and 9.3,c Exod .6.7 Levit .9 on vers 6 Numb .14 on vers10 So then hereby is to understood Gods glorious presence and consequently he himself ]and when I saw it I fell upon my face .[to wit being astonished by that dreadful manifestation of the divine majesty and be able to honor the same with adoration compare Genes .17 on vers 3 .]
\c 2
\s The prophet being terrified by the former vision raised up by God, vers 1 ,2 and called to the prophetical office among the children of Israel ,with instruction and strengthening against their obstinacy ,3 and the of a roll that was written without 9.
\p
\v 1 And he said unto me ,[to wit he whose voice he had heard ,above chap .1.28 who no doubt was he that fate upon the throne ,vers 26 of the same chapter]child of man ,[so the Lord calleth him ,left he should lift up himself through the excellent revelation of the heavenly vision before described but rather humble himself by the consideration of his human infirmity. This name also served for comfort unto the prophet as if God should say I know that thou art but a weak man ,and therefore art afraid of my majesty ,yea that thou also shalt be vexed by the reason of the contempts that shall befall thee from the Jews :but look unto me that call thee unto this office but not upon thy self who art but a weak frail man] stand upon thy eet [for the prophet was fallen down upon his face affrighted by the terrible vision that was shewn unto him ]and I will speak with thee
\p
\v 2 . Then the spirit [meaning the spirit of God that enabled him to do that which God commanded him .Isa 48.16 and61.1 so below chap 3.24 ] entered into me he spake unto me which set me upon my feet and l heard him that spake unto me [to wit the Lord that sate upon the throne ]
\p
\v 3 . And he said unto me child of man l send thee to the children of Israel [meaning the Jews that were carried away captive with Jojachin out of their own country Judea into Babylon below chap 3.11 howbeit under may be also comprehended theten tribes that were scattered out of their own land among the heathen . Some understand thereby also the Jews that still dwelt in their own country to whom the prophet Jeremia was sent to God] to the rebelling nation [there is the word Gojim which signifieth the heathen so the Lord seemeth to call his people here because they were far so departed from him by idolatry as that they were no better then the heathen :although it be also attributed to the Israelites in a good sense ,Exod 19.6 Jos 3.17 and 5.8 c] that have rebelled against me :they had their fathers have transgressed against me ,even unto this very day [Heb unto the bone or being of tis very day so Gen 7.13 and 17 .26 Levit 23.14 and 24.2 and 40.1 .]
\p
\v 4 . And those children are of face [that is with out shame compare Jerem 3.3 and 5.3 and below chap 3.7 [and stiff of heart:[are those that stiffen or harden their hearts who these are see Exod .4.on vers 21 .] I send thee unto them and thou shalt say unto them this faith the Lord LORD [this was usually the preface of the prophet when they were to declare somewhat according to Gods
\s Command now Ezekiel being called to be a prophet he is hereby authourised to speak thus and is also engaged to speak no otherwise then God had spoken to him .
\p
\v 5 . And they whether they will hear or whether they will forbear [The lord will have the prophet only to look upon his charge ,& not upon the event or issue so below v7.& cb.3.11,27 .]for they are a rebellious house [Heb a house of rebellion to wit against the Lord their God house for people so below vers6 and 3.26 ,27calso children of rebellion Numb17.10 a people of rebellion Isa 30.9 ]they shall know that a prophet [that is a person immediately sent by God to declare his will to raise up the decayed state of the church to threaten the wicked to comfort the wicked to comfort the godly to foretell things to come especially concerning the Meffias and also to instruct magistrates and rulers concerning their office and duty ] hath been in the in the midst of them .[that is be convinced that the Lord hath admonished them by his minister and exhorted them the repentance ,and yet remain obstinate and hardened are utterly left without excuse ]
\p
\v 6 . And thou child of man be not afraid of them neither be afraid of their words though rebels and thorns [meaning man that prick and hurt either with words or deeds] be with thee and thou dwellest with scorpions :[others thistles understand very crusty and mischievous men who know cunningly to shoot out the destructive poison of their malice and wickedness] be not afraid of their words nor be dismared at their looks for they are a rebellious house
\p
\v 7 . But thou shalt speak my words unto them ,whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are rebellious [Heb rebellion so Prov 17.11 and here in the next vers compare Job 24 on vers 220 and 35 bon vers 13
\p
\v 8 . Yet thou child of man hear that which I speak unto thee be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house open thy mouth and eat that I give thee .[ By this token prophetical office is delivered unto Ezekiel ,and he is charged thereby not only to hear the revelations of God readily and willingly but also to ponder them diligently and to discharge them faithfully .Thus where also men of God by certain tokens installed and confirmed in their offices and places see Exod 4.2,3,4.Isa .6.6,7 Jerem 1.9 Rev .10.8,9,10.]
\p
\v 9 . Then I looked and behold there was an hand put forth unto me and to therein was the roll of a book :[or a letter rolled together .In former times writings or written in paper or parchment are fastened together wraped roundabout a stick and rolled together by reason whereof they were called a roll .See Psal 40 on vers 8 likewise Isa 8.1 and 34.4Jerem 36.2 Ezra 6 on vers 3.]
\p
\v 10 . And be spread the same out before my face and it [T wit the roll of the book ]was written before and behind :[that signified that the judgments that God would send upon the Jews were manifold and in it were written lamentations and sighing and wo .[ to wit which signified the miserable condition that should befall the Jews by Gods just judgment ]
\c 3
\s The prophet eateth up that roll at the command of God vers 1 c who again chargethinstructeth and strengtheneth him against the peoples obstinacy :4 sheweth him again his glory and instructeth him concerning the office of a faithful prophet and the usefulness thereof 12 The glory of the Lord is shewed unto him again22God butteth and openeth the prophets mouth 25 c
\p
\v 1 After that he said unto me child of man eat that thou shalt find :[see chap 2 on vers 8 that is eat that is which is here present to wit this rolled letter as the following words express see the same phrase Ge 19.15.2 King 19.4 Jer 10.15,16]eat this roll [see above chap 2 on vers 9] and go speak unto the house of Israel [see above chap 2 on vers 3 ]
\p
\v 2 . Then I open my mouth and he gave me that roll to eat.
\p
\v 3 . And he said unto me child of man give the belly to eat and fill thy bowel with this roll that I give thee then did I eat it was in my mouth like honey by reason of sweetness [hereby he doth intimate that the revelations of God were pleasant and delightful unto him for though the contents thereof grieved him yet he assented altogether to the end and scope thereof which was to declare the justice of God in the punishing of fins compare Jerem 15.16 Rev 10.9.]
\p
\v 4 . And he said unto me child of man go thy waies go to the house of Israel and speak unto them with my words
\p
\v 5 . For thou art not sent unto a people deep of speech [Heb deep of lips that is of a dark unknown and strange speech for that which is deep is also dark and that which is dark is not well known so Isa 33.19and here in the next vers ]and heavy of tongue [that is language understand again a language that is strange outlandish and unknown and unknown for that folleth heavy to him that is not versed in it Exod 4.10 Moses calleth himself heavy of tongues because he was not eloquent]but to the house of Israel
\p
\v 6 . Not to many nations deep of speech ,and heavy of tongue whose words thou canst understand :[Heb hear see Gen 11 on vers 7 ] if I had sent thee unto them would they not have hearkened unto thee?[that that is they would not been so incredulous ,obstinate and unthankful as the Isaelites are at this day as the same also appeared by the repentance of the Ninevites at the preaching of Jonas compare Matt 11.21,23.Others if it were not for to wit that thou dost not understand their language nor they thine I had sent thee unto them and they had hearkened unto thee ]
\p
\v 7 . But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee because they will not hearken unto me for all the house of Israel [Meaning except true believers and elect such as were Jeremias ,Baruch ,Daniel and his companion and many others ]is stiff of forehead ;[that is impudent so above chap 2.4 hard of face] and they are hard of heart [so above chap 2.4stiff or hardened of heart compare Exod 4.on vers 21 also Prov 28on vers 14.]
\p
\v 8 . Behold I have made thy face stiff[ understand a stiffness proceeding not from a forward nature which consisteth of a hard cruel heart and discovereth itself in a bold impudent face but from the spirit of Christ consisting of a strong faith and confidence in Gods gracious helpjoyned with activity in working and courageousness in the outward countenance ] against tyheir faces and thy forehead stiff against thy forehead.
\p
\v 9 . I have made thy forehead as a diamond [see of the Hebrew word Schannar which many render an Admant or Diamond ,Jerem 17on vers 1 ]harder than a rock fear them not neither be dismared at their looks because they are a rebellious house [The Lord giveth a reason why he had furnished his prophet with strength that might not fear to wit because he had to deal with an willful and obstinate people which were to be dealt withal with an undaunted boldness and courage others although they are a rebellious house .So the reason should be expressed why the prophet might find himself to be dismaied Heb an house of rebellion so in the sequel .]
\p
\v 10 . Moreover he said unto me child of man receive in thine heart all my words that I shall speak unto thee and hear them with thine ears
\p
\v 11 . And go thine waies and come to them that are carried away ,[Heb transportation or carrying away see above chap 1 on vers1 ]to the children of thy people[ that is to thy people and thy nation namely the Jews that were carried away captive compare Genes 23.11 2chron 25.5.c God calleth not the Israelites his people because they were rebellious against him but Ezekiels people that is those that were of his nation compare Exod 32.7]and speak unto them and say unto them ,Thus saith the Lord LORD :whether they will hear or whether they will forbear [see above chap 2on vrse 5 .]
\p
\v 12 . Then the spirit [see above chap 2 on vers 2] took me up and l heard behind me a voice of a great rushing [to witmade by the beasts or the Angels or the Cherubims see the next vers ] said praise be the glory of be the Lord [compare Isa 6.3Luke 2.13,14. Revel 4.8 of the Lord that fate upon the throne .see above chap1.26 .The meaning is that his glory should not be diminished by the destruction Jerusalem and of the temple but rather be the more exalted by the demonstrations of his justice against the backsliding Jews] out of his place. [To wit removing and departing .Understand by this place Jerusalem and especially the temple which God has chosen for his habitation as a token of his presence among that people 1 Kings8.13. 2Chron 6.2 Psal 132.13,14 this place will forsake for a while Hos 5.15 Mich 1.3.]
\p
\v 13 . And I heard [ this word is here inserted from the former vers ]the found [Heb voice so in the sequel ]of the wings of beasts [this was a token that the holy Angels with a glorious sound of applause reverenced and magnified the jugdements of the supreme judge ]that touched [Heb kissed that is hit or touched ]one another [Heb the woman her sister that is the one the other see above chap 1 on ers 9]and the sound of the wheels over against them [to wit the beastor the wings of the beasts ]and the sound of great rushing .[Hereby was intimated that the ruine of the Jews should come suddenly and should also be very terrible ]
\p
\v 14 . Then the spirit [to wit the holy Ghost see above chap 1 on vers 12 and chap 2 on vers 2 ]lifted me up and took me away ,[to wit from the place wherein he saw the vision to the habitation of the captives .With the sight of his spirit it may be there was also transporting of his body ]and I went utterly grieved [Heb that is was inwardly sore grieved see 2Kings 4 on vers 27 ]by the heat of my spirit ;[that is by the hot disquiet ness and heaviness of my mind of my mind occasioned in me because I was called to his prophetical ministry and was to preach such terrible things Ezekiel confessed his own weakness .see like examples of infirmity in Moses Exod 3.11 c and 4.1,10 in Jerem 1.6 of my spirit meaning the prophets own will inclination and motion which is opposed to the power of the holy Ghost see 2 Kings 19 on vers 7]but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me [Meaning the power of the Lord which conquered the opposition of Ezekiels weak nature others understand the spirit of prophecy as above chap 1.3 see the annotate .]
\p
\v 15 . And l came to the carried away [Heb to the carrying away or transportation see above chap 1 on vers 1 ]at Tel-abib the word signifieth an heap of green ears of corn compare Exod 9.31 Lev 2.14 that is of new fruit but Tel-abib is here taken for a country so called lying in Mesopotamia about the river Euphrates see Ezra on vers 59 ]that dwelt by the river Chebar ,[see above chap 1 on vers 1]and I stayed where they dwelt :[Others and by Haescher where they dwelt .Thus Haescher is the name of another river called the Geographers Saocora between which and the river Chebar the country of Tel-abib lay]yea I stayed [the Hebrew word signifieth oftentimes not only to dwell but also to stay or tany. see 2Chron 32 on vers 10[there astonished [to wit at the terrible judgements of God that should fall upon the Israelites and which l was to denounce ] in the mist of them among them seven dates [He fate so long still without revealing anything either because being amazed he knew not how to begin his ministry or because he was afraid to undertake it or because he expected further and fuller charges from God
\p
\v 16 . Now it came to pass at the end of seven daies that the word of the Lord came unto me saying:
\p
\v 17 . Child of man , l have made thee a watchman over the house of Israel[ the prophets and other ministers of the word of God are called watchman because they are appointed by God to give warning to his people to avoid dangers that mayarise either from false docoine or scandalous conversation see Isa 21.11&52.8,56&10.11 Jerem6.17 below c 32 .2 Acts 20.28 ,29 it’s a comparison taken from watchmen that are set upon high towers or other places to give notice to the habitants of the place of the enemies coming or of any other danger near hand that they maybe in readiness and upon their guard to opposite it see 1 Sam14.16 2 Sam 13.34 and 18.24 2 Kings 9.17 therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth and give them warning [see of the word to give them warning Psal 19 on vers 120]in my name [Heb from or by me that is my name by my command or appointment or by charge warrant and authority from me .]
\p
\v 18 . When I say unto the wicked thou shalt die the death ,[Heb dying thou shalt die compare Genes2.17and 3.4 with the annotate and thou givest him not warning and speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way ,[see Prov 2 on vers 12 .]that thou mast save him alive :[to wit not as God the only workman by his own power ,but as his instrument by the administring of his word ,which is called the power of God ,1 Co.1.18,see 1 Cor .3.5,6,7,8,9.Thus the ministers of God are said to make many righteous Dan12.3. be fishers of men Matth .4.19 to be the light and salvation of Gentiles Acts 13 .47 to open the eyes of man that they might turn from darkness to light see Act 26.18 to save themselves and those that hear them 1Tim 4.16 to save the soul from death and to cover a multitude of fins James 5.20 c compare Jerem 1 on vers 10] that wicked man shall die in his iniquity compare Lev 15.3 below vers 19,20 and chap18.25] but his blood will I require at thine hand [see Gen 42 on vers22 .]
\p
\v 19 . Yet when thou warnest the wicked and he turneth not from his wickedness nor from his wicked way he shall die from his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul .[to wit from my vengeance and punishment which otherwise would have come upon thee so below vers 21]
\p
\v 20 . Also when a righteous man [to wit in shew and outwards appearance before men not indeed and in truth before God .So is the word righteous taken Prov 18.17 below chap 18.24,26 and 33 .13 .Matth 9.13 Luke 18.9 ,14 so faith for seeming or hypocritical faith Luke 8.13 Acts 8.13 and love for seeming or hypocritical love 1Job 3.18 and children of kingdom for to see that seemed to be such Matth 8.12] turneth away from his righteousness ,[that is shew of righteousness to wit which had an outward luster or appearance of righteousness but not the inward hidden root .So below chap 18 24 ,26 and 33 .13 Matth 5.20 ] and commiteth iniquity and I lay a stumbling block before his face [God is said to do this not properly by moving and by putting a man into fins ,but by leaving him in the way of his iniquity ,yea by giving him up to his way own wicked free-will and by suffering occasions to be offered unto him where bringeth himself into destruction .Others ,then I will lay a stumbling block before his face that is punish him for his fins he shall die as followeth ] he shall die because thou hast not given him warning ,he shall die in his fins, that is for his fin ,see above on vers 18 ]and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered [that is shall not be esteemed nor move God to spare him from punishing so below chap 18.24 and 33.13 ]but his blood will I require at thine hand .
\p
\v 21 . But when thou warnest the righteous man that the righteous fin not and he doth not fin ,[understand this of the reigning fin and whereof a man doth not truly repent 1Job 3.6,9 for even the truly righteous themselves for even the truly righteous themselves do also fin but do repent of it ,Eccles7.20 Job8.7.1 Job 1.8 ]he shall surely live ,[Heb living live so below chap 18.28 ]because he is warned ,[to wit actually ,really ,effectually ,powerfully and withal counting himself t be warned ,accepting the warning or suffering himself to be warning obtaining by the grace of God the true fruit of the warning whereby he escaped the danger and is saved ]and thou hast delivered thy soul.
\p
\v 22 . And the hand of the lord was [Or came see above chap1 on vers 3 ]there [to wit at Tel-abib see thereof above on vers 15 ] upon me he said unto me Get thee up go forth into the valley [the Hebrew word signifieth a low field that lieth between mountains and seemeth to be divided from them see also below chap 8 .4 ]and I willl there talk with thee.
\p
\v 23 . And I gat me up and went forth into th valley ,and behold the glory of the Lord [see above chap 1 on vers 28b stood there as the glory which l had seen by the river Chebar and I fell on my face [see above chap 1 on vers 28]
\p
\v 24 . Then the spirit entered into me [see above chap 2 on vers 2] and set me upon my feet and be [to wit the spirit of God .Other apply it to the word Lord the former vers ]sparks with me and he said unto me go shat thy self within in thine house [Heb in the midst of thine house ]
\p
\v 25 . For as for thee child of man behold they [They Jews that were carried away captive that were dwelt in the Tel-Abib by the river Chebar see above on vers 15] would lay thick cords upon thee [to wit if thou shouldst go forth unto them .Others they shall c Heb they have given that is laid thick cords upon thee : but that the preterperfect tense according to the prophetical manner of speaking must here be taken for the future maybe gathered from the word following that suit with the future tense ]and they bind thee therewith :[to wit to hinder thee that thou mightest no more prophesie against them and hose of Jerusalem .Some understand understand this is a parabolical way of the willful obstinancy of the Jews that should make the prophet s prophesies fruitless yea cause them to cease ]thou for thou shalt not go out into the midst of them :[Among them as above vers 15 ]
\p
\v 26 . And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth that thy shalt be dumb [this may be understood either of corporal dumbness or of inability and dejection of spirit which God brought up on his prophet because the Jews were unworthy of his fermous some understand it as if the Lord should have said I will reveal nothing unto thee at that time] and shalt not be them a reproving man [the Lord signifieth hereby that he will not restrain the obstinacy of the Jews but suffer it for a while for their greater punishment ] for thy are a rebellious house see above chap 2 on vers 5 Heb an house of rebellion so in the sequel ]
\p
\v 27 . But when I shall speak with thee I will open thy mouth [ that is by my spirit and by power give the ability again to excuse thy prophetical office ] and thy shalt say unto them that saith the Lord he that heareth let him hear and he that forheareth let him forhear ;[compare above chap 2 on vers 5,7] for they are a rebellious house .
\c 4
\s The prophet is commanded by God to portray the siege of Jerusalem upon a tile plate vers 1 c also the time of God forhearance with the backsliding of Israel and Juda 4 likewise the great famine that should be in Jerusalem during the siege 9,c.
\p
\v 1 And thou child of man take thee a tile [ meaning a flat smooth table made of tile or brick were on a man might write engrave or make a draught of anything as with us slates are used for such purpose ]and lay it before thy face and portray the word signifieth here properly to cut in to delineate to engrave with the graver compare below chap 23 .14 ]upon it the city of Jerusalem .
\p
\v 2 . And lay siege against it [to wit in portraying or delineating ] and build forts against it [ see of the Hebrew rendered here fort s 2 Kings 25 on vers 1 ] and cast up [Heb puore out ] a mount [see 2 Sam 20. on vers 15 ]against it and set camps against and set battering rams [to wit whereby the walls and the forts of cities were battered and broken down called by the latins arietes .the word signifieth also captain or commanders in war as 2 Kings 11.4 ,19 in which sense it is also taken by some as below chap 21.22.]against it round about .
\p
\v 3 . Moreover take unto thee an iron pan [to wit a token of Gods firm and unmovable resolution which he had to destroy Jerusalem and not to spare it] and set it for an iron wall between thee and between that city and set thy face against it [that is have a strong resolution to destroy it by the siege compare the phrase with Levit 17.10 and see the annotate The prophet is here commanded by the way of portraying to do that work against Jerusalem which God himself intended to do Jerem 21.10 ]that it besieged [Heb that it be in siege ]and thou shalt destroy it let this be a token to the house of Israel [to wit that Jerusalem shall be besieged ,taken and destroyed ]
\p
\v 4 . Lie thou thou also down upon thy left side [to wit for a token that God was so long as it was still a sleeping bearing with the iniquities of his people .Now it is conceived that this was not really done to the prophet in his own person but only in a prophetical vision and representation thereof which he in preaching was to shew unto the people .But some are of opinion that there was also some what of this really shewed unto the people upon thy left side to wit to signifie thereby that this first lying down was in respect of the children of Israel though some understand here not only the ten tribes but also Juda in regard of community of their fins especially of their idolatry whose chief city Samaria was to them that stood between it and Jerusalem with their faces towards the east on the left side that is northward as Jerusalem the chief city of the Jews was on the right side that is southward or understand by the left side that the Israelites were unworthiest of Gods people because they were under the reign of Jeroboam fallen off from the true worship of God [see below vers 6] and lay upon it the iniquity of the house of Israel according to this word is here inserted from the next vers the number of days that thou shalt he upon it thou shalt hear their iniquity .[to wit not as Christ did to take away the guilt and the punishment of iniquity by satisfaction but as a divine token and represented unto them by this portraiture signifying Gods long suffering and forebearance whereby he had born many years with their obstinacy and willfulness and also the grievousness of the punishment which they now had to expect.]
\p
\v 5 . For I have given thee the years of their iniquity according to the number of days [ that is I have appointed ordained and commanded thee to bear their iniquity so many days as those years are the years of which are here declare by the days of the prophets lying down as followeth .They are in a number three hundred and ninety beginning from the defection of the ten tribes under Jeroboam 1 Kings 12.26 , 2 Chron 12.1 and ended with the siege and taking of the city of Jerusalem and the destruction ,of the temple of Nebuchadnezzar .2Kings 25 2 Chron 36 with this proviso that among three hundred and ninety years are also comprehended the forty years mentioned in the former vers of the beginning whereof see there this maybe gathered from the ninth vers following were thew prophets provision is prescribed only for three hundred and ninety days .Some begin to count the years signified by these days from the twenty seventh year of king Solomon when he had the land began to fall into fallen idolatry 1 Kings 11 .4] three hundred and ninety days [ their number is here punctually set down because the strong and the strength siege of Jerusalem should continue so long agreeing with the time of years wherein the Israelites and the Jews had defiled themselves with idolatry for a public evidence of Gods righteous judgment by Jerem 52.4,5,6it appeareth that more days were expired from the beginning of the siege was intermitted a while because of the marching up of the Egyptian ,Jereem 37.5 which time is here passed by and not counted by Ezekiel ]that thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Israel [compare numbers 14.34. ]
\p
\v 6 . Now when thou shalt have accomplished these [that is when thou shalt not be far from the accomplishing of these days having finished those three hundred and fifty so that but forty remain ] lie down the second time [see above on vers 4.this second lying down was in respect of the fins of the Jews the Jews had above the Israelites lay southward that is on the right side of the world see above on vers 3 the right side may also signifie the dignity and excellency which the Jews had above the Israelites because with them was the temple and the service of God and the house of David ]that should bear the iniquity of the house of Juda [see above on vers 4] forty years these days which signify forty years as followeth begin the eighteenth year of Jofias reign wherein the Jews renewed their covenant with God but so as that they straight way again fell to idolatry and end with siege and destruction of the city of Jerusalem and the temple or the last carrying away of the Jews captive to Babel by Nebuzaradan 2 Kings 25] I have given thee each day of each year [Heb a day for a year ,a day for a year see Gen 7 on vers 2 and Levit 24 on vers 8 .]
\p
\v 7 . Therefore thou shalt set thy face against siege of Jerusalem [that is against Jerusalem that is besieged see above on vers 3] thine arm shall be made bare ;[ to signify that the Chaldeans shall be very ready active and forward to take Jerusalem suddenly by force and violence compare Jerem 21.5 ]and thy shalt prophesie against it.
\p
\v 8 And behold I will lay thick ropes upon thee that thou shalt not turn thee about from thy one side to thy other side ,[ Heb from thy side to thy side ]till thou hast ended the days of thy siege [ It is called his either because the potraying and prediction thereof was enjoyned to him or because they concerned his city .Others sieges with the plural number because at that time they were at that time two sieges of the city of Jerusalem .For when the Chaldeans had heard that the king of Egypt came to help king Zedekia they left the siege ,but when they understood that he was returned to Egypt they reassumed the siege .In this eight vers the Lord showeth that his decree of destroying the city was unalterable and that therefore the prophet must persevere in this his prophesying and in his propounding his prophetical portraiture .]
\p
\v 9 . And take thou for thyself wheat and barley and beans and lentils and millet [otherwise called hiose ]and spelte and put the in one vessel that is not every fort in a several vessel but all mingled together in one vessel which was wont to be done in time of need when there is great want of bread –corn ]and make them unto thee for Bread according to the number of days that thou shalt lie down upon thy side [by these and the following words is shewed the great distress and famine that should come upon those that should be besieged in Jerusalem ]three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat it [that is the siege of Jerusalem shalt last about fourteen months]
\p
\v 10 . Now thy meat which thou shalt eat shll be in weight twenty shekels a day [understand common or shekels whereof one made about a quarter of the Ryx –dollars Gen 20 on vers 16 four of these made the weight of an ounce that is of a Ryx-dollar so then the weight of a shekels was five ounce from time to time shalt thou eat it [That is thou shalt everyday eat but so much to signifie the famine that shall be in Jerusalem so in the next vers of the daily drink compare 2 King 25.3 Jerem 37.20.]
\p
\v 11 . Thou shalt also drink water by certain measures the sixth part of an hin [ a measure of moist commodities containing as much as may go into three score and twelve common egg-shells see Levit 19 on vers 36 so that the measure of drink was as much as might go into twelve hen eggs ]from time to time shalt thou drink it
\p
\v 12 . And thou shalt eat a barley cake,[Others thou shall eat it as barley cake meaning the meat mentioned on vers 9, 10 that is prepared and made up in such a fashion as barley cakes are ]and thou shalt bake it a dung of a man excrement [which should be fain to serve them instead of wood to boil their meat withal ;or also to bake their cakes on an hearth or in an oven heated with mans dung .So that hereby is signified that in the siege they should have great want of wood ;yeah also of cattle because the dung thereof was held to be less loathsom ]before their eyes [hence some do gather these things were not only shewed by God unto prophet in a vision but that he also shewed them unto the people in a visible resemblance ]
\p
\v 13 . And the Lord said thus shall the children of Israel [ that is the Jews with those of the ten tribes that dwelt around them see 2 Chron 21 on vers 2 ] eat their unclean bread [ it is called so because of the aforementioned boiling or baking compare Duet 23.12 ]among the Gentiles wither I will drive them [ meaning the Chaldeans ,among whom the Jews should be besieged and afterwards carried away captive by them]
\p
\v 14 . Then said I, Ah Lord LORD behold my soul [ that is my person see 1 Kings 19 on vers 4] hath not been polluted ;[to wit by any ceremonial uncleanness which was manifold whereof three forts are named here ,among with all the rest are to be understood , and those that are forbidden to the priest Levit 21 and 22 ]for from my youth up until now have I not eat a dead carcase of this fort of uncleanness Levit 11.40 ] or that which is torn into pieces [see of this fort Exod 22.31 ] neither came there loathsome flesh [Heb flesh of loathsomeness or of stink [ se Levit 7 on vers 18 into my mouth .
\p
\v 15 . And h said unto me ,Lo, behold I have give thee ox dung for mans dung therefore thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith. [ Thus the Lord matigateth his former command is the respect of the prophets own person that was to portray this before the eyes of the people above vers 12 but not in respect of the Jews that should be besieged in Jerusalem .]
\p
\v 16 After that he said unto me, Thou child of man , behold , I break the staff of bread [See Levit 26 on vers 26 and also Isa 3.1 below chap 5.16 and 14.13 ]in Jerusalem and they shall eat bread by weight ,[as God had threatened ,Levit 26.26 .] and carking ,[to wit whereby they shall be so cast down as that they shall stand like despairing men .]
\p
\v 17 . That they may want bread and water [Or so that they shall want bread and water ] and be astonished one with another [Heb the man and his brother ]and consume away in their iniquity .[compare Levit 26.39 Ezek 23.24 and 33.10.
\c 5
\s The prophet is commanded by god to shave his head and beard and to divide the hair into four parts and to deal severally with those four parts vers 1 c representing thereby the diversity and the dreadfulness of the plagues that should come upon the people of the Jews for the fins here mentioned 5 &c.
\p
\v 1 And thou child of man take thee a sharp knife Jos 5.2 thou shalt take thee barbers of razor :[ that is which barbers use when they shave a man this signifieth here the enemies of the Jews which God just made use of to punish his people by .compare Isa 7.20 ] which thou shalt cause to pass upon thine head and upon thine beard :[that is thou shalt cause the hair of thine head and thy beard to be shaved off therewith see the same phrase Numb 6.5 and 8.7 and compare Judg 13.5understand hereby the hair of the head and beard the citizens and inhabitants of Jerusalem which were very many in number and by the shaving off of the hair the cutting off of those citizens ]then thou shalt thee a balance [as a token of Gods justice ]and divide those hairs .[compare this verse with the twelfth vers following . ]
\p
\v 2 . A third part[ the hair divided into three equal parts signified that the Jews should be destroyed and perish by divers forts of judgments he that escaped the one should fall into other compare Isa 24.18 Jerem 15.2 ] thou shalt burn with fire[ which signifieth all the judgments whereby all the third part of the people during the siege should die into the city as namely by hunger sorrow pestilence ,shot, and the like plagues .see the word of fire taken for plagues and calamities Job 15 on vers 34 so below vers 4] in the midst of the city[ to wit of the city of Jerusalem he having portrayed it upon a tile above chap 4 .1 he was now tom shew upon the said tile this sad spectacle with the interpretation thereof unto he people that dwelt unto Chaldea were the prophet was]after the days of the siege are fulfilled that is thou shalt not burn the whole third part at once but now a little and then a little till the be ended .Others when the days of the siege shall be fulfilled ] then shalt thou take a third part smiling about it [ to wit the third part of the hair ]with a sword [ hereby is signified that another third part of the Jews without the city should be destroyed by the enemy ,to wit, when they should break out upon him or else taking flight should fall unto his hands 2 Kings 25.4 ]and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind ;[understand by this third part the remaining third part of the Jews which was partly scattered into the countrys round about partly carried away captive to Ribla and Babel 2 Kings 25.11,20,21 ] for I will draw out the sword after them [To wit the sword of enemies which shall here and there pursue after plague and devour the fugitive and captive Jews .Heb empty the sword after them so Exod 15.9 Levit 26.33 below vers12 and chap 12 vers 14. ]
\p
\v 3 . Thou shalt also take thereof [to wit of the last third part] a few number and binde them in thy skirts [ to signifie that a very small number of the poorest and meanest Jews should remain in the land, whom Nebuzaradan should leave there for vine dressers and husbandman 2 Kings 25.12 .Jerem 52.16 .]
\p
\v 4 . And thou shalt yet take of them ,[to wit of those few that are left ] and cast them into the midst of the fire and shalt burn them with fire :[which signified that yet many of them that were left under the government of Gedeliah should miserable perish and shall be feattered abroad 2 kings 25.25, 26 Jerem 41.3 ]there from shall a fire [meaning the fire of miseries and plague see on above vers 2 so in the sequel of this vers ] come forth against all the house of Israel .[to wit a fire which shall utterly plague and destroy the whole remnant of Juda and Israel mingled among them and where so ever they be see Jerem 42.16 and 44.27 ,28 .]
\p
\v 5 . thus saith the Lord LORD :this is Jerusalem [ to wit the city which the prophet had portrayed upon the tile above chap 4 .1 it was not the city it was not the city itself that was in Juda but the token and portrasture thereof see of this phrase whereby the token beareth the name of this thing betokened Gen 17 on vers 10 ]which I have in the midst of the heathen [that s I have shewed her more favor then I have done to any other cities among the heathen that she might be unto them an example of virtue and honestly compare Duet 4,6,7,8. Psal 48.2,3 & and 87 .1,2,3 &c]and lands round about her .[that is heathenish lands and nations before whom she ought to have shined in goodness or ,and of the lands that are round about her. ]
\p
\v 6 . But she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the heathen and my statutes more than the lands that are round about her :[see 2 Kings 21 on vers 9 and 2 Chrons 32.9 Jerem 2.10 see also in the end of the next vers ] for thy have rejected my judgment and into my statutes have they not walked [what it is to walk in the law or statutes have of the Lord see 2Chron 6 on vers 16 ]
\p
\v 7 . Therefore thus faith the lord Lord ;Because ye have made it so much the more then the heathen that are round about you ,[To wit ,by finning and transgressing .Heb. for your multiplying ;&c.that is , because ye multiply, to wit ,in fin ;or are multiplied in fin .Others understand this multiplication of their great store and abundant riches ,wherein they surpassed the heathen round about ,and yet notwithstanding were unthankful to toward God ,as followeth Compare Deut .32.15.] have not walked in my statues ,and have kept my judgments ,yea have not done according to the judgments of the heathen that are round about .[Which suffered not any rashly to change their Gods and their Religion ;Jerem.2.10.This may also be understood of the natural and civil laws which are by God written in the hearts of all men ,Rom.1.32and 2.15.which many heathen better kept and observed then the Jews did .Among these laws this is one ,that a man ought to keep his word and his promise ,to wit such one may kept which the Jews did not ,2Kings 24.1.and 20. ]
\p
\v 8 . Therefore thus faith the lord Lord ;Behold ,I will be upon thee , [namely O thou city of Jerusalem ;to wit ;to destroy thee .Others ,l come against thee :as Revel.2.5,16and 3.3 ] yea 1:[this repetition tendeth to the assurance and aggravation of the punishment that is foretold ]for l will exercise judgment in midst of thee [that is ,execute punishments upon thee .So Psal .119.84. below chap .11.9and 25.11.Compare 2chron . 20.12. and the Annotat.] before the eyes of those heathen .To wit whom thou exceedest in wickedness ,to whom thou by thy doings has given offence and who being thine enemies ,will rejoice at thy destruction.]
\p
\v 9 . And I will do in thee that which I have not done [ That is send such a punishment as I never sent heretofore ] neither will do anymore the like because of all thine abominations [to wit the idolatry and other fins against the first and second table as also against the ceremonial and judicial laws .]
\p
\v 10 . Therefore the fathers that shall eat the children in the midst of thee and the children shall eat their fathers :[to wit because their great hunger and want of victuals see the threatening of God concerning this Levit 26.29Deut 28.53 and accomplishment 2 Kings 6.29 Lament2.20 and 4.10 ]and I will exercise judgments in thee and I will seatter all thy remnant into all the winds [that is into all the parts of the world so Jerem 49.32,36 and below chap 12 .14 and 17.21 and 37.9 Zach 2.6 see also above on vers 2. ]
\p
\v 11 . Therefore as true as I live [compare Numb 14.28 Ruth 3.13 1Sam 14.39,45and 19.6. 2 Sam22.27Jerem 46.18 ] saith the Lord LORD because thou hast defiled my sanctuary [ that is the temple wherein the services of God were performed ]with all thy detestations and with all thine abominations [to wit of the grossest idolatries in the service of God and of the grossest evils in life and conversations ] if I also shall not therefore diminish thee and mine eye pity thee [this word is here inserted from the following 7 chap vers4because the eyes are witnesses of the heart therefore that is ascribed unto them which properly belongeth to the heart .Thus the eye is here said not to pity ,that is to have no compassion nor to be gracious or merciful see also Deut 7.16 and 13.8 1Sam 24.11 below chap 7.4 and 16.5 ] and also shall not spare [see Numb 14 on vers 23 and Deut 1 on vers 35. ]
\p
\v 12 . A third part of thee shall die of pestilence [see a further exposition of this vers above on vers 2 ] and shall by famine be brought into the midst of thee [that is in your besieged city of Jerusalem ]and a third part shall fall by the sword [to wit of the Chaldeans that shall be without the city and besieged it see of this phrase Levit 26 on vers 7 ] round about thee and I will seatter the third part into all the winds [compare above vers 10 and the annotate ]and I will draw out [ Heb empty as above vers 2] the sword after them [see above on vers 2.]
\p
\v 13 . Thus shall mine anger be accomplished [That is my threatening which I in my just wrath have denounced by my prophets shall be thus accomplished compare the phrase with Isa 10.25 Lament 4.11 below chap 7.8and in the end of this vers ] and I will cause my fury to rest upon [that wreck my spleen upon them and so satiate and satisfy my wrath upon them that I shall be quiet when I see them in a forlorn case by means of judgment that I shall not need to renew it Nahum 1.9 this is spoken of God after the manner of men so below chap 16.4 and 21.17 and 24.13 ]and comfort myself [that is avenge myself and wreak my spleen and delight myself the declaration of my justice is spoken of God after the manner of men so Isa 1.24] and they shalt know [that is find indeed and perceive to their shame and loss see Job 5 on vers 24 also below chap 6.7,10 c] that I the LORD have spoken it in my sealousie [meaning fierce and jealous wrath as of a man that is wronged by his wife so Psal79.5 Prov 6.34 Isa 59.17 below chap 16.42 and 38 .19] when I shall have accomplished my fury against them.
\p
\v 14 . Moreover I will make thee a desolation and a reproach among the heathen that are about thee before eyes of everyone that passeth by [to wit a reproach whereby thou shalt be despised reviled and abhorred by the nation round about when they shall say that thou was worthy to be dealt with because of the great things and abominations .see Gods threatening of this judgment Levit 26.31 and the accomplishment thereof Lam 2.2 &c .
\p
\v 15 . So the reproach and infamy shall be an instruction and an astonishment round about [to wit the instruction whereby the heathen may be taught what a great evil fin is and how fearful a thing it is by reason thereof to fall into the hands of God ]when I shall exercise judgments [that is execute just punishments so below chap 25.11 ] upon thee in anger and fury and furious rebukes [Heb in rebukes of fury ] I the Lord have spoken it .
\p
\v 16 . When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine [meaning all plagues scourges whereby death and famine is occasioned .They are called evil because they should be deadly and bring destruction along with them as the words declare see Deut 32 on vers 24 ] which shall be for destruction which l send forth to destroy you ;so will l increase the famine upon you and break your staff of bread [See Levit 26 on vers 26 and above chap 4.16 and below chap 14.13 likewise 2 Kings 6.25 Isa 3.1 .]
\p
\v 17 . Yea I will send upon you famine and evil beast [see Levit 26.22 ]which shall bereave thee of children and also pestilence and be loud [ that is man slaughter and murders see Genes 37 on vers 26 ] shall pass through thee and I will bring the sword upon thee : I the Lord have spoken it .
\c 6
\s A prophecy of the destruction of the land for the abominable idolatry of the people vers 1 & c promises of mercy to a small penitent remnant 8.The prophet is commanded by the gestures of disquietness and mourning to represent the fins and plagues of the people 11.
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came unto me saying:
\p
\v 2 . Child of man set thy face against the mountains of Israel [that is take a strong resolution and make thy self ready to prophesie boldly and undauntedly against them so below chap 13.17 and 20.4 and 21.2 and 25.2 and 28.21 and 35.2 and 38. 2 against the mountains of Israel to wit that there were near and round about Jerusalem see Psal 125.2 meaning the land and kingdom of Juda which is called Israel not only the Jews as well as the Israelites descended from the patriarch Israel that is, Jacob but for other causes also mentioned 2 Chron 15 on vers 17 and 21 on vers 2 ] and prophesie against them .
\p
\v 3 . And say ye mountains of Israel [meaning the men that dwelt upon the mountains so must in the following words hills brooks and valleys be taken namely for those that had their habitations upon or by or in the woods compare Jugd 1.19 Psal 98.8 below chap 36 .1Mich 6.1,2 ] hear the word of the Lord LORD thus saith the Lord LORD to the mountains and to the hills and to the brooks [or steams floods gulfs that strongly spread forth their course into the land so is the word taken Job 6.15 below chap 31.12 and 35.8 ]and to the valleys ,behold, I bring the sword [that is war see Levit 26.6 and 2 Chron 20.9 and the annotate ]upon you and I will destroy your high places [of high places Levit 26 on vers 30.]
\p
\v 4 . Moreover your alters [to wit which they had set up to the honor of their idols] shall be wasted and your images of the sun [ see of these Levit 26 on vers 30 ]shall be broken and I will cast down your slain men [or your mortally wounded man meaning the Jews that should be slain or murdered by their enemies even when they should be fled to their idols to be helped by them in their necessity as is implied in the following words ]before the face of your dung-gods [see Levit 26 on vers 30]
\p
\v 5 . And I will lay Heb properly give the dead bodies of the children of Israel before the face of their dung-gods and I will scatter your bones round about your altars .[ that is I will not cause not only to be slain before their idols but I will also cause their dead bodies and the pieces thereof to lie and to be scattered about their idolatrous altars to defile them therewith for the dead bodies of men were held to be most loathsome and abominable about altars and sacrifices ]
\p
\v 6 . In all your habitations [That is in all place were you might dwell ]the cities shall be laid waste and the high places he made a wilderness ,that your altars may be waste and solitary and your dung-gods may be broken and cease and the images of the sun may be cut down and your works [meaning their images and idols with all their idolatrous furnisher made by men’s hands see 2Kings 22 on vers 17] may be abolished .
\p
\v 7 . And the slain shall he [Heb threatening for lying see Jerem 9 on vers 22 ]in the midst of you that you may know [see above chap 5 on vers 13] that I am the Lord [that is the only and true God that have spoken these things by my by my prophets and will make it actually appear that I am both true and just so below vers 1 and chap 11.10 and 12.15 &c.]
\p
\v 8 . I will yet leave a remnant when ye shall have some to escape the sword among the heathen when ye shall be scattered into the lands [Heb escapers of the sword &c meaning those that should indeed become exile in foreign countries but by the grace of God should remain alive for their good that God might always reserve unto himself a people in the midst of all destruction ]
\p
\v 9 Then shall thine escape remember me [to wit whom when they were in their prosperity and lived in pleasure they had forgotten .To remember God is here to return unto him forsaking their former wicked life compare Jerem 50.51] among the heathen were they shall become captives because I am broken by their whorish heart which hath departed from me [that is I am fore troubled and vexed this is spoken of God after the manner of man to shew that the fins of the Jews extremely displeased him ,and stopped and broke down the current of mercies towards them .by the whorish heart here is meant the spiritual whoredom which is idolatry which is idolatry see Levit 17 on vers 7 and 20 on vers 5]and by their eyes ,which go a whoring after their dung-god compare below chap 20 on vers 24 and they shall loath themselves [Heb their faces that is themselves ]for[ the Hebrew particle is like wise taken 1 Kings 21.22 2Kings 7.7 and here in vers 7 ]the evils which they have committed in their abominations.
\p
\v 10 . And they shall know [see above chap 5 on vers 13 ]that I am the Lord I have not spoken in vain of doing this evil unto them .[To wit because my faithfulness requireth that I should so admonish and threaten them by my prophets and my justice that I should so destroy them by their enemies .]
\p
\v 11 . Thus saith the Lord LORD Smite with thine band [to wit in token of sorrow and heaviness which thou shalt bewray for the fins of people ,and the punishment that shall follow there upon compare Numb 24.10 and the annotate smiting and clapping the hands but with other words in the original hath also been used as a token of contempt see Job 34 on vers 37 Lam 2.14 yea even as a token of joy Psal 47.1 and 97.8 and 25.6 and of contracts or bargain Job 17 on vers 3 ]and stamp with thy foot [also in token of sorrow .A like token it is to smite upon the thigh or hip Jer 31.19 below chap 21.12]and say Ab for all the abominations of the evil for the house of Israel for they shall fall [ that is perish and die see Gen 14.10 and the annotate Levit 26.7 and the annotate by the sword ,by the famine and by the pestilence.
\p
\v 12 . He that is far off [meaning those that should be fled into the countries round about or should hide themselves in the woods and caves ]shall die by the pestilence but he that is near [that is those that should fall into the hands of the Chaldeans ]shall fall by the sword and he that remaineth and besieged [to wit in the city of Jerusalem others is preserved ] shall die by the famine this will I accomplish my fury against them .
\p
\v 13 . Then shall yea know that I am the Lord when their slain man shall be in the midst of their dung-god round about their altars upon all high bill upon all the tops of the mountains and under every green tree [see Deut 12 on vers 2 1Kings14.23 2Kings16.4 ]and under all thick oaks [that is very thick branched oaks ]the place were they made a pleasant savor to all their dung-gods [Heb savor of rest c [to wit of sacrifices and incense wherein they conceived that their idols took rest pleasure
\p and delight and so imitated that God had appointed see Gen 8 . on vers 21 annd Levit 16 on vers 31.]
\p
\v 14 . Therefore will I stretch out mine hand upon them and will make the land desolate yea more desolate then the wilderness towards the Diblath [it is conceived that the wilderness lay in the land of the Moabites being very terrible by reason of its extraordinary desolation thorow which wilderness the Israelites passed when they were to first enter into the land of Canaan Numb 33.47 Jerem 48.22 Diblath was a city as is conceived in the fore mentioned land of Moabites others called Diblathalain Jerem 48.22] in all their habitations and they shall find that I am the Lord .
\c 7
\s A further prophecy of the first and most fearful desolation of the whole land Jud avers 12 &c. the pitiful lamentations of those that escaped 16 because of their fins they shall like man astonished desperate malfactours both high and low heartless comfortless and void of counsel be carried into captivity this was represented unto them by a token of a chain 17 &c.
\p
\v 1 After that the Lord came unto me saying :
\p
\v 2 . Moreover thou child of man thus saith the Lord LORD concerning the land of Israel [meaning the kingdom of Juda which is often in the book called Israel compare 2 Chron 15.17 and 21.2 ]the end is come [to wit of the fore mentioned land understand by the word end the ruine and destruction of the land see Gen 6.13 compare Lament 4.18 ]the end is come that is very high at hand in this prophecy was made in the fifth year of Zedikiahs reign and was fulfilled in the eleventh see the like phrase 1 Sam 2.31 Psal 102.14 Isa 13.22 Jerem50.31] upon the four corners of the land .[Heb wings &c that is sides bound s parts of the land of Juda as for example they were the west ,east ,south, north-borders Christ calleth these the four winds Matth 4.31 .The meaning is that no part of the land should be free from Gods punishment .]
\p
\v 3 . Now is the end upon thee for I will send mine anger against thee [that is my judgments which I will pour out in my wrath against thee so Exod 15.7 Job 20.23 Psal 78.49 ]and I will judge [that is punish see Genes 15 on vers 14 ]thee according to thy ways [that is works see genes 6 on vers 12 ]and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations [Heb I will give upon the &c that is bring , lay ,put so vers4 that is I will punish thee for thine abominations and wicked works see the like phrase 1 Kings 8 on vers 32 Jerem 26.15 below vers 8 and chap9.10 and 11.21 and 16.43 and 22.31 . 23.48 .
\p
\v 4 . And mine eye shall not pity thee [see above chap 5 on vers 11 and below chap 8 on vers 18 ] neither will I spare but will bring ways upon thee and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee [that is the punishments of thine abominations &c for the guilt of abominations had been long before among them so iniquity of punishment thereof see Levit 5.1 and the annotate ]and you shall know that I am the LORD .
\p
\v 5 . Thus saith the Lord LORD ;an evil [ meaning the evil of punishment Gen 19 on vers 19 ] an only evil which at once shall utterly ruine and destroy you compare the phrase with 1 Sam 26.8 Nahum 1.9]behold is come .
\p
\v 6 An end is come [see above on vers 2] that the end is come [to wit which I have continually threatened by my prophets one and the same thing is twice said to express the truth and heaviness of it ] it is awaked against thee [it meaning the fore mentioned end others he is awaked to wit the Lord and that to punish thee awaked that is prepared and ready to fall upon thee compare 2 Pet 2.3 ]behold the evil [to wit whereof is spoken in the former vers ]is come.
\p
\v 7 . The morning that is the time wherein thou shalt of a certain be early and quickly cut off .Some conceive that here respect is had to the time of public civil punishments which among the Israelites were done in the morning using for that purpose that which is said Psal 101.8 ] is come unto thee o inhabitants of the land the time is come that day of trouble is near [ meaning a certain and determined time wherein the land should be full of trouble by means of the lamenting and howling of men Heb the day the trouble is near ]and there is no echo of the mountains [meaning the echo proceeding from the shouting and noise that is made when they gather in their new wine and other fruits of the fields some understand this also of the joyful sound which idolaters made upon the mountains near their altars compare 25 on vers 30 .]
\p
\v 8 . Now will I shortly [Heb from high at hand ] pour out my fury upon thee [that is send upon thee the punishments of my fury in great abundance and with violence so below chap 20.8,13 see Psal 79 on vers 6] and accomplish mine anger against thee [see above chap 5 on vers 13]and judge thee according to thy ways [that is works or doings as above on vers 3] and will bring upon thee all thine abomination
\p
\v 9 . And mine eye shall not pity neither will I spare I will render unto thee according to thy ways and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee [see above on vers 4] and ye shall know that I am the Lord that finisheth [that is that punisheth justly see of this word on Gen 8 on vers 21 .
\p
\v 10 . Behold the day [that is the time of punishment and vengeance of God see above vers 7 and below vers 12 ]behold the morning [this word is here inserted from the fore going seventh vers or from the following words of this vers .We may also put in the room of it the evil from the fifth vers ]is come the morning is gone forth the rod hath blossomed [ by the rod here is understood by many king Nebuchadnezzar by whom the Jews should be punished for which end his might increased and flourished compare Isa 10.5 ] pride hath budded [by pride here is meant the bold and obstinate presumption of the Jews in the sinning against God which was the cause of the aforesaid blossoming rod see the next vers .]
\p
\v 11 . Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness [by violence understand here injustice and cruelty proceeding from the afore mentioned pride .For from contempt of God issueth and injustice and cruelty which men practice one against another now this bringeth forth the rod whereby the wickedness of men according to the just judgment of God is punished violence maybe also here understood by in respect of the Chaldeans whom the Lord would shortly raise up to punish the wickedness of the Jews ] nothing of them [to wit of the Jews ] shall remain [this is to be understood with exception of the remnant whereof is spoken above on chap 6.8 ]nor of their multitude [that is of the common people ]nor of their tumult[ understand the Lord the great ones of the land that is with multitudes of people accompanying them or waiting upon them shew themselves others nor of them that are out of them that is of their prosperity ]neither shall there be lamentation for them [that is no mourning when they shall be dead the meaning is that the destruction should be so great that few shall be left to lament the dead or that everyone should have enough to do with his own grief see Jerem 16.4,5,6,7.]
\p
\v 12 . The time is come [see above on vers 7] the day is approached let not the buyer rejoice[to wit because he shall he should not enjoy the commodity that he hath bought] neither let the seller mourn [to wit because he was constrained through want and poverty to sell his land or other goods of his for if he had not sold it yet he would not have been able to have kept it see the next vers] for burning [ meaning the burning anger of the Lord see 2 Chron 28 on vers 13 and below vers 14 ] is upon all the multitude of the land [to wit of the land of Juda .]
\p
\v 13 . for the seller shall not return to the thing sold [ As was done in the year of Jubilee wherein every man that had sold his inheritance was to return to it again see Levit 25.13 but this law should not be kept in seventy years captivity Heb selling above chap1 .1 carrying away for those that were carried away ]though their lives were yet among the living [[that is those both buyer and seller were yet alive ] because the vision concerning the whole multitude of the land [to wit of the land of Juda as in the former vers that is this prophecy foretelling the ruine of the kingdom of Juda and of the seventy years captivity of people of the Jews see of the word vision Genes 15 on vers 1 and 46 on vers 2 ]shall not turn back [that is shall not be revoked by God nor be in vain but shall be certainly accomplished so is the word taken Isa 55.11 compare also2 Sam 1.22] and no man shall strengthen his life by his iniquity [the meaning is that the Jews how wickedly and vilely so ever they shall seek to keep back Gods vengeance yet not withstanding they should not escape the same .These words may also be rendered thus no man whose life is in his iniquity shall strengthen his life or shall strengthen himself in his life that is as long as he goeth on in his iniquity he shall not be able to save himself from destruction .]
\p
\v 14 . They have trumpeted with the trumpet have prepared all [to wit that is needful and serviceable for war ]but no man goeth to the battel [to wit either because through carelessness he will not or through fear he will dare not or through weakness can not] for my burning anger is upon all the multitude of the land [to wit of the land of Juda as in the two former verses .]
\p
\v 15 . The sword without [to wit without the city of Jerusalem ] and the pestilence and the famine within [to wit within the city of Jerusalem ]be that is in the field [meaning those that flee out of the city that they might not perish in the destruction ]shall die by the sword [to wit the Chaldeans that besieged the city ]and he that is in the city the pestilence shall consume him .
\p
\v 16 . And their escaping ones [meaning those that shall have escaped the common plague of the city and the hand of Chaldeans [ shall indeed escape but they shall be upon the mountains they shall be like the doves of the valleys [to wit wherein they hide themselves for fear of storm and tempest or for fear of some birds of prey] mourning, [the Hebrew signifieth here as much as making a stir by sighing ,whining and howling compare Isa 38 .14 and 59 .11 ]everyone for his iniquity .
\p
\v 17 . All hands shall wax feeble [see 2Sam 4 on vers 1 compare Isa 13 on vers 7 Jerem 6.24] as all knees shall show way as water [[Heb go away c that is lose their strength trembling for fear and not being able to stand not against my violence or to flee from it so belowchap21.7 of feeble knees see also Job 4.4 and the annotate .]
\p
\v 18 . They shall also gird on sacks [see Gen 37on vers 37 Isa 15.2 ,3 Jerem 48.37]horror shall cover them see the same phrase Psal 55.6 and shame shall be upon all faces and baldness upon all their heads [to wit because through the greatness of their sorrow they should pluck out the hair of their head of which the lord had forbidden Deut 14.1 not willing that his people should mourn immoderately and uncivilly as the heathen which command for as much as these men would not heed or regard it seemeth therefore that they repented not. ]
\p
\v 19 . They shall cast their silver in the streets [to wit either because it might been an hinderance to them in their flight or because they should despair of possessing it any longer ]and their gold shall be as un cleanness [that is which they shall esteem no more then that which by the law is unclean and from which they were to separate and sequester themselves Heb sequestration see of this word 2Chron 29.5]their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord [that is when god in his just judgment shall severely punish the Jews compare Prov 11.4 Zeph 1.18]they shall not satisfy their soul [the word soul here is taken for the appetite and desire unto meat the same is said not to be satisfied for want of victuals which should also besal the richer fort yea the very richest the phrase is also found n Jerem31.25] nether shall they fill their bowels for it [to wit gold and silver ]shall be the stumbling block of iniquity[that is the occasion and cause of their fall and ruine because they had gotten it ill and used it ill and especially in honoring their idols therewith below chap 16.17 see of the word stumbling block also below chap 21.15 and the annotate.
\p
\v 20 . And he [to wit God ]set the beauty of his ornament [meaning the temple of Jerusalem which was not only adorned with gold and many precious instruments and jewels but also with the exercise of the true service of God ]for excellency [that is to shew thereby as an outward token his exceeding eminent glory and to exalt his people as his dear spouse most costly adorned above all nations ]but they made images of their abominations and of their detestation therein therefore have I made it [ to wit the beauty of mine ornament ]uncleanness unto them [see on the former vers others made it a separation &c that it or put it far from them .]
\p
\v 21 . And I will deliver it [to wit the beauty of mine ornament unto the hand of strangers for a prey [to wit into the hand the power of strange nation as the Chaldeans or Babylonians who spoiled ,destroyed and burnt the temple 2King 25 .9&c 2 Chron 36.18 ,19 ] and to the wicked of the earth[ meaning the same Chaldeans that should have no tear of God no justice no compassion towards men] for a spoil and they shall pollute it [ to wit the plundering murdering ,violating and burning it likewise by taking the gold ,silver ,copper and the holy vessels out of it and employing them to profane uses 2 Kings 25.13,14,15& c Dan 1.2 and 5.3.]
\p
\v 22 . I will also turn away my face from them [to wit from the Chaldeans that shall take and destroy my temple .It implies that he will let them alone and not hinder nor resist their wicked practice .Others understand this of the Israelites ]and they shall profane my secret place : [meaning the holy of holies where the ark of the covenant was and it is called a secret or hidden place because it was the innermost part of the temple and no man might enter into it save the high priest and that only once a year ]for breakers in see of this word Psal 17 on vers 4 shall enter into it [namely into Jerusalem and from thence into the temple and into the holy of the holies ]and profane it .
\p
\v 23 . Make a chain [or cord to wit for a token that the Jews like malefactors that are wont so to be carried bound with chains and cord to prison or to the place of execution should partly perish by the sword and partly be carried away captive into Chaldea ]for the land is full of judgment of bloud [that is fins that have deserved death otherwise called judgment of death see Deut 19 on vers 6Jerem 26.11 others understand public judgments wherein the innocent are condemned to death by the unrighteous judges ]and the city full of violence [understand hereby all manner of of injustice practiced against our neighbor either by open public oppression or by secret fraud and deceit to heap up riches.]
\p
\v 24 . Therefore I will cause the worst of the heathens [that is the Chaldeans who at that time were the mightiest among the heathens and implacable enemies to the Jews ] that shall hereditarily possess their houses [the Hebrew word indeed signifieth for the most part to posses a thing by right of secular inheritance but also taken in possession in propriety how and in what manner so ever the same might be obtained 1 Kings 21.15 Habak 1.6 ]and I will haughtiness [ that is the pride lostiness pomp and stateliness ] of the strong [ that is of the great ones in the land that are great and mighty in birth ,honour, richies or one of them ]to cease that hallow them [to wit the fore mentioned strong men .Now those that hallowed them were the priest that offered sacrifices for them whereby they thought to be hallowed ]shall be profaned .
\p
\v 25 . Ruine [or rooting out destruction Heb cutting off compare Isa 38.12 ]cometh and they shall seek peace but it shall not be .
\p
\v 26 . Misery shall come upon misery and there shall be a rumuor upon rumour then they shall they seek the vision of a prophet [to know of him the event then misery but their seeking shall be without finding because they hearkened not to the prophet in due time ]but the law shall perish from the priest and counsel from the eldest [that from the counselors rulers of the land [that is the ordinary ecclesiastical person shall shall lose the true and sincere doctrine which alone can instruct and comfort a man truly in all trouble and affliction and the political or civil rulers shall be void of counsel and all this to the aggravation and increas4e of punishment that the Jews had deserved compare Isa 29.14 .
\p
\v 27 . the king shall mourn and the princes shall be clothed with desolation [that is be quiet filled with astonishment amazement and despair see the like phrase Job 8.22 and the annotate Heb the prince shall be clothed c]and the hands of the people of the land [that is of the common people see Jer 44.21 Higg 2.5] shall be troubled [that is through trouble and astonishment of the heart be utterly unable to do anything towards the beating off of the enemy compare 2 Sam 4.1 and the annotate ] I will do unto them according to their way [that is according to the deserts of their works ] and with their judgment [ that is with the punishment that they have deserved judgments for punishment see 2 Chrons 20 on vers 12 or according to the manner so as they deserve judgment for manner see Genes 40 on vers 13 ] will I judge them and they shall know that I am the Lord .

\s When were and how the vision shall be revealed unto the prophet vers 1,2,3,4 .God bringeth him into the temple at Jerusalem and sheweth him the abominable idolatry that the Jews there committed with the image of jealousie or provocation of God 5 with divers creeping thing abominable beast and dung-gods 8 he sheweth him also the women that wept for the idol Thammuz ,13 the men that worshipped the sun ,15 all which abominations they esteemed light 17 .Therefore God will punish them without mercy .
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass in the sixth year [ to wit after carrying away of Jojachin see above chap 1 on vers 2 ] in the sixth moneth [called the Hebrews Elal see Nehum 6.15 and the annotate ]on the fifth day of the moneth when I sat in mine house [to wit in Babylon among the Jews that were carried away captive ] and the eldest of Juda [ that is the rulers of the Jews see Exod 3.16 and Levit 4.15 and the annotate some understand those that dwelt in Jerusalem others those that dwelt there among the captive compare below chap 14.1 and 20.1 ]sat before my face [ to wit to receive some advice counsel instruction or comfort concerning the state of the land of Juda and of the church of God from the prophet compare Exod 3.16 and 2 Kings 6.32 and the annotate] that the hand of the Lord LORD fell upon me [se above chap 1 on vers 3 .]
\p
\v 2 . Then I beheld [to wit in the spirit and in a trance see of the prophetical vision on Genes 15 on ver 1 and 46 on ver2 ]and to a likeness [to wit of the shape of a man ] as the shape of fire from the shape of his loins and downward was fire [which signifieth Gods vengeance and just wrath that was kindled against the wickedness of the Jews compare Deut 4 on vers 24 ]and from his loins and upward as the shape of brightness [signifying Gods majesty and gracious kindness towards them that receive his word with faith and reverence see above chap 1 on vers 28] as the color of Hasmal [ see above chap 1 on vers 4.]
\p
\v 3 . And he put forth the likeness of an hand [to wit which likeness and shape is described in the former verse compare Dan 5.5] and took me by the hair [or hair locks ]of mine head and the spirit[ that is the holy ghost that shewed him this vision see above chap 1 on vers12 ] carried me up between the earth and between the heaven [ this was done in the spirit not in the body by a trance not by a change of places for the prophet interpreteth himself immediately saying in the vision of God [to wit which God by his spirit wrought in my mind so above chap 1.1 and below chap 40.2 ]to Jerusalem to the door of the gate of the inner court [this word is expressed in the Hebrew text below chap13.3 see of this court 1Kings 6 on vers 36 some understand this of the innermost part of the great court called otherwise the peoples court others of the entry of the great court ] which looketh toward the north where was the seat of an image of jealousie [ it is conceived that all image was the image of Baal unto whom Achaz had set up an altar 2Kings 16.10 &c which altar Hizekia afterward destroyed but Manasseh set it up again 2 Kings 12.3 it was after ward broken down by Josia and set up again by Joahaz and his breathen is called the image of jealousie because the idol worship performed unto it by the Jews provoked God to jealousie as followeth that is incensed and provoked him to anger because honor and service which his people only owed unto him as their only bride groom was tendered to his idol see Exod 20 .5 and Levit 20.5] which provoketh to jealousie [ namely the Lord its spoken after the manner of man see Deut 4 on vers 24 .]
\p
\v 4 . And behold the glory of God of Israel was there [see above chap 1 on vers28 ] according to the form that I saw in the valley [see above c 1 on vers 28]
\p
\v 5 . And he [to wit the spirit of whom is spoken above vers 3 said unto me child of man lift thine eyes now [ to wit the eyes of the spirit of the body for Ezekiel was not in Jerusalem according to the body but in a trance ]towards the way of the north [Heb way towards the north or north ward ]and I lift up mine eyes towards the way of the north and behold towards the north at the gate of the altar was the image of jealousy the entry [understand by the gate here mentioned the gate of the temple by which gate the copper altar otherwise called the altar of the burnt offering was to stand according to Gods commands but now this image was placed there compare 2 Kings 16 .14.]
\p
\v 6 . And he said unto me child of man seest thou indeed what they do the great abominations which the house of Israel here commit ?[meaning the abominable idolatry which they committed here to honor of Baal ] that I should go far away of my sanctuary ?[the meaning is that the abominations which they committed would give him cause to depart from his sanctuary ]but thou shalt yet again see great abominations [Heb thou shalt return thou shalt see c that is thou shalt see again see Numb 11 on vers4 others turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations. ]
\p
\v 7 . So he bought me to the door of the court [to wit the inner court whereof see above on vers 3 others understand the outer court ]then I looked and behold there was a hole in the wall [meaning an opening in the wall which the prophet is commanded to dig through and to see what was done within which was all done in a vision of the spirit and not by any bodily act. ]
\p
\v 8 . And he said unto me child of man dig now in that wall and I digged into that wall and behold there was a door [or there became a door [to wit which the Lord had made by that opening. ]
\p
\v 9 . Then he said unto me go in and behold the wicked abomination that they do here.
\p
\v 10 . So I went in and saw and behold there was every similitude [that is of all sorts and shapes forms or representations the word all or every is often so taken see Gen 7.14 so here in the sequel ]of creeping things and abominable beasts [Heb beasts of abominations that is that are detestable to wit not only because some of them might not be eaten Levit 11 but because they were all of them by reason of the divine honor that was given to them an abomination in the sight of God Deut 27.15] the Hebrew word rendered here beast signifieth a creature with four feet not only tame but also wild especially those that are of some bigness see Genes 6 on vers7 ] all the dung-gods [see Levit 26on vers 30 of teahouse of Israel portrayed [to wit either by picturing or by engraving ]quiet round about [Heb roundabout round about ] upon the wall .
\p
\v 11 . And seventy men of the eldest of the house of Israel [that is of the people of Juda see above chap 7 on vers2 some understand by these seventy men the seventy senatours Numb 11.17 whose president it may be Jaazania was .But these may be also understood other persons that were in authority among the people either because of their age or office or if that they ought to be examples of good unto others ]with Jaazania the son of Saphan [we read below chap11 vers 1 of another Jaazania that was the son of Azzur ]standing in the midst of them stood before their faces [ to wit the faces of the portrait images that is they ministered unto those idolatrous images see Deut 10 on vers8] and every man had his censer in his hand and a plentiful cloud or mist went up.
\p
\v 12 . Then said he unto me child of man hast thou seen what the eldest of the house of Israel do in the darkness [that is in secret and hidden places according to the abominations of the heathen] every man in his pictured inner chambers ? [ Heb inner chambers in his portraiture that is wherein every man had his idolatrous pictures which he honoured in secret this may be understood either of the chambers of the pries that were built about the temple 1 Kings 6.5 or of the secret places which they had set apart in their houses for the service of idols ]for they say the Lord seeth us not the LORD hath forsaken the land [this excuse they pretend when they would give a reason why they served idols .compare 2 Chrons 28.23 Jerem 44. 18. Moreover they declared that they were not afraid of Gods wrath because he minded tem not as being departed from them compare Psal 10.4,11 and 94.7]
\p
\v 13 . And he said unto me thou shalt yet greater see abominations [see above on vers 6] which they commit.
\p
\v 14 . And he brought to the door of the gate the lords house which is towards the north and behold their fat women weeping for Thammuz [by these women understand the priest whose idolatry was full of dishonesty and uncleanness committed to the honor of the idol Thammuz .Thammuz was the name of an heathenish idol which by many is held to have been the idol of Egyptian called the Osiris who had been the one Isis who have lost this her husband in Egypt caused him every year to be lamented by a kind of most filthy unclean idolatry others understand the idol Adonis which whom the heathen committed like idolatry ] the place where this idolatry was practised is conceived to have been by the gate off the priests court in the chambers that were built about the temple for the priest into these chambers they might no women come but the prophet saw some there. ]
\p
\v 15 . And he said unto me ,son of man hast thou seen that ?thou shalt yet again see greater abominations then these .
\p
\v 16 . And he brought me to the inner court of the Lords house [see above on verse 3 ] and behold at the door of the temple of the Lord between the porch [see hereof 1Kings 6 on vers 3] and between the altar[ to wit altar of a burnt offering others under stand the altar of incense which was in the holy place ] where about five and twenty men [which some conceive to have been those whereof mention is made below chap 11 .1 where they are called princes of the people that is rulers and governors in the land ]their hinder most part were towards the people of the Lord [that is towards the holy place and the holy of holies wherein the ark was a token of Gods gracious presence among that people ]and their faces towards the east ;[that is with their backs towards the west just as the heathen were wont to worship their idols but the Jews when they worshipped God where to turn their face s towards the west where the ark of God was in the holy of holies ]and these bowed themselves down towards the east before the sun .[that is and worshipped it with religious honor and worship against the express command of God Deut 17.2 ,3 c.
\p
\v 17 . Then he said unto me son of man hast thou seen that? is there anything counted lighter in the house of Israel then to commit these abominations which they commit here ? [this question implieth a strong denial see Gen 18.17 the meaning is that nothing was counted lighter by the Jews though these abominations committed against the first table were of all others the most grievous and most displeasing to God but there was no commandment so great but the Jews counted it a light thing a transgress against it ]when they have filled the land with violence [that is with oppression of the innocent and poor which is done either in public by judgment or in private by all manner of wrong and injury ]then they return themselves to provoke me to anger [to wit by idolatry whereby they provoke me to jealousy and prophane my temple ]for lo they put the vine branches [or boughs or graffs the Hebrew word is so taken Numb 13.4 and below chap 15.2 ]to their nose [to wit to honor of the fun whom they worship because they cherisheth and ripeneth the fruits this place is diversly expounded. ]
\p
\v 18 . therefore I will also deal in fury mine eye shall not pity neither will I spare [so above chap 5.11 & 7.4 ]though they cry before mine ears with a loud voice yet I will not hear them [to wit because their prayers shalt not proceed from a true and lively faith nor be joined with true repentance but only wrung from them by a sense of present misery and feeling and fear of great punishment without any firm resolution of true amendment compare Prov 1.28 Isa 1.15 Jerem 11.11.]
\c 9
\s God commandeth six men to execute his vengeance in Jerusalem ver 1 .The glory of the Lord departeth to be threshold of the temple 3.God commandeth a man clothed in linen first to set a mark upon all the godly 4.He commandeth the others to destroy all the rest 5.Which being done ,the prophet greatly troubled at it 8 Receiveth thereupon answer from God 9.The man clothed in linen reporteth the execution of his commission 11.
\p
\v 1 After that he [namely the Lord of whom see above chap 1 on vers 26] cried before mine ears with a loud voice [that is so that 1 Ezekiel heard this cry understand by this cry the Gods power providence whereby he moveth the creatures to executes his will and eternal counsel ]saying [to wit the holy Angels that are at Gods service to execute his commands and judgments Psal 103 .20 Heb 1.14 ]cause the overseer of the city namely Jerusalem .Heb .oversight & c .that is those that had the oversight :meaning certain angels that were appointed by God as overseers of the city :for they were by him set over lands ,nations ,and cities ,not only to preserve and defend them 2 Kings 6.17 .Dan 10.20,21,22. but also to punish them Gen 19.12,13 2 Kings 19.35 they are called princes Dan 10.20,21 also dominions ,principalities ,powers , Colos 1.18that is rulers ,commanders ,potentates .so here oversight for overseers ,commissioners ]to draw near and every man with his destroying weapon [Heb weapon or furniture of destruction ;that is whereby he should destroy the inhabitants of the city ] in his hand.
\p
\v 2 . And behold six men [that is as some are of opinion six angels in the shape of men compare Genes 18.2 Mark 16.5 Acts 1.10 some take it that by these men are meant the Chaldeans or the commanders of the army that should besiege Jerusalem.Others ,the nations and kingdoms which the Chaldeans should have for their aid and assistance in his expeditions ] came from the way of higher gate [see of this gate 2Kings 15 on vers 35 also 2 Chrons 27.3 Jerem 26.10]which is turned towards the north [to wit from whence the Chaldeans should come that should destroy the city and the temple ]and every one [to wit of those six men ]with his crushing weapon [Heb the furniture of his crushing, that is; the weapon wherewith he should crush and batter in pieces ]in his hand and one man in the midst of them [to wit ,distinct from the six men aforementioned for they were sent to destroy having their weapons ready for it ;but this man to save ,having for that purpose his inkhorn and a command to mark the godly as followeth ]was clothed with linen [like priest see Exod 28.39 Levit 6.10 some understand by this man our only high Priest the Lord Jesus Christ ,who is sent by his Father to deliver his people from the destruction of the soul and consequently he is not here considered in his divine Majesty and Glory ,which he hath common with the father and the holy Ghost as above chap 1.26 but in the state of his humiliation and office of Mediatourship ]and a writer ink-horn [ to wit ,out of which the writer taketh ink with his pen ]was on his lions ;[meaning ,hanging on the girdle of his lions ]and they went in and stood by his copper altar [so called Exod 38.30. 2Kings 16.14 otherwise the altar of burnt offerings Exod 30.28 of this place see Levit 1.3 ,5 a further description thereof see 2 Chron 4 on vers 1 .]
\p
\v 3 . And the glory of the God of Israel [see above chap 1 on vers 28] lifted up itself from the Cherub [meaning the Cherubim that where over the ark in the most holy place ,for a token of Gods gracious presence with that people .Some understand the Cherubims which Ezekiel saw in his vision compare below chap 10 on vers 4 with the annotate see of the Cherubims Genes 3 on vers 24 ]where upon he was [to wit God of Israel ,or she was namely the glory of God ] to threshold of the house that is the end of the most holy place this signifieth that God would part from the temple ]and he called to the man that was clothed in linen which had the writer ink-horn on his lions .
\p
\v 4 . And the Lord said unto him ,go thorow ,thorow the midst of the city and thorow the midst of Jerusalem ,and mark a mark upon the foreheads of the man that sigh [which were the remnant of Gods people hid among the back sliding generation .This marking was not done corporally by a visible and outward mark upon the body ;but spiritually by an invisible and inward mark upon the spirit ,which distinguisheth true believers from all hypocrites and unbelievers .For all this is done in a spiritual vision and consequently not by a corporal act compare Revel 7 .3] and cry out for all abominations that are done in the midst thereof namely of the city of Jerusalem .]
\p
\v 5 But to those others [ to wit those six other men that were appointed to destroy , to kill, and to cut off ,of whom see above vers 2]he said before mine ears ,go thorow ,thorow the city after him, [to wit that had the ink-horn on his lion and went before see of this man above vers 2 and the annotate the killing might not be done to those that were to be saved were marked ,and so exempted from the common destruction compare Genes 19.22] and smite :[that is killing ,destroy cut off compare chap 7.9 ]let not your eye pity neither spare ye .
\p
\v 6 . Slay ,old men ,young men ,and maids ,and little children ,and women even to the destruction ,[see the accomplishment 2Chrons 36.17 ]but come not near any man upon whom the mark is :[seeing some that were marked have also tasted of the outward punishment ,as namely Jeremia ,that was an exile in Egypt ,and others besides :understand this as was said before ,of the spiritual preservation unto salvation ]and begin at my sanctuary ][to wit the staying the staying or killing ] at my sanctuary [that is at my temple see 2 Chron 20on vers 8]and they began at the ancient man which where before the house [that is before the temple so in the sequel see of these ancient men above on chap 8.11 and the annotate .]
\p
\v 7 . And he said unto them defile the hose which was done by the dead bodies which was slain in it compare Numb 19.11 2 Kings 23.16 ]and fill the courts [see of both courts the inner and the outer court 1 King 6on vers 36 ]with the slain go forth and they smote in the city that is they made a great slaughter and killing of all forts of men throughout the whole city see the word smiting taken for killing Genes 8 on vers 21 .]
\p
\v 8 . Now it came to pass when they had smitten them [to wit the inhabitants of Jerusalem ]and I was left ; [to wit supposing myself to be left alone .compare 1 Kings 19.10 Rom 11.3 ] that I fell upon my face [to wit through great amazement at Gods severe vengeance and through compassion towards the people that were in slain compare Genes 17 on vers 3 ]and cried and said ah! Lord LORD wilt thou destroy all remnant of Israel [that is of Juda and of Benjamin and those that are of other tribes might be mingled among them see 2chron 21.2 and the annotate ]in pouring out thy wrath upon Jerusalem ?
\p
\v 9 . Then said unto me the iniquity of the house of Israel and Juda is exceeding great compare Genes 17.6, 20 below chap 16.13 and the land is filled with bloud [Heb blouds that is slaughters ,murders see Genes 4 on vers 10 and 1 Kings on vers 33 ] and the city is full of back-sliding [or perverseness ,or revolting ,or wresting of judgment ]for they say the Lord hath forsaken the land and the Lord seeth not [see above chap 8 on vers 12]
\p
\v 10 . Therefore as for me mine eye shall not pity neither will I spare he speaketh in the future tense because that was related before was not early done but only in a vision which in the prophets spirit was a representation and prediction of that which should actually done in its due time ] I will give their head [that is punish them as they have deserved by all their wicked deeds seee 1 Kings on ers 32 andabove chap 7 on vers 3 .]
\p
\v 11 . And behold the men that was clothed with linen on whose lions the ink-horn was brought word again saying I have done according as thou hast commanded me [ compare Psal 40.9 Job 4.34 and 5.30 and 6.38 and 17.4 others according to all that. ]
\c 10
\s A further vision of the glory of the Lord being like unto the former which the prophet had seen by the river Chebar and of the fiery coles which the man clothed with linen received for to scatter them in the city vers 1 & c The glory of the Lord seemeth here to have changed its place three times first from the Cherubims to the threshold of the temple 4 secondly from thence again upon the Cherubims 18 thirdly upon the Cherubims to the east-gate or foremost gate to go forth out of his house 19.
\p
\v 1 Then I looked [to wit in the spirit for the prophet was in a trance ]and behold above the firmament [see above chap 1 on vers22 and compare there vers 26 ]which was over the head of the Cherubims [that is the likeness of the Cherubims see of these Genes 3 on vers 24 they are above chap 1 on vers. 26 and he [to wit God who is called below the Lord vers 18 and the God of Israel vers14 ] appear upon them [to wit the firmament and the throne or upon them to wit the Cherubims.]
\p
\v 2 . And he spake to the man clothed with linen see of this man above chap 9 on vers 3 if by him here he understood the Lord .Christ then he is here considered as the judge of the wicked ] and he said go in even between the wheels [that is into the very midst of them so in the sequel understand by these the wheels whose description and signification see above chap 1 on vers 15 ] under the very Cherub [for the wheels where by the Cherubims ]and fill thy fists with fiery coles [which were representations of Gods just judgments see above chap 1 on vers 13 and compare Psal 18.9 ] from between the Cherubims [Heb from betweenesses of the Cherubims that is from the place which is between the Cherubims ]and scatter them over the city [ for a token that it shall be consumed by a burning of the sword famine and pestilence yea also with material fire 2 Kings 25.9] and he [ namely the man clothed with linen ] went in before mine eyes [that is so as I beheld him with mine eyes in this vision .]
\p
\v 3 . Now the Cherubims stood on the right side [that is on the north-side which looked towards the land of the Chaldeans to signifie the destruction of the temple and of the Jews to come from thence ] of the house [ that is of the temple of the Lord meaning in the inner court as appeareth by the following words of this vers ]when that man went in and a cloud which signifieth Gods wrath and the destruction that was neerhand ready to light upon the temple So that the cloud here is a token of Gods anger and approaching calamities as Psal 18.13 and not of his gracious co-habitation as Exod 40.34 Numb 9.15 1 Kings 8.10,`11]filled the innermost court [which was the court of the priest see 1 Kings 6 o vers 36.]
\p
\v 4 . Then the Glory of the Lord [see above chap 1 on vers 28 ]lifted up itself from high above its Cherub [upon which the Lord had his ordinary dwelling place in the holy of holies 1 Sam 4.4 Psal 8.20 Isa 37.16 or from upon these four Cherubims to the threshold of the house as followeth the Cherub or Cherubims for the singular number is here taken for the plural see above on vers 1 and chap 9 on vers 3] upon the threshold of the house [to signifie that God would remove from the temple and from that people by house is here meant that part of the temple which was called the holy place First God departed from the most holy place above c 9.3 Now he departeth also from the holy place and the house was filled with a cloud with a court [to wit the innermost court otherwise called the court of the priest ]was full of the brightness of the Lords glory .
\p
\v 5 . And the noise of the wing of Cherubims [to wit who thus as it were with praise and thanksgiving applauded the just removal of God or as it were with astonishment foretold the fearful misery that would follow thereupon of the Cherubims wings see above on chap 1 on vers6] was heard unto the outermost court [this is further described by similitudes above chap 1.24 the outermost court was otherwise called the great court see 1 Kings 7.9 and the annotate ]as the voice of the almighty God[ see above chap I on vers 24 of the almighty God see Gen 17 on vers 2 ] when he speaketh .
\p
\v 6 . Now it came to pass when he[namely the Lord whose glory is described above v 4] had commanded the man clothed with linen saying take fire [called above vers 2 fiery coles fire signifieth Gods wrath and vengeance see Job 22 n vers 20 ] from between the wheels [see above on vers 2]from between the Cherubims that he went in and stood by a wheel [ to wit by one of these four wheels that were by the Cherubims .Others wheels and so the singular number is taken for the plural compare above vers 4the annotate on the above Cherub. ]
\p
\v 7 . Then one Cherub [to wit one of the four of which see above chap 15 and the annotate ]put forth his hand from between the Cherubims unto the fire which was between the Cherubims and took thereof and gave it into the fists of him that was clothed with linen he took it and went out .
\p
\v 8 . For there was seen onto the Cherubims the likeness of a mans hand under their wings see above chap 1 on vers 8 Nevertheless understand that each of them had two hands The singular number for the plural compare above vers 4 on the word Cherub also below vers 21 .]
\p
\v 9 . Then I looked and behold four wheels [ see above chap 1on vers 15 ]were by the Cherubims [which were also four in number above chap 1 vers 5 were they are called beasts see the annotate ]one wheel was by every Cherub [Heb one wheel by one Cherub and one wheel by one Cherub that is by every Cherub a wheel see of this phrase Genes 7 on vers 2 and Numb 7 vers 11 and 13 on vers 2 ] and the form of the wheels was as the colour of the beryl-stone a precious stone of which see above chap 1 on vers 16 ]
\p
\v 10 . And as for their forms these four had one manner of likeness which signifieth that in all the works of God there is a wonderful likeness in manner order and perfection ]as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel [see above chap 1 vers 15 on the words four faces likewise see the annotate in the same place on vers 16 .]
\p
\v 11 . When those [ to wit the Cherubims by whom the wheels were see above chap 1 on vers 9.] then these [to wit the wheels see above chap 1 on vers 17 went upon their four sides they turned not about when they went [ see above chap 1 on vers 17 ] but the place whither the head looked [meaning one of the four head which every Cherub had which looked towards the four winds ]they followed it they turned not about as they went .
\p
\v 12 . Now their [to wit the Cherubims ]whole body [Heb flesh for mans body consisteth of flesh see Job 12 on vers 10 ]and their hands and their wings together with the wheels were full of eyes round about [eyes are here ascribed unto the Cherubims though not in the first vision chap 1 which signifie the providence of God which enlightened and whereby all their works is wisely ordered and performed compare above chap 1 on vers 18 where mention is made of the eyes of the wheel ]those four [ to wit Cherubims see above chap 1 on vers 15 likewise here verse 9 ] had their wheels the meaning is that every Cherub had one wheel .]
\p
\v 13 . As for the wheels everyone of them was called before man ears Galgal [that is in my hearing or so that I heard it every wheel was called Galgal that is wheel or globe or ball or thus it was cried unto them o wheel or the wheel &c.]
\p
\v 14 . And everyone had four faces and the first face [to wit of everyone of the Cherubims now this first face of the Cherub was that which looked forward the second that looked towards the right hand the third towards the left hand the forth looked backward such four faces they all four had Heb the face of the first ]was the face of the Cherub [some are of opinion that here instead of the face of an ox is put the face of a Cherub to shew that they were all Cherubims others give other reasons ] and the second face was the face of a man and the third was that of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagle [in the vision is some difference both in order and appellation from the former vision mentioned above c1 though indeed it was the very same see above chap 15 .22.]
\p
\v 15 . And those Cheribims lifted themselves on high this was the very beast [or these were the very beasts the singular number before the plural he speaketh of the four beast whereof see above chap 1.5] that I had seen by the river Chebar .
\p
\v 16 . And when the Cheribims ran then those wheels went by them and when the Cheribims lifted up their wings to lift themselves on high from the earth then those same wheels also turned not themselves about from besides them .
\p
\v 17 . When those [to wit the Cheribims ] stood these[to wit the wheels so in the sequel ] stood and when those were lifted up they also lifted up themselves for the spirit of the beasts [To wit the holy Ghost see above chap 1 on vers 12 others the spirit of life ] was in them .
\p
\v 18 . Then the Glory of the Lord [that is God that is glorious see above chap 1 on vers 28 ] departed from above the threshold of the house [to wit upon which was come before from the Cherubims see above vers 4 and the annotate ] and stood or set itself above the Cherubims .
\p
\v 19 . And the Cherubims lift up their wings and lift up themselves on high from the earth before mine eyes [that is that I beheld it to wit with the eyes of my spirit being in a trance ] when they went out the wheels were over against them or besides them and everyone stood or stayed at the door of the east gate or foremost gate of the Lord house [some understand by this gate the gate of the priest court others the gate of the people court this signified that God would at length utterly remove from his house compare above chap 9 the annotate on vers 3 and in this chap on vers 4 and the glory of God from Israel was from above over them namely over the Cherubims .]
\p
\v 20 . This is the beast see above vers 15 ]that I saw under the God of Israel [for these beasts stood under the firmament above which the Glory of God appeared see above chap 1 .26 and here vers 1 ]by the river Chebar [see above chap 1.3 ] and I perceived that they were Cherubims [so that the vision of the prophet served for interpretation of the first vision described above chap 1.]
\p
\v 21 . Everyone had four faces and everyone had four wings and the likeness of mens hands was under their wings .
\p
\v 22 And as for the likeness of heir faces they were the same faces that I had seen by the river Chebar their forms and themselves they went everyone straight on before his face [see above chap 1 on vers 9.]
\c 11
\s God sheweth unto the prophet the wickedness of the chiefest rulers in Jerusalem that mocked at Gods prophecies vers 1 c the prophet must prophesie of their sins and punishments 4, one of the aforesaid rulers dieth at which the prophet is troubled 13, God sheweth him how those at Jerusalem mocked at their brethren that were carried away to Babel to whom on the contrary God promiseth his both spiritual and corporal blessing 14 .The glory of the Lord foresaketh the city 22.God bringeth the prophet again in a vision to his fellow captive breathen in Chaldea 24.
\p
\v 1 Then the spirit lift me up [meaning the spirit of God that sheweth him this vision see above chap 8 on vers 3 ]and brought me to the east-gates of the Lords house [ see above chap 10 on vers 19 ] which looketh east ward and behold at the door of the gate were five and twenty men [it is conceived that they were then very same that were mentioned above chap8.16 however this is the most certain that they were men of great account among the people and especially those whose names are hereafter expressed .They come here out of the house of the Lord from the idol service which they had performed to the sun and discourse together about fortifying the city as followeth ]and in the midst of them I saw Jaasania the son of Azzur [this is to be distinguished from another Jaasania the son of Saphan above chap8.11] and Pelatia the son of Benaja [this Pelatia is also to be distinguish ed from another of this name 1 Chron3.21 and 4.42 ] princes of the people [that is most honourable and excellent persons that being in place of government and authority were greatly respected by people and consequently ought to have been examples of piety unto them compare Exod 3.16 Levit 4.15 2Kings 23.1 and annotations. ]
\p
\v 2 . And he said unto me [he to wit the spirit that carried him whence it appeareth that the word must not be understood of the wind others understand by this speaking person the Lord that shewed himself over the Cherubims above chap 10 .19 ] these are the men that devise iniquity and that counsel evil in this city [to wit not to deliver up the city into the hand of the Chaldeans against the counsel of the prophet Jeremia but to defend it against them .]
\p
\v 3 . Which say a man ought not to build houses nearby [to wit near the city that is in the suburbs ] this city [that is Jerusalem ]should be the pot [to wit whereof Jeremia prophesized Jerem 1.13 see above chap 1 on vers 3 ]and we the flesh [that is the Chaldeans coming to besiege this city might conveniently dwell in the houses of the suburbs and as a fire cause the city being as a pot to seethe and consume us that should be in it as the flesh by famine compare below chap 24.47c they scoff at Jeremias prophecy Jerem 1.13 which they by their counsel go about to discredit and to prove it to be a false and lying prophecy others our destruction is not near let us build houses to wit the tarry and dwell here and so let this city be the pot and we the flesh for if we be the flesh in the pot we must stay in it so that Jeremia prophecieth himself when he telleth us that we shall be carried away .]
\p
\v 4 . Therefore prophesie against them prophesie o child of man .
\p
\v 5 . So then the spirit of the Lord fell upon me [see above chap 1 on vers 3 ]and he said unto me [see above on vers 2] say thus saith the Lord thus do ye say [to wit as is related immediately before vers 3 ]o house of Israel [that is Juda see 2 Chron 15 .17 and 21.2 with the annotate ]for I know every one of the things that ascendnto your spirit [Heb the ascensions of your spirit whatsoever ascendeth into the thought of your heart see of the like phrase Jerem 7.31.]
\p
\v 6 . Ye [to wit princesses and rulers of the city of whom see above on vers 1]have multiplied your slain in this city [that is those whom you have opposed in the city by all manner of injustice compare above chap 7.23 and 9.9 ]and you have filled the street with the slain .
\p
\v 7 . Therefore thus saith the Lord LORD your slain whom ye have laid down in the midst of it they are that flesh and this city is the pot and I will cause you to go forth out of the midst of it [to wit Jerusalem namely by means of the Chaldeans that should take them captive and punish them according to their deserts see the four following verses others be shall or they shall cause you to go forth meaning the enemy .That which the Jews spake in derision of Jeremiahs words the same doth Ezekiel retort against them as if he had said the city of Jerusalem is indeed the pot but the flesh that boils in it are those whom ye have cruelly oppressed in it for which cause and all your impieties Gods wrath shall devour you and such as you are yet more fearful and hitherto is hath done .]
\p
\v 8 . Ye have feared the sword that is war see Levit 26] and I will bring the sword upon you saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 9 . And I will cause you to go forth out of the midst thereof and I will deliver you into the hand of strangers [namely of the Chaldeans ]and I will do judgment among you [see above on vers 8.]
\p
\v 10 . They shall fall by the sword that is perish by war see Levit 26 on vers 7 ]I will judge you [that is punish you ompare Genes 15 on vers 14 so here in the next vers] in the borders of Israel [namely in Ribla see of this city 2 Kings 23 on vers33 and 25.6 it lay in the land of Hamath which was by north on the border of Palestina Numb 33 Jos 13.5 ]and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
\p
\v 11 This city shall not be your pot [to wit seeth in it that is to stay in it and to bear your greatest punishment touching this life ]and ye shall not [this word must here be added again from the former clause be the flesh in the midst thereof therefore I will judge you in the board of Israel [as above in the fore going 5 verse see the fulfilling hereof 2 Kings 25.21 Jerem 52.10.]
\p
\v 12 . And ye shall know that I am the Lord because ye have not walked in my statutes neither done my judgments but have done according to the rules or manner of the heathen that are round about you meaning the idolatious law and customs of the heathen which God had forbidden his people in any wise to follow Levit 18.3 and 20.23 Deut 12.9,30 and 18 .14 above chap 5 on vers 7 the Jews are reproved because they lived not according to the judgments or laws of the heathen but see thereof the annotate there.
\p
\v 13 . Now it came to pass when I prophesied that Pelatia the son of died [it seemeth that this prophesying of Ezekiel and the dying of Pelatia happened in that vision and afterwards indeed so that Ezekiel actually declared unto the Israelites that were in Chaldea that which he had seen and done in the spirit and that the death of Pelatia then also happened actually for confirmation of his prophecy ]then fell I down upon my face [to wit through astonishment and to pray for the remnant of the people compare Numb 14 on vers5]and cried with aloud [Heb great ] vice and said ah Lord LORD wilt thou utterly make a full end of the remnant of Israel ?[the prophet in this complaint doth not properly look at Pelatia that was a wicked man but at a few that yet were left conceiving that if the Lord should so go on he would suddenly make an end whereas he had promised to reserve a remnant see of this phrase Jerem 4 on vers 27 .]
\p
\v 14 . Then the word of the Lord came unto me saying .
\p
\v 15 . Child of man they are [meaning those that with Jojachin by Jeremiahs counsel had removed as exile into Chaldea 2 Kings 24.12 & c ]thy brethren [that is thy kinsmen or neer of kin see Gen 24 on vers 27] thy brethren [this repetition is made or express the zeal of God and the weightiness of the matter ] the man of thy kindred ,[ Heb of redemption that is those by virtue of their kindred had right to redeem thy goods and consequently are thy nearest kinsmen see Levit 25.25] and all the house of Israel yea all that [to wit that was there in Chaldea for he most past belonging to the tribe of Juda ]unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said [to wit mocking them because they had left their own country and dwell like banished men in Chaldea whereas they on the other side still possessed and enjoyed the land which God had given unto their fathers for an inheritance as followeth ]get you far away from the Lord this same land is given unto us for an hereditary possession [as if they had said we only are Gods people that inhabit his land which he gave unto our fathers . We have nothing to do with you that are gone away from us and ye shall have no share with us in this land which ye shall forsaken .]
\p
\v 16 . Therefore say thus saith the Lord LORD although I have removed them [to wit those whom he had in the former verse called the prophets brethren and the house of Israel so in the sequel ]far off among the heathen and although I have scattered them in the lands yet I will be to them a little while a sanctuary [or I am to them a little while a sanctuary to wit instead of the visible temple in Jerusalem which was a token of my presence I will be a little while with them without that outward token dwelling among them by my spirit and grace hearing their prayers and protecting them .Others a sanctuary of fewness that is a few compare Isa 8.14 .] in the land into which they are come [to wit the land of Chaldea and other countrys wherein are scattered .]
\p
\v 17 . Therefore say thus saith the Lord yea I will gather you from the nations and I will assembly you out of the land wherein ye scattered [which was fulfilled when the Jews came back out of the Babylonian captivity into their own country and yet more fully when our saviour Christ gathered his church out of all nations by the ministry of the apostles ]and I will give you the land of Israel [to wit after the captivity of seventy years .]
\p
\v 18 And they shall come hither and take away all the detestations thereof and all the abominations thereof [that is the idols which man ought to detest and abominate ]from thence .
\p
\v 19 . And I will give them one kind of a heart [that is such as is not double of false but is upright unfeigned cleaving only unto me and not divided between me and idols. See further Jerem 32.39with the annotate .By heart here is meant inclination motion .So is the word heart for the most part taken when it is place by the word spirit which then signifieth the mind understanding and thoughts of man Psal 51.12 below chap 18.31 and 36.26 ] and will give a new spirit in the innermost part of you [ that is another mind and other thoughts then were in you before .Meaning a change of the spirit not in substance and essence but in qualities and powers compare the fore-quoted places likewise Rom7.6 and 12.2 Cor4.13 Eph 4.23 Col 30.10.] and I will take away the stony heart [Heb the heart of stone that is a stony heart the heart of unregenerate man is here likened to a stone in regard of its natural hardness .The resemble consisteth also herein that a stone of its own nature hath not power to change or to turn itself into flesh so neither hath an unregenerate man by his own unregenerate nature power to turn unto God but as God is able even of stones to raise up children unto Abraham Matth 3.9 so can he also soften his heart by his saving and sanctifying spirit ] out of their flesh [ that is out of their body wherein the soul dwelleth see Job 12 on vers 10 and this I will do saith God by rooting out of the soul by rooting qualities power and faculties wherewith through their own corrupt nature they oppose me and by taking them away from them by the spirit of regeneration that they may no more rebel against me ]and will give them a fleshy heart [Heb an heart of flesh that is a fleshy heart the heart of a regenerate man is here resembled to flesh which is not hard like a stone but is flexible soft and suffereth itself willingly to be led by Gods spirit such is the heart of man after God hath taken away the stony heart and hath given a new heart .]
\p
\v 20 . That they walk in my statutes [ he saith not that they may be able or may have power to walk &c but he speaketh of actually obedience which the regenerate yield unto God ] and keep my judgments [the word keep hath respect to the certain perseverance of those that are truly converted unto God ]and do them and they shall be a people unto me [see Levit 26 on vers 12 ] and I will be a God unto them [ See Gen 17 on vers 7 and Levit 18 on vers 2 compare Jerem 24.7 and 30.22 and 31.1 and 33.38 .]
\p
\v 21 . But whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestations and their abominations [that is idols of walking after idols compare 1 Kings 11 on vers 5 after the heart that is which they conceive that their idols do wish and desire .Others but as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestations and abominations ] I will render their way upon their head [see above chap9.10 compare Jerem 9.10 ]saith the Lord .
\p
\v 22 . Then did the Cherubims see above chap 1.6 upon the word beasts ]lift up their wings [to wit wherewith they flew see above chap 1 on vers 6 ] and the wheels [see above chap 1 on vers 15]over against them and the glory of God of Israel [see above chap 1 on vers 28 so in the next vers ] was over them from above .
\p
\v 23 . And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city [see above chap 10 on vers 4 ] and stood upon the mountains [that is stayed or went and stood or set itself upon the mountain meaning the mountain of Olives whereof see 2 Sam 15.30 Zach 14.4 Matth 24.3 ]which is towards the east of the city .
\p
\v 24 . Afterward the spirit took me up and brought me in vision by the spirit of God into Chaldea [that is in a vision that was shewed me by the spirit of God compare above chap 4 on vers 4 ] the meaning is that all this happened to him in the vision of his spirit not really in his body which still remained in Chaldea ] to them that were carried away captive [Heb captive carrying away so in the next vers see above chap 1 on vers 1 ] and the vision that I had seen went up from me [that is ceased or vanished away. ]
\p
\v 25 . And spake unto them that they were all carried away captive all the words [or matters ]things of the Lord which he had caused me to see .
\c 12
\s The prophet is commanded by God to represent his own person the flight and captive carrying away of King Zedekia and the people excepting a few vers 1 also to eat his bread and to drink his water with carefulness and anguish for a token unto the Jews 17 God rejecteth the taunting proverb of the Jews and foretelleth on the contrary a sudden and certain accomplishment of his prophesies ,21.
\p
\v 1 Moreover ,the of word of the Lord came unto me ,saying :
\p
\v 2 . Child of man thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious [that is in Chaldea amongst the Jews that with the King Jojachin were carried away out of their own country into Babylon among whom though God had his own people above chap 11.16,17,c yet it appeareth from this place that many of them were unbelieving and obstinate persons of the term rebellious house see above chap 2 on vers 5 also in the sequel compare above likewise chap 2.3 and 5.6,7 and3.26 ,27 ] which have eyes tosee and see not [to wit inwardly by the spirit to perceive what punishments themselves had endured and yet had to expect more to the end that they might be converted unto God compare Isa6.9 and 42.18 Jerem 5.21 ]have ears to hear and to hear not [that is believe not nor obey according to all the warnings or threatening which God hath given them by the prophets compare Jerem 5.21.] for they are a rebellious house .
\p
\v 3 . Therefore thou child of man make thee furniture of removing [to wit a wallet or bundle staff traveling –coat shoes and other necessary for a journey compare Matth 10.9,10 .Others understand household -stuff as bedding bolster stools tables chests cabinets &c] and remove by day before their eyes [ that is so as that they may behold it with their eyes for the Lord would by that which the prophet was to do publicly give these that were carried away a captive by a certain token of that which of a certain should shortly basal those of Juda and Jerusalem because they believed it not that it should be ill with them yea they hoped suddenly themselves to return thither Jerem 28.3 they rebuking the prophet Jeremia by whose advice they had suffered themselves to be carried away into Chaldea ] and thou shalt remove from thy place [to wit where thou dwellest ]to another place [to wit where in the city thou hast not dwelt and that to fashion thy self every way after the manner of those that remove indeed and are wont to change often and frequently their habitation which was to be token unto the people that king Zedikia with his people should be constrained suddenly to remove out Juda and Jerusalem and to carried away captive to Babel ]before their eyes it may be before they considerate [to wit how I will punish them from their rebellion it may be he useth his particle to leave the prophet doubtful of the successful event of this token that he might learn to be contented with only obeying and following his command .It sheweth also that he would raise up some good hope in the prophet to stir him up to diligence ]though they be a rebellious house [that is though they be willful & disobedient so that there is not much amendment to be expected in them yet I will shew them this visible token for the greater conviction .Others because they are rebellious house in regard such judgments shall light upon their people and they themselves were not yet battered by their own judgment which had befallen them.]
\p
\v 4 . Thou shalt then bring forth thy furniture [to wit whereof is spoken in the former vers ]by day before their eyes as the furniture of those that remove [Heb as the furniture of removing that is which men take along with them when they remove depart or take a journey ]afterwards thou shalt go forth in the evening before their eyes [ it seemeth that the prophet is enjoyned first to bring his furniture into a place before his house being within the wall and to go away with it in the dark as followeth to signifie that the Jews should seek to escape away privily and that King Zedekia should get away out of Jerusalem and flee by night as it also came to pass 2Kings 25.4 Jerem 39.4 and 52.7 the evening is here taken for the night see Job 7 on vers 4 ]as they go forth that remove [Heb according to the goings forth of removing that is after the manner of going forth of them that take a journey .
\p
\v 5 . Dig thee through the walls before their eyes and bring out thereby thy furniture [to wit to signifie that King Zedekia should cause the city walls to be broken that he with his soldiers might thrown the breach escape out of danger see the accomplishment thereof 2 kings 25.7 Jerem 52.7 these words thy furniture are here inserted from the foregoing fourth vers and the following seventh vers. ]
\p
\v 6 . Before their eyes [see above on vers 3] shalt thou carry it upon thy soldiers thou shalt bring it forth in the dark thou shalt cover thy face that thou see not the land [this signifieth that King Zedikiah should flee away from swifly and so dismayed to escape the hands of the Chaldean that he should fearcely see the land through which he fled again that Zedikiah should be deprived of his sight by the loss of his eyes so that he should not see the land of Babylon . See the accomplishment 2Kings 25 .7 Jerem 39.7and 52.11 the covering of the face hath also been a token of shame and grief which a man already hath and of trouble which is to be expected compare 2 Sam 15 on vers 30 Esth 7.8 Jerem 14.3]for I have given thee for a wonder token unto the house of Israel [to wit to signifie that which was to come namely the ruine of King Zedekia and of the city of Jerusalem so below vers 11 and chap 24.24 compare Psal 71.7 with the annotate .
\p
\v 7 . And I did so according as I was commanded I brought forth my furniture by day as he furniture of them that remove [Heb f removing ] afterwards in the evening I digged me through the wall mine hand [not with any iron tools and open violence but as it is were with a thief-like slight and privacy to signifie that king Zedekia with his company should seek privily to escape and flee from the hands of Chaldeans see 2 Kings 25.4 ]I brought it forth in the dark [to wit the traveling furniture and I carried it upon my should before their eyes .
\p
\v 8 . And in the morning came the word of the Lord unto me saying :
\p
\v 9 . Child of man hath not the house of Israel a rebellious house said unto thee what doest thou ?[that is what’s the matter that thou dost thus suddenly remove in a strange kind of a way ?]
\p
\v 10 . Say unto them thus saith the Lord this burden [that is this prophecy that is propound unto you by the token of my removing see 2 Kings 9 on vrs 25 ]is against the prince of Jerusalem [that is king Zedikia and all the house of Israel the meaning is that the burden which he carried upon his shoulders was a token of the burden of great miseries that should come shortly unto the king his Lords and all the people or thus this burden is against Jerusalem ]that is in the midst thereof [to wit the Jews that dwelt in Jerusalem or the city of Jerusalem wherein the Jews and Israelites were gathered. ]
\p
\v 11 . Say I am your wonder-token see above on vers 6 like as I have done [to wit in bearing this furniture thus for to remove ]so shall it be unto them [namely to the king of Juda and his people ] they shall be carrying away or removing go into captivity [to wit to Babel see the accomplishment hereof 2 Kings 25.]
\p
\v 12 . And the prince [namely king Zedekia of whom is spoken in the foregoing vers ] that is in the midst of them [that is of those of Jerusalem and all Juda ] shall carry the furniture [to wit such furniture as in needful for traveling as above vers 4 ]upon his shoulder in the dark compare above vers 4,6,7]and he shall go forth and they shall dig through the wall [compare above vers 5]to bring him out thereby he shall cover his face that he see not the ground with his eye compare above vers 6. ]
\p
\v 13 . I will also spread out my not upon him [to wit by the Chaldean soldier that shall pursue after him in his flight and take him as followeth see of the accomplishment 2 Kings 25.5 ,6 and of the phrase Job 19 on vers 6 that he be taken in my snare and I will bring him into Babylon the land of the Chaldeans also be shall not see it [to wit because by sentence past upon him his eyes shall be blinded before he cometh thither 2 Kings 25.7 ]though he shall die there .
\p
\v 14 . And I will scatter into all the winds [see above chap 5 on vers 10 ]all that are about him for his help [to wit those that accompanied king Zedekia in his flight see the accomplishment hereof 2 Kings 25.5 understand the Egyptians that were formally come to help the king in his siege Jerem 37.6also those that are after Gedalias death were fled into Egypt Jerem 42.16,17,18and 43.5,6,7]and all his bands [the word signifieth properly wings and all his bands and troops of soldiers so below chap 17.21 and 39.10 ] and I will draw out the sword after them [see above chap 5 on vers 2.]
\p
\v 15 . So they shall know [see above chap 5 on vers 13 ]that I am the Lord [see above chap 6 on vers 7]when I shall disperse them among the heathen and scatter them in the lands .
\p
\v 16 . And I will cause a few men [Heb men of number that is a few man that may be easily be numbered see Genes 34.30 ]of them [to wit of the Jews and other Israelites that were mingled one among another in Jerusalem and without the city ]to be left from the sword from the famine and from the pestilence that they may declare all their abominations [against the first and the second se thereof 2 Kings 16.3,4 and 21 .2,3 2Chron 33.2,3and36 .14,16 ] among the heathen wither they shall come [to wit that they may declare them not only in bare words but also actually declare that they were the cause of their scattering into all the countries round about whereby they shall be brought as it were upon the stage of a public shew of Gods vengeance against sin] and they shall know that I am the Lord [to wit not only the Jews shall know it finding really and indeed that I am true just and an enemy unto sin but also the Gentiles shall know it being informed by the Jews and beholding the just plagues wherewith God punished their sins . ]
\p
\v 17 . Afterwards the word of the Lord came unto me saying
\p
\v 18 . Child of man thou shalt eat thy bread with trembling and thou shalt drink thy water with trouble and with carefulness [to wit to signifie the distress fear and dismaiedness where into the Jews should be brought into Jerusalem and everywhere through out the land compare above chap 4.16.]
\p
\v 19 . And thou shalt say unto the people of the land [namely of Chaldea he meaneth the Jews and the Israelites that dwelleth there as captives unto these it would be satisfactory to hear what would yet become of Jerusalem for they were grieved to wit being seduced by false prophets that by Jeremias counsel they had left their own land and they have yielded themselves up to their enemies ]thus saith the Lord of the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel they shall eat their bread with carefulness and they shall drink their water with astonishment [that is being exceedingly troubled perplexed and astonished at the unexpected and fearful miseries that should fall upon them once ]because her land [meaning the land of Jerusalem ti wit wherein this city lay and over which she bare rule ]shall be desolate from her fullness [that is from that which it is full of so Psal 24.1 meaning all manner of abundance and riches that should be taken away by the enemy ]because of the violence of all them that dwell therein .
\p
\v 20 . And the inhabited cities shall be laid wast and the land shall be wilderness and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
\p
\v 21 . Again the word of the Lord came unto me saying :
\p
\v 22 . Child of man what kind of proverb [the Hebrew word signifieth here a common word saying signifying much in few words and so well known to the greatest part of men that upon occasion it is commonly made use of see 1Sam 10.12 and 24 .14 and below chap 18.2] is this which you have in the land of Israel [to wit you that among your selves mock at my threatenings ]saying the days shall be prolonged and every vision shall perish?[the meaning of this proverb is that they had nothing to do with the predictions of the prophet touching their ruine because God according to his patience and long suffering would prolong the time of the coming of their destruction which the prophet made it to be short or because their prophesie would never be found true .]
\p
\v 23 . Therefore say unto them thus saith the Lord I will make this proverb to cease that they shall use it no more for a proverb in Israel but say unto them the days [that is the times of their ruine ]are at hand and the word of every vision [that is the prophecy of their destruction by the Chaldeans or the subitance of every prophecy concerning your destruction aforesaid. ]
\p
\v 24 . For they shall be no more any vain vision [that is false and lying prediction so Liment 2.14 below chap 13.6 ,7 Zach 10.2 vanity for falsehood see Job 31on vers 5 ] nor flattering divination in the midst of the house of Israel [Heb smooth divination or divination of him that is smooth to wit is mouth or tongue by flattering and fair speaking compare Prov 5.3 and 26.28 and the annotate he speaketh of the false prophets that gain-sayed the true prophets and soothed up the people with sweet and pleasing predictions in their unbelief idolatry and wicked lives others slippery that is doubtful divinations. ]
\p
\v 25 . For I am the Lord I will speak the word that I shall speak shall be done the time shall be no more delayed [for the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar followed shortly after Heb properly be adjourned ]for in your days [that is in your life time] o rebellious house will I speak the word and do the same saith the Lord.
\p
\v 26 . Moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying :
\p
\v 27 . Child of man behold they of the house of Israel say the vision that he seeth for many days [that is for a long while before it shall be accomplished for that the punishment shall not come in our days .They do not absolutely deny the truth of the prophecy but to rock themselves asleep they put it off a long while ]be [they mean the prophet Ezekiel ] prohesieth of the times that are far off .
\p
\v 28 . Therefore say unto them thus saith the Lord LORD none of my words shall be anymore delayed the word that I have spoken it shall be done saith the Lord LORD.
\c 13
\s God commandeth the prophet to prophesie against the false prophets and their vain daubing ver1 also against the false prophetesses and their arm-pillow and head- vails coverings 17.
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came unto me saying :
\p
\v 2 . Child of man prophesie against the prophet of Israel [to wit that were in Chaldea among the captive Jews whom they would make to believe that they should quickly return into their own country .See of them also Jerem29.8 they had their companion also in Jerusalem Jerem 23.16 ,17 ]that prophecy [that is that take upon them but falsely the prophetical office ]and say unto them that prophesy out their own heart [Heb unto the prophets out of their own hearts that is those that prophesy that which proceedeth out of their own opinion judgment and motion and not from God Such kind of prophets are said to prophecy false vision and the deceits of their own hearts Jerem 14 .14 to speak the vision of their own heart Jerem 23.16 to be prophets of the deceits Jerem 23.26 to walk after their own spirit in the next vers see the contrary Numb 16.28 and the annotate there] hear the word of the Lord .
\p
\v 3 . Thus saith the Lord wo unto those foolish prophets that walk after their own spirit [that is follow their own minds and conceptions in propounding their presumptuous prophesies compare the annotate on the former vers ]and that which they have not seen [that is that which was not shewed them by God in a vision to declare it in his name unto the people the word seeing is often thus taken as Prov 24.4 Isa 30.10 Lament 2.14 and here below vers 6,7,8 hence the prophets are called seers .See 1 Sam 9 on vers 9 and 2 Chrons 9 on vers 29. ]
\p
\v 4 . Thy prophets O Israel are like the foxes in the waste places [to wit like these foxes that being in waste barren and desolate places were very little prey is to be had are very eager to snatch at the meanest thing they come at. ]
\p
\v 5 . Ye [to wit false prophets ]have not gone up into the gaps [it is similitude taken from warlike affairs were valiant soldiers do boldly set themselves in the gap that is made in the city-wall by the enemy to keep the enemy out of it which the false prophets ought to have imitated by their prayers unto God and exhortations unto congregations to turn away Gods judgments and punishments see the same phrase Psal 16.23 ,30 and below chap 22.30 ]neither have ye made the hedge for the house of Israel [to wit when the said hedge was broken its anther similitude taken from the gardens whose hedge and fences when they are hurt by the wild beast must be repaired against a new in rode of them see of the comparison below chap .30 ]to stand in battle in the day of the Lord [meaning the time wherein the Lord would send the Chaldeans against the Israelites to destroy them the day of the Lord for the day of punishment is vengeance see Job 24 on vers 1 .]
\p
\v 6 . They [to wit the false prophets unto whom Ezekiel had spoken in the second person vers 5 of whom he now speaketh in the third person as also above vers 4 see of the like alteration in person Job 18.4 ] see vanity [see above chap 12 on vers 24 ]and lying predictions [Heb prediction of a lye ] that say the Lord hath spoken whereas the Lord hath not sent them and they give hope of confirming the word [or the matter to wit which they have false pretended to be a prophecy that came from God .]
\p
\v 7 . Do ye not see a vision [Heb a vision of vanity so above chap 12.24 see the annotate ] and speak a lying prediction [Heb the prediction of a lye ]when ye say [to wit unto the people ] the Lord speaketh whereas I [namely I the Lord ] have not spoken ?[this question implieth a strong affirmation ]
\p
\v 8 . Therefore thus saith the Lord LORD because ye speak vanity and see a lye therefore behold I will be upon you [to wit to punish and destroy you compare Jerem 21.13 with the annotate ] saith the Lord LORD .
\p
\v 9 . And mine hand [that is my power to punish and destroy so Exod 9.3 Judge 2.15 1 Sam 2.12 .15 ]shall be against prophets that see vanity and foretell a lye they shall not be in the assembly [so is the word sod taken Psal 89.8 and 111.1 ]of my people neither be written in the house of Isarel [that is as the register of Gods children compare Exod 32.32 and the annotate like wise Psal 69.29 and the annotate Luke 10.20 Revel 13.8 and 17.8 and 20.15 and 21 .27 of the house of Israel that is that formed the number of the true church ]nor enter unto the land of Israel [that is not return unto the land of Juda out of the Babylonian captivity as they also that remain impenitent shall not enter into the heavenly Canaan .The meaning then of this passage is that false prophets shall not be reckoned among Gods chosen people nor be partakers of his spiritual goods ]and ye shall know that I am the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 10 . Therefore yea therefore [this doubling is made to add greater force to the sense or meaning see the like Genes 7 on vers 2 and 14on vers 30 Numb 3.9 and duet 16.20 Joel 3 .14 and the annotate ]because they seduce my people [to wit so as that they have not believed my threatening nor purely performed worship nor obeyed my laws prescribing the way the rule of life Jerem 28.15 ,16 ]saying peace [that is making them believe that all things were well and that there was no punishment to be expected compare Jerem 6.14 and 28.9 and below vers 16 where there is no peace and because one [ to wit false prophets ] buildeth a mud-wall [that is a slight and weak fence to save an house from violence onset and breach meaning the vain and flattering prophets deceivers which they presented unto people that they might not believe the threatening of God denounced by the prophets ] and lo others [to wit other false prophets ] daub it with slight lime that it[to wit helped by the vain and plausible flattering to confirm make good former prophets propounded prophecy understand here the slight lime an ill-made or tempered stuff of lime or mortar that easily falleth off and perisheth compare below chap22 .28. ]
\p
\v 11 . Say unto them that plaister with slight lime that it [to wit the mud-wall ]]there shall be an over flowing shower [understand by this and that which followeth the violence of the Chaldeans which should be terrible poured out upon Jerusalem and the kingdom of Juda .The same comparison are also elsewhere used see Isa 25.4 Jerem 47.2 below chap 38.22 ] and ye O great hall-stones shall fall and a stormy wind shall spilt it .
\p
\v 12 . Lo when that wall shall be fallen shall it not then be said unto you [to wit by the man that passing by shall see the ruine of the house or shall have notice thereof .This question implieth a strong affirmation ]where is the plaistering wherewith ye have plaistered ?
\p
\v 13 . Therefore thus saith the Lord LORD yea I will split it [to wit that mud-wall ]by a great stormy wind in my fury and there shall be an over slowing shower in mine anger and great hail-stones in my fury to destroy it [Heb for destruction .]
\p
\v 14 . So will I break down wall that ye have plaistered with slight lime and will cast it down to the ground [Heb make it to come near the ground ]so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered [that is it shall be rased to the very foundation see the same phrase Psal 137.7 Mich 1.16 Habak3.13 compare 2 Sam 22.16 ] thus shall the city namely Jerusalem fall and ye [to wit the Jews ] shall perish in the midst thereof and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
\p
\v 15 . Thus will I bring forth my wrath against the wall and against them that plasters it with slight lime and I will say unto you [meaning those that believed in false prophets and expected all manner of good from their vain and flattering prophecies ]that wall is no more [that is ,it is thrown down ] neither are they plastered it [to wit alive see Genes 42.13 and Prov 12.7.]
\p
\v 16 . To wit the prophets of Israel that prophesie concerning Jerusalem that see a vision of peace for her [see above on vers 10] where there is no peace saith the Lord .
\p
\v 17 . And thou child of man set thy face against the daughters of thy people [see of this phrase above chap 6 on vers 2] which prophesie out of their own heart [that is set thy face against the women that pretending themselves to be prophetesses and diviners by meer vanities and lies made man believe that God was not angry with them as the true prophet taught moreover they scattered the people and hardened them their fins promising them Gods mercy and blessing though they continued and went on in those fins now to assure every one of it they made as some conceive arm-cushion and head-quoifs which they tendered to the person whom they deceived for some gain which the prophetesses reaped from it ] and prophesie against them [see above in this chap on vers 2.]
\p
\v 18 . And say thus saith the Lord LORD Wo to those women that sow cushion for all arm holes of the arms [some understand this not properly but figuratively of the flatteries and promises of peace and rest others understand it properly that they made and sold such things to be used by those that believe their prophecies to signifie that they should as truly have rest and peace in the land as their arms should easily lean and rest upon those cushions Heb all arm –holes of the hands to wit all those that for the aforesaid purpose should have a desire to buy and use them ]and made head-coverings [other night-quoifs of kerchief this served as a token that they should always sleep soundly and quietly ] for the head of every structure [that is of every age tallness .They suit their juggling to all sorts of men small and great ,to seduce every men to pluck every men ]to hunt souls [ and so to catch them that is to bring men into temporal and eternal destruction ,by hardening them in abominable idolatry and impenitency compare Prov 6.26 and the annotate ]will ye hunt the souls [meaning the reasonable and immortal souls ]of my people and will ye save unto your selves [or for your selves that is for your good ]the souls [that is your persons so Gen 9.5 on the words that your souls ]alive ?[that is nourish and sustain them by the unjust and unlawful gain by your false prophesies. ]
\p
\v 19 . And will ye profane me among my people [to wit in abusing my name as if I have commanded you to seduce my people by false prophesies compare Levit 18 on vers 21 ]for hand full of barley and for pieces of bread to slay the souls that should not die [that is to declare death by your prophecies to those that shall not die because they believe in me and abhor my divinations ]and to save the souls alive that should not live [that is to promise life to those that shall not live because they depart from me and adhere unto you ]by your lying to my people that hear lying ? [to wit your lying wherewith you deceive them .]
\p
\v 20 .Therefore thus saith the Lord LORD behold I will be upon your cushions [to wit to tear them in pieces and to destroy them compare above vers 8 and the annotate wherewith ye there hunt the souls to the flower gardens [Heb gardens to wit wherein they had their idols to ask of them concerning things to come and to entice them thither that were very eager and desirous after those things that they might seduce them Isa 65.5 others but they might fly away to wit being loose from your deceitful cushions ] and I will rent them off [ or pluck them off ]from your arm and I will let the souls loose [to wit out of the nets where into ye hunt them or out of the cages wherein ye hold them captive that that they may escape the destruction which ye seek to bring upon them ]the souls which ye hunt to the flower-gardens .
\p
\v 21 . Moreover I will rent your head-vails and deliver my people out of your hand [that is power and might see Genes 16 on vers 6 ]so that they shall be no more in your hand for an hunting [to wit as a prey to be hunted by you ]and ye [to wit the false prophesies of whom is spoken above vers 17 ] shall know that I am the Lord .
\p
\v 22 . Because by the falsehood ye have made the heart of the righteous sad [to wit threatening him with temporal and eternal destruction because he did not believe and follow you ] whereas I put him [ to wit the righteous or it to wit the heart of the righteous ]to no sorrow [to wit in threatening him with my judgments yea have rather comforted him with the promise of my mercy ]and because you have strengthened the hands of the wicked [that is have hardened and encouraged him in idolatry impenitency see of this phrase also Judg 9.24 and the annotate it is also taken in good sense as Judg 7.11 1 Sam 23.6 Isa 35.3 ]that he should not return from his wicked way that I might save him alive .
\p
\v 23 . Therefore ye [to wit false prophesies ] shall see no more vanity [see above vers 6 to wit because ye shall perish ]nor use divinations [or deal in divination Heb divining in divine so Deut 18 .10 2 Kings 17.17 and 21.21 see further of the word divination Prov 16 on vers 10 ]but I will deliver my people out of the hand and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
\c 14
\s Some of the eldest of the people come to the prophet as if were counsel of God ver 1 God by the prophet answereth then according to the desert of their idolatry and hypocrisie and threateneth ruine to all such enquirers and to the seducing prophets that prophesied to the enquirers according to their minds annexing a promise to the penitent vers 2 & c God sheweth that the intercessions even of the most holy men that ever were such as were Noah Daniel and Job would not be able to help Jerusalem nor any people whom he had firmly decreed to punish but that they should only deliver their own souls 12 he foretelleth that some should be left and shall also be carried to the other Jews to Babel as an example and glass of Gods justice towards them 22.
\p
\v 1 Then came unto me man of the eldest of Israel [that is rulers and the heads of congregation that dwelt in Chaldea see Exod 3 on vers 16 and Levit 4 on vers 15 ]and sate down before my face [to ask the counsel of God concerning the future condition of the people both in Jerusalem and there in Chaldea see the following third vers compare above chap 8 vers 1 and below chap 20.1. ]
\p
\v 2 . Then came the word of the Lord saying :
\p
\v 3 . Child of man these men have set up their dung –gods in their heart [that is they have given them the highest place in their mind as they were wont also without the heart set up in high places so that they esteem and honour them on highly above all others things yea even above myself so in the sequel ] and they have put the stumbling block in their iniquity here is meant their idols for when they set up these before their faces contrary to Gods commands they were an occasion unto them for sinning many ways against Gods and of falling into many abominations so in the sequel thus idols are called a snare Exod 23.33 Deut 7.16 Judg 2.3 [am I then earnestly inquired by them ? [Heb being inquired of inquired of ;that is earnestly or uprightly required of As if he should say no These tings cannot stand together that a man should adhere unto idols and yet now withstanding ask counsel of true God .Others should I be inquired of at all by them ? that is I desire not to be inquired of by such a people The Lord was ordinarily inquired of by the high Priest being clothed with the Ephod see Numb 27.21 and the annotate Judg 1 on vers 1 or by a prophet 1 Sam 23 on vers 2 and 6 and 28 .6 2Sam 2 .1 2 Chrons 11.7.]
\p
\v 4 . Therefore speak then and say unto them thus saith the Lord LORD every man [Heb man that is every man see Levit 15 on vers 2 so below vers 7] of the house of Israel [ that is Juda see above chap 6 on vers 2 meaning the Jews that dwelt in Chaldea ]that setteth up dung-gods in his heart and putteth the stumbling-block of his iniquity directly before his face and cometh to the prophet [to wit to ask counsel of God by him ]when he cometh [others in that time ] according to the multitudes of his dung-gods that is I will answer them not according to that which they would fain hear but as their great and manifold idolatry hath deserved others of or concerning the multitudes of their dung-gods that is I will answer them nothing else but that which concerneth the punishments which they have thereby deserved. ]
\p
\v 5 . That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart [that is I will so answer them as that I will bring them to light that which was hid in their heart for they will pretend themselves to be godly people when they come to ask counsel of me but I will by my answer discover the wickedness that lurketh in their hearts ] because they are all estranged from me through their dung-gods.
\p
\v 6 . Therefore say unto the house of Israel thus saith the Lord LORD repent and turn yourselves from your dung-gods and turn your face away from all your abominations [that is nor only from your idolatry and fins committed against the first table but also from all your vallanies committed against the second table of the law understand here under the word faces the heart also without whose turning away the faces the also can hardly be turned away this is contrary to te putting of a stumbling-block before ones face above vers 3.]
\p
\v 7 . For every man [Heb man as above vers 4] of the house of Israel and of the stranger [that is the proselyte that was become such having either before in Juda or afterwards in Chaldea embraced the Jews religion with the observation of their ceremonies see of such strangers Levit 17.8 and 25.35 ]that sojourneth in Israel which seperateth himself from after me and setteth up his dung-god in his heart and putteth the stumbling –block of his iniquity directly before his face [see above on vers 4] and cometh to the prophet to enquire by him of me [others to enquire of him concerning me ] I am the Lord shall be answered to him by me [that is not only by the prophet whom he enquireth but by or of myself who will answer him not so much by words as by plagues and punishment as the following words shew ]
\p
\v 8 . And I will set my face against that man [see Levit 17 on vers 10 ]and will make him a token [to wit of my just vengeance against hypocrites for I will in the punishing such deal so fearfully and strangely with them that every one shall be frightened threat as at a public token of my vengeance propounded to everyone by me for his warning compare Deut 28.46 others I will lay him waste for a token that is that he may be a token ]and for proverbs [see Deut 28 on vers 37 also Job 17 on vers 6 see also 1 Kings 9.7.8 2 Chrons 7.21 ,22 Psal 44.14 ,15 and 69.12 Jerem 24.9 Habak 2.6 ]and I will cut him off from the midst of my people [see Levit 20 on vers 3] and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
\p
\v 9 . Now when a prophet shall be persuaded [to wit by the hypocrites who ask counsel of them and desire them to prophesie some good thing unto them see of Hebrew word Judges 14 on vers 15 ] and shall have spoken something [to wit which the enquirer would fain hear but is false ] I the Lord have persuaded the prophet [to wit not by inspiring any evil into the prophet but by justly punishing the enquirers hypocrisie by the prophets lightness and covetousness that proceed from the prophet and from Satan compare 2 Sam 12.12 1Kings 12.15 and 22 .22 Jerem 4.10 with the annotate also 2 Thessa 2.11,12] and I will stretch out mine hand against him [to wit against the prophet to punish him so Exod 7.5, Isa 5.25 Jerem 15.6 below vers 13 and chap 25.7 & c ] and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel .
\p
\v 10 . And they shall bear their iniquity [the Hebrew word here signifieth the punishment which is deserved by the iniquity and offence see Levit 5 on vers 1 ]as the iniquity of the inquirer shall be so shall the iniquity of the prophet be :
\p
\v 11 . That the house of Israel may go no more astray from after me and that they may no more pollute them selves with all transgression [which are frequently called pollution in scriptures as Ezra 9 .11 below chap 24.13 and 36.17 and 39.24 1 Thessa 4.7 James 1.1 ]then shall they be a people unto me [see Levit 26 on vers 12 ] and I will be a God unto them [see Genes 17 on vers 7 ] saith the Lord.
\p
\v 12 . Moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying :
\p
\v 13 . Child of man when a land shall have sinned against me transgression grievously [Heb transgression that is committing transgression ] then will I stretch out mine hand against it and will break her staff of bread [see Levit 26 on vers 26 ] and send a famine into it to cut off men from beast from it :
\p
\v 14 . Though these three men ,Noah ,Daniel ,and Job were in the midst of it [he nameth these three person because they amongst others were accepted of him and had received great mercies from him compare Jerem 1. 15] they should deliver only their own lives from the common destruction of the land that the word only must be here inserted may be gathered from the following 16 and 18 verses ]by their righteousness [ to wit considered and valued in the mediatour Christ whose perfect righteousness taketh away the imperfection that is in the righteousness of all the godly so that it is of free grace rewarded with a blessing ]saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 15 . If I cause evil beast to pass through the lands [this plague is threatened to a sinful people Levit 26.22 above chap 5.17 and was actually sent upon them 2Kings 17.25 ]which bereave it of children so that it become desolate that no man may pass through it [ Heb without goer through] because of the beasts .
\p
\v 16 . These three man being in the midst of it as true as I live saith the Lord LORD if they should deliver sons and if they should deliver daughters [meaning that they should not deliver them as the following words shew and compare the following 18 vers ]they only should deliver themselves but the land should be desolate [here is spoken of an irrevocable sentence of God passed upon the abominable obstinacy and thankfulness of the people and that according to righteous judgments see below vers 23.]
\p
\v 17 . Or when I bring the sword [that is war see Levit 26 on vers6 ]upon that land and say sword go through the land so that I cut off men and beasts from it [God speaketh to the liveless and brute creatures as if they had life and understanding to shew his omnipotency and the dominion that he hath over all things and nothing cometh to pass in any things how great or small soever they may be by chance and all by his omnipresent providence compare Deut 4 on vers 26. ]
\p
\v 18 . Through those three men where in the midst of it as true as I live saith the Lord LORD they should not deliver sons nor daughters but they only shall be delivered by themselves .
\p
\v 19 . Or when I send the pestilence into that land and pour out my fury upon it[ see above chap 7 on vers 8 with bloud [that is by killing and slaying many men and beasts as followeth for bloud is often taken for killing slaughter murder see Genes 37 on vers 26 see of the slaughter which God made by his angel 2Sam 24.15,16]to cut off from it men and beasts :
\p
\v 20 . Through Noah ,Daniel and Job were in the midst of it as true as I live saith the Lord LORD if they should deliver a son or if they should deliver a daughter [implying that they shall not see above vers 16 ]they should deliver only their own soul by their righteousness [see above vers 14]
\p
\v 21 . For thus saith the Lord LORD how much more when I shall have sent my four evil judgments [that is punishments or plagues see Exod 6.5 and 7.5 and the annotate compare 2 Chrons 20 .12 they are called evil or wicked because they are grievous painful and very hurtful unto men see also of four forts of plagues called kindness though in part distinct from these in this vers Jerem 5.3 ]the sword and the famine and the evil beast and the pestilence against Jerusalem to cut off men and beast from it ? [the meaning is if the afore-named men being alive when I do punish a land but with one plagues should be able to save themselves alone from the punishment how much should they be able to do it for themselves alone when I shall send four plagues at once upon Jerusalem ? others how much less to wit should they be able to deliver the people when God sendeth four plagues upon them ?]
\p
\v 22 . Yet behold therein[ that is in Jerusalem ] shall be left escaped ones [Heb an escaping that is such as shall escape the destruction by the four forementioned plagues from escaping from escaping ones as 2 Kings 10.30 1 Chrons 4.43 so the remnant of the remaining ones or such as are left 2Chron 36.20 captivity for captive Numb 31.12 ]that shall be carried forth sons and daughters behold theyshall come forth [to wit out of Jerusalem and Judea be carried hither to Babel ]unto you that dwell here in Chaldean and ye shall see their way and their dealing that is their course of life and the manner of their conversation whereby ye shall be able to perceive what kind of people they are namely exceeding perverse and corrupt ]and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that shall have brought upon Jerusalem yea concerning all I shall have brought upon it [ye shall be comforted to wit not with word that ye shall hear of them but with the misery wickedness and reproach which ye shall behold for ye shall thereby perceive that God hath had very great cause punish them in the manner so that ye shall rest contented and satisfied with his judgments as followeth .]
\p
\v 23 . So they shall comfort you when ye shall see their way and their dealings and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it [or to with or against it to wit Jerusalem ]saith the Lord LORD .
\c 15
\s By similitude of the wood of the vine God foretelleth utter ruine to Jerusalem by all reason of all wickedness .
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came unto me saying:
\p
\v 2 . Child of man what is the wood of vine [to wit after it is cit down others tree ]more then all wood [that is better of more value and more profitable implying not a whit but rather slighter both for form it being crooked knotty and unshapely and for matter it being unfit to make any wooden vessel or any piece of work of it as followeth ]or the vine branch more then that which is among the wood of a forest ?
\p
\v 3 . Is wood taken thereof to make a piece of work ? doth a man take a pin [that is a wooden nail or peg ] to hang any vessel thereon ? [ Heb do they take a pin of it &c that is shall a man be able to take a fit stuff of it only to make a wooden pin or nail whereon he might hang some pieces of household stuff or working tool ?]
\p
\v 4 . Behold it is delivered to the fire to be consumed [or for a consumption or for a fuel so below vers 6] the fire consumeth both the ends thereof and the midst of it is burnt [some understand by the ends all the borders of the land that were wasted round about and by the midst Jerusalem ]would it be fit for a piece of work ?[this question implieth a strong rejection for besides that the vine wood being entire and not hurt at all is very fit to make anything of it yet it is much more unfit when it is spoiled and damnified by the fire as followeth. ]
\p
\v 5 . Behold when it was whole it was not made into any piece of work how much less where the fire hath consumed it and it is burnt shall it yet then be made into a piece of work ?
\p
\v 6 . therefore thus saith the Lord LORD like as the wood of vine [hereunto are the Jews and those of Jerusalem compare whom God had set apart for his own people that they might bring forth good fruits see Isa 5.1,2 &c Job 15.1,2 &c ]among the wood of the forest [meaning the heathen and antions thatwere unbelievers and consequently unfruitful to all good works now by these words the Jews are joined in a like judgment as followeth because by their willful thankfulness they made void the prerogative which by Gods grace they had above them ] which I deliver to the fire to be consumed so will I the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
\p
\v 7 . For I will set my face against them when they go out from one fire [to wit of miseries and plagues see Job 15 on vers 34 ] another fire shall consume them [the meaning is that they should not sooner have escaped one plague but they should fall into another as from the famine into the pestilence or into the sword or from the sword into captivity compare Isa 24 .18 and Jerem 48.43 ] and ye shall know that I am the Lord when I shall have set my face against them .
\p
\v 8 . And I will the land waste because they have grievously transgressed [Heb have transgressed transgression compare above chap 14.13 ] saith the Lord.
\c 16
\s By the similitude of a new born and miserably forsaken young daughter andsee God presenteth before the eyes of the Jews their unworthiness and his special love and kindness which he shewed them out of their meer free grace vers 1.2,3 on the contrary their vile unthankfulness and unfaithfulness manifested by all manner of idolatry and heathenish covenant 15 moreover the justice of his severe judgments upon them 35 which they being worse then their sisters Sodom and Samaria had well deserved 45 yet with a promise of gracious restoration which thy with the elect Gentiles should be partakers of the Messiah 60.
\p
\v 1 Moreover the word the Lord came unto me saying :
\p
\v 2 . Child of man make Jerusalem [that is inhabitants of Jerusalem which here in the sequel for the cause are spoken to in the singular number and in the feminine gender ]acquainted with her abomination [that is abominable committed especially by idolatry .]
\p
\v 3 . And say thus saith the Lord LORD unto Jerusalem ;thy dealings [many understand hereby the whole practice of all the people of Israel in the point of religion and the service of God where under are also to be comprehended the works concerning the conversations of life others render this word offsprings or generations originals habitations and conversations ]and thy nativities are of the land of the Canaanites [that is the beginnings and the originals of forementioned dealings are not Abraham and Sara of whom ye boast to be descended but of the idolatrous and wicked heathen whose doings ye have imitated degenerating from the faiths and the works of your father Abraham compare Job 8..39 Rom 2.28 and 9.7,8 some conceive that the Hebrew word is here put in the plural number to shew that the Israelites always followeth the drivers idolatrous religion not being contented with one ] thy father was Amorite [see of this people descent Genes 10.16 and their wickedness Genes 15.16] and thy mother an Hittite [of the Hittites descent see Genes 10.15 and their wickedness Genes 27.46. ]
\p
\v 4 . And concerning the nativities in the day when thou wast born [that is at the time that I called Abraham as an idolater Jos 24.2 when thou wast in his loins out of Uz in Chaldea to go into the land of Canaan and brought his feed into Egypt and led them through the wilderness into the land of promise compare Hos 2.3 ] thy navel was not cut [this signifieth that no bare creature was delivered or could deliver this people from their natural misery and death to bring them to everlasting salvation ]neither wast thou washed with water when I beheld thee [Heb my beholding that is as soon as I beheld thee so do some also render the words by or with my foot Genes 30.30 that is as soon as I came in others for my beholding that is for a delight of my beholding so that thou shouldest have been delightful and acceptable unto my sight others for softening to wit whereby the skin a new born child is made soft clean neat and smooth when after it is washed it is anointed with some materials useful for that purpose ] also thou wast not rubbed with salt at all [Heb being salted wast not salted salt was also used to stiffen or harden the skin and to strengthen the inward parts all this intimateth that God in the Israelites when he took them for his own people found nothing else in them but misery filth and weakness and consequently chose them not in respect of their own worthness but of this free grace in the promised Messiah ]nor swaddled in swaddling –bands [the people of Israel misery is in this and some following verses described by a similitude taken from a new-born child that being come forth out of its mother womb is regarded by no man. ]
\p
\v 5 . No eye had compression on thee [to wit not only because they would not but also because they could not Heb no cry spared or pitied thee] to do one of these things unto thee [to wit which ought necessarily to be done to a such new born babe for its preservations] to have mercy upon thee but thou wast cast out upon the plain of the field [that is forsaken by all and to be held by none but by God ] for the loathsomeness of thy soul [for the heart of man is deceitful above all things and corrupt Jerem 17.9 his understanding is enmity against God Rom 8.7 and he wholly as a maggot and a worm Job 25.6 yea lighter then vanity Psal 62.10 ]in the day when thou wast born .
\p
\v 6 . When I passed by thee then I saw thee being trodden down in thy blood [to wit which was upon thy body when thou first camest into the world this blood signifieth the corruption of our nature wherein we are all conceived and born and which maketh us liable to both temporal and eternal death ] and I said unto thee in thy blood [that is when thou wast in thy blood ] live [that is thou shalt live though thou art exceeding corrupt and miserable it is a command containing in it a promise of life of which kind of phrase see Psal 37 on vers 3 and Prov 3 on vers 25 as if the Lord should say though ye be very unclean and deformed and lie as it is were in the midst of death and I will cause you to live this is continually accomplished according to the covenant of grace which God made with Abraham ] yea I say unto thee in thy bloud live [this is here said to shew that God hath often times renewed his promises and that they remain firm and stedfast see of these promises Gen 12.1 ,2 ,3 and 13.15 ,16 and 15.1 c and 17.1,2 c and 22.17,c and 24.7 and 26.3 and 28.13 c.]
\p
\v 7 I have made thee ten thousand [that is a very great maltitude see Exod 1.7 nd 12.27 a certain number for an uncertain ]as the bird of the field and thou art grown and waxen great and thou art come to great ornament [Heb. ornament of ornaments that is to a very great or to the greatest vigour see of this phrase Lev. 2 on vers 3 understand this of a spiritual ornament and viguor the cause whereof see Deut 7.7,8 and consequently issued from the first mercy here mentioned contained in the promise of life above vers 6] thy breast are become firm and thine hair is grown but thou wast naked [Heb nakedness so below vers. 22 meaning the deprivation of original righteousness and the emptiness of the saving riches see of the spiritual nakedness also Revel 3.17. ] and bare .
\p
\v 8 . For when I passed by thee I saw thee and behold thy time was the time of loves [that is the time that thou wast marriage the Lord here speaketh after the manner of man of the spiritual marriage which he out of meer grace and love made with the people of the Jews when he separated from other nations of the earth and entered with them into a covenant of grace in the Messiah ]then I spread out my wings over thee [that is I took the into my custody to make thee my spouse compare Ruth 3 on vers 9] and covered thy nakedness [or shame ] yea I swear unto thee [see Genes 22.16 and 24.7 ]and entered with thee into a covenant [to wit of spiritual marriage that I will be your God and ye should be my people see Genes 17.1 ,2 &c ] saith the Lord and thou became mine .
\p
\v 9 . Then washed I thee with water [hereby many understand the benefit of the forgiveness of sins flowing from the covenant of grace which is often represented and expressed by washing Exod 24.8 Levit 15.13 psal 51.4 ,9 below chap 36.25 Acts 22 .16 1Cor 6.11 Revel 1.5 but understand also this and the following benefit to wit the regeneration and sanctification in respect of the children of promise and the elect among the people ] yea I rinsed thy blood off from thee [to wit the blood that was found upon thee in thy nativity ]and anointed thee with oil [ to wit to make the acceptable compare Esth 2.12 this signified the spiritual anointing with the oil of regeneration whereby to men is sanctified for a better life see of this oil and anointing 2Cor 1 .21 ,22 1 Job 2.20,27.]
\p
\v 10 . I clothed thee also with bordered work [or broidered works so below vers 18 is I have abundantly furnished thee not only in body in all that was needful for thee but have likewise so enriched and filled thee with spiritual goods and mercies that thou excellest all other nations Gen 12.2,3 Numb 24.5,6,7,17,18,19 Deut 4.6,7,8 Psal 132.13,14,15 c and by my marriage art become a queen see Psal 45.11,12,13 ,14 c see also below on vers 13 ] and I shod thee with badgers skins [see of these Exod on vers 5 ]and girded thee about with fine linen [see Genes 41 on vers 42 ] and covered the with silk.
\p
\v 11 . I adorned thee also ornament and put bracelets upon thine hands [see of these bracelets Genes 24on vers 22] and a chain [see of this word also Genes 4.42]on thy neck [Heb. throat. ]
\p
\v 12 . Likewise I put a front let [see Gen 24 on vers 22 ]upon thy face [or over thy nose or upon thy forehead see Gen 24 on vers 47 ] and ear rings [see the same word in the same signification Gen 35 .4]on thine ears and a crown of glory [or a crown of ornament that is glorious or a beautiful crown see Prov 4.9 and the annotate ]upon thine head .]
\p
\v 13 . Thus wast thou adorned with gold and silver and thy clothing was fine linen and silk and embroidered work thou didst eat fine floure and hony and oil [understand the forts of sustenance here mentioned all that is necessary for sustenance here mentioned all that is necessary for sustentations of life and recreations of the body ]and thou wast prosperous so that thou becomest a kingdom [that is so that thou hadst thine own kings that governed thee or thou hadst prosperity in the kingdom to wit for the most part under the reign of King David and Solomon the royal dignity was promised to the Israelites Gen 17.6 and 49.10 by all these similitudes taken from corporal ornaments necessaries beauty and prosperity is shadowed out of the abundance of spiritual blessings whereby God had exalted the people of Israel above other nations such as were the giving of the law the revelation of heavenly doctrine the gift of prophecy the priesthood the pure worship of God the miracles the hope of the life to come &c.]
\p
\v 14 . Moreover a name of thee went forth among the heathen because of thy beauty [see the promise hereof Gen 12.2 Deut 4.6,7,8 the accomplishment Numb 23.8,21 c Jos 2.9.1Sam 3.7 1Kings 10c.24 c 2Chrons 32.23 ]for the same was perfect through my glory which I had put upon thee [see above on vers 10and 13 ]saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 15 . But thou didst trust in thy beauty [as if though shouldst keep it forever though thou shouldst deal never so ill with me ] and playedst the harlot [ that is didst commit idolatry partly in thy idol worship and partly in your covenants with idolatrous nations see of the spiritual whoredom committed by idolatry Levit 17on vers 7 and 20 on vers 5 and of lawful confederacies forbidden by God Exod 23.32 and 34.12 Deut 7.2 and made by the Jews 2Chrons 19.2 and 20.25 c] because of thy name [that is because thou hast the name of being very beautiful and in that respect thou hast a desire to prostitute thy self for the satisfying of thy whorish condition ] yea hast poured out thy fornications on everyone that passed by for him it was [it to wit thy beauty compare Isa57.5 Jerem 2.20,23 ,36 and 3.6. ]
\p
\v 16 .. And of thy garments thou didst take and madest to thy self speckled high places [meaning altars set up in high places unto idols and hung with faire or broad speckled garments that being spied afar off they might allure the passengers of idolatry these are here compare to the beds of harlots that are beautiful and costly trimmed to entice lovers thither Prov 7.16 for which cause also these idolatrous places are called the beds of idolaters Isa 57.7 ] and playedst the harlot thereupon such a thing hath not come neither shall it come to pass [the meaning is that the Jews committed such a gross offence by their idolatry that they never had the like nor ever should have .]
\p
\v 17 . Moreover thou hast taken the vessel of thine ornament [the Hebrew word is generally taken for all the manner of vessels furniture or household staff made of gold silver &c compare Levit 15 on vers 4 ] made of my gold and of silver which I had given thee [that is which I have given thee for the necessary use and moderate ornament compare Hos 2.8 and madest [to wit of that gold and silver ]to thy self images of a man are named and not the images of a woman either because here Jerusalem is brought under the person of all harlot that keepeth company with every man portrayed most unchastely and formidably ]and thou didst commit whoredom with them [to wit by offering sacrifices unto them calling upon them and giving all religious honor and worship unto them ]
\p
\v 18 . And thou lookest thy embroidered garments and coveredst them [to wit thy images and that for to adorn them also with costly ornaments which is likewise idolatry ]and thou hast set mine oil [which I gave thee for other uses and amongst the rest for my service see Genes 28 on vers 18 Exod 27 .20 ,21 and 30.7 Levit 2.1,2 and 8on vers 2 and Judge9 on vers 9 and mine incense [of incense made of sundry spices for the service of God see Exod 30.4 ,35 ]before their face .
\p
\v 19 . And my bread which I gave thee fine flour oils honey wherewith I fed thee the same hast thou set also before their faces [to wit the faces of the images ]for a pleasant savor [compare Gen 8 on vers 21 ]thus it was said the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 20 . Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters whom thou hast born unto me [to wit which belong to me by virtue of the covenant which I made with thee and thy seed for though the people of the Jews have forsaken God and deserved to be forsaken of God yet in regard this was not yet done they begat children whom he by reason of circumcision also yet vouchsafed to own for his not desiring to punish the children for the offence of the parents so below chap 23.37 ]and hast offered them unto them [to wit unto the idols and images ] to be consumed [that is that they might devour them by the fire] is it a small thing of thy whoredoms [to wit in thine eyes or in thy judgment that thou dost commit such abominations as are mentioned in the former and following words proceeding from thy whoredom ?]
\p
\v 21 . That thou hast slain [the Hebrew word signifieth properly to throat or to cut the throat Levit 1 on vers 5 but here its taken simple for killing or slaying by causing to pass through the fire see Levit 18 on vers 21 2Kings 23 on vers 10 2Chrons 28.on vers 3 and below chap 23.37 ]my children and hast delivered them when thou didst cause them to pass through the fire for them ?[that is to the honor of the idols .]
\p
\v 22 . Also in all thine abominations and in thine whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth [see above on vers 4] when thou wast naked [see above on vers 7 and bare when thou wast trample on in thy blood [see above on vers 6. ]
\p
\v 23 . It came also to pass after all thy wickedness wow o unto the saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 24 . That thou hast built unto thee a gallery [that is an elevated place to commit thine idolatry upon it compare Levit 26 on vers 30 also Isa 57.7 c Jerem 3.6 ] and hast made thee an high place in every street .
\p
\v 25 . Thou hast build thine high at every head of the way [or in every head way or in the front of every way that is in all the cross- ways and top of the streets so below chap 21.21 compare Prov 8 on vers 2 and the annotate were the cross way is called an house of paths ] and hast made thy beauty abominable and hast straddled with thy legs [Heb fell before everyone that passed by [that is thou hast given thyself up to all manner of the vilest and most shameless idolatry that is of what nations forever thou mightest have borrowed it the Hebrew is used both of the mouth and of the legs of the mouth for opening it wide to speak immodestly and impudently Prov 13.3 of the legs for open them wide to uncleanness as here ]and thou hast multiplied thou whoredoms.
\p
\v 26 . Thou hast also committed fornication with the children of Egypt [that is the Egyptians so children of Assur for the Assyrians below vers 21 children of Babel below 23.18 ]thy neighbors [to wit by making unlawful covenants with them compare Isa 30.2 and 31 contrary to the command of God Deut 17 .16 so is the word committing fornication or playing the whore also taken below vers 28 ]which are great of flesh [that is are strong and mighty even in uncleanness compare below chap 23 .20 ]and thou hast multiplied thy whoredoms to provoke me to anger
\p
\v 27 . Behold therefore I stretched mine hand over thee [to wit to punish thee as followeth see above chap 14 on vers 9 and diminished thine appointed portions [to wit of meat and drink and ordinary sustenance see Job 23 on vers 12 ]and delivered thee unto the lust that hate thee [see the exposition of this phrase Psal 27 on vers 12 ]the daughters of the Philistines which were ashamed because of thy lewd way [Heb thy way of . ]
\p
\v 28 . Moreover thou hast played the whore with the children of Assur [see above on vers 26 see also 2Kings 16.7 and 2Chrons 28.16 ]because thou hast insatiable [to wit of playing the whore ] yea when thou hadst played the harlot with them thou wast also not satisfied .
\p
\v 29 But thou hast multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea: [Some understand this thus; that the Jews not only followed the idolatry of the Canaanites, but also of the Chaldeans: and this might have been done by those that were carried away captive to Babel with Jechonia] and therewith also thou wast not satisfied.
\p
\v 30 . How weak [or faint feeble weary]is thine heart [to wit being wearied and over -labored by that insatiable whorish lust ] saith the Lord LORD when thou doest all these things being the work of an imperious whorish woman ?[that is which is not only an whore but is so excessive wanton and willful in whoredom that she is the mistress over all. ]
\p
\v 31 . When thou buildest thine arch [see above on vers 24] at the head of every way[see above on vers 25 ] and makest thine high places in every street and hast not been as a harlot scorning an harlot reward [seeing thou desirest no reward but givest it see vers 33,34. ]
\p
\v 32 . O that adulterous woman [to wit that entiseth other man to her without desiring any reward ]she receiveth strangers [to wit lovers and fornicators that is strange and false Gods Psal 44.21 Jerem 2.25 and 3.13 ]instead of her husband [which is God himself Hos 2.19 2Cor 11.2. ]
\p
\v 33 . Men give a reward to whore [Heb they give c. To wheremongers] but thou giveth they reward [to wit, as well in getting and obtaining of strange gods, and the manner how to serve them, as for to make idolatrous covenant with the heathen] to all thy lovers, so in the sequel] and thou giveth them gifts that they may go in unto thee, [se of this phrase, Gen. 6 on verse 4.] from round about [that is, from all cities and countries] for thy whoredomes. [that is, for to commitwheredome with her]
\p
\v 34 . So the country [Heb. Turning about] happeneth thee in thy whoredomes from women, [to wit, that are unchaste and make their bodies common: for they desire to receive a whores reward, & not to give a reward] seeing none pursueth thee, or enquireth after thee to commit wherdome with thee] for not given to thee, therefore thou art become contrary.
\p
\v 35 . Therefore O harlot hear the word of the LORD:
\p
\v 36 . Thus saith the Lord LORD because thy venome is poured out [the Hebrew word rendered here venome signifieth properly copper ,copper rust ,copper green ,Spanish green,which is venomous and is here by way of similitude taken for that contagiousness which an harlot by frequent uncleanness getteth in her body .Whereby is intimated how filthy and odious idolatry is in the sight of God .According to the opinion of others ,the word pointeth at the unfatiable lust of whores .See of the Hebrew word also below chap 24.11 .Others render this word filthiness ,dersomity ,shamefulness or basness ] and thy shame is discovered through thy whoredoms with the suiters and with all dung-gods of thine abominations ;[here is related a two fold spiritual whoredom the first committed with the strange nations by unlawful covenants ,such as were the Assyrians ,Egyptians ,and Babylonians :The other word with idols by false worship or religions idols are called abominations ,because in their idolatrous service many abominations are committed ] and according to the blood of thy children which thou didst give unto them [Heb the blood that is slaughters ,murders see Gen 4 on vers 10 whereby thou hast cruelly murdered thy children in honor of thine idols see above vers 20,21 others by or about the blood of thy children c that is when thou didst murder thy children. ]
\p
\v 37 . Therefore behold I will gather all the lovers [of whom the army of the Babylonians consisteth ] with whom hast thou been mingled [to wit in the spiritual idolatry ,both of wicked covenant and of false worship .Others hast taken or committed pleasure or delight or hast been voluptuous or hast had the sweet ]and all them that thou hast loved with all them that thou hast hated :and I will gather them round about against thee and I will discover thy nakedness [or thy shame ]before them all that they shall see all thy nakedness [this signifieth vilest and basest infamy and reproach that may be done to any one before men compare 2Sam 10 .4 Isa 10.4 and 47.3 Jerem 13 on vers 22,26 Nahum 3.5.]
\p
\v 38 . Besides I will judge thee according to the judgments of adulteress [see of these laws of judgments Levit 20.10 and Deut 22.22 ] and of blood –shedders [see Gen 9.6 Exod 21.12 Matth 26.52 Revel 13.10 ]and I will deliver thee to the blood of wrath and jealousy [that is to death that shall proceed from my wrath and jealousy see of God above chap 5 on vers 13. ]
\p
\v 39 . And I will deliver thee unto their hand and they shall break down thine arch and throw down thine high places and strip thee of thy clothes and take thy beautiful jewels [Heb vessels or furniture of thy beauty or of thy glory ] and leave thee naked and bare .
\p
\v 40 . Moreover they shall cause a congregation to come up against thee and shall stone thee with stones and thrust thee through their sword .
\p
\v 41 . They shall also burn thy houses with fire [this punishment is peradventure here also mentioned in respect of the sins by adultery which by some ancient laws was so punished compare Gen 38.24 Levit 21.9 Jerem 29.2 ,23 below chap 23.45,47 see tis burning accomplished 2 Kings 25 and 2 Chron 36 and Jerem 52 ]and execute judgments against thee before the eyes of many women [that is nation .Thus the nation of the Jews is the whole transactions is set forth under the name of the adulterous woman so likewise in scripture by daughters is meant nations see above on vers 27 now here mention is made of the nations round about unto whom the Jews in their ruine became a public example of Gods vengeance yea a scorn and a derision unto many see Psal 137.7 Lament 1.8 ,21 and 2.15 ,16 below chap 25.3 and 26.2 ]and I will cause thee to cease from being a harlot and thou shalt give no harlots a reward anymore .
\p
\v 42 . So I will cause my fury to rest upon them [see above chap 5 on vers 13 ]and my jealousy shall depart from thee [to wit after that I shall have executed all my fearful judgments against thee so that I shall rest satisfied therewith without being any more angry at thy lewdness as followeth God speaketh of himself after the manner of man ]and I will be quiet and will be no more angry .
\p
\v 43 . Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth [that is thy former misery and my mercy therein towards thee see above vers 4 ]and hast been a commotion unto me [that is an anger or vexation thus this word is taken for angry commotion Gen 45.24 Prov 29.9 see the annotate ]by all these things behold therefore I will also render thy way upon thine head [see above chap 9 on vers 10 and chap 11.21 ] saith the Lord LORD thou shalt not commit that lewd act meaning the forgetfulness of her youth whereof mention is made in the beginning of this vers .others understand the murdering of her children whereof see above vers 20,21 some take the Hebrew word in a good sense and render these words thus and thou hast not made and had one thought that is not once thought on all thy abominations ]above all thine abominations [that is abominable idolatries .]
\p
\v 44 . Behold everyone that useth proverb shall use a proverb concerning thee [see of the word proverb above chap 12 on vers 22] saying as is the mother so is her daughter [that is the daughter very often follows the mothers qualities and nature.]
\p
\v 45 . Thou art thy mothers daughters [that is thou art of thy mothers nature and art like unto her in qualities and actions ]that loathes her husband and children [that is God when she forsook by idolatry and her own sons and daughters whom she murdered to the honour of the idols ]and thou art the sister of thy sisters [called Samaria and Sodom in the next vers Heb sister that is each of thy sisters so in the sequel ]which loathed their husbands and their children thy mothers was an Hittite and thy father was an Amorite [ see above on vers 3. ]
\p
\v 46 . Now thy great sister is Samaria [Samaria whereby the ten tribes are to be understood is called Jerusalem great sister because her kingdom was greater then the kingdom of Juda so Sodom in the following words is called her little sister because her kingdom was less ]she and her daughter [the words daughter indeed often times signifieth the dependent places of the greatest cities see 2 Kings 19 on vers 21 but here it may be understood of the inhabitants of these cities and countries ]which dwelleth at thy left hand [that is northward of thee for those that were at Jerusalem with their faces towards the east had Samaria on their left hand that is by north and Sodom on their right hand that is by forth ]but thy sister that is less then thee which dwelleth towards thy right hand is Sodom and her daughters .
\p
\v 47 . Yet hast thou not walked in their ways nor done after their abominations [that is their fins are not comparable to yours which are far greater and more abominable then theirs ] it was a mean thing to wit to sin no other ways then as those of Samaria and Sodom had sinned [a grief to wit that thou shouldst do no more then they had done ]but thou hast corrupted it more [ that is made it worst and lived more wickedly so is the word corrupting or making corrupt taken Deut 31.29 Judg2.19 otherwise the scripture calleth this corrupting ones way Genes 6.12 corrupting ones doing or works Zephan 3.7 ]then they in all thy ways [that is works .]
\p
\v 48 . As true as I live saith the Lord LORD if Sodom thy sister she with her daughters hath done like as thou hast done and thy daughters [an abrupt speech usual in oaths.]
\p
\v 49 . Behold this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom pride fullness of bread [understand hereby all sins that are wont to proceed from the wicked in the abundance of all their earthly enjoyments so in the words following still quietness for the evil that proceedeth thence ]and still quietness [or quiet stillness others abundant idleness ]had she and her daughters but she strengthened not the band of the poor and needy .
\p
\v 50 . And they lifted up themselves and committed abominations [see hereof Genes 13.13 and 18.20 and 19.5 ]before my face [see Genes 6 on vers 11 ]therefore I took them away [see Genes 19.24 ]after that I had seen it [to wit how abominable they lived compare Genes 18.21 and the annotate is spoken of God after the manner of men. ]
\p
\v 51 . Neither hath Samaria sinned the half of thy sins [to wit by reason of thy thankfulness whereby thou hast contemptibly rejected my bounty and loving and kindness which I best owed upon thee in afar great measure then I did upon Samaria and by reason of thy carelessness whereby thou hast slighted the judgments which I sent upon Samaria for thine example and warning ]and thou hast multiplied thine abominations more then they and hast justified the sisters by all thine abominations which thou hast done [that is declared then to be more honest then thy self because they have not sinned so abominably as thou hast done compare Jerem 13.11. ]
\p
\v 52 . Thou then also bear thy shame thou that hasty judged for thy sisters [that is hast justified them and hast pronounced them to be more honest then thy self as in the former vers Heb sister see above on vers 45 others thou hast condemn thy sisters to wit Samaria declaring that she was justly punished and forsaken by God for her backsliding others thou that hast judged thy sisters bear also thy shame for thy fins] by thy fins which thou hast made more abominable then they :they are more righteous then thou be thou then confounded also and bear thy shame because thou hast justified thy sisters [Heb sister see above on vers 45.]
\p
\v 53 . Then I shall bring again their captives [Heb captivity so in the sequel see Numb 31 on vers 12 ]namely the captives of Sodom and her daughters and the captives and the captives of Samaria and her daughters ;[the word captivity is used for all manner of plagues and judgments that come upon man see Job 42.10 and the annotate ]then will I bring again the captives of thy captivities in the midst of them [then that is never for Sodom and Samaria were utterly destroyed without any hope of being restore to their former estate so in 55 vers following understand this with exception of those whom God of grace had chosen to be an holy seed and remnant of his church of whom see below vers 60.]
\p
\v 54 . That thou maist bear thy shame and maist be confounded for all that thou hast done when thou shall comfort them [to wit Sodom and Samaria that is ease them in their plague which they have received when they shall consider that like fins they shall be rewarded with like plagues compare above chap 14 on verse 22. ]
\p
\v 55 . Which thy sisters Sodom and her daughters shall return to their former estate and also Samaria and her daughters shall also return to thy former estate .
\p
\v 56 . Yea thy sister Sodom was not heard in thy mouth [Heb was not an hearing or report in thy mouth that is thou hast fiercely made any mention on of the fearful example of my vengeance which I have poured out upon my Sodomites to the end that thou by avoiding the like fins to the mightest escape like the plagues ]in the day of thy great pride [ Heb thy prides that is when thou wast exceeding thou proud to wit when thou is thy great pride stoutness didst despise all the admonitions of my prophets and wentest on in thine abominations others thy glories and excellencies that is when thou wast in thy greatest prosperity pleasure and dignity the Hebrew word is in a bad sense taken for pride or haughtiness Levit 26 vers 19 Job 35.12 above chap 7.2 in a good sense for glory excellency dignity Exodus 15.7 Job 40.5 Psal 47.5. ]
\p
\v 57 . Before thy wickedness was discovered [to wit by my judgments that I sent upon thee otherwise of Gods people have been always discovered by the preaching and admonitions of the prophets ] when the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria [whereby thou wast reproached by the Syrians when they overrun and plundered thy country 2Kings 16.5,6 2Chrons 8.5 ,6]and of all those that were round about it [to wit the land of Syria ] the daughters of Philistines see 2Chrons 28.18 ]which despised thee [ understand the contempt and despising which immediately before was called reproach others spoiled and plundered for the Hebrew word according to the opinion of many signifieth not only despising but also spoiling or robbing ]from round about [that is on every side.]
\p
\v 58 . Thou hast born thy lewd acts ]Heb lewd act lewdness that is the punishment thereof whereby thy wickedness hath begun to be discovered ]and thine abominations saith the Lord .
\p
\v 59 . For thus saith the Lord LORD I will also unto thee according as thou hast done which hast despised the oath [to wit whereby thou hast sworn and cursed thy self if ever thy shouldst break thy covenant that I made with thee Deut 27.15 compare Nehem 10.29 and the annotate ] breaking the covenant made on mount Sinai the meaning of this word on this vers is as thou hast broken the covenant so have I now also liberty to do it .]
\p
\v 60 . Nevertheless I will remember my covenant [ see Genes 8 on verse 1 ] with thee in the days of thy youth [that is which I made with thee in the times of Abraham ,Isaac and Jacob for with these and their prosperity God had established a covenant of grace grounded on the merits of the Messiah that was to come Genes 17.2 ]and I will establish with thee an everlasting covenant [to wit depending on the former covenant of grace and being a renewing thereof and likewise standing open for all Gentiles that should believe in Christ. ]
\p
\v 61 . Then shalt thou [ namely O Jerusalem and Juda ]remember thy ways and be ashamed thou shalt receive [that is take into the fellowship of the church ]the sisters that are greater then thee with them that are smaller than thee [meaning those of the Israelites or ten tribes of the nation both great and small should believe in the Messiah and converted to the true knowledge of God ] for I will give them unto thee for daughters [to wit as born unto thee by preaching of the gospel see Gal 4.26 ] but not by the covenant of grace which also concerneth mine elect of the Gentiles .]
\p
\v 62 . For I will establish or confirm my covenant with thee [understand the covenant of grace compare Jerem 31.32 ] and thou shalt know that I am the Lord .
\p
\v 63 . That thou maist remember it and be ashamed and not open thy mouth any more [Heb maist not have open thy mouth any more that is that thou maist have no more the boldness or cause to excuse thy self of favour thy sins this phrase taken in a good sense is as much as to have the boldness and matter to utter or express something clearly and plainly see below chap 29.21 Eph 6.19 ]because of thy shame when I shall make atonement of thee [that is shall reconcile thee unto myself so 2 Chron 30.18 or shall be gracious unto thee Deut 21.8 see the annotate ]for all that thou hast done saith the Lord LORD .
\c 17
\s Under the parable of an eagle fetching the Cedar branch from Libanon and planting a new wine as also another great eagle to whom that vine bowed itself God presenteth before his people the captive carrying away of King Jochonia and others by king of Babel the ordaining of Zedikia to be king in his stead and Zedikias perjury and revolt unto the king of Egypt verse 1,2,3 for which God foretelleth that he should be forsaken of Egypt and of his own people and should be carried away captive to Babel 15 Nevertheless hepromiseth new Evangeheal Cedar-branch for the salvation of his people 22.
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came unto me saying :
\p
\v 2 . Child of man put forth a riddle [see judges 14. on verse 12 ] and use a similitude [or parable that is a relation which is throughout compared with another to give it more cleanness and strength and it may otherwise also be called an allegory so below chap 20 .49 and 24.3 Matth 13.3 ,13 Heb parable a parable ]unto the house of Israel [or concerning the house of Israel.]
\p
\v 3 . And say thus saith the Lord an eagle that was great [ meaning Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel see below verse 12 ] great of wings long of wings full of feathers [ having great power a large extended kingdom and abundance of all kind of richies ]which had divers color [the Hebrew word signifieth properly that which is made with the needle of divers colours as broidered work above chap 16.10 ,13 but here by way of comparison it is used to signifie fair speckled and mix-colour feathers as if so be they were embroidered ] came upon Libanon [meaning the land of Pelistines which northward was bordered with mount Libanon see 1 Kings 4 on vers 33] and took the uppermost branch of a Cedar [by this is signified by king Jojachin otherwise also called Jechonias 1Chron 3 on vers 16 who was Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive to Babel 2 Kings 24.12 ,2 Chrons 36.10 the Cedar was a figure of the kingdom of the Jews compare Numb 24.6 Amos 2.9.]
\p
\v 4 . He pluck off the top of his young branches [these signifieth the princes ,Lords and Nobles ,that with King Jojachin went into captive in Babel 2 Kings 24.12 ]and brought it into a land of traffic [here in the original word Chenaan which properly signifieth merchants see Job 40.25 and the annotate understand now hereby Babylon where traffic or merchandising was much used by reason of multitude of men that dwelt there and that from all countries conversed and traded there] he set in a city of merchants [namely Babel others of grocers and drugsters as 1 Kings 10.15 so might the city of Babel be called because it was full of manner of spices ,drugs and costly wares serving not only for necessity and delight but also for delicacy and excess .]
\p
\v 5 . He [ to wit the fore mentioned eagle King Nebuchadnezzar ] took also of the seed of the land [that is also that were born in the land of Juda meaning Muttania the uncle of Jechonia that is his father Jojachins brother called by Nebuchadnezzar’s Zedekia 2Kings 24 .17 ]and laid it in a seed field [that is he made Zedekia king of Juda ] he took he set it by many waters that is in a covenant place that it might grow well ]with great prudence [that is on wise and well advised conditions others as a willow tree that delighteth to grow by the waters ]
\p
\v 6 . And it [to wit that seed King Zedekia ] sprung forth and became a luxuriant wide –spreading vine the meaning is that the king prospered and was happy in his kingdom as long as he continued faithful to the King of Babel ]but low of stock [to wit as being under the power and command of the king of Babel unto whom he was constrained to pay a yearly tribute [Heb low of stature ,tallness pitch so below cha 19 .11 and 31.3 ,5 ,10 ]looking with its branches towards him [to wit of whom he had its plantation and under whose protection it lay hid ] because the roots thereof were under him so it became a vine which brought forth branches and cist forth springs .

\v 7 . There was yet a great eagle [namely Pharaoh King of Egypt see below verse 15 and 17 ]great of wings and abounding in feathers [compare above the annotate on verse 3 ]and behold this vine [that is King Zedekia ]did bend her roots towards him [to wit the eagle the king of Egypt understand by the vine roots of the ambassadors whom King Zedekia sent secretly unto the King of Egypt to make a covenant with him to the end that he might help him against the King of Babel whose tributary and vassal he was and whom he was now revolted compare below verse 15 Jerem 2.18 ]cast forth her branches towards him that he [meaning the same eagle ]might water it [to wit the fore mentioned vine King Zedekia towards the beds of plantation that is towards the entries and passages that lead to the places of her plantation the Hebrew particle rendered here towards is taken in like signification Judg 7.3,17 see the annotate .This now looketh at the custom of Egypt where when the river Nilus overflowed they made rivers trenches and furrows to let out the water throughout the whole land and to spread it abroad into all places so did likewise King Zedekia desire and request that the King of Egypt will send his forces and soldiers unto him to help him against the King of Babel others by the beds of her plantation to wit so as that his land being watered by the King of Egypt he then thereby might grow up of her plantation to wit of the vine plantation to wit in the place where it was planted to wit in Judea. ]
\p
\v 8 .It was planted [to wit by King Nebuchadnezzar] in a good soil by many waters to bring forth branches and to bear fruits that it might become a glorious vine.
\p
\v 9 . Say thus the Lord LORD shall it [ to wit the vine that was planted by the first eagle King Nebuchadnezzar ]not pluck up the roots thereof [to wit of the vine understand king Zedekia as above with all his strength and whole kingdom ]and cut off the fruit that it grow dry ?it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring and that [so is the letter V an taken for and that Jerem17.10 ]not by a great arm nor by much people to carry it away from the roots thereof [ that is without the necessity of making use of a mighty army to do it for the Lord himself will be against Zedekia for his wickedness and perjury. ]
\p
\v 10 . Yea behold shall it being planted prosper ?[this question implieth a strong negation ]shall it not utterly wither [Heb withering wither ]when the east winds toucheth it ? [This question implieth a strong affirmation understand here by the east wind the King of Babel that should destroy King Zedekia all his strength and the city of Jerusalem as the fruits are destroyed by the east winds Gen 41.6 ]on the beds of her spring [that is wherein it buddeth to growth so above verse 7 the beds of her plantation that is wherein it was planted]shall it wither [on the beds &c t wit wherein it planted that it might be well watered and might grow well or it shall wither and perish together with the furrows that is the land of Juda likewise wherein it standeth or the furrows that is the means whereby he will seek to get help from Egypt shall likewise perish.]
\p
\v 11 . Afterward the word of the Lord came unto me saying
\p
\v 12 . Say now to that rebellious house [Heb that house of rebellion understand the tribe of kingdom of Juda see above chap 2on verse 5 ] know ye not what these things [to wit which I have put forth unto you concerning two Eagles ]are?[or mean signify ,imply ] say behold [ here followeth the exposition of the propounded parable] the King of Babel is come to Jerusalem and hath taken the King thereof [namely Jojachin 2 Kings 24.12 ,2 Chrons 36.10 see above on verse 3 ]and the princes thereof [which verse 4 are compare to the uppermost tender branches of Libanon ]and hath carried them to Babel [here followeth the exposition of the propound parable .]
\p
\v 13 . Moreover he hath taken of the royal seed called above verse 5 the seed of the land namely of Juda Heb seed of kingdom he nameth Zedekia see above on verse 5 ]and made a covenant with him [see Jerem 34.18 ]and hath brought him to an oath [or made him to enter into an oath to wit whereby Zedekia cursed himself if he did not keep his word and did not continue loyal compare above chap 16 on verse 59 some conceive that this phrase to cause one to enter into an oath hath the respect into an ancient custom whereby those that made a covenant with each other flew beasts divided them into pieces and then passed between divided pieces or parts see Genes 15 on verse 17 ]and he hath taken away [to wit for pledges or hostages ]the mighty of the land [to wit which might have assisted King Zedekia both with counsel and action for to strengthen the kingdom of Juda against the king of Babel ,and cause it at length to fall of from him .]
\p
\v 14 . That the kingdom might be low not lifting itself up and that keeping his covenant [to wit the King of Babel covenant understand the promises of subjection and fealty ,which Zedekia and the Lords of the land had made unto the King of Babel ] it might stand .
\p
\v 15 . But he rebelled against him sending his messengers into Egypt that they might allow him horses and much people ;[see Jerem 37.5] shall he prosper ?shall he escape that doth such things ?yea shall he break the covenant [to wit which he hath made with king Nebuchadnezzar ]and escape?
\p
\v 16 . As true as I live saith the Lord LORD if he shall not die in place of king that made him king to wit in the places where King Nebuchadnezzar dwelleth that is Babel as is here said in the end of the verse ]whose oath he despised and whose covenant he brake by him in the midst of Babel [that is in the same place or city as was said even now consequently not in his own country the meaning is that he should certainly die there though he should not see the land because his eyes before the time should be blinded in Ribla 2Kings 25,6,7 Jerem 32.5 and34.3,5 and 52.11 .]
\p
\v 17 . Neither shall Pharoah by his great army and multitude of warlike assembly perfom anything with him in war [with him that is with Zedekia to wit to help him by joining his forces with Zedekias forces or against him that is against King Nebuchadnezzar to oppose him and to drive him away from Jerusalem ]when they shall cast up [ Heb pour out so 2Sam 20.15 2Kings 19.32 ]a mount and when they shall build forths [which the king of Babel should do] to cut off many souls [that is many men .]
\p
\v 18 . For he [namely KingZedekia despised the oath or curse breaking the covenant whereas lo he had given his hand [to wit to the King of Babel to assure him that he will strongly keep and maintain the covenant that he made with him see of such giving a hand for assuring of that which a mna saith or promiseth 2Kings 10.15 2 Chrons 30.8 Ezra 10.19 seeing he hath done all these things he shall not escape .
\p
\v 19 Therefore thus saith the Lord LORD as true as I live if I render not mine oath [God calleth the oath that Zedekia had mad unto the King of Babel his own oath because it was made with calling upon his name and in the like sense the covenant which he had made with the same king .Understand under the word oath the punishment of breaking the oath [thathe hath despised and my covenant thathe hath broken upon his head [ that is if I recompence it not with punishments see 1Kings 8.32 so above chap 9.10 and 11 verse 21 and 16.43 and below chap22.31 an abrupt kind of oath .]
\p
\v 20 . And I will sprad forth my net upon him [to wit upon King Zedekia see of this phrase above chap 12 on verse 13 and below chap 32.3 ] so that he shall be taken in my snare and I will cause him to be brought to Babel and I will plead with him there [to wit over and above the judgments which ]caused to pass upon him at Ribla 2 Kings 25.6,7 for after that he lay in prison in Babel till he died Jerem 5.11 God is said to plead with man or to enter into judgments with him when by his punishments he convinceth him of his sins and as it were disgraceth him ashamed in a court of justice so Isa 66.16 below chap 20.35 and 38.22 see futher hereof below chap 20.35 ]for his transgression whereby hehath transgressed against me .
\p
\v 21 . Moreover all his fugitive [see of these 2Kings 25.5 and Jerem 52.8 with all his hands [that is multitudes and companies of soldiers see above chap 12 on verse 14 ] shall fall by the sword [that is die or be slain in war or perish by weapons of war see Levit 26 .7]and they that remain shall be scattered into all winds [ that is into all corners of the world see above chap 5 on verse 10 ] and ye shall know that I am the Lordhave spoken it .
\p
\v 22 . Thus saith the Lord I will also take [ to wit a young sprig or twig which is here immediately called a tender branch ] of the uppermost branch [ that is of the royal stock ] of the high Cedar [ that is of the kingdom of Juda see above on verse 3 or thus of high branch of the Cedar ;or of this uppermost branch of the Cedar that was high ] which I will set [ that is which I will plant ] I will crop off from the uppermost part of his young twig a tender one [hereby is meant Zerubbabel and his successors but especially Christ of whom they were types Christ is called a branch of a sprig Isa 11 .1 and 60.21 Zach 6.12 ]upon an high and exalted mountain [meaning the true Zion that is the true Jewish and the Christian church and congregession of saints see Isa 2.2 and 1.9 and 20.40 Mich 4.1. ]
\p
\v 23 . Upon the mountains of the height of Israel [that is which shall be exceeding high understand this highest as well as the renowned and large diffusive of the kingdom of Christ as of the eminent of height and dignity of the mercies and benefits of Christ that therein shall be obtained ] will I plant itand it shall bring forth broughs and bear [Heb make ]fruit[ see of this fruit Psal 85.10 &c Isa 11.2 &c Dan 9.24 ]and it shall become a glorious Cedar [understand not an outward or earthly glory butan inward or heavenly glory of which see Psal 110.1 &c Eph 1.20 &c Philip 2.9,10 ,11 ] that under it shall dwell all fowl of all manner of wings [that is not only Israelites and Jews but also Gentiles ]in the shadow of the branches theeof shall they dwell .
\p
\v 24 . So all the trees of the fields [that is men who are also called because they ought to bring good fruits Psal 1.3 Isa 56.3 Matth 7.17 ,18,19 some understand roperly kings that among other men are eminent in highness Dan 4.17 ,19 ] shall know that I the Lord have abased the high tree [this may corporallybe understood by the Babylonians and then monarchy which was destroyedby Cyrus ;and spiritual of the devil and his kingdom which was destroyed by Christ ]have exalted the low tree [this may be also corporally understood of the Jews when they returned out of the Babylonian captivity and spiritually of all the elect and believers that were redeemed by Christ from the power of the devil ] have dried up the green trees and have made the dry tree flourishing [the former is related in other words ] I the Lord have spoken it and will do it .
\c 18
\s God sharply reproveth of the hypocritical Jews concerning the sowre grapes whereby they accuse him of injustice and cruelty verse 1,2 &c shewing how he will deal with a righteous father 5 with a wicked son of righteous father 10 with a righteous son of a wicked father 14 with a wicked man that repenteth 19 with a righteous man that falleth away 24 he desendeth his justice 25 exhorteth them to repentance 30 .
\p
\v 1 Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying :
\p
\v 2 . What ail ye that ye use this proverb [that is what reason have ye to use this proverb ?as if he should say I have given no cause for it .Of the word proverb see above chap 1 on verse 22 ] of the land of Israel [that is concerning the inhabitants of Israel see Genes 6 on verse 11] saying the fathers have eaten unripe grapes and the childrens teeth [that is our teeth ] are set on edge ? [that is the fathers have sinned and the children must suffer for it thus the Jews accused God most impudently of injustice. ]
\p
\v 3 . As true as I live saith the Lord LORD if it shall happen to you any more to use this proverb in Israel [he denieth strongly with an oath that they should ot have occasion long to use this blasphemous proverb for they should be suddenly assailed with such horrible plagues that everyone might judge yea their own conscience might bear witness that they were plagued for their own sins. ]
\p
\v 4 . Behold all souls [ that is men see Genes 12 on verse 5 ] are mine [that is belong to me to wit because I am their creator and their preserver hence God concludeth that he can wrong no man because he had done all of them good in creating them and doth them still good in preserving them but that only he punisheth those that sin and that not because he hateth his creature but because he hateth sin and is a just and righteous judge against him that commiteth it as foloweth ]as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth the same shall die [that is hall bear the punishments of thy sins to wit either in this life or in the life that shall come. ]
\p
\v 5 . Now when a man is just and doth the judgment and ustice [that is liveth according to the commandments of the first and second table either in public or private calling see Genes 18 on vers 19. ]
\p
\v 6 . Eateth not upon the mountains [to wit of that which is offered unto idols and consequently hath no fellowship with idolatry for upon the mountains as also in the groves and under the green trees they had their altars whereon theyoffered sacrificies unto idols 1King 11.7 Isa 65.7 Hosia 4.13 whereof they then also dideat in a part and feasted with their friends Deut 32.38 Judges 9.27 Psal 106.28 1Cor 8.1,4 &c ]neither lifteth up his eyes to the dung –gods of the house of Israel [to wit to give them religious honor because they commonly stand in high places so below vers 15 the contrary is to lift up ones eye unto God who is in heaven Psal 123.1 ]neither dsileth his neibhours wife [to wit by adultery se the phrase thus fully set down below chap 23.17 ]neither cometh neer to the separated woman [to wit to know see Genes 20 on verse 4 the separated woman that was to be severed or separated from the carnal copulation of her husband whenshe had monthly course uponthe pain of death see Levit 15.24 and 18 verse 19 ,20 and 20.18 and the annotate. ]
\p
\v 7 . And appreseth no man [ see Exod 22.21 Levit 19.13 and 25.14 ]restoreth to the debtor his pledges [see the law concerning this Exod 22 .26,27 Deut 24.12 ]spoileth no spoil [that is taketh not from any one that which is his either by open robbery and violence or under a pretence and color of law see the same phrase see the same phrase below chap 22 on verse 29 ]giveth his bread to the hungry and covereth the naked with clothing [see Deut 15.7 Isa 58.7 Matth 25.35. ]
\p
\v 8 . Giveth not forth upon usury neither taketh excess of gain [see of these words usury and exortion Levit 25 on verse 36 Exod 22.25 ]withdraweth his hand from iniquity excerciseth true judgment between the one and the other [Heb doth right or judgments of the truth between the men towards the man that is judgeth and dealeth rightly between the one and the other which must not only be done by those that are in public office and authority but also by every private man in his private calling. ]
\p
\v 9 . Walketh in my statutes and keepeth my judgments [compare 1 Kings 11.33 and the annotate ] to deal faithfully [Heb to do truth and faithfulness see Prov 12 on vers 22 ]the righteous man shall surely live [Heb living live that is be saved both in soul and body so below verse 17 ,19,21 ]saith the Lord LORD .
\p
\v 10 . Now if hath begotten a son that is breaker in [ see Psal 17 on verse 4 ]that sheddeth blood that doth unto his brother [that is neibhour see 2Chrons 11 on vers 4 ]one of these things to wit that are forbidden others that doth unto his brother any other thing but &c to wit of these good deeds that are mentioned immediately before .Or of the statutes and judgments of God wheeof mention is made in the former verse. ]
\p
\v 11 . And that doth not all those things [to wit that are commanded others doth none of these things ] but also eateth upon the mountains [see above on verse 6 ] and desileth his neighbours wife .
\p
\v 12 . Oppresseth the miserable and needy spoileth much spoil [Heb spoileth spoils that is doth much violence to take away much from his neighbours compare above verse 7 and below verse 18 ]restoreth not the pledge andlifteth up his eyes to the dung-gods [see above on verse 6] committeth abiminations [by abomination is very often in scriptures meant idolatry see above chap 8.6 and the annotate for which cause also idols are called abominations 2Kings 23.13 and idols abominations above chap 16.63. ]
\p
\v 13 . Giveth forth upon usury and taketh extortion should he live? he shall not live he hath done all those abiminations he shall surely be put to death [Heb he shall dying be put to death or be put to death with death to wit either here in body by means of men or hereafter in Gods judgments both in body and soul] his blood [Heb blood ] shall be upon him [that is he himself is the cause of his own death seeLevit 20 on vers 9.]
\p
\v 14 . Now lo if he hath begotten a son that seeth all his father sins that he doth and looketh to it he do not such like ;
\p
\v 15 . Eateth not upon the mountains [see above on verse 6] neither lifteth up his eyes the dung-gods of the house of Israel desileth not his neighbour’s wife .
\p
\v 16 . And oppresseth no man keepeth not the pledge [Heb pledgeth no pledge to pawn but to keep the pawn ant not to restore it as may be gathered above from the comparing the seventh verse where it is said restoreth unto the debtors his pledge ]and spoileth no spoil giveth his bread to the hungry covereth the naked with clothing .
\p
\v 17 . With holdeth his hand from the afflicted [understand the hand that doth violence and wrong that is withdraweth his hand from doing violence and wrong to poor which above verse 8 is called to withdraw ones hand from iniquity or wrong ] taketh no usury nor extortion and doeth my judgments and walketh in my statutes he shall not die for the iniquity of his father he shall surely live [Heb shall living live. ]
\p
\v 18 . His father because he oppressed his oppression [that is cruely oppressed to wit with violence or deceit see Prov 14 on vers 31 ] robbed his brother [that is his neighbour above verse 10 ]goods ,[Heb his brothers spoil ]did that which was not good in the midst of his nations lo he shall die in his iniquity .
\p
\v 19 . But ye say why? Doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father ? [ye namely the Jews that use the afore-mentioned proverb above verse 2 accusing Gods falsely that he punisheth the children for their fathers offences ye I say answer me thus why ? &c thus the prophet here preventeth that which the wicked Jews answered upon his former doctrine why? &c these are the words of the Jews as if they had said why doest thou say that to wit that the sonn doth not bear the iniquity of his father seeingthe contrary appeareth in us who are punished with war for our fathers sake ?iniquity is here taken for the punishment of iniquity so in the sequel see Levit 5 on verse 1 Heb doth not the son bear in or the iniquity &c and so in the sequel ]indeed the son that hath done judgment and righteousness and hath kept all my statutes and done them he shall surely live [this is a further reply which God giveth by his Prophet unto the Jews shewing that the godly man is not punished for the wicked mans sake but that the wicked beareth his own punishment as followeth in the next verse .]
\p
\v 20 . The soul that sinneth the same shall die [see above on verse 4] the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father [understand this of such a son as doth not follow the iniquity of his father otherwise the threatenings which we read Exod 20.5 & Deut 5.15 remain firm and stedfast ]neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteousness of the righteousness shall be upon him [that is the gracious recempence of righteousness and of good works shall be betide him concerning the word righteousness compare Genes 30.33 and the annotate likewise see Psal 24.5 and 85.14 and 112 .9 Isa 58.8 ]and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him [that is the just punishment which the wicked deserveth shall come upon him see above verse 19 on the word iniquity .]
\p
\v 21 . But when the wicked turneth from all his sins he hath committed and keepeth all my statutes and doth judgment and justice [see above on verse 5] he shall surely live [Heb living live ] he shall not die .
\p
\v 22 . All his transgression that he hath commiteth shall not be remembered [that is non of his transgression shall be remembered see of this phrase 1 Kings 11 on verse 34 ]unto hi [or against him see Psal 79 on verse 8 the meaning is that the transgression shall not move the Lord to punish him it is spoken of God after the manner of man so Isa 64.9 Jerem 14 .10 Heb 10.17 compare above chap 3 on verse 20 ]in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live [not that his righteousness deserveth its own worth or value but because of God of his free grace for his sons and is pleased for to reward it Rom 4.4.]
\p
\v 23 . should I have any delight at all [Heb delighting delight ]in the death of the wicked ?saith the Lord LORD [this question implieth a strong negation the meaning is that he no ways delighteth nor is moved by any delight to slay the wicked for through he hath decreed to punish the impenitent yet his end is not properly is not the destruction of his creature but the revelation or manifestation of his justice Rom 9.17 secondly here the speech is properly of the death of the wicked that repenteth and not for those that never repent as te precedent and subsequent words do shew as if God should say you think that I take such delight in destroying and killing and destroying as I even not spare the wicked that repeneth nor accept his repentance but that is blasphemy and is far from me] is it not [ to wit that I have pleasure and delight in this ?] when he returneth from his ways [to wit wicked ways that is wicked life which is called a wicked way 1Kings 13.33 2 Kings 17.13 Jona 3.10 &c ]that he may live ? That is may escape my judgments and be saved? this question implieth a strong affirmation that the repentance and conversion of the wicked is so pleasing unto God as that he that is converted shall surely live and that he hath no desire or delight at all to slay the wicked person that is converted compare below verse 32 and chap 33 .11 others do I not elight therein tat he should return &c Ezek 33.11 the Hebrew words are placed some what otherwise then.]
\p
\v 24 . But when the righteous man turneth away from his righteousness [see above chap 3 on verse 20] and committeth iniquity doing according to all the abominations that the wicked man doth should he live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be remembered [that is shall not move God to reward them and to free him from punishment see above chap 3 on verse 20 compare Acts 10.4 ]in his transgression whereby he hath transgressed and in his sin that he hath sinned them shall he die .
\p
\v 25 . Yet ye [ namely ye rebellious Jews ]say the way of the Lord [that is the manner of acting or the coarse that God taketh in governing of man see of the word way so used Deut 32on verse 4 and Psalms 25 .12 also compare 6.6 ] is not right [that is not sitted and squared to the rule of justice others not made straight or even weighed right implying that God kept no equality between the punishments and the sins and that he punished one man more grievously then he did another and that he pardoned one mans sins and did not pardon another mans sins &c these were horrible blasphemies ]hear now O house of Israel is not my way right ?are not your ways wrong ?[that is not as they ought to be nor rightly weighed in the balance of justice. ]
\p
\v 26 . When the righteous man turneth away from his righteousness and committeth iniquity and dieth in them [to wit his wicked ways whereof mention is made in the former verse] he shall did in his iniquity that he hath done.
\p
\v 27 . but when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committeth and doth judgment and justice he shall save his soul alive [that is he shall save himself alive to wit by faithful persevering in the way that dealeth unto life for it is the will of God that those to whom he for Christ sake graciously promiseth the crown of righteousness should come to it by the ways of righteousness Ephes 1.4 and 2.10 Tit 2.11, 12, 13, 14.]
\p
\v 28 . Because he taketh heed [that is careful that he do not continue in his sins which he is sensible of the confesseth see the like signification of the word heeding or considering 1 Kings 12.16 and above in this chapter verse 14] and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committeth that he shall surely live he shall not die.
\p
\v 29 . Yet saith the house of Israel the way of the Lord is no right equal [see above on verse 25 ]should not my ways O house of Israel be right ?are not your ways wrong ?
\p
\v 30 . Therefore I will judge you O house of Israel everyone according to his ways [of the word ways see Genes 6 on verse 12] saith the Lord LORD return and repent all your transgressions so iniquity shall not be stumbling block unto you [that is an occasion of your ruine and destruction compare above chap 7 .19 and the annotate.]
\p
\v 31 . Cast away from you all your transgression whereby you have transgressed [this commandment and that which followeth shew that we are bound to do and not we of our selves are able to do but ought to pray that we may be able to do it by his grace that commandeth it Psalms 51.12 Jeremiah 31.18 Job 15.5] and make you a new heart and a new spirit [compare Ephes 4.23 Jerem 32.39 and above chap 11.19 below chap 36.26] for why should ye die O house of Israel?
\p
\v 32 . For I have no delight in the death of him that dieth [that is I have no delight that any man should die and perish in the impenitency but that he being converted should live compare above verse 23] saith the Lord LORD therefore turn yourselves and lives [this commandment containeth itself a strong promise that they shall surely live that do so sincerely and from the heart turn unto God see Psalms 37 .3 and Proverbs 3 on verse 25.]

\s A prophetical lamentation for the wicked administration and the miserable of the Zoahaz and Zedekia Kings of Juda and also for the ruines of the land of Juda under the arable of lioness ,lion whelps and young lions also of a vine the rods thereof &c .
\p
\v 1 Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel [these are Gods words to the prophet Ezekiel understand here by the princes of Israel the kings of Juda whom the king of Babel had brought under his yoke.]
\p
\v 2 . And say what thy mother was? [meaning the house tribe or kingdom of Juda and especially Jerusalem were the kings of Juda had their court and their throne and roam which place they were defended] a lioness [that is to be compared to a lioness to wit not only for royal power and dignity which was in the tribe of Juda but also for boldness fierceness and cruelty which that tribe often times shewed in governing] lying down among lions [that is dwelling in the midst of mighty kings cruel nations or kingdom compare Nahum others how was thy mother a lioness lying down among lions ![she brought up her whelps [understand by these the young sons of kings that is in time were to come to the place of their fathers now here is spoken to the sons of King Josiah that utterly degenerated from the virtue and piety of their fathers ]in the midst of young lions [to wit which are indeed some what older and stronger then lion whelps as may be gathered from the following verse. ]
\p
\v 3 . Now she brought up one of her whelps [namely Joahaz who became king in his father stead 2Kings 23.30 ]it became a young lion the same learned to spoil the spoil [ Joahaz is here accused of greediness after prey and oppression committed against the neighbour nations to wit the Egyptian afterwards of tyranny ,violence and blood shedding committed even against his own subjects compare below verse 6 ]he did eat up men [compare Deut 7 on verse 26 and 31 on verse 17 Psalms 14 on verse 4 and 2 on verse 2. ]
\p
\v 4 . The nations [that is the Egyptian as appeared in the end of this verse ]heard this of him he was taken in their pit [they write that lions are wont to be caught in seerer pits and also with nets ]and they brought him with hooks [that is with chains that consist of many links as of so many hooks ]unto the land of Egypt [see 2 Kings 23.33,34 Jerem 2.11,12. ]
\p
\v 5 . Now she [to wit the lioness or mother of this young lion whereof is soken above vers 2 [seeing that she had been in hope but her expectation was lost [to wit of getting the captive lion Joahaz again ]then she took another for her whelps [to wit Jojakinthe brother of Joahaz given to the lioness by Pharoah and permitted by him to be in his brothers stead as is implied in the following words ]whom she made a young lion .
\p
\v 6 . This walked continually among the lions [meaning king, or nation, whose cruelty abominableness he imitated see above on vers 2 and learned to spoil the spoil [compare above verse 3 ] and did eat up men.
\p
\v 7 . He knew their widows [that is had carnal copulation with the wives of those whom who he had wrongfully murdered and cruly oppressed see of the word knowing so taken Genes 4 on verse1 oters take the word Almenoth which signifieth widows below chap 22.25 for Almenoth that I palaces 2Chrons 36.19 or desolate palaces as Isa 13 .22 see there the annotate and that this sense that Jojachin also seized upon and took good of men yea of the great one whom he had oppressed for that very end and purpose viewing them and taking notice of them ] and laid waste their cities so that the land and the fullness thereof [that is that which filleth orthat which is in it so Psal 24 .1 Isa 6.3 and below chap 32.15 .] became astonished [or waste ,and solitary ] at the voice of his roaring [that is at his tyrannical raging and oppression. ]
\p
\v 8 . Then the nations set themselves against him round about from the countries [see of these nations and countries 2 Kings 24.2] and thy spread out their net over him see above on verse 4 ]he was taken in their pit .
\p
\v 9 . And they put him in closed ward with hooks [see above on verse 4 ]that they might bring him to the king of Babel they brought him into holds [that is to Babel which was very strong and had great holds or forts Jerem 51.25,53 indeed their intention was to bring him thither but they could not perfom it because he died by the way as Jeremia had foretold Jerem 22.18 ,19 and 36.30 ]that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel .
\p
\v 10 . Thy mother [see above on verse 2 ] was like a vine in thine stillness [that is as long as the kingdom was in peace and prosperity or as others as long as thou didst remain obedient to the king of Babel others in thy blood that is at thy birth and first coming forth into theworld compare above cahp 16.6 and the annotate ]planted by the waters she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters .
\p
\v 11 . And she [to wit the vine ]had strong rods for scepters of rulers [or branches or sticks of strength &c understand by these the king and princes of the blood royal of which the kings of Juda were made ]and the stock[Heb statur and tallness as above chap 17.6 ]of every rod waxed high [to wit aslong as the blessing of God was upon that vine ]between the close branches understand by these the multitudes of the Lords ,prnces and great one of the land ]and she [to wit every king which are here called scepters of rulers ]was seen [that is famous and rowned by her hight with the multitude of her branches [meaning the whole kingdom and strength of the people of the Jews. ]
\p
\v 12 . But she was plucked up by wrath [meaning by the just wrath of God and cast down to the ground and the east wind [this signifieth here the king of Babel with all his army as above chap 17 .10] dried up her fruits her strong rods [see on the former verse ]are broken off and are withered the fire [to wit the divine vengeance ] hath consumed them .
\p
\v 13 . And now she is planted in a wilderness in a dry and thirsty land [meaning the land of Babylon which though in itself it abounded withwater and and was very fruitful yet unto the captive Jews it was like a dry and barren wilderness as the wilderness had been unto their fathers through which they traveled to the land of promise compare below chap 20 .35.]
\p
\v 14 . Moreover a fire is gone out from the rod of her branches [that is from king Zedekia who as it followeth by his rebelling against the king of Babel brought a remarkable destruction upon himself and upon all the people of the Jews 2 Kings 24.20 and 25.1 ]which hath consumed her fruit sothat there is no strong rod to be a scepter to rule [se above on verse 11 ]this is a lamentation and is become a lamentation .

\s Some of the eldest of the pople come again unto prophet to ask counsel of God verse 1 God telleth by the prophet that he wil not tbe enquird of by them but setteh before them his great fore bearance and the continual obstinate idolatry of the fore fathers in Egypt 5 in the wilderness 13in Canaan 28 yet he promiseth to gather his people again and to restore them by the gospel 33 prophsying again under the name of the south forest of the destruction of Jerusalem andJuda 46 the Prophet complaineth of his being derided by his country men 49.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in the seventh year [to wit after carrying away of Jojachin compare above chap 1 on verse 2 and 8on verse 1 ]in the fifth month [see of this moneth Numb 33 on verse 38 .] on the tenth day of the same moneth that there came man of the eldest of Israel [see above chap 8 on verse 1.] to enquire of the Lord [to wit what event the people of the jews should have of all their troubles as well in Jerusalm and Judea as there in the land of Babylon ,and what they should do to escape the judgments wherewith they are threatened .How the Lord was enquired of ,see above chap 14 on verse 3 .] and they sat down before my face .
\p
\v 2 . Then came the word of the Lord unto me saying:
\p
\v 3 . Child of man speak unto the eldest of Israel and say unto them thus saith the Lord LORD do ye come to enquire of me ? as true as I live if I be enquired of by you saith the Lord LORD ! [that is I will not be enquired of by you see ofthis kind of oath Numb 14 on verse 23 .]
\p
\v 4 . Shouldst thou give them judgment ,[Heb judge them .that is here intercede for them excuse maintain answer desend them so below chap 22.2 and 23.36 compare Genes 15 the annotate on verse 14 upon the word judging others wilt not thou judge them c that is judging punish them as followeth] shouldst thou give them judgments O child of man [he doubleth the speech to give the greater power and pmlieth that he no ways ought to intercede for them ,or to descend them compare Numb 17.12 Judg5.12,17.] acquainted them with the abominations of their fathers [to wit those which they had common with their fathers that they may perceive how deeply they are rooted in their wickedness and how long I have born with them in it.]
\p
\v 5 . Say unto them thus saith the Lord LORD in the day when I chose Israel [that is ,declared that I had chosen them out of the people and nations of the earth that they might be a holy people unto me compare Deut 4.37 and 7.6 and 14.2 and 26 .18 ]then I lifted up mine hand unto the seed [that is posterity see Genes 9 on verse9 .] of the house of Jacob [that is I promised them and bound it with an oath that I would take them for mine own people .Genes 22.16 Exod 6.7 lifting up of the hand for swearing .Itis spoken of God after the manner of men see Genes 14 on verse 22 ] and made myself known unto them into the land of Egypt [to wit by Moses and Aaron see Exod 3 and 4 c] yea I lifted up mine hand unto them saying I am the Lord your God.
\p
\v 6 . In the same day I lifted up mine hand unto them that I should bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had spied out for them flowing with milk and honey [see Exo 3 on verse 8] which is the ornament of all lands so below verse 15 and chap 26.20 .See likewise of the glory of the land of Canaan, Deut 8.7 and 32.13 Psal 126.24.]
\p
\v 7 . And I said unto them cast ye away every man the detestations of his eyes ,[so God calleth the images and all their wicked trumpery because they are loathsome in his sight and should be so in the sight of all man upon which not withstanding the Israelites did cast their eyes with great delight see 2Kings 18 on verse 32 2Chron 15 on verse 8 ]and defile not yourselves with the dung-gods of Egypt ;[which is done by setting them up for idolatry and by giving them inwardly or outwardly religious honor so below verse 30 and 31 and chap 23.7 and 36.25 iolatry is spiritual uncleanness compare Genes 35.2 and 2Chron 29.16 hence it iis also called fornication or adultery see Levit 17 on verse 7 the dung-gods of Egypt which were very abominable and ridiculous as calves ,crocodiles,apes,the bird Ibis , which they write to be a bird like a unto stock which devoureth serpents c] I the Lord am your God .
\p
\v 8 . But they were rebellious against me and would not hearken unto me no man did cast away the etestations of his eyes [Heb everyone did not reject or did not cast away the detestations of their eyes .So in the following words no man or none of them meaning the greatest part did not see 1Kings 11 on verse 34 .] neither did any forsake the dung-gods of Egypt therefore I said that I would pour out mine indignation upon them [ see Psal 79 on vers 6] to accomplish mine anger against them [see above chap 7 on verse 8 ]in the midst of the land of Egypt .
\p
\v 9 . But I did it [to wit that which I have done namely promising to deliver them out of the land of Egypt Genes 15.14 Exod 3.8 compare below verse 14 and 22 .] for my names sake [that is not because they deserve it ,or were worthy ,but because I had promised it out of meer grace and mercy and would be found true in my word compare below chap 41.22 ,44 cDan 9.19 Rom 9.27,23 Eph 1.6 ]that it should not be profaned [ see Levit 18 on verse 21 and below verse 21,24,39 and chap 39.7] before the eyes of the heathen in the midst of whom they were unto whom [namely the Israelites ] I made myself known before their eyes [to wit te eyes of the heathen and and especially of the Egyptians that had seen all Gods wonderful works Exod 14 verse 18 Numb 33.3 .] to bring tem forth out of the land of Egypt .
\p
\v 10 . And I carried them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness [which reacheth from thae red sea unto the borders of the land of Canaan.]
\p
\v 11 . Ther [to wit of mount Sinai of which see Exod 19 on verse 1 see also Levit 7.38 also chap 25.1 and the annotate ] I gave them my statutes made my judgments known unto them which a man do he shall live by them [see Levit 18 on verse 5 andDeut 6 on verse 25 Romans 10.5 Gal 3.12 .]
\p
\v 12 . Moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths [seof this Word Levit 25 on verse 2 to be a token between me and between them [that is a ceremonial representation and signification of the spiritual and eternal Sabbath so below verse 20 also Exod 20 .8and 31.13 &c 35.2 ]that they may know that I am the Lord that hallow them that is of my free grace separate them fromother men that I may be their God and they may be my people which I purifie unto myself by the blood of Messiah and sanctify them by my word and spirit see Levit 20 on verse 8 and 21on verse8 .]
\p
\v 13 . But the houseof Israel was rebellious against me in the wilderness they walked not in my statutes and rejected my judgment which if a man do he shall live in them and my Sabbaths they greatly profaned [to wit by doing therein that whichGod hath forbidden and leaving undone that which he hath commandeth] so that I said thati would pour out mine indignation upon them in the wilderness to destroy them.
\p
\v 14 . But I did for my names sake [to wit that which I did unto them according to my gracious promise see above on verse 9 others I did it to wit in punishing them oftentimes when they murmured and sinned against me in the wilderness] that the same might not be profaned before the yes of those hathen before whose eyes I brought them out [to wit out of the land of Egypt as above on verse 6.]
\p
\v 15 . Yet also I lifted up mine hand unto them [see above on verse 5 ] in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land that I had given them flowing with milk and honey [see above on verse 6] whichis the ornament of all lands .
\p
\v 16 . Because theyrejected my judgments and walked notn my statutes [or in my statutes walked not in them or and concerning my statutes walked not in them the meaning is one and the same] and profaned my Sabbaths for their heart walked after their dung-gods [compare 1 Kings 11 on verse 5.]
\p
\v 17 . But mine eye spare them that I destroyed them not neither made a full end of them [see of tis phrase Jerem 4 on verse 27 so above chap 11.13 ]in the wilderness .
\p
\v 18 . But I said unto thir children in the wilderness [that is unto the sons and daughters of those whomi had powerfully brought forth out of the land of Egypt walk not in the statutes of your father [see 1 Kings 15 onverse26 ]neither observe their judgments [tat is their way and manner of doing compare Genes 40.13 and the annotate ]neither defile yourselves with their dung-gods see above on verse 7 .]
\p
\v 19 . I am the Lord your God walk in my statutes [compare 2 Chron 6.16 and the annotate and observe my judgments and do them .
\p
\v 20 . And hallow my Sabbath [that is use them for that holly end for which I have hallowed them see Jerem 17.22 ]and theyshall b for a token between me and between you [see above on verse 12 ] that ye may know that I the Lord am your God.
\p
\v 21 . But those children were also rebellious against me they walkednot in my statutes neither heeded they my judgments to do tem which is of a man do he shall live by them thy profaned a Sabbath so that I said [or I thought saying for thinking see Genes 20 on verse 11 ]that I ould pour mine indignation upon them [see above chap 6 on vers 8 ] accomplishing mine anger against them in the wilderness [so above verse 8.]
\p
\v 22 . Yet I turned away mine hand [to wit from accomplishing mine anger upon them ]and did it for my name sake [to it that I destroyedthem not in the wilderness ]that it should not be profaned before the eyes of the heathn so above verse 9 before whose hose eyes I had bought them out .
\p
\v 23 . I lifted up ine hand unto them also in the wilderness [to wit threatening to punish them compare Psal 10.11 and the annotate ] that I would disperse them among the heathen and scatter them in the lands .
\p
\v 24 . Because they had not done my judgments but had rejected my statutes and profaned my Sabbath and andtheir eyes [understand also for their hearts and for these two follow one another Job 31.7 therefore they are also sometimes joined together Jerem 22 .17 above chap 6.3 ]wereafter thirfathers dung-gods .
\p
\v 25 . Therefore I gave them also decrees [that is determined sentences and ordinates of my just judgments containing in them the punishment which they had deserved and also were sain to suffer so is also the Hebrew word is taken Job 23.16 Psal 2.7 so in the followingword the judgment is taken for punishments which justly belong unto them for their sins ]that were not good [that is not pleasing unto them or agreeing well with them but very bad and destructive see of these punishments Numb 16 verse 23 &c and 21.6 and 25.4 &c others understand by these evil statutes the idolatrous laws of the heathen which God is said to have given to the Israelites because in his just judgment he suffered them to walk thereinto their own destruction because they forsook his holy laws compare Psal 81.12,13.] and judgments whereby they should not live [which was accomplished when they perished in te wilderness afterwards. ]
\p
\v 26 . And I polluted them in their own gifts [that is I declared shewed and testified that they were unclean that is profane abominable and displeasing unto me in the offering of their gifts which they brought unto me see of the word polluting so taken Levit 13.3 ]because they caused to pass thorow the fire this is here inserted from 31 verse following it is also left out of the text Levit 18.21 ]all that openeth the womb [Heb all opening of the womb that is every first born so Exod 13.2 &c Numb 3.12 see of this abomination of the heathen Levit 18 on verse 21 some are of opinion that the Jews also commit this abomination to the honor of the true God [that I might make them desolate [for God had threatened them if they followed the abominations of the heathen that he would make their land desolate Levit 26 verse 22 ,31,32 &c ]to the end that they might know that I am the Lord .
\p
\v 27 . Therefore child of man speak unto the house of Israel , and say unto them thus saith the Lord LORD yet herewith your fathers have reproached me that by transgression they have transgressed against me [that is have committed a special sin against me compare the phrase Levit 5.15 Numb 5.27 Jos 7.1 .]
\p
\v 28 . When I had brought them into the land for the which I have lifted up mine hand to give it to them [that is when I had brought them into the land of Canaan which I had promised into their fathers ]then thy looked toward every high hill and all close trees [that were very thick and twisted together in their boughs and leaves compare Levit 23.40 Nehem 8.16 ] and offered here their sacrifices [here is related the afore mentioned special transgression ] and gave there their provoking offerings [Hebprovocation of their offerings whereby they did irritate and provoke me to anger ]and thre they set thir pleasant savour and there they offered their drink offerings [see Psal 16 on vers 4.]
\p
\v 29 . And I said unto them what is that high place whereunto ye go ? nevertheless the name threof is called high place into this day [what the idolatrous high place were see Levit 26 on verse 30 the Lord speaking thus asked in an ironical way what it meant that they thiter to offer sacrifice for though he had continually forbidden them by his prophets to do it yet there remained still together with idolatrous worship the very name of the place among them in honor and esteem .]
\p
\v 30 . Therefore say unto the house of Israel thus saith the Lord LORD are ye become polluted [others are ye not become polluted ]in the way of your fathers [that is after or with the manner and course of life of you fathers see Prov 6 on verse6 ] and go ye a whoring after th detestations ? [se Levit 15 on verse7 and 20 on verse5 .]
\p
\v 31 . Yea by the offerings of your gifts and causing your children to pass through the fire ye are polluted in all your dung-gods unto this day and should I be enquired of by ye O house of Israel ?[others for when ye offer your gifts or hen ye cause your children to passthrough fire &c should I then be enquired of by you &c ]As true as I live saith the Lord LORD if he enquired of by ye [fill up the sense as in other oaths of God see Numb 4 on verse 23 the meaning then is as if the Lord should say I would not be enquired of by you that are such abominable idolaters. ]
\p
\v 32 . Therefore that which is come up into your spirit [that which is come into the thoughts of your hearts or that which you think or imagine with yourselves compare above chap 11 on vers 5 and see Jeem 7 on verse 31 ]shall no ways be done [Heb shall being not be or being done not be done ]that ye say we will be as the heathen and as the families of the lands serving wood and stone [so are images called Deut 4.28 and 29.17 Jerem 2 .27 and 3.9 also hewen stones Levit 26.1 gold and silver Deut 29.17 Psal 115.4. ]
\p
\v 33 . As time as I live saith the Lord LORD if with a mighty hand [that is sore and grievous plagues see Exod 3.19 and 9.3 and Job 13.21 with the annotate ] and a stretched out arm [that is violent far extending and long lasting punishments compare Jerem 21.5 and above chap 4.7 ]and with fury poured out see above chap 7 .8 I will not rule over you [that is be your Lord and King it shall not be in your liberty and power to cast me off to cast me off and to forsake me for to choose another sovereign .]
\p
\v 34 . For I will bring you from the nations [manyundestand by these those that were conveyed away to Babel with King Jojachin 2Kings 24.13 though among them may be also understood those that under zedekias reign were scattered into the country round about compare Jerem 40 .11 ,12 ] and gather you out of the lands wheein ye are scattered by strong hand and by a stretched out arm and by out.
\p
\v 35 . Moreover I will bring you into the wilderness of the nation [that is into Chaldea and the countries round about as the Jews should be as in wilderness compare above chap 9.13and the annotate] and there will I reason or plead with you [the Hebrew word rendered here reasoning or pleading signifieth properly to be judged before a judge Psal 109.7 Prov 29.9 Now there is no other supreme judge but God alone but he is said to be judged whereb his punishments he so convinceth man of his sins that even other man may judge that the sinner is justly punishedfor them see above chap 17 on verse 20 ]face to face [that is in presence discovering myself unto them by punishments the justice whereof shall shall so appear unto all as if I pleaded against you in personal presence compare Exod 33.11.]
\p
\v 36 . Like as I pleaded with your fathers in wilderness of the land of Egypt so I will plead with you saith the Lord LORD .
\p
\v 37 . And I will cause you to pass under the rod [that is separate you from the rest and appropriate you as an holy unto myself see of this phrase Lev 27.32 also Jerem33.13 ] and I will bring you[to it whom I have set apart ]under the bond of the covenant [that is to the obedience which you owe by virtue of the covenant that I made with you .
\p
\v 38 . Moreover I will purge out from you [or sweep out from you that is separate them from those whom I have chosen from my own perculiar people and are obedient to my word ]those that are rebellious and those transgress against me [to wit Israel] I will bring them forth [to wit to be carried captive to Babel out of the land of their pilgrimges [that is out of the land of Juda he speaketh of the Jews that were with Zedekia yet in Judea and he called the land whereof they boasted themselves to the true and lawful heirs the land of their pilgrimages because it was almost subdued by the king of Babel & that by their rebellion against him yea also against God himself they had lost their right and interest in it some understand by the land of their pilgrimages the country of Chaldea from whence some wicked men indeed should be brought forth but should be destroyedby God and not come into the land of Israel asfolloweth ]and they shall not come again into the country of Israel [that is into the same land to wit because they should die in the Babylonians captivity ]and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
\p
\v 39 . And ye O house of Israel thus saith the Lord LORD go you ways save ye each one his dung-gods [ a command given in a deriding way and in most bitter wrath to signifie that he forsook and rejected his obstinate people compare Judges 10.14 1 Kings 22.15 Job 18.15 and the annotate ]also here after [to wit after ye shall be carried away captive out of Judea ]because ye hearkened not unto me yet profane not my holy name [Heb the name of my holiness ]anymore with your gifts [to wit which ye give and offer unto your idols and that forsooth out of a good intention to my honor and glory as ye pretend ]and with your dung-gods .
\p
\v 40 . For upon my holy mountain[Heb in the mountain of my holiness ] understand the holy church and see above c 17on vesre22 upon the high mountains of Israel saith the Lord LORD they shall all the house of Israel in the land [or all that are in the land meaning the spiritual Israel hich is the congregation of all the elect and true believers Rom 9.6,7 and 11.26 Galat 6.6,16 ]serve me they all they will I take pleasur in them [that is in their persons that out of the free grace for the mediator sake in whom they shall believe and by whose spirit they shall sanctified and governed Eph 1.6 ]and there will I require your heave offerings and the fisrt thing of your heaving with all you hallowed things [to wit which shall be hallowed and dedicated unto me understand by the naming here of the worship of the old testament also the worship of the new compare Isa 19.19,21] Malach 1.11.]
\p
\v 41 . I will take pleasure in you because of the pleasant savour [see Genes 8 on vese21.] when I shall bring you out rom the nations and gather ye out of the lands wherein ye shall be scattered and I will be hallowed [that is be honoured and magnified for the grace and mercy hich I shall haveshewed unt you see Levit 10 on verse3 ] before the eyes of the heathen
\p
\v 42 . And ye shall know that I am the Lord when I shall have brought you into the country of Israel into the land of which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers .
\p
\v 43 There shall ye remember your ways and all your dealings [compare above chap 6.9 and the annotate] wherewith ye have defiled yourselves[ compare above chap 14 on verse 11 ] and ye shall loath yourselves [see above chap 6 on verse 9 ]for all yourevils that ye have committed .
\p
\v 44 . So ye shall know that I am the Lord when I shall have done with you for my names sake [see above on verse 9 ]not according to yourevil ways nor according to your corrupt dealings O house o Israel saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 45 . Moreover the word of theLordcame unt me saying:
\p
\v 46 . Child of man set thy face towards the way of the south [that is prepare thy self sit thy self take a take a strong resolution to prophesie against the south compare above chap 62 and below chap 21.2 some begin here the next chapter in the beginning whereof this figurative prophesie is plainly expounded .Towards the way of the south that is towards Jerusalem and Judea for this land lay southward in respect of Chaldea and Mesopotamia where Ezekiel now was compare below chap 21.2 ]and drop [see Deut 32 on verse 2 ] towards the south drop against the forest of the field in the south ;[meaning the land of Judea which was as full of man as wood as is full of trees compare the next verse. ]
\p
\v 47 . And say to the forest of the south [that is to the man that dwell in Judea see above chap 17 on verse 24 ]hear the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord LORD behold ,I will kindle a fire [that is a fore plague of a cruel war compare Job 15 on verse 34 likewise see Psal 78.63 and 83.15 ]in thee ,which shall consume every green tree in thee and every dry tree [that is both the righteous and the wicked see this significant below chap 21.3,above chap 17.14 ..The godly are said to be green and wicked dry Psal 52.10 Jerem 17.8 Luke 23.31 ] the flaming flame [ Heb the flame of flame or the flame flame that is the very mighty flame or the flame that flameth exceedingly .Meaning a very great punishment see Job 15.30 ]shall not be quenched but all faces from the south to the north [that is all men from one end of the land to the other compare below chap 21.4 shall be burnt thereby .
\p
\v 48 . And all flesh [that si every men see Genes 6 on verse 12 ]shall see that I the Lord have kindled it shall not be quenched .
\p
\v 49 . And I said ah Lord LORD they say of me [to wit mocking at my person ministry calling ] is he not an inventor of parables ? [of the word parable see above chap 7 on verse2.]
\c 21
\s God commandeth the prophet to preach very sharply against Jerusalem the temple and the whole land both high and low concerning the sword of the Lord for which the prophet must sigh and lament for a token unto the people verse1,2 he foretelleth that the king of Babel shall enter into consultation whether he shall first sit upon Jerusalem or upon the land of the Ammonites but yet that he shall first march to Jerusalem because of their perjury 24 A prophesie against the kingdom of Juda and of the coming of Christ 30 also against the Ammonites, 33.
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came unto me saying :
\p
\v 2 . Child of man set thy face against Jerusalem [see above chap 20 on verse 46 ] and drop [that is teach reprove ,exhort .See Deut 32.on verse 2 ] against the sanctuaries [meaning the temple of the Lord concerning which the Jews did so boast and brag as if it could not be destroyed Jerem. 7.4.The plural number is used ,because this temple had divers parts see Levit. 26 on verse 31 . ] and prophesie against the land of Israel [meaning the land of Juda which was apart of the land of Canaan ,which the Lord had promised unto the Israelites for their inheritance .see above chap 6 on verse 2.]
\p
\v 3 . And say to the land of Israel thus saith the Lord behold I will be upon thee ;[As if the Lord should say ,not only the Babylonians are set against thee ,but I myself am your advisery also ready for to destroy you see above chap 13 verse 8] and I will draw my sword out of his sheath [it is spoken of God after the manner of man as also Levit 26 .33 sword for the Judgment of war Levit 26.6 sometimes it seemeth to comprehend yet some other punishment as Job 19 verse 29 as war is a sea of all manner of plagues see also Psal 22 on verse 21 .][and I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.[meaning the righteous in shew but not in truth as above chap 3.20 see the annotate or the righteous in comparison of the wicked that is more unrighteous .He that is less wicked is justified by him that is more wicked ,that is ,he is counted more righteous in respect of him .see above chap .16.51,52 ..if the word righteous be taken for the truly godly man then he is punished with the wicked man because he continueth with him though the godly mandoth not perish as the wicked man doth compare Revel 18.4 .]
\p
\v 4 . Because the I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north see above chap 20 on verse 47 and 48?
\p
\v 5 . And all flesh shall know that I the Lord have drawn my sword out of his sheath t shall not return any more [ That is not to be put up in the sheath again that is not cease from destroying until it shall have executed my full vengeance ]
\p
\v 6 . But thou child of man sigh [to wit to represent the lamentation and howling that the Jews should make when they should hear the news of the Chaldeans coming ] sigh before their eyes [to wit the eyes of the people among whom thou dwellest for the prophets actions was to be a sure token unto the congregation of the judgments that should come upon the Jews in Judea and Chaldea ]with breaking the loins [ that is with the heavy stretching up of his breath out of the depth of his body and with such as a carriage and wringing of his limb as if his loins were broken ]and with bitterness [ that is, with most inward smarting grief compare 2 kings 4 on verse 27 .]
\p
\v 7 . And it shall come to pass when they shall say unto thee, wherefore sighest thou? That thou shalt say for the report for it cometh [that is , the certain news of the coming of the Chaldeans to destroy you ]and every heart shall melt [to wit for fear see Deut 1 on verse 28 and Josh. 2 on verse 11.] and all hands shall be slack [though astonishment and diquietness see 2 Sam 4 on verse 1 ] and every spirit shall shrink up [ that is, by the apprehension and feeling of its miseries be straightened, pressed and contracted .the contrary is , when the heart dilateth and spreadeth itself ,Psal 119.32 .] and all knees shall flow away [Heb. Go away that is losing their strength see above chap 7 on verse 17.] Like water behold it cometh and shall be done saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 8 . Again the word of the Lord came unto me saying:
\p
\v 9 . Child of man prophesie and say thus saith the LORD [slay the sword [understand by the sword the plagues of war see Levit. 26.6]the sword [the word is doubled to express the greatness and certainly of the thing that is related as likewise the grief and sorrow of him that maketh the relation and also to stir them up whom the relation concerneth to hearty sorrow and grief compare 2Kings 4.19 Isa. 26.5 Jerem. 4.19 and below verse28 .is sharpened [to wit to punish and destroy you] and also wiped ,[that is made clean ,neat .]
\p
\v 10 . It is sharpened that it may slay a slaughter [understand here by the slaying and murdering of the of the Jews by the sword and weapons of the Chaldeans The Hebrew word is likewise so taken Psal 37.14 Isa34.6 Jerem 25.34 otherwise it signifieth the slaughter of beasts for mans food and nourishment Genes 43.16 Prov 9.2 see the annotate ]it is wiped that it may glitter [that is that it may be apart for to terrify and slay compare Deut 32.41 Job 20.25 and the annotate ]or shall we then rejoice ? some take these to be the words of the prophet unto the Jews wherein he gives a reason why he ought to sigh as he was joined above verse 6 namely because there was no cause of gladness but sufficient cause of mourning and sighing Heb.or we shall rejoice ]it [to wit the fore mentioned sword ]is the rod [that is the scourge and punishment see Job 9 on verse 34 ]of my son [that is wherewith I chastise my son to wit my people Israel which are so called in respect of the covenant of grace see Exod 4.22 and the annotate or understand the natural and eternal son of God by whom the father executed his judgment Psal 2.7,8,9,12. These are Gods words unto the prophet] that [to wit the rod]contemneth all wood [that is so strong and tough that is can not be broken by beating against any wood be it never so hard others the tribe of my son contemneth all wood that is my people carth not for any fatherly correction therefore I will punish them with the sword others all trees that is all men which were left in Juda both high and low the princes and the common sort of people see below verse 12 .]
\p
\v 11 . And he [namely God] hath given it [to wit the sword] to be wiped that they may handle it with the hand that sword is sharpened and it is wiped to give it unto the hand of the slayer [that is of the king of Babel and his army.]
\p
\v 12 . Cry and howl O child of man and the same [to wit that sharpened and wiped sword ]shall be against my people [to wit to destroy and cut them off ] it shall be against all the princes of Israel terrors by reason of the sword shall be among my people [others they to wit the fore mentioned princes shall be thrust down into the sword with my people [ that is shall fall into the sword and perish by war ] therefore smite upon thy hip .[to wit in token of great grief see Jerem 31.19. ]
\p
\v 13 . When there was trial [to wit whereby I formally tried my people by the Chaldeans and other enemies that grievously plagued them 2Kings 23.33 and 24.1 c. 2Chron36.3c.] what was it then? [What did it avail to wit for the amendment of my people? As if he should say nothing at all] should there then also [to wit in regard the people grow daily worse and worse] be no condemn rod? [whereby they may be punished according to their deserts see of the contemning rod above verse 10 others should they then to wit my people also not be without the contemning rod ? others if it were a trial what would it be? should he nevertheless not be a contemning tribe ? ] Saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 14 . Therefore thou child of man prophesie and smite hand against hand :[ that is smite thine hand together to wit for a token of grief and sorrow for the willful perverseness of the Jews and of their terrible ruine and destruction so above chap 6.11 see the annotate .it may also be that this clapping of the hands is enjoined to he prophet to signify how that Chaldeans should incite one another on to fall upon the Jews compare the 17 verse following and below chap 22.13 .] for the sword shall be doubled the third time [that is be often used for to destroy the Jews or understand this of three great slaughters which the Chaldeans made among the Jews see of the 2 Kings 25.5,6,7 Jer52.8,9,10,11 of the second 2Kings 25.8,9,10 c.Jerem.52.12,13,14,. And the third which after the death of Gedalia was also made by the Chaldeans among the Jews that were fled into Egypt see Jerem a chapter 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46.] it is the sword of them that shall be slain [that is which shall slay and destroy many men ]it is the sword of the great man that shall be slain [that is wherewith not only mean and ordinary men but even Lords and Princes shall be slain see of the word great men so called 2 Kings 5.1 and 10.6 and the annotate ]which shall rush in unto them into their innermost chambers [that is it shall rush in unto those that shall hide in the most secret and private places that be to escape the sword compare 1Kings 20.30 and 22.25 Heb. Which shall inchamber or inchambering unto them in the innermost places?
\p
\v 15 . l have set the point [Or edge, brightness. Others render the word terrour slaughter or cry .It is only found here ] the point of the sword against then cities ,strong hold ,which in time past mainly consisteth in their gates see Genes 22 on verse 17.] That their heart may melt [that is may perish for anguish and fear and may lose all its strength so Jos2.9, 24 Job 30.22.]and the stumbling-block be multiplied :[that is the occasion of falling whereinto they shall cast and destroy themselves seeking indeed to escape dangers and save their lives but should fall out of one not another compare above chap 7.19]oh it[to wit the sword ]it is fitted that it may glitter [the Heb. For glittering that is that it may be fit to terrify and destroy the obstinate Jews compare above verse 10 and below verse28 ]it is wrapt up for a slay [that its laid by to have it ready for the slaughter others sharpened they are the words of the prophet lamenting the misery of the people. ]
\p
\v 16 . Keep close together O sword to the right hand oder thy self turn to the left hand [Heb keep close together go the right hand order thyself go to the left hand see of this phrase Psal 45.5 the Lord here speaketh unto the sword as if it were the soldier himself that was to use it see Job 14.7 he giveth it a charge to join and unite itself together with the other swords of soldiers of its hand that thy may all at once with the courage and strength fall upon the enemy whether on the right or on the left ] with so ever thy face is set [that is to what part or place of Juda so ever that commanded to go for to kill and slay spare not nor pity no man. ]
\p
\v 17 . And I my self will also smite mine hand against min had [to wit to encourage and to instigate the Chaldeans and to stir them up and to destroy and cut off the Jewish nation see above the annotate on verse 14 understand that this should so appear by the event of the business that the action of the Chaldeans agreed with the righteous will of God ]and will cause my fury to rest [that is I will wreck my spleen upon you and satisfy my wrath upon you compare above chap 5 on verse13 .] I the Lord have spoken it .
\p
\v 18 . Again the word of the Lord came unto me saying:
\p
\v 19 . Child of man set before the two ways[ to wit portraying and expressing them upon a painted table as above chap 4 on verse 1, 2 both ways coming forth out of the land of Babylon as followeth whereof the one was on the right hand to come into Judea he other on the left to come into the land of Ammonites now Nebuchadnezzar took counsel which land he should first set upon in this expedition which here signified by these two ways ] whereby the sword of the king of Babel may come they shall both come forth out of one land [to wit Babylon or out of one mans land that is out of the king of Babel land and choose one side [Heb hand see Prov 8.3and the annotate understand from whence the king of Babel should fall into the land of Juda ] choose it at the head of the way of the city [that is at the beginning of the cross-ways to wit at the way that turneth to the city of Jerusalem it is a prophesy that Nebuchadnezzar should first seek to bring the land of Juda under his subjection that he might afterwards subdue the Ammonites also]
\p
\v 20 . Thou shalt appoint a way whereby thee sword shall enter in against Rabba of the children of Ammon see 2Sam 11.1] or against Juda to defenced city of Jerusalem.
\p
\v 21 . For the king of Babel shall stand [to wit when he shall march up with an army out of his own land toward the south to do some warlike exploit in the Hebrew the time past is used stood to shew the certainty of his relation as if he had been already done ]at the parting of the ways [to wit as one that is in doubt which way he should go whether that way which leadeth to right hand or that which leadeth to the left Heb at the mother of the way meaning a place were two ways meet to cross which is divided into two ways the parting of the way is called a mother way because out of it other ways do come forth as from a mother children do come forth ]at the head [that is at the beginning the entry see above chap 16.25 the annotate ]of the two ways to use divination [Heb to divine divination that is to use divination or to deal in divination see of the word divination in Prov 16 on verse 10 the meaning is that he would use the art of his idolatrous divination to see which way he should go]he shall grind his arrows[to wit the end that when he should made use of them according to his superstitious custom they might all have him which way he should choose others render the word arrows knives which wee wiped and made clean when they had done many offerings herewith from which the heathen made their divinations ]he shall enquire of [that is ask counsel of ]the Teraphim [see Genes 31 on vese19 ] he shall look in the liver [to wit in their slain beasts now from the disposition and the quality of the liver they judged according to their idolatrous superstition what they were to do or omit. ]
\p
\v 22 . The divination shall be at right hand upon Jerusalem [that is the divination shall shew that Nebuchadnezzar was to chose the right hand to besiege Jerusalem first as followeth ]to appoint captain [that is to attempt and ordain the siege against Jerusalem The Hebrew word rendered here captains is so used 2Kings 11.4 but in the following words of this verse it signifieth battering rams as also above chap 4.2]to open the mouth in killing [that is to drive on the soldiers with a great noise and cry to the murdering and destroying of the Jews or for the opening of some gaps or hole in the wall whereby they might break into the city the following word shouting may also be rendered a brokn sound to lift up the voice with shouting [ that is with a fearful alarm to frighten the enemies and to fill all upon the city ] to appoint battering rams [see above chap4 on verse 2]against the gates to cast up strong holds and to build bulwarks [compare above chap 4.2 and 17.17.]
\p
\v 23 . Thus [that is this their propheie ]shall be unto them [to wit unto theJews] as a vain divination [Heb divination of vanity or o a lie compare below verse29 ]in their yes [that is in thir judgment see Job18.3] because thy are sworn with oaths among them [namely the Jews iththe Egyptian or all other nations roun about that had promised the Jews with an oath that they rotect themagainst the Chaldean some understand it of th oath wherby they were engaged to the king of Babel from that which followeth ]but he [namely the king of Babel illremember the iniquity [ meaning the disloyalty and perjury which king Zedekia had shewed in breaking his covenant made with Nebuchadnezzar ]they [namely the Jews that dwelt in Jerusalem andin the places thereto belonging ] maybe taken [or apprehended taken in custody that is be conqured and subdued by weapons of war and carried away captive.]
\p
\v 24 . thereforethus saith the Lord LORD because you make your iniquity to be remembered in thatyour transgressions are discovered so that your sins are seen in all your dealings [that is because ye make me the king of Babel to remember it by to willful and openly in your perjury and strengthening yourselves therein new covenant which ye have made with other nations against the king of Babel ]because remembrance is had of you ye shall be taken with the hand [to wit of Nebuchadnezzar that is by his mighty army.]
\p
\v 25 . And thou O profane wicked princes of Israel [he nameth Zedekia king of Juda ho was profane and wicked to wit by reason of his idolatry against God perjury against king Nebuchadnezzar cruelty against his own subject whose day shall come [to wit the day of thy punishment and ruine see Job8.20 and the annotate Psal37.13 likewise here below verse 29 ]at the time of the uttermost iniquity [that is whenuniquityshall become to the highst and shall be full Genes 15.16 Heb at the time of the iniquity of the end of the uttermost that is to the utmost or final iniquity or we may understand with some by iniuity as elsewhere the punishment of iniquity and of the end thatis which shall make an nd of them or which shall put an end to them so below verse 29 chap 35.5 ]
\p
\v 26 . Thus saith the Lord LORD remove that hat [to wit, from thine head see of this hat Exod 28.4]and lift off that crown this shall not be the same [that is be no more thy crown that is thou shalt be no more king ]I will exalt him that is low [meaning king Jojachin that was in Babylonian captivity of whose exaltation see 2 Kings 25.27,c.] and abase him that is high [that is Zedekia who in deed was king at the pesent but should be soon taken prisoner be made blind and carried away to Babel see 2 Kings 25.6,7]
\p
\v 27 . I will overturn, overturn, overturn, overturn that crown [to wit that crown whereof mention is made in the former verse that is I will utterly abolish overthrow and destroy it the same word is is thrice repeated to shewthe certainty of prediction and the zeal of the prophet and also to move him efficaciously whom it did concern compare Isa 7.4 and 22.9 the Hebrew word is so taken Isa 24.1.] yea it shall not be [ that is there shall be no king the tribe of Juda] until he come that hath right to it [to wit to have the crown tis is our Lord Jesus Christ who is the true son and successor of David] and to whom I will give him that [to wit right]
\p
\v 28 . And thou child of man prophesy and say thus saith the Lord LORD concerning the children of Ammos and concerning the reproach[to wit which they have done unto my people whereof see below chap 25.6 and Zephan 2.8 ]say them the swrd the sword [of the like doubling of this word see above verse 9] is drawn forth [Heb opened see Psal 37.14] it is wiped for the slaughter [to wit of you O Ammonites which have likewise revolted from King Nebuchadnezzar and thereor ye shall not escape destruction though it be Jerusalem turn first to consume [others opprehend to take hold ] to glitter [others because of the glittering that is because it is so fitted and prepared even unto glittering that with the slaughter it shall also cause great fear and terror compare above on verse 10.]
\p
\v 29 . While they [meaning the false prophets of the Ammonites]see vanity [that is prophesie of the false hood to wit concerning peaces for whiles they thus flutter you the Chaldeans shall fall upon you ]unto thee[ he speaketh unto the people of Ammonites] whiles they foretell a lie unto thee to set thee upon thennecks of them that are slain by the wicked [that is to cause you to rejoice at the Jews that are oppressed by the Chaldeans as if you were not to expect the same oppression your selves Hed upon the neck of the slain of the wicked meaning the Jews that were murdered by the chaldeans] whose day [to wit the day of those that are slain see of this day above on verse 25.] was come at the time of the uttermost iniquity.
\p
\v 30 . Cause by sword to return into his sheath [that is resist not the Chaldeans for it will not avail you others should I cause the swordto return into his sheath? Imitating no but I will c.] I will judge thee [that is punish thee with sword ofter Chaldeans see Genes 15.14] in the place were thou wast created [that is in the country were thou wast born] in the land of the habitations [others of thy dealings]
\p
\v 31 . And will pour mine indignation upon thee I will blow against thee by the fire of my wrath [compare above chap 20.47 and the annotate] and I will and I will deliver thee into the hand of the burning men [to wit burning with anger and enmity others and irrational man] forgers of destruction that is that are skilful and cunning to work destruction]
\p
\v 32 . Thou shalt be for meat to the fire [Heb thou shalt be for the ear c.that is for the fire to eat thee as the fire devoureth wood so shall the enemies devour thee] thy blood shall be in the midst of the land [to wit every where cruelly shed by the by the enemies] thou shalt not be remembered any more [to wit by men so extremely shall thou be destroyed compare below chap 25.10.] for I the Lord have spoken it.
\c 22
\s God setteth down a catalogue of the abominable sins that were rise in Jerusalem committed against the first and second table of the law verse 1, 2, 3, c. for which he in every fierce anger foretelleth them fearfully astonishment and scattering among the heathen 13 and that he will because they are become as dross melt them in Jerusalem as in a furnace by the fire of his anger 17 general wickedness of the prophets, priest,princes and people, 23.
\p
\v 1 Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying:
\p
\v 2 . Now thou child of man shouldst thus give judgment to the bloody city [that is which is full of slaughter and murder Heb. city of blood so below chap 24, 9 Nahum 3.1 see Genes 37.27] shouldst thou give a judgment? [See above chap 20.4 and below chap 23 .36.] Yea make known untoall her abominations:
\p
\v 3 . And say thus saith the Lord O city that sheddeth blood in the midst of it [that is whose inhabitants shedblood or in which men shed blood and so in the sequel that her time may come [to wit the time of the punishment and destruction their end which by their sins they draw upon themselves an is justly determined by God to come upon them see above chap 7.7, 10 with the annotate so in the sequel days and years one and the same thing is declared in divers words compare futher Mich 6.16 and above chap 12.23,24,25,27.] and maketh dung-gods [see Levit 26.30]against herself [or by herself inherself for herself ]todefil herself .
\p
\v 4 . Thu art become guilty by thy blood [this is expounded by the word adjoined so below verse13.] that thou hast shed and thou hast defiled thy self with te dung-gods which thou hast made and hast caused thy days to draw near and art come unt thy years [see on the former verse ]thereforehave I delivered thee unto the heathen for areproach and to all lands for a mocking [or appointed made thee a reproach by or for under & csee Deut 28.36 that is I will surely do it as I have already begun to do it]
\p
\v 5 . Those that are near and those that are far from thee shall mock thee thou unclean in name [that is thou hast a base ignominious name being everywhere infamous by reason of th wickedness that iscommitted in thee and full of disquietness [or abundant in stirring commotion within which there is such a continual stir to commit all manner of all horrible wickedness and enmity whereby thou everywhere gettest shame and disgrace this is declared in the sequel]
\p
\v 6 . Behold the the Princes of Israel were [or are and so in the sequel] in thee everyone according to his abilityeveryone strieveth to be foremost he that doth it not it is for want of power not for want of will see Job 2 .8.]To shed blood [that is theyare or have been bent to it they give their mind to shed blood they make it their work their whole business to commit murder and to shed innocent blood in stead that they should as they ought to have punished it]
\p
\v 7 . In thee have they [that is have they so in the sequel] set light by father and mother that is vilisied contemned them] in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger [oppressing him either by violence and cruelty or by deceit and subtitle] in thee have they oppressed [or spoiled] the fatherless and the widows.
\p
\v 8 . Thou hast despised mine holy things and thou hast profaned the Sabbaths.
\p
\v 9 . In thee were backbiters to shed blood [Heb. man of backbiting which by their running up and down and tale bearing and informing have brought their neighbour into trouble and to destruction see Levit 19.16] and in thee have they eaten upon the mountains [see above chap 18 on verse 6 that is they have been such in thee and they are such still that do this] they have committed lewdness in the midst of thee.
\p
\v 10 . In thee have man discovered their fathers shame [that is committed horrible incest see Levit 19.6.] in thee have they dilowered her [or disgraced layen with her Heb humbled her so so in the next verse] that was unclean by separation [see Levit 15 on verse 24]
\p
\v 11 . Moreover one hath committed abomination with the neighbours wife and another hath with the lewdness defiled his sons wife yet another thee hath deislowered his sister his fathers daughter [see Levit 18 .20 Jerem 5.8 Levit 18.15 Levit 18.9]
\p
\v 12 . In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood thou hast taken usury and axtortion [see of usury and extortion Levit 25.36] and thou hast practiced greediness upon thy neighbour by oppression [by extorting by him unlawful gain or condemning him by crasty and subtile device fo the Hebrew word is used of both] but thou hastforgotten me saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 13 . Behold theni hav smitten mine hand [to wit one hand against or in the other a token of distemper and abhorring of his wickedness mentioned in the following words a purpose to punish and instigating the enemy compare above chap 21.13 with the annotate there] for the greediness which thou hast practiced and for thy blood [above chap 4] which hath been [to wit greediness and murder] in the midst of thee.
\p
\v 14 Shall thine heart stand? shall thine hands be strong implying by no means but by heart and courage shall then fail thee and thine hands shall wax feeble ] in the days when I shall deal with thee ?[according to my justice and thy deserts ] I the Lord have spoken it and will do it .
\p
\v 15 . And I will scatter thee among the heathen and disperse thee in the land [compare above chap.12.14,15]and consume [[or cause to perish ]thy uncleaness out of thee [that is I will make thine inhabitants leave that uncleaness when they shall be driven out of their own country and be carried away captive compare below chap 23.27.]
\p
\v 16 . So thou shall be profaned in thy self [being used as a profane vile base contemptible city in regard of thy desolation others thou shalt give thy self for for an inheritance or be taken for an inheritance that is foreign nations shall possess thee and bear the rule over thee] before the eyes of the heathen and shalt know that I am the Lord.
\p
\v 17 . Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying:
\p
\v 18 . Child of men those of the house of Israel are to me become dross see Isa 1.22 Jerem 6.28,29,30 with the annotate Heb the house of Israel are unto me &c.] All they are copper or tin or iron or lead [whereas they should be fine gold and silver; that is upright holy and godly] in the midst of thefurnace they are become dross of the silver.
\p
\v 19 . Therefore thus saith the Lord LORD because ye all become dross therefore behold I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem [as into a furnace this is declared in the sequel compare above chap 11.7.]
\p
\v 20 . As silver or copper or iron or lead or tin is gathered [Heb according to the gathering of silver &c.] into the midst of a furnace to blow up the fire upon it to melt so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury leave you and melt there and melt you .
\p
\v 21 . Yea and I will bring ye together and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath so that you shall be melted in the midst thereof [to wit of the city of Jerusalem so in the next verse compare verse 19]
\p
\v 22 . As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof and ye shall know that I the Lord have poured my fury upon you.
\p
\v 23 . Moreover the word of he Lord came unto me saying:
\p
\v 24 . Child of man say unto her Jerusalem and the land of Juda as foloweth tou art a land that is not cleansed [from wicked man and wickedness tou art not amended by my judgments ]that hath not had her shower of rain [or that is not rained upon that is which is not cleansed by my judgments as a great shower of rainis wont to cleanse and wash away filth and dirt others which shall not be rine upon that is thou shalt be consumed and destroyed by my judgments and not be enlighted or refreshed ]in the day of wrath [that is of my judgments ]
\p
\v 25 . The conspiracy [or consideracy] of her prophets [that is Jerusalem prophets and so in the sequel ]is in the midst of her like like a roaring lion that raveneth a prey [the false prophets have combined together against the true prophets of God and those that are addicted to them to ruine them compare Jerem 20.2 and 6.8,9and 29.25,62 Lament4.13]they eat up souls [that is manner see Genes 12.5in making them bare and naked by their seducing ptophecies for whch they will be well rewarded and devoured godly mans estate as followethas false accusation and evil practices compare Mich 3.11 Matth23.14.] they take away the treasure and precious things they multiply her widows in the midst of her [bereaving them of their husbands whom by their false accusation they cause to be put t death .]
\p
\v 26 . The priest offer violence to my law [without any fear rushing in upon it after their own mind compare Zeph 3.3,4 .] and they profane mine holy things they put nodistinction between the holy and the profane neither shewthe difference between the unclean and clean moreover they hide thir eyes from Sabbath [that is they withdraw themselves from the observation of my Sabbaths as if they were altogether ignorant of mine ordinance concerning the same ]yea I am profane in the midst of them [that is I am dihonoured and accounted as nought among them as if I were not a God thus they deal with me and are the cause that oters do the like.]
\p
\v 27 . Her princes are in the midst of her like wolves that raven at a prey to shed blood and destroy souls [that smen as above verse 25] that they might practice greediness.
\p
\v 28 . Now her prophets doube herwith loose lime [see above chap 13.10 ] seeing vanity [or falsehood falsly pretending that God had revealed this and that thing unto them by vision see above chap 13.6 and foretelling a lie unto them saying thus saith the Lord LORD and the Lord hath not spoken.
\p
\v 29 The people of the land practice more oppression and commit mere robbery [Heb oppression or with oppression robrobbery that is the whole land is full of deceit and violence ]also they oppress [or vex plunders rob ] the miserable the needy and they oppress the sranger without right [or wrongfully against all reason without measure or so as that no right is done to him to wit by magistrate Heb by or in with not judgment c.]
\p
\v 30 Now I sought a man out of them [that is among them] that might wall up the wall [see above c. 13 .5 with the annotate] and stand in the gap before my face for the land that I might not destroy it but I found none.
\p
\v 31 Therefore I poured out my indignation upon them; I have consumed them by the fire of my wrath their way have I rendered upon their head [se above chap 9.10 ]saith the Lord LORD.
\c 23
\s Under the names of the two women, Ohola and Oholiba God describeth at large the whoredoms and adulterous of Samaria and Jerusalem or Israel and Juda verse1,2c. Also 36 for which cause this unsatiable were to be sentenced and dealt with according to the ustice therein required 22c.also verse 45,c.]
\p
\v 1 Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying:
\p
\v 2 . Child of man there were two women the daughters of one mother [meaning Juda and the ten tribes both descendeth from Israel Jerem 3,8,7.10 and above chap 16.44,45 .]
\p
\v 3 . These commited whoredom that is commited idolatry see Levit 7.7 and above chap 20.8 and below verse8.19c.] in Egypt they commited whoredomin their youth [wheni shall first took them for mine own people see Jerem 2.2 Hos 2.2 with the annotate] there were their breast pressed and there were the teats of their viginity felt [or handled Heb they handled or felt that they did it it as done their idolatrous practices are thus shadowed so below verse 8 c. others spoled and bruised.
\p
\v 4 . Now their names [meaning figurative or borrowed names] were Ohala [that is their tent or terbanacle so God calleth the ten tribes and Samaria (their chief city, Isaiah 7.9. as followeth) because they had separated themselves from Juda, the temple and the true worship of God, and had set up a worship of their devising. See 1 Kings 12.16, 28, 29. c.] in greatest, [so are the ten tribes called by reason of their power and respect] and Oholiba [that is, my Tent (is) in, or among them. So God called Jerusalem and Juda, because his Temple and worship were there, which he had ordained himself] her sister: and they became mine, or had married them, and had made a matrimonial covenant with them. See above chapter 16.8,22. for God giveth them these names from that which happened during the time of the marriage, while that lasted] and sons and daughters: these were their names; [Meaning proper, and no fihurative names] Samaria is Ohola and Jerusalemoholiba.
\p
\v 5 . Now Ohola played the harlot, being under me [That is, though she was my married wife, and, was under my subjection, yet she proved unfaithful unto me, and kept company with others, instead of me; as the Hebrew word may be also rendred, but not without such filling up of the sense] and she doted on her suiters, [the heathenish nations, with whom sha entred into covenant, and embraced their idols. See verse 7, 30, c.] on the Assyrians [Heb. Assur] that were near: [see 2 Kings 15.19 and Isaiah 7.8, 17, 18. Hos. 8.9, 10, c.]
\p
\v 6 . Clothed with skie-colour, princes and Rulers, all of thm desirable young men: [Heb. Young men of desire, or wish; that is, desirable, wished for, and consequently pleasant, gracious young men. So verse 12, 13.] horsemen riding upon horses.
\p
\v 7 . Thus she committed her whoredome with them, [Heb. Properly she gave, or delivered her whoredomes to them, that is, she behaved herself as a bold impudent strumpet] which were all the choise of the children of Assur: [That is, Assyrians. See above chapter. 16.26. so verse 23 and children of Babel, verse 15,23] and with all on whom she doted, with all their dung-gods she defiled herself. [or, the words being a little transported, thus: and she defiled herself with all their dung-gods, and with all on she doted.
\p
\v 8 . Neither left sha her (whoredomes brought) from Egypt: [as above verse 3. this may be specially understood of the idolatry of the golden caves, first set up in the wilderness, and after at Dan and Bethel; and the covenants made Egypt. See 2 Kings 17.4.] for they had layen with her in her youth, and had felt the tears of her virginity; [as above verse 3.] and they had poured out their whoredome upon her.
\p
\v 9 . Therefore I delivered her unto the hand of her sisters, into the hand of the children of Assur, [see 2 Kings chap. 17 and 18.] upon whom she doted.[And yet afterwards fell off from them, 2 Kings 17.4.]
\p
\v 10 . These discovered her shame, [she above chap.16.37.] and they took away her sons and her daughters, but they slew her with a sword: [that is, they slew the most principal of the people with the sword. Compare below verse 25.] and she got a name women, [that is, she became famous, as a special example and spectacle of God’s righteous judgement among all nations, as followeth] after they had exercised judgements upon her. [That is, had punished her for her disloyalty committed against God, and her consederates]
\p
\v 11 . When her sister Oholiba [Jerusalem and Juda, above verse 4] saw (this), then she corrupted her love yet them she, [she did worse then Ohola, that is, thenthe tribes, not taking warning by her example. Compare this with Jeremiah 3.8, 9, 10, 11. And above chap. 16.47, 51.] And her whoredoms more then the whoredoms of her sister.
\p
\v 12 . She doted upon the children of Assur, [see above chap. 18.28.] the princes and rulers that were near, [as above verse 5.] clothed with perfect ornament [Heb. With perfection; to wit, of ornament] horsemen riding upon horses: all of them desirable young men. [As above verse 6]
\p
\v 13 . Then I saw that she was defiled; they had both one manner of way. [Juda took the same course that Israel had done. See Genes. 6 on verse 12. and below verse 31.]
\p
\v 14 . Yea sha added yet unto her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed [Heb. Men of pourtaied, or pictured, printed, engraven things. See above chap. 8.10.] upon the wall, [to wit, in her own country; as the outlandish pictures, especially of proud nations, are wont to be every where carried about and pourtraied to satisfie the curiousity & pride of many men] the images of the Chaldeans pictured with vermilion, [see Jer. 22. on verse 14.]
\p
\v 15 . Girded with a girdle upon their loins, having abundantly died (hats) [or (hats) died abundantly; or, much hanging down, waving up and down] upon their heads, which were all of them captains to look to (after) the likeness of the children of Babel of Chaldea the land their nativity. [from whence they were carried into Juda, or at least pourtraied or pictured after the habit that was worn in Babel]
\p
\v 16 . Then she grew enamoured them [as immodest women are inflamed with and upon strange gay pictures, s was Judea enamoured with the pictures of the Chaldeans. See a beginning and spake of this, 2 Kings 20.12,13, c. above 16.29.] with the looking on of her eyes: [that is, as soon as she lookt upon them with her eyes, she was inflamed with an heathenish carnal idolatrous love towards thm] and she sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.
\p
\v 17 . Now the children of Babel came to her in the bed of love, [That is, to lie with her; that is, to make a covenant with her] and defiled her with their whoredom: she also defiled her self with them after that her soul was drawn away from them [or turned away, separated herself, went away from them (the nature of the unchat woman) so verse 18.22, 28. she enstrangled her self from the Chaldeans, and departed from them, lusting after Egypt, verse 21.]
\p
\v 18 . Thus she hath discovered whoredome, and discovered her shame: then my soul was drawn off from her, as my soul was drawn off from her sister. [Israel, or the ten tribes, called above Ohola]
\p
\v 19 . Yet sh multiplied her whoredoms, remembering the dates of her youth, when [Or wherein, or how] she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt, [as above verse 3]
\p
\v 20 . And she grew enanoured more then their concubins, [that is, th concubines of the Egyptians: the behavd her self much more immediately and more foolishly then other nations did that of time had been united with Egypt. Some understand here the Babylonians and Chaldeans] whose flesh is (as) the flesh asses, [to wit, the Egyptians flesh was such. (see above chapter 16.26.) who were exceeding bnt and inclined to corporal and spiritual whoredome] and whse issue is (like) th issue of horses. [or stone horses]
\p
\v 21 . Thus thou hast fetcht up again [Heb. Visited: which word in our languageis sometimes also used in the same signification when speake of visiting, trying, examining this or that thing again ]the lewd fact of thy youth :when those of those of Egypt felt thy teats ,because of the paps of thy youth .
\p
\v 22 . Therefore O Oholiba ,thus saith the Lord LORD behold ,I will raise up thy suiters [see above chap .16.37.]against thee ,from whom thy soul is drawn off :[meaning from the Chaldeans as above verse 17.]and I will bring them against thee from round about;
\p
\v 23 . The children of Babel and all the Chaldeans ,Pekod,and Son,and Koa ,[these are names of lands or countries belonging to Babel and whose inhabitants were like wise used in the army of Babylonians against Judea and Jerusalem compare further Jerem 50.21 with the annotate some conceive them to be names of princes and captains of war ]and all the children of Assur with them desirable young men which are all princes and rulers captains and renowned which all ride horse back .
\p
\v 24 . they shall come against thee with carts [or charets ,fighting charet ,and following words riding wagons ]wagons nd wheels and with an assembly of nations bucklers and shields and helmets [In the Hebrew these words are all used in the singular number ,cart,wagon ,wheels,bucklers,shields ,helmetsaccording to the the use of thr language ]they shall set themselves round about against thee [that is besieged thee] and I will set judgement before their faces [that is I will lay the law open before them ,which they shll use against thee, I will use them an executioners of my udgements upon thee I will so order and govern them that they shall give thee thy deserved reward ]and they shall jdge thee according to thir judgements [or way manner custome so as they are wont to punish rebels,perjured persons ,and adulteresses see thereof the sequel .]
\p
\v 25 . And I will set my jealousie [my utmost nd just vengeance for thy disloyalty committed against me ] against thee ,that they shall deal in fury with thee;they shall take off thy nose ;and thine ears [or take away c that is cut them off ;as the Egyptians were wont to do unto adulteresses :whereby is further meant all manner of cruelty that the enemies should shew to her ]and the last of thee [that is the last of thee that rememeth ,thy remnant]shall fall by the sword [others thy last shall be that thou shalt fall by the sword that isthy end or at last thou shalt c so in the sequel ]they shall take away thy sons and thy daughter and the last of thee shall be consumed by the fire .
\p
\v 26 . They shall also strip thee thy clothes and shall take away thy ornament instruments .
\p
\v 27 . Thus I will make thy lewdness to cease from thee [compare above chap 22.15.] together with thy whoredom brought from the land of Egyprt and thou shalt lift up thine eyes unto them [to wit the Egyptians ]nor remember Egypt anymore .
\p
\v 28 . For thus saith the Lord LORD behold I will deliver thee into the land of them whom thou hatest into into the hand of them from whom thy soul is drawn off.
\p
\v 29 . they shall deal ith thee out the hatred ,and take away all thy labour [that is all thou hast gotten by ty labour all thy estate ]and leave thee naked and bare ,that thy harlotry may be discovered together with thy lewdness and whoredom .
\p
\v 30 . These things shall be done unto thee [or will I do unto thee or shall they do unto thee because the Hebrew word here as elsehere is put without limitation of person ] because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen ,and necause thou hast defild thy self beore thir dung -gods .
\p
\v 31 . thou hast walked in the way of thy sister :[as above verse 13.] therefore will I give her a cup into thine Hand [To wit, the cup of my wrath whereof she hath drunken. That is, I will punish thee with like punishment because thou hast committed like sins. See Psalms 11 on verse 6 and Job 21 on verse 20. Jeremiah 25.15, c.]
\p
\v 32 . Thus saith the Lord LORD, thou shalt drink thy sister’s cup which is deep and large: thou shalt become a laughing stock and a mocking; [as those that have drunk themselves drunk are wont be] (the cup) containeth much. [Heb. is much in containing, or to contain; that is, much drink may go into it, as we use to say.
\p
\v 33 . Thou shalt be fall of drunkenness and misery: [the word misery or sorrow serveth for exposition: as if God should say, thou shalt be drunken and fall, but it shall be with sorrow and misery] the cup of thy sister Samaria is a cup of desolation and of solitariness [others, of or with the cup, c (which), c.]
\p
\v 34 . Thou shalt drink it, and suck (it) out, and thou shall break the sherds thereof to shivers, [As drunken men in their ager and madness break the drinking vessels in pieces, so shalt thou find thy self exceedingly vexed at my judgements] and thou shalt pluck of thine (own) breasts: [with which thou hast exercised spiritual whoredom. That is, thou shalt loath thy self because of thy sins, by feeling of the fear-full punishments that shall come upon thee for the same] for I have spoketh, saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 35 . Therefore thus saith the Lord LORD, because thou hast forgotten me and cast me behind thy back [see 1 King 14 on verse 9] therefore thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms. [That is, the punishment thereof. So below verse 49.]
\p
\v 36 . And the LORD saith unto me, child of man, shouldeth give judgement [see above chap. 20 on verse 4 and 22.2] to Ohola and to Oholiba? [see above verse 4.] yea shew them their abominations.
\p
\v 37 . For they have committed adultery, and there is blood in their hands, [Especially the blood of their own children. See above chap. 16.36 and below verse 45.] and they have committed adultery with their dung-Gods: moreover they have caused their children whom they had born unto me, [as being Abraham’s seed, and in covenant with me, likewise born whiles my marriage with them yet lasted. See above chap. 16 on verse 20.] To pass before them (through the fire) [see above chap. 6.20,21,36,45 with the Annotat. Likewise chap. 20.31 for meat, [to wit, of the fire; that is, to be consumed by the fire. Compare above chap. 16.20 and 21.32. with the Annotat.]
\p
\v 38 . Yet thy have done this uniform: [Or against me] they have defiled my sanctuary [others my sanctuaries: that is, the temple wherein was the holy place and the holy of holies] in the same day and prophaned my Sabbaths.
\p
\v 39 . For when they had slain to their dung-gods, [Or throated the, cut (their) throats, to, to the honour of their idols. See above chap. 16.20,35. With the Annotat. Also Isa. 57.5.] then they came the same day into my sanctuary [as if (forsooth) they were willing to tender ye some service and honour unto me. Compare 2 Kings 21.4,5. Jeremiah 7.9,10 and 11.15 and above chap. 8.3,6 and below chap. 43.8] to prophane it: and lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house. [see 2 Kings 21.4,c]
\p
\v 40 . This is also (to be added) they sent unto me to come from far: [to make unlawful covenants with heathenish nations, for the alluring and entertaining, of whom God relateth in the words of the following, that they used the likes tricks, devices and practices as cunning base thumpers are wont to do. Compare Proverbs 7.16,17, c. unto whom when a messenger was sent, lo then they came from whom thou didst wast thy self, paintedth thine eyes, and adornedth thy self with ornaments.
\p
\v 41 . And thou satest upon a glorious bed, before which a table was prepared, and mine oil. [Which I had given thee, wherewith I as thy lawful husband had adowed and adorned thee, and which thou oughtest to have used to mine and glory. Compare Hos. 2.8,9 and above chapter 16.16,17,18,19.]
\p
\v 42 . Now when the noise of the multitude was quiet upon it. [to wit, upon the aforesaid bed, that is, when these sisters had dispatched their covenant-affairrs with those great outlandish Lords, then (they sent) to wit, Ohola and Oholiba sent. This is here inserted to fill up the sense from verse 40] unto men of multitude of men, [that is, of the common people or of the meaner fort of them] (and) there were wine-ibers brought from the wilderness: [or drunkards, drunken men, c. others, Sabeans, c. because the Hebrew word was signifie both because there is likewise mention made in the wilderness so hereby may be understood all the rubble of vile and base nations, such as were the Sabeans (of whom see Job 1 verse 15) Arabians, Moors, c. (being also given to drinking and swilling) towards whom these adulterous sisters did likewise carry themselves lie vile base strumpers. Others, and in them (namely Juda and Israel was a voice of a merry company, (that is, there were heard mirth and joy (as is usual in flaws and brothelhouses) for the heathenish covenants, and with the multitude, or because of the multitude of men (that is, of the common fort of people) were brought Sabean, c.] they put arm-rings [or arm-wels, bracelets] upon their hands, [to wit, upon the hands of the harlots] and a beautiful crown [Heb. C own of ornament] upon their heads.
\p
\v 43 . And I said [that is, I thought; spoken of God after the manner of men, to express the unbridled wickedness of the people whereof in the sequel] of this that was grown old (in) adulteries: [or worn out, &c. this may be applied unto Ohola, as whose whoredome began even under the reign of Joroboam, after the death of Solomon: or of Oholib, who continued longest in her own country or of both together. O here, and I told this old one of (he) adulteries, that is, I reproved her for them by my prophets, but it was to no purpose, as followeth] now will they whore the wheredome of this (whore) and that (also) [or and (also) of the other. It will begin again. Or others, it will once cease with them both. Now, c. as if the Lord should have said, now it seemeth that notwithstanding her old age, her wheredome will begin again anew. Others, now will they whore out the wheredoms of this (whore) and she (also) herself. That is, now will they surely once grow weary and cease as well those that come abroad to commit fornication with these harlots, as these harlots themselves: but no, the contrary hath appeared. Others (in that) they commit wheredome sometimes with this and sometimes with that (harlot). These words because of their brevity are diversly rendered]
\p
\v 44 . And they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that is an harlot: so they went in unto Ohola and unto Oholiba, those lewd women. [Heb. women of lewdness]
\p
\v 45 . Righteous man, thy sall judge [or,condemn] them [this may be generally taken, as if the Lord should have said; all honest righteous man shall be made to condemn these harlots. Or it may be applied to the Assyrians and Babylonians, who are called righteous, because they were the executioners of God’s Justice Israel and Juda and had just cause for it, by reason of their perjury and rebellion. See the next verse] (according to) the judgement of adulteresses, and according to the judgement of blood shredders: [see above chap. 16 on verse 28] for they are adulteresses, and is in their hand. [As above ver. 37.]
\p
\v 46 . For thus saith the Lord LORD, I will [or one shall, they shall, as above chap. 16.40.] cause an assembly to come up against them, and will give them up for a commotion, and for a prey.
\p
\v 47 . And the assembly shall stone them with stones, and cut them down with their swords: they shall stay their sons and their daughter, and their houses with fire.
\p
\v 48 . Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land: that all women may be instructed not to do after your lewdness.
\p
\v 49 . Thus shall they lay your lewdness upon you, [that is, upon your head, recompensing and punishing you according to your deserts] and ye shall hear bear the sins of your dung-gods: [that is, the punishments of your sins committed with your dung-gods, as above verse 35.] and ye shall know that I am the Lord LORD.

\s The year, day moneth of the Babylonians coming before Jerusalem, verse 1,2. By the parable of a hot seething pot with pieces of flesh and bones, is pourtrayed the fearful extremity that should fall Jerusalem because of her wickedness, 3 which calamity should be so great, as that they should not mourn even for the destruction of the temple, (which they held in so great estimation) which the prophet is commended to represent his own perform, as being forbidden to mourn for his own wife, whose death God foretelleth him, 15,16, c.
\p
\v 1 Moreover, the word of the LORD came unto me in the ninth year, [after the captive away of King Jojachin, described 2 Kings 24.12,13,14,16. (Compare above chapter 1.2 and below chapter 33.21 and 40.1.) In whose stead Nebuchadnezzar made Zedekia King: and in the ninth year of this King Zedekia in the tenth moneth & on the tenth day of the moneth, Jerusalem was besieged. See 2 Kings 25.1. Jeremiah 39.1. and 52.4.] In the tenth moneth, [in the ecclesiastical year called Tebeth, in the political or civil year Thamuz] on the tenth (day) of the month:
\p
\v 2 . Children of man, write thee down the name of the day, [In remembrance, that it may be compared with the even, whereof see 2 King 25.1. Jeremiah 52.4. This was about two years before the talking and destruction of Jerusalem, whereof here is prophesied] even of this same day, [Heb. The strength, or the bone of the day, that is, the being of the day, and (as we use to say) even, or just the same day. See above chapter 2.3. with the Annotat.] the King of Babel layeth himself before Jerusalem, [or is come near, hath fitted, composed himself, c. the Hebrew word is frequently used for leaning, staying, underpropping, also of laying on of hands; all which is done with some conjuction, approaching, or drawing near: and in matter of siege we use to say to lie down, or to lay ones self down before a citie, c] even on this same day.
\p
\v 3 . And use a parable [Heb. As if we would say, parable a parable. See above chapter 17. on verse 2.] into the rebellious house, and say unto them, thus saith the Lord LORD. Set on a pot, [signifying the besieged city of Jerusalem, as verse 6. see Jeremiah 1.13 and above chapter 11.3 with Annotat.] set (it (on) and also poure water into it.
\p
\v 4 . Put the pieces thereof into it, [thereof, namely of the pot; that is such pieces of flesh as ought to be in the pot.] These pieces of flesh signified the inhabitants, especially the rich citizens and great one of Jerusalem, as followeth] all good pieces, [Heb. all, or every good, or best piece] the thigh, [or loins, hip, hinder part] and the shoulder: fill (it) with the choice of bones. [That is, the choicest bones, as marrow-bones]
\p
\v 5 . Take the choice of the flock, [That is, the choice choicest, or goats, take the best of the small cattel for the purpose] and kindle also a burning pile of bones under it: [or a fire of bones, c. (compare below verse 9 and Isaiah 30.33) signifying the grievous and continuing , miseries of the people, which they should shutter in the siege by the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and also afterward; as a fire made of bones is very hot and bones are hard and durable or lasting. Some apply it to the casting away of the dead bodies and bones that should lie unburied in the open field, as God had often threatened them; so that there should be bones enough to be had to make a fire of them: by which judgments they nevertheless should not be amended or converted, as followeth] make it, [the pot] boil well; [Heb. Boil his boilings] also of it [of the pot, as verse 4.] shall be boiled [or sodden] therein. [Heb. In the midst thereof, namely of the pot]
\p
\v 6 . Therefore thus saith the Lord LORD; who to the bloody city, [As above chapter 22.2. and below verse 9.] to the pot whose seum [Others rust, as below verse 11. where there is also another word that signifieth rust] is therein and from whom the seum thereof is not gone out, [the word (rendred seum) that is used in this place, and also below version 11,12. seemeth to signific the seum, that not being boiled off, or sodden away, flicketh fast at the side of the pot, and becometh a more tough filth or slime. The Lord doth intimate hereby that the inhabitants of Jerusalem by all that seething and boiling were notwithstanding not cleansed not cleansed, that is, converted, but continued still obstinately in their wickedness] put piece by piece out of it; let not the lot fall upon it. [what piece so ever thou shouldst have to pull out of the pot, either first, or last, or none at all, they must all pack away, some be slain, others sent away out of the land. Heb. By, or according to the pieces thereof, according to the pieces thereof bring it out: the lot is not fallen upon it. This signifieth the flaying and casting away of many and carrying away of the rest into captivity to Babel, without either pity or distinction of person. See above chapter 11.7.]
\p
\v 7 . For her [To wit, Jerusalem’s typified by the pot] blood is in the midst of her; she laid it upon a smooth rock, [Heb. Smoothness, brightness, or top sticking out of a rock, where as in the fight of God she shed the blood of her to the honour of idols and let it lie open to provoke God to anger, as followeth. Compare the phrase with below chapter 25.4,14.] she poured it not out upon the ground to cover it with dust: [this hath respect to the law, Leviticus 17.13. Deuteronomy 12.16, 24.]
\p
\v 8 . That I may cause wrath to arise to exercise vengeance, [Heb. to avenge vengeance. That is, that I might exceedingly manifest my wrath and vengeance against such abominations] I have (also) laid her blood upon a smooth rock, that it should not be covered. [Implying that he will also punish her publickly, that the tokens thereof shall be seen before the eyes of all men]
\p
\v 9 . Therefore thus saith the Lord LORD, wo to the bloody city; [As above verse 6.] I will also make the burning pile great. [Compare above verse 5. that is, I will kindle a great fire under Jerusalem (this pot) as followeth]
\p
\v 10 . Heap on much wood, [Heb. multiply wood, or, sticks. Here, and the following words is a lively representation of the fire, consume the flesh. [Or, dress it, make it ready, boil it thorowly, let it be well and fully sod] and strow (it) well wit spices, [Heb. Spice the spice: that the enemies (as some conceive) may have an appetite and mind to it] and let the bones be burnt. [Or, burn to (stick to)]
\p
\v 11 . Then set it [the pots] empty upon the coles thereof, that it may be hot, and the rust thereof may be burned, and the uncleanness of it may melt away, [Or , may flow away, may be poured off] (and) the seum thereof may be consumed. [That is, Jerusalem, shall not onely be deprived of inhabitants, but the city also shall be burnt, that the place may be wholly purged of that abominable uncleanness]
\p
\v 12 . She hath wearied (me with) vanities, heatheneth covenants, intestine oppression, lying, hypocrisic, and all manner of wicked devices, whereby the would under prop her ruinous condition, and keep ofteth eatened destruction, in stead of repenting and turning unto me, whereunto I exhorted them by my prophets with such patience and forbearance, and admonished them so faithfully and frequently with fore threatnings, that I am even grown weary of it, they being (in the least) not bettered, but still grown more obstinate and hardened thereby, as in the sequel is set forth. The Hebrew word is onely found here, coming, according to the opinion of most interpreters, from a word that signifieth vanity, injustice, lying, wickedness, vice, and also idolatry. Others, she hath wearied (her self with) vanities] yet is not her abundant seum gone forth onto so her; her seum (must be) in the fire.
\p
\v 13 . In thy uncleanness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, therefore thou shalt not be purged from thy uncleanness any more, till I shall have caused my wrath to rest upon thee. [See above chapter 5 on verse 13. That is, because I have fought to purge thee by the exhortations, admonitions, and threatnings of my prophets, but all hath been in vain, and fruitless, therefore I will now take another course with thee]
\p
\v 14 . I thee LORD have spoken it, it shall come to pass, and I will do it: I will not depart from it, neither will I spare, nor repent: according to thy wans, and according to thy dealings shall they judge thee, saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 15 . Moreover, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:
\p
\v 16 . Child of man, behold, I will take away from thee the pleasure [Or, with] of thine eyes [That is, thy wife. See verse 18. Whereby the Temple and city of Jerusalem was typified] by a plague: [that is, sudden death extraordinarily sent her by God] yet shall thou not morn, nor weep, neither shall thy tears come forth.
\p
\v 17 . Cease from lamenting, [that is, lament not, but hold thy peace] thou shalt make no mourning for the dead, [that is, show no tokens of mourning, as in those times they were wont to do for their deceased friends] bind thine hat upon thee, [or, set thy quoif, cap, bonnet, upon thine head, as below verse 23. The Hebrew word rendred here hat hath its name from adorning offering: on the contrary, mourners were wont to go bare-headed, and to strow ashes or dust upon their heads, Levi. 10.6 and 21.10. 1 Samuel 15.32. Isaiah 61.3. Lamentation 2.10.] and put on thy shoes upon thy feet: [whereas mourners were wont to go unshoed, or bare-foot, 2 Samuel 15.30.] neith shalt thou wrap up uppermost lip, [Gr. Cover, wrap up the mustacho, as those were wont to do, that mourned for a great mishap, or mischance. See Levit. 13. 45. Mich. 37. some understand not onely the uppermost lip, also the mouth and the chin, with the whole place of the beard] neither shalt (thou) eat the bread of men. [meaning mourning food, feast or banquet with thy friends and neighbours. See Jeremiah 16 on verse 7.]
\p
\v 18 . This I spake unto the people in the morning and at even my wife died: and I did in the morning like as I was commanded.
\p
\v 19 . And the people said unto me, wilt thou not tell us what these things (are) to us, that thou doest (thus)? [That is, what they signifie to us, what thou wilt give us to understand by this strange kind of action. The word (are) is here added, according to the nature of the Hebrew language, as elsewhere often. So below chapter 35.19.]
\p
\v 20 . And I said unto them; the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:
\p
\v 21 . Say unto the house of Israel; thus saith the Lord, LORD, behold, I will profane my sanctuary, [the temple; that is, deliver it unto the hands of the chaldeans, to be destroyed as a common profane place] the glory of your strength, [Or, highness, Excellency of your strength. That is, that glorious building of the Temple, whereupon ye so greatly rely, supporting that I will spare Jerusalem because of it. Some understand Jerusalem or the kingdom] the d fire of your eyes, [understand the very same Temple, in the beholding whereof they were wont to take pleasure and delight, and for which they now so greatly longed. Some understand their wives, from verse 16.] And the pitying of your soul; [Which temple ye so love, that it would grieve you to the very heart, if it should be laid waste. Some understand here their children, and neareth friend, whom they when they went into captivity with Jojachin, had left behind at Jerusalem] and your sons, and your daughters, whom ye left behind shall fall by the sword.
\p
\v 22 . Then shall you do like as I have done: [ye shall not then be able to show any tokens of mourning by reason of the curse of God and your astonishment at the dreadful common calamities and desolations that shall light upon the temple, city, countrey, and all the people. Compare herewith especially Jeremiah 16.4,5,6,7,8. with the Annotat. There] ye shall not wrap up your uppermost lip, neither shall ye eat the bread of them.
\p
\v 23 . And your hats shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet; ye shall not mourn, nor weep; but ye shall consume [or, pine away, melt away, because of Gods curse that lies upon you, as below chapter 33.10.] in your iniquities and sigh [or, bowl, roar, through impatiency and want of comfort] every own towards his brother.
\p
\v 24 . Thus Ezekiel shall be unto you a wonder-token; [see above chapter 12. verse 6.] according to all that he hath done, shall ye do: when this cometh, then shall ye known that I am the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 25 . And thou child of man, shall it not be, [That is, it shall certainly so come to pals] in the day when I shall take away from their strength, [The Temple, &c. as above verse 21. that is, at such time as Jerusalem shall be taken, and the city with the miserably dealt with according to these prophecies] the joy of their ornament, [that is in whose ornament hey rejoyed] the desire of their eyes and the longing of heir souls, [Heb. The lifting of their souls; that is, hat which they heartily long for: as a man lifts up himself and reaches high for a thing that he would sain have or come at. [see Psalms 24. on verse 4.] their sons and their daughters; [god foretelleth these things for the greater confirmation of these prophecies. See the accomplishment thereof below chapter 33.21, 22.]
\p
\v 26 . This in the same day one that is escaped shall come unto thee, to cause (thine) ears to bear (it)? [That is, one that is got away and hath escaped the destruction and by my providence is come to thee, to bring thee the news, tidings]
\p
\v 27 . In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him that is escaped and thou shalt speak and be no more dumb: [compare below chapter 33.22 and above chapter3.26. with annotate.] thus shalt thou be a wonder-token unto them and shall know that I am LORD. [As if God should say; thou hath now sufficiently foretold my people of the miseries that are at hand: be now silent for a while, till all tings be clearly fulfilled and plain before their eyes; then shalt thou speak again to their comfort and instruction, that thou mayeth thus be unto them and to my whole church in sundry waies a wonderful token of great things to come.]

\s Prophecies against the Ammonites and the Moabites, because of their rejoicing at the destruction of the temple, and the misery of God’s people, verse 1,2, c. 8,9, c. against the Edomites and the Philistines because of their desire of revenge and cruelty against the people of God, 12, c. 15, c.
\p
\v 1 . And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying:
\p
\v 2 . Child of man, set thy face against the children of Ammon: [see of this phrase, setting the face against, &c. above chapter 6 on verse 2 and and prophecies against them, [see Jeremiah 49.1 c. and above chapter 21.28, c. the Ammonites, Edomites and Philistines were all of them enemies unto God’s people: Ammon and Moab in the east beyond Jordan, Edom in the south, and the Philistines in the west along the midland-sea.]
\p
\v 3 . And say unto the children of Ammon; hear the word of the Lord LORD: thus saith Lord LORD, because thou sadist Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned, [As above chapter 24.21.] and against the land of Israel, which was laid waste and against the house of Juda, when they went into captivity; [Tha is, didst take delight therein and didn’t shout thereat. See Job 39.28. Psalms 35.21. With the Annotat. So below chapter 26. 2.]
\p
\v 4 . Therefore behold, I will deliver thee to them of the east [Heb. The children of the east] for a possession, that they ay set their cattles [Or, towers, palaces, flately buildings, magnificent houses] in thee and make their dwelling in thee: they shall eat their fruits and they shall drink thy milk. [By these men of the east some understand the Chaldeans of Babylonians: but because the scripture continually saith, that the Chaldeans should come from the north, therefore others understand it of the eastern nations, that bordered on the eastern side of Ammon, as the Arabians, that lived in tents; Kedarens, & c. having great store of camels and cattle and given to seek out for good pasture and in scripture commonly reckoned among those of the east, these (to wit, as many as many of them were left, or spared by Nebuchadnezzar) should take and possess the land of the Ammonites, (being destroyed by the Chaldeans, and the inhabitants thereof carried away captive) to accommodate their cattle withal, see Genesis 29.1. Judges 6.3 and 8.11. Job 1.3. Isaiah 60.6,7. Jermiah 49.28,29,30,32. With Annotat.]
\p
\v 5 . And I will make Rabba [The royal city of the Ammonites, see 2 Samuel 11 on verse 1.] a stable for camels, [for the camels of those of the east] and the children of Ammon [that is, their land] a sheep-coat: [for the sheep of those of the east] and you shall know that I am the LORD.
\p
\v 6 . For that saith the Lord LORD, because thou hast clapped with (the) hand and stamped with the foot; [For great joy and delight at the Jews miseries, as followeth; as if they had said, Aha, so so, that is too good for them, that is bravely done. Compare verse 3 above 6 on verse 11.] and hast heartily removed in all thy plundering, [or, despite, also, content, as above chapter 16.57 and below verse 15. Or, hast rejoiced with delight. See Psalms 27 n verse 12. So verse 15. Or thus, andhast rejoyed in all thy eager plundering. Heb. I, or with the soul. Compare below chapter 36.5.] against the land of Israel.
\p
\v 7 . Therefore behold, I will stretch out mine hand against thee, [see above chapter 16 on verse 9, so below verse 13.36.] and give thee for a prey to the heathen, and (I) will cut thee off from the nations. [That thou shalt be no more counted a people or a land] I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.
\p
\v 8 . Thus saith the Lord LORD; because Moab [see Jeremiah 48.1, c.] and seir [that is, the land of Edom, and consequently the Edomites, Esaus posterity, to whom this land tell. Of Seirs posterity see Genesis 36 on verse 20. So below chapter 35.2, c. and further of Edom, Jeremiah 49.7. Obadiah verse 1, c.] say: behold, thou house of Juda is like unto all the heathen: [That is, they imagined that they were Gods special and peculiar people, and had a prerogative with him above other nations, but it appeareth now otherwise because they are no more favoured by the Babylonians then others: mocking thus at God’s covenant and his churches, yea at the God of Israel himself]
\p
\v 9 . Therefore behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities (which) are on his frontiers; [Heb. Utmost, or end] the ornament of the land, Bethjesimoth, Baal-meon and unto Kiriatham; {or, and Kiriathain. These were some of the chiefest cities of the Moabities, lying between the brook Arnon and the Jordan. The meaning is, I will prepare for them of the east (as followeth, verse 10.) an open passage into the best and strongest places and countreyes of the land]
\p
\v 10 . For them of the east, [see on verse 4.] with [or, over and above, besides] (the land) of the children of Ammon which I will deliver for a possession, [for them of the east, as verse 4 implying, that as he had given the land of the Ammonites unto them of the east, so he would likewise open the land of the Moabites unto them.] that the children of Ammon may not be remembered among the heathen (any more) [above, chapter 21.32.]
\p
\v 11 . I will also exercise judgments in Moab: and they shall know that I am the LORD.
\p
\v 12 . Thus saith the Lord LORD, because the Edom [Called see above verse 8.] hath dealt by more revengefulness [Heb. Hath done, or dealt in, or by revenging of revenge, or b revenging revenge. Compare verse 15] against the house of Juda, and they {the Edomites] have made themselves exceeding guilty, in that they have revenged themselves upon them: [upon the Jews from the old grudge which they inherited from their forefathers Esau see Genesis 27.41. 2 Chronicles 18.17. Psalms 137. 7. Amos 1.11. Obadiah verse 1, c..]
\p
\v 13 . Therefore thus saith the Lord LORD: I will also stretch out mine hand against Edom, [As above verse 7.] and I will cut off man and beast from it; [the land of Edum, or Idumea] and will make it a wilderness from Theman; [see Jeremiah 49 on verse 7.] and they shall fall by the sword (unto) Dedan.
\p
\v 14 . And I will execute my vengeance upon Edom, [Heb. Lay, set against, under, upon, c. as verse 17.]By the hand of my people Israel; [That is, (as some expound this) by the same hand wherewith I smote my people Israel, (namely the army of the Babylonians) will also execute my vengeance upon thee. See Jeremiah 49.19 with the Annotat. But others take it upon spiritual sense: by the hand; that is, by the mean, ministery, or power of my church in their head Jesus Christ, who shal vanquish and subdue the enemies of his people. Compare Isaiah 11.14. Jeremiah 49. 2. Obadiah verse 19. With the Annotat. Of any corporal vengeance that the Jews or Israelites should have executed upon Edom in Succeeding ages we read nothing at all, save that which is related in the second book of the Machabees chapter 10 verse 15,16 and so forth] and they shall deal against Edom [or in, with Edom] according to mine anger, and according to my fury, thus shalt perceive my vengeance, saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 15 . Thus saith the Lord LORD; because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, [see 2 Chronicles 28.18. Joel 3.4. Amos 1.6,7,8.] And in heart [or with delight, as verse 6.] have exercised [Heb. Avenged] vengeance by plundering, [or spite, contempt, as verse 6] to destroy (by) an everlasting enmity: [Heb. Enmity of eternity, or antiquity.]
\p
\v 16 . Therefore thus saith the Lord LORD, behold, I stretch mine hand against the Philistines, [as above verse 7.] and will cut off the Cherctines, [This seemeth to have been the name of a country in the land of Philistines; but therby are meant the Philistines in general, as 1 Samuel 30.14,16. See there: also Zepheniah 2.5. But the Hebrew the words Cheretim, and cutting off, suit elegantly one with another, as if we should say, I will cut of those cutters off] and destroy the remnant of the sea-haven. [see Jeremiah 47.7. Zephaniah 25.6]
\p
\v 17 . And I will execute great vengeance among them with furious rebukes; [Heb. Rebukes of fury] and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have executed [Heb. given as verse 14.] my vengeance upon them.
\c 26
\s The time of this prophecy, verse 1 of the destruction of the city of Tyrus by the Chaldeans, because she rejoiced at the destruction of Jerusalem, 2. A description of the terror, astonishment and lamentation that there shall be at the sudden and unexpected destruction of Tyrus, 15.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, [After the captive carrying away of the kings Jechonia. See above chapter 24 on verse 1] on the first (day) of the moneth, [what moneth this is uncertain. From the following verse we may conceive it to have been the fifth moneth after the taking of Jerusalem which happened on the ninth day of the fourth moneth in the eleventh year of king Zedekia, Jeremiah 52.6] (that) the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\p
\v 2 . Child of man because that Tyrus [That is, the inhabitants of the city of Tyrus Heb. Tsor. See Joshua 19. On verse 29 and 1 Kings on verse and further Isaiah 23.1 &c. Jeremiah 47.4. Joel 3.4, &c. Amos 1.9,10. Zachariah 9.2,3. Pslms 83.8 and 81.4. Matthew 11.21,22.] Hath said concerning Jerusalem, Aha. [As above chapter 25.3.] She is broken the grace of the nations; [Heb. doors, &c. by which the nations from all parts did enter into exercise their merchandise. Compare below chapter 27.3 and Isaiah 23.3] she is turned about to me, [That is, her trading will now come to me] i shall be filled, [with merchandise and riches] she is laid waste. [as if she had said; she is quiet undone: or; (now, because) she is laid waste]
\p
\v 3 . Therefore, thus saith the Lord LORD; behold, I (will be) upon thee, [As above chapter 13.8] o Tyrus: and will cause many heathen to come up against thee, and if I caused the sea with his waves to come up [compare below verse 19. Others, as the sea lifteth himself up with his waves: this the Tyrians were wont to do, as laying in the sea.]
\p
\v 4 . They [to wit, these heathen, or nations. See verse 7.] shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers; verse 1 will wipe away her dust from her , [as when a man wipeth away the dust from a rock, so that the bare rock may be seen, which was before covered all over with dust. Thus it pleased God to represent most lively in Rhetorical terms the destruction of the city of Tyrus] and will make her a smooth rock. [Heb. make her the smoothness of a rock. Compare chapter 24.7. this hath respect to the situation of the city, which was built upon the rock, and from thence the name Tsor, that is a rock. God doth hereby intimate, that he will cause the building to be destroyed and consumed like dust, so that nothing more of it shall be seen, then the smooth bare empty rock upon which that proud ands stately city was built, so verse 14.]
\p
\v 5 . It shall be in the midst of the sea [for Tyrus lay round about in the sea, separate from the continent. See 1 Kings on verse 1 and below verse 17 and chapter 27.34 and 28.2.] (for) the spreading abroad of nets, [or, drag-sails. It shall be like bare island, where fisherman will spread nets abroad to dry them] for I have spoken it, saith the Lord LORD; and it shall become prey to the heathen.
\p
\v 6 . And her daughters [That is, the cities and villages that belonged to her, that is the inhabitants thereof. See 2 Kings 10 on verse 21 so verse 8] which are in the field shall be slain with the sword and they shall know that I am the LORD.
\p
\v 7 . For thus saith the Lord LORD, behold I will bring Nebuchadnezzar the King of Babel, the king of Kings, [That monarch, the greatest and mightiest of the kings of the earth. Compare Genesis 9 on verse 25 and cant. 1 on verse 1 and see Daniel 2.37] From the north against Tyrus, with horses and with chariots and with horsemen and (warlike) assembly and much people.
\p
\v 8 . He shall stay thy daughters [As verse 6.] in the field with the sword; and he shall make forts against thee and cast up a mount against thee, [see 2 Samuel 20 on verse 15] and lift up bucklers against thee, [that is, fight against thee, or cause souldiers with bucklers or bucklermen to all on upon assault the: for bucklers or shields in fighting are lifted up, or heaved up, to cover ones self therewith against the enemy]
\p
\v 9 . And he shall set well-breakers {such a warlike engine as destroyeth all that is before, or against it] against thy walls, and break down thy towers with his swords [or, axes of King Nebuchadnezzar.]
\p
\v 10 . By reason of the abundance of his [Nebuchadnezzar’s] horses, their dustcover thee: thy walls shall shake because of the noise of the horsemen, and wheels and chariots, when he shall march in through thy gates as (though) the entries of a city broken through. [or as men are wont to march into the city broken through, or split, rent asunder; that is, whole gates shall be so spoiled and open by the violence of the besiegers, as that they shall be able to march wide enough and in troops, as it were, through great breachers; or as men in a storming manner fall in through the breaches that are made, so shall be march in unto thee and destroy all. See verse 15 the breaches shall be to him instead of gates]
\p
\v 11 . He shall with the hooss [Heb. claws] of his horses tread down all thy streets: he shall stay thy people with the sword, and every one of the pillars of thy strength shall fall down to the ground, [Heb. the pillars of thy strength (whereby is seemth that strong towers or other strong holds are meant, which they had set up for defense) shall go down (in the singular number) to the ground; every one of them. some understand it of the stately statues, pageants &c. readred up for a show of their greatness]
\p
\v 12 . And they shall rob thy wealth, and plunder thy merchandise and break thy walls and overthrow thy costly houses: [Heb. houses of thy desires; that is, thy costly, desirable, pleasant houses] and they shall cast [Heb. lay, set] thy and thy wood, and thy dust in the midst the waters.
\p
\v 13 . Thus will I cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thine harps [Others, citherns] shall be more heard. [That is, all thy mirth shall be ended. See Isaiah 24.8. Jeremiah 7.34 and 16.9.]
\p
\v 14 . Yea I will make thee a smooth rock; [see above on verse 4.5.] thou shalt be (for) the spreading abroad of nets, thou shalt be built no more: [that is, not as in times past: thou shalt return no more to thy former worldly prosperity state and glory and in time utterly perish. Compare Isaiah 15.23,17. And below verse 21 and chapter 27.36. likewise Ezra 3.7. Nehemiah 13. Matthew 15.21. Mark 7.24. Acts 12. 20. and 21 3.7. its conceived, that this city rose as a little under the reign of King Cyrus, and in the time of Alexander the Great its remarkable that it was of some strength and power, when he besieged in seven months and at last took it but at this day many testify that there are hardly any reliques to be seen of the repaired city of Pale-Tyrus: nevertheless it hath had spiritual promises for the elect under the Messiah, Psalms 7.4. Isaiah 23.18. God (unto whom all things are known from eternity) joyneth here (as elsewhere often) the beginning and the end together] for I the Lord have spoken it, saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 15 . Thus saith the Lord LORD unto Tyrus, shall not the isles [That is, the inhabitants beyond see that have traded with thee and have been enriched by thee. Compare below chapter 27.35 and see Psalms 72 on verse 10] tremble at the sound of thy fall, [as if he should say, surely they will] whom the deadly wounded men shall grone [or howl, Sigh 30.24] when they shall cruelly murder [Heb. killing or (with) killing kill; that is, commit murder, murder all] in the midst of thee?
\p
\v 16 . And all the prince of the sea, [That dwell by the sea-side have thee, and have relied upon thee. Compare below chapter 27.35] shall come down from their throne, [in token of astonishment and sorrow; likewise for their own estate by thine example] and removes from them their robes and trembling, they shall sit down upon the ground and tremble at every moment, and be astonished at thee.
\p
\v 17 . And they shall take up the lamentation for thee, and say to thee, how art thou [A question proceeding from pity and amazement] perished out of the sea, thou well inhabited] wherein (to wit, in the seas) thou layest round about. Compare below chapter 27.35. others, thou that wast inhabited of the seas; that is, of sea-farring men, traders that came from beyond sea to dwell in thee; that is, to live and reside in thee a long while because of their traffique. Compare Acts 2.5. Jeremiah 4.13 and here in the end of this verse dwelt, that is, lived a long time, after the manner of the merchants’ factors, c] thou renowed city which wast strong at sea, she and her inhabitants, which gave their terror to all that dwelt in her. [That is, which by their extraordinary power, pomp and magnificence caused terror to be on all those that came from other places to live among them? Compare below chapter22.23, c and Isaiah 23.8.]
\p
\v 18 . Now shalt the Isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled because of the going out. [That is, because thy people shall be contained to go forth into captivity. Or going out, that is, end, pitiful issue; as we also use the fame word in our own language]
\p
\v 19 . For thus saith the Lord LORD, when I shall make thee a desolate, like the cities, that are not inhabited; when I shall cause an abysse [meaning the Babylonian army. See above verse 3] to come upon thee, and great [or many] waters shall cover thee;
\p
\v 20 . Then will I cause thee to come down with them that descend into the pit, [that is, into the grave, as often: that thou shalt be those that are dead, buried and forgotten] to the old people, [Heb. people of eternity; that is, antiquity. Understand those that of old time in former ages, from the beginning of the world, are gone down thither, see of this word Olam, Jeremiah 2 on verse 20. So in the sequel] and will cause thee to lie down in the lowermost places of the earth, [Heb, the earth of lowness. So below chapter 52.10, c] in the desolate places (that) have been of old, [the same thing is said in other words] with them that descend into the pit, that thou be not inhabited: and I will restore ornaments in the land of the living. [That is, upon the earth, among men that are alive. See Psalms 27 on verse 13. That is, my land of Canaan, Jerusalem and of my people of Juda (at whose misery and destruction thou saidth, Aha verse 2) then will I deliver and restore to such an estate, that they shall be the beauty and glory of all the earth, as a type of that which I will do to my whole Church by the Messiah on earth and in the heavenly Canaan. See above chapter 20.6. Psalms 48.3. Ephesians 5.27. Revelations 21.2 and below chapter 37.11,c.]
\p
\v 21 . (But) I will make thee a greater terror, [Heb. terrours, troubles, astonishments, That is, I will so deal with thee that every one shall be frightened when he hereth of it, thinketh of it] and thou shalt be no more: [see above on verse 14. [when thou art sought for thou shalt not be found for ever, compare Psalms 37.35,36, c.] saith the Lord LORD.
\c 27
\s A prophetical lamentation for Tyrus, with a description of her glory, and accommodation that many nations had had by all manner of commerce and trading from her, verse 1,2,c. and on the contrary, of her terribal fall, as also the loss, astonishment, mourning and hissing that shall be made thereat by the nations and their kings, 26,c.
\p
\v 1 . Furthermore, the word of the LORD came unto me saying:
\p
\v 2 . Thou then child of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus;
\p
\v 3 . And say unto Tyrus that dwelleth at the entries of the sea, [That is, whereunto they sail from the sea, and whereupon the sea beateth on every side. See 1 Kings 5 on verse 1.] dealing with the nations [or which is the chiefest among the nations in dealing or exercising merchandise. Heb. Properly the dealer of the nations] in my isles: [see Psalms 72 on verse 10] thus saith the Lord LORD; o Tyrus, thou sayest I am perfect in beauty.
\p
\v 4 . Thy borders are in the heart of the sea: [that is, in the midst, (as verse 32) or directly in the sea. Compare Deuteronomy 4 on verse 11. so below verse 25,26,27. and chapter 28.2,8.] thy builders have perfected thy beauty.
\p
\v 5 . They have built all thy baths [Heb. Two tables, whereby is meant the hatches of a ship. The Hebrew word is used in the dual number, as hatches of ships are frequently divided into twain, going flopping down on both side] (of) fir-trees of senir: [growing on that mountain. See Deuteronomy 3.9] thy have fetcht] Heb. Taken, that is, taken and brought or fetcht. See Genesis 12 on verse 15 and Jeremiah 37 on verse 17.] cedars [Heb. Cedar. See Judges 9 on verse 15] from Libanon to make mast [Heb. Mast-tree] for thee.
\p
\v 6 . They have made thine oars (of) the oaks of Basan: thy boards [Heb. Thy board, or bench; or we may render it, bench-work] have they made (of) well trodden ivory, [Heb. A daughter of steps, or goings; that is, which hath layen long in the ground, and where consequently men have long gone over, which counted the right ivory, Plin, lib 8. cap. 3. see of this phrase Job 5 on verse 7. Isaiah 5 on verse 1. others, thy (ships) benches (whereon they rowed, or whereon the passengers set, for pomp) have those of the company of the Assyrians. See 2 Samuel 2.9 with the Annotat.) made of ivory,c. because the Hebrew word Aschur and Aschar are very like one another. See of the word ivory, 1 Kings 10 on verse 18.] from the isles of the chittites. [See Genesis 10 on verse 4. some understand by these the nations that lay westward from Palestina]
\p
\v 7 . Fine linen [see Genesis 41 on verse 42.] with needle-work [or broidered work] from Egypt was thy spreading forth, to be a sail [or ensign, flag] for thee: skie-color, [that is, garments of this color] and purple from the isles of Elisa, [see genesis 10 on verse 4.] was thy covering.
\p
\v 8 . The inhabitants of Zidon [see genesis 10 on verse15] and Arvad [see Genesis 10 on verse 18 also verse 11.] where thy rowers: thy wise men, [that were expert, skilful and well versed in navigation, so verse 9.] O tyrus (that) were in thee they thy ship-masters. [or pilots, steermen. So in the sequel]
\p
\v 9 . The oldest of Gebal [see 1 Kings 5 on verse 18] and the wise men thereof were in thee, mending thy breaches: [Heb. Breach, split, rent. That is, to repair thy costly buildings and houses: or as some, to stop the holes, to tallow the ships] all the ships of the sea and their sea men were in thee to drive a mutual trade with thee [Heb. To mix thy mixture; that is, to traffick with thee. The Hebrew word being of one root, and used of trading,, trafficking, dealing with one another for any commodity to contract together, to be surety for one another, &c. so in the sequel]
\p
\v 10 . Persians and Lydians, [see Genesis 10 on verse 13.] and puteans, see Genesis 10 on verse 6. Heb. Lud and Put] were in thine army, thy shoulders: thy shoulders: [whom thou as well as thy own garrison, as otherwise to help thy friends, and to aw thine enemies, and for pomp, didst most stately maintain in thy service] they hanged up the shield and helmet in thee:] [for pomp and ornament, as is also yet practiced at this day; their fair and beautiful weapons] those thy made thine ornaments, [or brought thine ornament. Heb. Properly gave, have given, that is, they made thee comely, adorned thee, served for thy ornament or beauty]
\p
\v 11 . The children of Arvad and thine army were upon thy walls round about, and the Gemmadites [These are placed some in a country of Phoenicia, or a certain city there called Gammale, by changing the letter d into an l, (see Pli. Lib. 2 chapter 93.) not far from Tyrus, northward. Heb. Gammadin. Some guess that it cometh from the word Gomed, Judges 3.16. signifying an ell or cubit, elbow, from whence also these people had their name as being expect archers, watchmen, guards, that kept the forts, being strong in their elbows, arms and hands and so fit and serviceable for that use, as followeth] were upon their towers: [that is, city-forts and strong holds] they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they made thy beauty perfect.
\p
\v 12 . Tharsis [see genesis 10 on verse 4.] traded with thee: [or was thy dealer. So verse 16.18.] by reason of the maltitude of all kinds of goods; [Heb. All, c. That is, all manner of riches, substance, goods: as verse 33. so verse 18.22] with silver, iron, tin and lead they traded [or set themselves, composed themselves. Heb. They gave or have given. And so often in the sequel] (in) [this word is here inserted from verse 16 and 19. so in the 1 verse following] thy fairs.
\p
\v 13 . Javan, Tubal andMesich, [that is, theposterity of these three. See Genesis 10 on verse 2.] they were thy merchants: [or traders, factors, dealers] they draw a mutual trade with thee with the souls of men, [that is, the persons or men themselves. See Genesis 12 on verse 5 and Revelations 18.13 meaning to sell them for slaves, or otherwise to trade with them] and copper vessels.
\p
\v 14 . Of the house [That is, family or people] of Togarma, [see Genesis 10 on verse 3.] they delivered [or they brought and horsemen and mules in (thy) fairs.
\p
\v 15 . The children [That is, the posterity] of Dedan [See Genesis 10 on verse 7. Jeremiah 25 on verse 23.] were thy merchants; many isles were isles were the merchandise of thine hand, [that is, which thou hadth for thy merchandise and wares ready at hand, or wherewith thou didst trade in buying and selling, wherein the giving of the hand or striking of hands was a thing usual in concluding or making up of the bargain; as also in other mutual translations. Compare below verse 21.] They gave thee again (for) a present [or brought, c. Heb. They brought again thy present; that is, thee for a present: or (as some) in payment] horns of ivory and ebony-wood.
\p
\v 16 . Syria [Heb. Aram. See Genesis 10 on verse 22. Meaning the Syrians] traded with thee because of the multitude of thy works: [or makings; that is, all manner of wares that are made in thee to traffique or trade withal. So verse 18.] with Emeraulds, purple and needlework, [or broidered work] and silk, and Ramoth, [see Job 28 on verse 18] and Cadkod; [see Isaiah 54.12.] on thy markets did they trade.
\p
\v 17 . Juda and the land of Isaiah they were thy merchants; [Compare 1 Kings 5.9. Acts 12.20] they drave a mutual trade with thee with wheat of Mimmith, [See Judges 11.33.] and Pannag, [which some conceive to be balm, others, Phenira] hony and oil and balm. [compare 1 Kings 5.9. Acts 12.20. Of Balm see Genesis 37.25 and Jeremiah 8.22.]
\p
\v 18 . Damascus [see Genesis 14 on verse 15 and Samuel 8 on verse 5] traded with thee for [Or, within] the multitude of thy works, [as above verse 16.] because of the maltitude of all manner of goos, [as above verse 12.] with wine of Chalboa, [wich someone conceive to be Charlibon in Syrian] and white wooll.
\p
\v 19 . Dan [The prosperity of Dan, dwelling at Dan, by mount Libanon, see Judges 18.29] also and Jaavan, [see Genesis 10 on verse 2.] the traveler [Heb. Muzzal; that is, he is done, that is, is driven to travel to and fro, he that is chafed about, driven about, to wit, out of a desire of gain, as merchants and traders are. Some conceive it to be the proper name of a nation] delivered [or, traders, as verse 12.] in thy markets; smooth iron, Cassia and Calamus was in thy mutual merchandise.
\p
\v 20 . Dedan [That is, pofterity of Dedan. See Genesis 25.3] dealt with thee with precious vesture [Heb. Clothes of liberty, or freedom, that is, which free men, and not servants or bond-men use; that is rich, costly apparel] for charets: [Or, riding-furniture, faddle-furniture]
\p
\v 21 . Arabia, [That is, the Arabians] and all the Prince of Kedar, [so Genesis 23 on verse 13. Jeremiah 2 on verse 10.] they were the merchants of thine hand; [see above verse 15.] with lams and rams and goats, therewith did they trade with thee.
\p
\v 22 . the merchants of Scheba and Raama, [see of these two, Genesis 10 on verse 7.] they were thy merchants: they escaped in the markets with all head-spices, [That is, all sorts of the chiefest and most excellent spices. So in the sequel. Compare above verse 12.] and with a ll precious stones and gold.
\p
\v 23 . Haran, [see Genesis 11 on verse 31.] and Canna, [some conceive this to be Calne, Genesis 10.10] and Eden, [see Genesis 2 on verse 8] the merchants of Scheba, [some hold this to be Seka in desert Arabia, by Mesopotamia. See Job 1 on verse 15.] Assur, [That is the Assyrians. See Genesis 10 on verse 22.] (and) Kilmad [Some hold this to be a country lying in the uppermost part of Media, between Aflyria and Parthia d aleth with thee.
\p
\v 24 . These were thy merchants with perfect adornings, [see above chapter 23.12. Or, all sorts (of things), or, in gross. Heb. Perfections, accomplishments] with packs [Or, Bales, folded pieces. Heb. As if one should say, foldings, wrappings up: Others, cloaks, coats, gowns] of skie-color, c of skie-color and needle-work [Or, broidered work] and with treasure-chests [or, coffers] of beautiful garment bound with cords, and pack in cedar, [Heb, cedared, that is, put, laid, or packt up in chests of cedar, or in chests made of cedar, or, cedar chests] among the merchandise. [Or, upon thine exchange]
\p
\v 25 . The ships [That is, the sea-fearing men, or the passengers] of Tharsis, or the Ocean sea. See 1 kings 10 on verse 22.] Sung of thee, (because of) the mutual trading with thee: [or, (in) thy markets] and thou wast replenished, [to wit, with all manner of riches] and exceedingly glorified in their heart of the seas. [as above verse 4 and in the sequel]
\p
\v 26 . They that rowe thee, [That is, thy Rulers and the Princes that are thy leaders, that are like the rowers in the ships] have carried thee into great [or, mighty] waters: [that is, have brought thee into great peril and danger of shipwreck. Compare 2 Samuel 22 on verse 17. Or, thou art come to such a great height, that thy fall shall be the greater; whereunto thou hat given occasion by thy great and intolerant pride, as ships in great large waters carried with main high sails, are the sooner tossed aside and broken in pieces by a storm, as followeth] the east-wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas. [see Exodus 10 on verse 13. Job 27 on verse 21. Psalms 48.8 and above chapter 17.10.]
\p
\v 27 . Thy goods and thy market wares, thy mutual trading, thy sea-men, and thy pilot they ruined thy breaches, and they that drive a mutual trade with thee, and all thy souldiers that are in thee, even with all the congregation which is in the midst of thee, shall fall unto the heart of the seas, in the day of thy fall.

\p
\v 30 . And they shall cause their voices to be heard against thee, and cry bitterly: and they shall cast [Heb. Cause to come up, bring up, cast up] dust upon their heads, [see 2 Samuel 1 on verse 2] they shall wallow themselves in the ashes [as Jeremiah 6.26]
\p
\v 31 . And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, [Heb, properly baldness or, make themselves bald with baldness. See Jeremiah 16 on verse 6.] and gird or sacks; [see Genesis 37 on verse 34] and shall weep for thee with bitterness of soul, [That is, bitter grief of heart] and bitter-wailing.
\p
\v 32 . And in the morning they shall take up a lamentation for thee. [Others, their children shall, &c] and lament over thee, (saying): who hath been like Tyrus, like the destroyed [To wit, city] in the midst of the sea.
\p
\v 33 . When the market-wares come forth out of the seas, thou didst satisfie many nations; with the multitude of thy goods, and thy mutual traffick hath thou enriched the Kings of the earth.
\p
\v 34 . In the time when thou broken by the seas in the depths f the waters, are thy mutual trading and all thy congregation fallen in the midst of thee.
\p
\v 35 . All the inhabitants are astonished by thee; [compare above chapter 29 on verse 15.] and the hairs of their kings’ hair stand on end [As below chapter 32 verse 10] they are amazed in countenance. [Showing great dismayness and affraightment in their countenance]
\p
\v 36 . The traders among the nations whistle at thee; [Or, over thee. See 1 Kings on verse 8 and jeremiah 18 on verse 16] thou art become a great terrour; Heb. Terrours. So, below chapter 28.19.] and shalt be no (more) for ever. Compare above chapter 26.14 with the Annotat.]
\c 28
\s A prophecy of the destruction of the King of Tyrus, for his pride, insolency, verse 1,2,c. A prophetical lamentation for him, by comparing his former glory with his future ruine, 11. A prophecy against Zidon; 21 with a promise of the restauration of the church, 25.
\p
\v 1 . Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto me saying:
\p
\v 2 . Child of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, [Meaning the King of Tyrus as above verse 12, and see 2 Samuel 6.21 and 2 Kings 20.5.] Thus saith the Lord LORD; because thy heart lifteth up it self and saith, [or, thou sadist, or, sayest; to with, with thy self; that is thinkest, perfwadest thy self] I am God, [Attribution to thy self the wisdom, power, majesty which belongeth to the onely true God] as I sit in God’s seat, [as in such a kingdom, where no enemy can annoy me, nor any glory is lacking unto me] in the heart of the seas: [see above chapter 27.4. so verse 8] whereas thou art a man, and not a God, yet thou settlest thine heart as the heart of God. [thou comparest thy self in wisdom, &c. with God
\p
\v 3 . Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel: [Meaning in thine own conceit; and so the sequel: or it is spoken ironically. It seemeth that there was such a proverb used in Babel, (where Ezekiel prophesied) taken fron Daniel’s wisdom, which was famous there. See Daniel 1. 17, &c.] They have hid [Or, darkened] no closed thing from thee. [Or, men have hid no closed thing, &c. or, or no closed thing hath been, &c.]
\p
\v 4 . By thy wisdom, and by thine understanding thou hast gotten [Heb. Made. So in the sequel] for thee wealth; yea thou hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures. [or, treasures.]
\p
\v 5 . By the greatness of thy wisdom in thy traffickast thou increased thy wealth: and thy heart lifteth up itself because of thy wealth.
\p
\v 6 . Therefore thus saith the Lord LORD, because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God;
\p
\v 7 . Therfore behold, I will bring strangers [The Babylonians, above chapter 26.7 and below chapter 29.20.] upon thee, the most tyrannical [or, most terrible, most horrible, most cruel. So below chapter 30.11. and 31.12. and 32.12] of the heathen they shall draw out their swords [Heb. Empty their swords: because the sheath is empty when the sword is drawn out. So below chapter 30.11.] Against the beauty of thy wisdom, [that is, thy flourishing kingdom and state, the glory whereof thou ascribest unto thy wisdom: or, against thee, the esteemeth thy self to be so beautiful and wise] and shall profane thy brughtness. [that is, defile it, deal with it as a profane and filthy thing, by killing thee and casting thee into the pit, as followeth. So verse 16. see above chapter 7 on verse 21.]
\p
\v 8 . They shall cause thee to go down to the pit: and thou shalt die the death [Heb. In the plural number deaths or killings as Isaiah, as Isaiah 53.9.] of one that is slain in the heart of the seas. [As above verse 2. The meaning is, they shall put thee to a violent death, even in thine own city, which is compassed about with waters, wherein thou trustest]
\p
\v 9 . Wilt thou (then) in any wise say [Heb, saying say] before the face of thy slayer, [when thou shalt indeed find thine own impotency and weakness, being in the power of thine enemy] I am God whereas thou art a man, and not a God, in the hand of him that slayeth thee.
\p
\v 10 . Thou shalt die the death of the uncircumcised, [Heb, deaths (in plural number, as verse 8.) of the uncircumcised; that is, thou shalt die as wicked, profane men, and such as are hated and despised of God, that are none of his people, die. See 1 Sam. 17.26. Judg. 15.18. also below chap.31.18 and 32.19,21,25,27,&c. some conjecture that this may have respect to the ordinance of God’s people, that had a command to cut off from among them those that would not be circumcised, Genes. 17.14.] by the hand of strangers; for I have spoken at, saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 11 . Moreover, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:
\p
\v 12 . Child of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him; [Or, concerning him] thus saith the Lord LORD; thou sealer up of the summe, [that is, of that which is told or weighed: that is, (as some conceive) that hath the supreme command over all the great traffick of Tyrus; or, (as others) that art the measure, pattern, image, or, picture of an absolute flourishing slate: or, without any defect, where nothing at all is wanting, as a summe that is well told and sealed up] full of widsome and perfect in beauty:
\p
\v 13 . Thou wast in Eden, the garden of God; [Didst dwell and keep court in all exceeding pleasant places, as in a garden of pleasure, or paradise. See Genes. 2.8 and 13.10. and below chap. 31.8,9 and 36.35.] Every [or, all kind of] precious stone was thy covering, [that is, thy garment were so adorned therewith, as if thou clothed with mere precious stones] Sarduis stones or Rubies. In the Hebrew all these stones are mentioned in the singular number. See further, Exod. 28 on verse 17.] Topazes, and Diamonds, [or, Carbuncles] Torroise, Sardoux-stones, [see Gen. 2. on ver. 12.] and Jasper-stones, Saphirs, Rubies, [or carbuncles] Emeraulds, and gold: the work of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was thee; in the dry when thou wast created [that is, born, and by the power, goodness, and wisdom of God cameth first into the world out of thy mothers womb. Compare Genes. 1 on verse 1 and verse 15. and above chap. 21. 30.] Were they prepared? [From thy very infancy hast thou lived in all kind of jollity aud wantonness; all manner of pleasure and dainties hath been tendered to thee, for which purpose the voice of the tabret & pipe served.]
\p
\v 14 . Thou wast an anointed covering Cherub: [For that which was in the Tabernacle was anointed with the holy oyl, Exod. 30.26,&c. the Cherub covered the ark with wings, Exod. 25.20. of the word Cherub see Genes. 3 on verse 24. The meaning is, thou wast to be compared for outward costliness and glory, with that which was most precious and glorious upon mount Zion in the Temple, namely the golden Cherubims, and the priestly garments. This surteth fitly with this whole verse. Others apply it to the Cherubims that fence Paradise; (because in the former verse is spoken of Eda, and the garden of God) with whom this king, as anointed (that is, ordained, and sit (as followeth) to be a defender of his kingdome) is compared] and I had set [Or, made] thee (so) [that is, I had endued thee with such glory] thou wast upon the holy mountain of God, [Heb. Upon the mountain of the holiness of God: that is, as, or like &c. meaning Zion] thou walketh in the midst of fiery stones. [Heb. Stones of fire. That is, everywhere where thou didst go up and down in thy palace, it did shine with glittering precious stones: or thou didst walk in garments that were trimmed and adorned therewith, and did cast as it were beams of fire from them: as the high priest shined with the stones that were in the priest breast-plate, Exod. 28.15,&c.]
\p
\v 15 . Thou wast perfect in thy wayes, [That is, being, purpose, and action. See Genes. 6. on verse 12. that is, nothing is lacking unto thee in regard of pomp and magnificence] from the day that thou wast created, [As above verse 13.] till iniquity [others, great iniquity: to express, that the Hebrew word which signifieth iniquity, perversness, vice, &c. hath one letter more then ordinary. Compare Psalms 3 on verse 3.] was found in thee. [That is, plainly appeared, and was discovered, and thou wast taken and apprehended n the very act. Compare Psalms 36.3. Jer. 2.20, &c. with the Annotat.]
\p
\v 16 . By the multitude [or greatness] of thy merchandise they [To wit, those that traded with thee] have filled the midst of thy city] with violence, [So as that thou art bent and inclined to all manner of oppression: or, so as that thou hast gathered great treasures gotten by violence: others, they are (in) the midst of thee full of, c.] and thou hast sinned: therefore I will profane thee [cast thee away as unclean and profane. Compare verse 7.] from the mountain of God, [That is, contemptibly reject thee from thy glory, whereby thou wat to be compared with my mountain, above verse 14.] and will destroy thee, thou covering Cherub, [As above verse 14.] from the midst of the fiery stones. [So that thou shalt be stripped of all thy pride. See verse 14.]
\p
\v 17 . Thine heart lifteth up it self because of thy beauty; thou hast corrupted thy wisdom, by reason of thy brightness: [Thine excellency and glory hath caused thy wisdom to perish, and hath besotted thee] I have cast thee upon the ground, [that is, I will surely do it: it is spoken in a prophetical way, and so in the sequel] I will set thee before the face of kings, that they may look upon thee. [That is, for a gazing-stock or spectacle of my righteous and wonderful judgement upon thee, at whose pomp and riches every one formerly wondered, as is declared n the sequel]
\p
\v 18 . Because of the multitude of thine iniquities, by the injustice of thy traffick, hast thou profane thy sanctuary; [That is, thy palace, and thy royal throne (which ought to be consecrated unto God and which thou compareth with the habitation and throne of God, verse 2) hast thou made unholy, vile and profane] therefore have I caused a fire [to wit, the fire of mne anger, occasioned thee and thine; or, plague and miseris. See Job 22.20. and above chap. 27.27. and below chap. 30.8.] to come forth from the midst of thee, the same hath consumed thee, and I have made thee to ashes [that is, I will bring thee to the uttermost nullity and destruction. See Job 6.15,&c.] upon the earth, before the eyes of all them that behold thee.
\p
\v 19 . All that know thee among the nations were astonished at thee: thou art become a great terrour, [As above chp. 27.36.] and shalt be (no more) shalt not (be any more) for ever.
\p
\v 20 . Furthermore, the word of the Lord came unto me saying:
\p
\v 21 . Child of man, set thy face against Zidon: [see above chap. 6 on verse 2. Zidon lay also by the midland-sea, or the sea of Phoenicia, northward off Tyrus. See Genesis 10 on verse 15.] and prophesie against;
\p
\v 22 . And say, thus saith the Lord LORD; behold, I (will be) upon thee, [see above chap. 13.8. and Jeremiah 21 on verse 13.] O Zidon, and will be glorified] by my judgements and punishments (as followeth) gie occasion of being honoured and extolled] in the midst of thee: they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall have exercised [Heb. Done. So verse 20. and below chap. 30.19, &c. see above chap. 5. on verse 8. judgements in her [in Zidon] and shall be hallowed in her. [shall have manifested my justice, holiness and power among them. So verse 25. and c. 36.23. and 38.16.]
\p
\v 23 . For I will send the pestilence into her, and bloud into her streets, and the slain shall fall [Others, be judged] in the midst of her, by the sword (that) shall be against her round about, and they shall know that I am the Lord.
\p
\v 24 . And the house of Israel shall have no more paining [Or, pricking] thorn, or grieving thistle, of all that are round about them, [or, from all places that are round about them] that rob them: [or, despise them. Se verse 26. compare above chap. 16.37. That is, the enemies round about shall no more vex and annoy them] and they shall know that I am the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 25 . Thus saith the Lord LORD, when I shall have gathered the house of Israel the nations among whom they are scattered, and I shall be hallowed among them [As verse 22.] before the eyes of the heathen: then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant, unto Jacob.
\p
\v 26 . And they shall dwell safely therein, and build houses and plant vineyards; yea they shall dwell safely when I shall have exercised judgments against all that have spoiled them, of those that are round about them, and they shall know that I am the lord am their God. [This prophecy (contained in these last two verses) may in a sort be applied to the deliverance from Babel, but the accomplishment thereof belongeth to the spiritual kingdom of the Messiah: and is set down (as elsewhere often) according to the style of the Old Testament. Compare Jerem. 32.37,38,39,c.]
\c 29
\s The time of this prophecy, verse 1. Against Pharaoh and all Egypt, 2. with a promise of a finall restauration, 13. that the people of God may trust no more in trouble, 16. the time of the ensuing prophecy, 17 whenin God giveth the land of Egypt unto King Nebuchadnezar for a reward of his service against Tyrus, 18. The restauration of Israel, 21.
\p
\v 1 In the tenth year [After the captive-carrying away of Jechonia, or Jorachin. Compare above chap. 1.2 and below 33.21,c.] in the tenth (moneth), [In the ecclesiastical year called Tabith, in the civil, Tamuz] on the twelveth (day) of the moneth, the word of the Lord came unto me saying:
\p
\v 2 . Child of man, set thy face against Pharaoh King of Egypt: [See of this phrase above chap. 6. on verse 2. some hold this Pharaoh to have been Pharaoh-Hophra. See jerem. 44.30. with the Annotay. From which place may be gathered, that he lived at the time when the Jews, after the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezar, fled into Egypr; otherwise Pharaoh was a common name of the Kings of Egypt. See Genes. 22 on verse 15.] and prohesie against him all Egypt.
\p
\v 3 . Speak and say, thus saith the Lord LORD; behold, I (will be) upon thee, [As above chap. 28.22. So below verse 10 and chap. 30.22, &c.] O Pharaoh, King of Egypt; that great sea-dragon, [see Psalms 74.13,14. Isaiah 27.1 and 51.9 and below chap. 32.2. Some understand here a crocodile] that lieth in the midst of the rivers: [understand the sundry arms and streams of great and famous river Nilus, whereby he thought to be Sosase, that no enemy, yea no God (as Hirodotus writeth Lib. 2) was able to drive him ot of his kingdom] which saith, my river is mine, [To wit, the river Nilus: I alone am Lord and master over it is onely for my profit and security, no man else hath power or command over it, nor can take or wrest it away from me] and I have made it for myself. [Ordered and divided it for the accommodation and strengthening of my kingdom]
\p
\v 4 . But I will put books in thy chews, [Compare Amos 4 on verse 2.] and cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy seales: And I will draw thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy seales. [That is, I will pluck out thy subjects with thee (as the little fishes stick fast unto the scales of the great ones) and I will carry and hale you together to the places where it shall fare with with you as followeth: I will execute my judgement upon you partly by the Cyrenians, (as some conceive out of Herodotus Lib. 2) and partly also by Nebuchadnezar, whereof mention is made I in the sequel verse 19, &c. also chap. 30.24,25,&c.] Compare Jerem. 43. 10 and 46.2,&c. and see also Jerem. 44 on verse 30. The order of these histories is somewhat obscure among interpreters, because Pharaoh-Hophra is held to be the be the grand-child of Pharaoh Necho, whom Nebuchadnezar in the life-time (as is conceived) of his father Nebuchadnezzar the first, (otherwise called Nabopolaffir) conquered, and afterward destroyed Egypt; the matter it self and the truth of God’s word remaining without all controversie: as God often joyneth the beginning. Progress, and end together and mixeth them one among another, so doth he also in his prophecies of judgements; forasmuch as all things are known unto him from all eternity, and one thing is as sure and certain as another; which is especially to be heeded in the writings of the prophets. Compare Jerem. 46.2,13 With the Annotat. On both verses there]
\p
\v 5 . And I will have thee in the wilderness, thee; and all the fish of the rivers; thou shalt fall [That is, be smitten and perish. See Genes.14 on verse 10. Or, falling for lying, as elsewhere] upon the field; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered for meat to the beasts of the field, and to the fowls of heaven.
\p
\v 6 . And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the Lord: because they have been a stass of reed to the house of Israel. [Stirring them up to rebellion against the chaldrean, with promises of great help which they performed not. See 2 Kings 18 on verse 31. Isaiah 36.6.]
\p
\v 7 . Then they took hold of thee thy hand, then wast thou broken, [Or crackt: not onely not supporting them, but also hurting and pricking them as followeth] and didst all their sides: [Heb. side, or the whole side. Others, shoulder, in the following words is spoken of leaning, or staying and resting] and when they leane upon thee, then thou wast broken and suffereth all loins to stand upon themselves. [Heb. madest all their loins to stand. That is, thou didst forsake them, didst leave them to shift for themselves as well as they could , without helping, or supporting them, contrary to thy promises, and their hope and expiration, Or this: And shouldst thou cause all their loins to stand? That is, be able to keep them standing, or to hold them upright?]
\p
\v 8 . Therefore thus saith the Lord LORD; behold, I will bring the sword [Hostility, war, murder and destruction] upon thee: and I will cut off man and beast out of thee.
\p
\v 9 . And the land of Egypt shall become a wilderness, and a desert; and they shall know that I am the LORD: because he [Pharaoh] saith, the river is mine and I have made (it). [As above verse 3.]
\p
\v 10 . Therefore behold, I (will be) upon the, [As above verse 3] and upon thy river, and I will make the land of Egypt desolate, wilde, solitariness, [Heb. desolations of desolation, of solitariness, or wilderness; that is I will make it utterly waste and desolate] from the tower [Heb. Migdol; which some take to be the city of Migdol, whereof . see Jeremiah 44.41 and 46.14] of Syene, [Heb. Seveneh, that is, from one end of the land to the other, as some expound this; But Syene was a famous city in Egypt, lying just under the circle, or the Tropick of cancer, Pln, lib. 2 chap. 75. Some are of opinion that is now called Asna] unto the border of the coutrey of Ethopia: [Heb. Cuseb. See Genesis 2 on verse 13 and 10 on verse 6. That Ethopia bordereth on Egypt is held to be a truth without all controversie. See Isaiah 18 on verse 1,2 and compare below chapter 30.4.]
\p
\v 11 . No foot of man shall pass thorow it, nor any foot of beast shall pass thorow it, neither shall it be inhabited [see of the Heb. word Jerem. 17 on verse 6] fourty years
\p
\v 12 . For I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of desolate countreyes, [That is, in such a condition, as other desolate countreyes and cities are wont be in. so below chap. 30.7.] and her cities shall be a desolate in the midst of desolate cities, fourty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the heathen and will disperse [Or, san, winnow, shake So below chapter 30.23.] them in the lands.
\p
\v 13 . But thus saith the Lord LORD; At the end of fourty years, [After this desolation, when the Babylonian Monarchy shall decline to an end] will I gather the Egyptians from the nations whither they were scattered.
\p
\v 14 . And I will turn the captivity of the Egyptians, and bring them again into the land of Pathros, [see Genesis 10 on verse 14] into the land of their merchandise. [Where they were wont to drive in their trade in the buying and selling. Others, converse, habitation; the meaning is, their own country] and they shall be there a base kingdom. [Under the monarchy of the Persians. Compare above chapter 17.14]
\p
\v 15 . And it shall be baser then (other) kingdoms, neither (shall it) exalt self any more above the heathen: for I will diminish them that they shall not rule over the heathen.
\p
\v 16 . And it shall be no more a confidence unto the house of Israel, to cause (then) iniquity to be remembered, To wit, the iniquity which they committed in trading with the Egyptians and otherwise of old had brought away from thence. See above chapter 21.24 with the Annotat. And further chapter 8.10,14 and 23.19,20,21.] When they look after them: [Or, when they looked after them: to wit, the Egyptians; not trasting in me, but in the Egyptians and so consequently departing from me: whereby they would give me occasion to remember the one with the other, and to punish them for the same. See Genesis 8 on verse 1.] But they shall know that I am the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 17 . Moreover, it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, [See verse 1.] in the first (moneth) [called Nisan, in the ecclesiastical year; thesri, in the civil] on the first (day) of the moneth; (that) the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:
\p
\v 18 . Child of man, Nebuchadnezzar the Kings of Babel caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus; [See above chapters 26,27,28.] all heads [Heb. headside] are grown bad, [that is, his souldiers were grown bare and poor, tired and worn out by the long and tedious siege of Tyrus, which lasted, as ancient histories report (Josephus cont. Appi. Lib. 1) thirteen years together] and all sides are plucked up: [or, all shoulders are peeled, by the carrying of burdens] and neither he nor his army have had any wages for Tyrus, for the service that he served against it.
\p
\v 19 . Therefore thus saith the Lord LORD; behold, I will give the land of Egypt into Nebuchadnezzar the King of Babel, and he shall carry away her [The land of Egypt] multitude, [or, common people, or plenty riches. See of the Hebrew word Psalms 37 on verse 16. Jeremiah 46 on verse 3.4,10,15. And 31.2,12,16,&c. and spoil her spoil, and prey her prey, and it shall be the wages for his army.
\p
\v 20 . (For) his wages, [Compare Jeremiah 22 on verse 13.] because he served against her, [The city of Tyrus] have I given him the land of Egypt, because they wrought. [See of such use of the Hebrew word, Ruth 2 on verse 19. Proverbs 31 on verse 13.] For me, [not that Nebuchadnezzar’s and his souldiers arm was to obey the true God of Israel in this, (who are called wicked, below chapter 30.12) but because God by his secret providence used them for the execution of this his judgement, as it were for his own service. See Jeremiah 25 on verse 9. Although it may be that Nebuchadnezzar having heard of Ezekiel’s prophecy (as being made in Babylon) by God’s direction and government did the more victoriously his intent and purpose. Compare Jeremiah 40.2, 3] saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 21 . In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, [That is, cause the honour and respect of the church again to spring up (as herbs or plants spring up out of the earth) in the midst of their captivity, so as that ye shall dare boldy speak of me and my works, even in Babel, and spread abroad my praise there, as followeth: for which purpose questionless God used both the accomplishment of such prophecies as these and also the grace and favour and dignity and renown of Daniel and his companions. See Daniel 2.46 and 3.29 and 4.37. And 5.29. Or, it may be taken in general as a prophecy concerning the grace and mercy that God is wont to shew unto his church after great troubles and afflictions, a this in Babel was, whereby he giveth them occasion to extol his holy name in publick] and (I will) thee the opening of the mouth [See Psalms 51.17. Proverbs 31.9 and above chapter 16.63 and below chapter 33.22. Eph. 6.19 with the Annotat.] In the midst of them; [The Babylonians] and they shall know that I am the LORD.
\c 30
\s Two prophecies mo the one concerning the destruction of all Egypt, and all her helpers and considerate round about, verse 1,2,3,4,c the other concerning breaking the arm of their king, and the strengthening of the king of Babel’s are against him; as also concerning the scattering of the Egyptians among the actions, 20.
\p
\v 1 Furthermore, the word of God came unto me, saying:
\p
\v 2 . Child of man, prophesie and say; thus saith the Lord LORD: Hwl, Ah that day! [The time of punishments and plagues. See Psalms 37.13. Joel 1.15 with the Annotat.]
\p
\v 3 . For the day is near; yea the day of the Lord is near; a cloudy day; [Heb. day of cloud. See Joel 2.2 with the Annotat] it shall be the time of the heathen. [That is, the time that is appointed for their unisshment. Or, the time wherein the heathen shall destroy Egypt. Compare above chap. 22.3. With the Annotat.]
\p
\v 4 . And the sword shall enter into Egypt, and there shall be great pain in Ethiopia, [They shall be in such a strait by reason of all kind of misery, as a woman that is in travel. So verse 9. Of Ethiopia see above chapter 29.10. and below verse 5,9. Heb. casch] when the slain shall fall [Heb. the salin shall, c in the singular number] in Egypt: for they [The Chaldeans] shall take away her multitude, [Meaning the plenty, or the multitude of Egypt, as above chap. 29.19 and below verse 10.] and her foundation shall be broken down.
\p
\v 5 . Ethiopia, and put and land, [as above chap. 27.10. That id, the Ethiopians, Puteans and Lydians] and all the mingled heap, [see Jerem. 25 on verse 20.] and club, [This is, held to be a country in Lydia lying near Egypt] and the children of the land of the covenant, that is, the other confederates of the Egyptians, or a certain neighbouring people, that were in a strait strict and fellowship with the Egyptian, some understand the Jews, that had formerly inhabited the land of Canaan, which was given them by God’s covenant, and fled into Egypt and it may be had served the king of Egypt in his war against his enemy. See Jeremiah 43.17 and 44.27. And compare the phrase children of the land, with Job 1.3 and chapter 16.28 and see the Annotat. There] shall fall with them [The Egyptians] by the sword.
\p
\v 6 Thou saith the LORD, yea shall fall that support Egypt; [That is, all her helpers, as verse 8] and the pride [Or brightness, pomp, highness; also Excellency, eminency. So below verse 18.] of her [Egypt’s]power shall come down: from the tower of schene [see above chapter 29 on verse 10] shall they fall in it [in Egypt] by the sword saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 7 . And they shall desolate in the midst of a desolate countreyes: [See above chap. 29.12] and their cities shall be in the midst of desolate cities.
\p
\v 8 . And they shall know that I am LORD, when I shall have laid a fire in Egypt [to wit, a fire of war, miseries and plagues, (see above chap. 28 on verse 18. and Job 15 on verse 24. Jerem. 49.27. Amos 1.4,c.) Whereby Egypt shall be consumed. So below verse 14.16] and all her helpers shall be broken in pieces.
\p
\v 9 . In that day shall there messengers go forth from before my face in ships, to make careless Ethiopia. [Heb. Casch of security, or confidence; to wit, that secure and careless Ethiopia, that is, the Ethiopians] afraid: [That is, I will order the matter so as that the news of the chaldeans in rode or falling into Egypt shall be carried over into Ethiopia. God speaketh here as a judge sitting upon his judgement-seat in Egypt, and governing this whole business [and there shall be great pain among them, [to wit, among the Ethiopians; as above verse 4.] as in the day of Egypt; [as there was in Egypt, when it was destroyed, as above verse 4. or (as some) when God smote the first born in Egypt, Exodus 12.29, 30.] for lo, it cometh. [That is, it shall certainly come. Or, it (the aforesaid pain) shall come upon them]
\p
\v 10 . Thus saith the Lord LORD; yea I will make the multitude [Or, noise and stir. See above chapter 29 on verse 19 and here verse 4] of Egypt of cease, by the hand [that is, by the power, or ministry] of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babel.
\p
\v 11 . He and his people with him, the most tyrannical of the heathen, [as above chapter 28.7.] shall be brought [By my secret providence. See above chap. 29.19, 20.] To destroy the land: and (they) shall draw out [Heb. Empty, or make, or vain: as above chap. 28.7.] their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.
\p
\v 12 . And I will make the rivers [see above chapter 29 on verse 3] drinks and sell the land into the hand of the wicked: [that is, deliver, or give into their hand and power, as ware that is sold is delivered into the hand power of the buyer. See above chapter 29.19 and Psalms 44.13. of the wicked; of the Chaldeans, who were indeed in this matter as God’s ministers and executioners of his judgements, but were of themselves wiced and intended nothing else, but to satisfie their own lusts, by doing mischief, and by violence and oppression; whole wickedness God made use offer to execute his holy and unblameable judgements upon the Egyptians . Compare above chapter 29 on verse 20 and see 2 Sam 12 on verse 12] and I will make the land waste the fullness thereof, [The gifts, wherewith God had endued, enriched and adorned Egypt. Compare Psalms 24.1.] by the hand of strangers; I the LORD have spoken it.
\p
\v 13 . Thus saith the Lord LORD; I will also destroy the dung-Gods, see Levi. 26 on verse 30.] and cause the idols of nought [heb. Elilim; that is, meer nothing. See Levit. 19 on verse 4.] To cease out of Noph: [See Isa. 19.13. Jerm. 44 on verse 1. and below ver. 16.] And there shall be no more a prince out of the land of Egypt, and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 14 . And I will make Pathrons [see Genesis 10 on verse 14. Jer. 44.1 & above chap. 29.14.] Desolate, lay a fire in Zoan, [See Numb. 13 on verse 22. Psalms 78 on verse 12.] and I will exercise judgement in No. [See Jer. 46 on verse 25]
\p
\v 15 . And I will pore out my fury [See Job 18. on verse 21. Psalms 79 on verse 6.] Upon sin, [some hold this to be Pelusium, in the uttermost borders of Egypt, agreeing with the names of the wilderness of sin, and of mount Sinai] the strength of Egypt, and I will cut off the multitude of No. [Compare Jeremiah 46.25.]
\p
\v 16 . And I will lay a fire in Egypt; Sin shall have very great pain, [Heb. As if one should say, shall suffering pain suffer pain] and No shall be split, [Heb. shall be to be split] and Noph shall be daily sore distressed. [Heb. (shall be) daily, or by day, in the day-time distress,. Others, by daily distressers.]
\p
\v 17 . The young men of Even. [That is, held to be on, which some conceive to be Heliopolis, that is, the city of the sun, see Gen. 41.45.] And Pi-Besseth [that is held to be Bubastic or Bubastus, where the Idol Diana was worshipped] shall fall by the sword, and the (daughters) [this word is here inserted from the opposition. Heb. They. Others, these (cities) shall c. that is, the inhabitants of these cities, or the dependent adjoining cities and villages, as in the next verse] shall go into captivity.
\p
\v 18 . And at Tachpanhes [Heb. Here Thechappannes. See Jerem. 2.16 And 43.7,8. With the Annotat.] The day shall be darkened, [or withheld, hindered] when I shall break there the yoke of Egypt [or axletrees, cords, wherewith or whereunto the yoke is made saft: understand the burden of bondage which they laid up on other nations and see Jerem. 27 on verse 2.] and the pride of her power [as above ver. 6.] Shall cease in her: [Tachphanhes] a cloud shall cover her, [see above verse 3.] and her daughters [as ver. 17. others understand the dependant cities and villages; that is, the inhabitants thereof. See 2 Kings 19 on verse 21.] Shall go into captivity.
\p
\v 19 . Thus will I exercise judgement in Egypt: and they shall know that I am LORD.
\p
\v 20 . Also it came to pass [others, It was come to pass] in the eleventh year, After Jojachians carrying away. See above chap. 1.2 and below chap. 33.21. hence is gathered, that in the writing and joining together of these prophesies there is not followed the order of time, but the connexion and likeness of the things that are treated of. Compare above chap. 29.17. And Jerem. 35 on verse 1.] In the first (moneth), on the seventh (day) of the moneth, (that) the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:
\p
\v 21 . Child of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh King of Egypt; [that is, I have made him weak and impotent, by the discomfiture of Pharao-Necho by Charchemis, Jeremiah 46.2, c. (of which overthrow some understanding this) after which the kings of Egypt were not able to effect any matter of weight or concernment. Compare the following figurative words with Jerem. 46.11. others understand it of Pharaoh Hopiah, & his overthrow by the Cyrenians] and to it [Pharaoh’s arm] shall not be bound up, by laying plaifters upon (it), by putting a roller upon (it), to bind it up, to make it strong, that is, may hold the sword.
\p
\v 22 . Therefore thus saith the Lord LORD, behold I (will be) upon Pharaoh [see above chap. 29.3.] the kings of Egypt, and will break his arms, (both) the strong one and the broken one: [that is, all his strength, as well that which is left as that which is already decayed] and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.
\p
\v 23 . And I will scatter the Egyptians among the heathen: and I will disperse them in the land [as above chap. 29.12 and below ver. 26.]
\p
\v 24 . And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babel, and give my sword into his hand; [as above chap. 12.9 and here in the next verse, and below chap. 32.10. see Jerem. 47. on verse 6.] But I will break Pharaoh’s arms (so) that he shall lament before his face [or shall sigh, howl, grone before the face of the king of Babel. See of the Hebrew word Job 24 on verse 12.] As a deadly wounded man lamenteth. [Heb. shall wail the wailing, or sighness of a deadly wounded man. Compare above chap. 26.15.]
\p
\v 25 . Yea I will strengthen the arms of the King of Babel, but the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down: [All his strength and courage shall fail him] and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall have given my sword into the hand of the king of Babel, and he shall have stretched it out upon the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 26 . And I will scatter the Egyptians among the heathen, and will disperse them in the lands: thus shall they know that I am the LORD.
\c 31
\s The time of this prophesy, ver. 1 wherein God presenteth before the eyes of King Pharaoh and his people, the eminency, glory, and pride of the king and kingdom of Assyria, under the parable of an high fair Cedar-tree, 2, 3, c and their ruine because of their pride and haughtiness, 10, 11, c. for an example to all others, 14 and that it shall fare just so with Pharaoh and his people, 10, 18.
\p
\v 1 Also it came to pass in the eleventh year, [after the transportation of Jojachin. See above chap. 1.2, c. in the third (moneth), on the first (day) of the moneth (that) the word of the Lord came unto me, saying:
\p
\v 2 . Child of man, say unto Pharaoh the King of Egypt, and his multitude, [that is, all his people] whom thou art thou like in thy greatness? [As if God should say; dost thou imagine that there was never any one like unto thee, and that therefore nothing can hurt thee? Take notice of the great and mighty monach of Assyria, and see what became of him, and look thou to fare alike, as followeth compare Isa. 29.13.]
\p
\v 3 . Behold Assur [The King of Assyria] wasa Cedar [That is, was like unto a Cedar-tree] on Libanon, fair in branches, shadowy in leaf, [or shadowing, making a shadowing forest, or wood, as the Hebrew word hath the signification of forest and sprigs, branches, or leaf] and high of flock, [chap. 17.6.] and his top was between the close broughs. [by this whole figurative speech is signified the greatness, glory, and power of the Assyrian Monarchy. See Judge. 9 on verse 15. And compared Sal. 80.9. above chap. 17.3,22,23. Dan. 4.10, c.]
\p
\v 4 . The waters made him great, [that is, the situation and affluence that I afforded him of all things that might serve to increase his estate. Compare chap. 17.5,8 and 19.10, c. and below verse 9.] The deep [that is, deep waters great depths] made him high: the same [deep, or depth] went with her fire arms round about his planting, [As above chap. 17.7.] and sent out her conducts unto all the trees of the field. [That is, he communicated of his abundance and superfluity to other kings that were less then he, and prospered by his means.
\p
\v 5 . Therefore his flock came higher then all the trees of the field: and his boughs became manifold, and his branches long, because of the great waters, [see verse 4] when he shot forth. [cast forth his branches, and spread himself abroad. Compare above chap. 17.6 or, when he budden forth: or got buds, or blossoms].
\p
\v 6 All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and all the beasts of the field brought forth their young under his shadow: [Heb. All fowls made their nests, and so all beasts did cast their young, or brought forth their young: that is, all manner of, or many nations were under his command and dominion. So Dan. 4.12.] And all great nations sate under his shadow. [Defense or protection, addressing themselves unto him. Psalms 9.1. So below verse 17.]
\p
\v 7 . Thus was he fair in his greatness, (and) in the length of his branches: because his root was by great waters.
\p
\v 8 . The Cedars in the garden of God did not darken him [that is, other kings or princes, though they were also great and glorious like the cedars of a paradise as the first was, could not darken or hide his luster or brightness: as the fun darkeneth the shining of the other stars in the day-time, so did he darken all the luster and darkness of other kings and princes. Compare above chapter 28.13 and below verse 9.16.] The fir-trees were not like hi boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his branches: no tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty. [Heb. Every tree was not, c that is, no tree was, &c. see 1 kings 11 on verse 34. So below verse 14.]
\p
\v 9 . I had made him (so) fair by the multitude of his branches, that all the trees of Eden that were in the garden of God, envied him.
\p
\v 10 . Therefore thus saith the Lord LORD; thou hast exalted thy self for (thy) stock: [Compare verse 14. this may be taken for a speech directed to the Assyrian, of whom God immediately (as elsewhere) speaketh again I the third person: or as an abrupt speech unto Pharaoh, the consummation whereof followeth below verse 18. as if God should say, because thou should exalteth thy self. See now (I pray) what the Assyrian also did, and how I punished him for it, c.] Yea he did put up [Heb. Gave. Compare (concerning the use of the Hebrew word, which according to the nature and quality of things admitteth of various significations) 2 Sam. 18. On verse 9 and above chap. 27.12, &c. so verse 14.] His top above the midst of the close boughs, [Heb. As if one should say the betweenness, c. that is, he excelled among and exalted himself above other Kings, Lords, Princes. C. Compare above chap. 19.11. And his heart was lifted up because of his height:
\p
\v 11 . Therefore I delivered him into the hand of the mightiest of the heathen: [inot power of the king of Babel, Berosach, or Merodach-Baladam, and also Nebuchadnezzar, who transferred the Assyrian Monarchy (whereof Esar-baddon, the son of Sennacherib, is held to have been the last king. See 2 Kings 19 on verse 37 and of that Berodach, 2 Kings 20 on verse 12) to the Babylonians] (that) he may handle him exactly: [Heb. Doing he may do it to him, dealing deal with him, or did, or did, dealt he with him, as some. Some understand this phrase thus, according to his pleasure according as he ought to be dealt with] I drave him out for his wickedness.
\p
\v 12 . And strangers the most tyrannical of the heathen [as above chap. 28.7.] cut him off, and left him: [here followeth a figurative description of the ruine of the Assyrian Monarchy] his branches fell upon the mountains in the valleys [as in great overthrows all places, both mountain and valleys are wont to be full of slain men and plunder] and his grafts were broken by all the streams of the land, [or of the earth] and all the nations of the earth went down from his shadow, and left him.
\p
\v 13 . All ye fowls of the heaven dwell upon his flock that is fallen down, [Or fallen flock. Heb. Fall; that is; other nations took his kingdome, possessed it, and laughed him to scorn] and all the beasts of his field were upon his branches. [Heb. Every fowl, every beast, c. as above verse 10.]
\p
\v 14 . That no trees by the waters may exalt themselves for their stock, [Heb. All the trees of the water or of the waters may not, c. compare above verse 8. And so in the sequel] neither put their top above the midst of the close boughs, [as above verse 10.] neither any (trees) that drink water, [that is, those that are filled with all plenty by my blessing and suffer no want. So verse 16. Compare above on verse 4.8.] May stand upon themselves because of their height: [this phrase is also usual in our language, for trusting in oneself, or lifting up the hand high; the contrary whereof is to walk humbly before God. Compare the phrase below chapter 33.26. The meaning is that God would make this great Monarchy and example of his judice. That it might be a warning unto all great and mighty men on earth, and here especially unto Pharaoh, to the end that no man might lift up himself against him, and be wicked, left by like sins he falls into like plagues, which he shall not be able to avoid by any humane power] for they are all delivered unto death, to the lowermost (parts) of the earth, [Heb. The lowermost earth; or the earth that is beneath. So verse 16.18.] In the midst of the children of men [that is, among the common, or meaner sort of people. See Psalms 4 on verse 3] to them tat go down into the pit.
\p
\v 15 . Thus saith the Lord LORD, in the day when he went down to hell, [see of the Hebrew word Sheol, Gen. 37 on verse 35. so ver 16.17,18 and below chap. 32.21,22 ad the sequel there. By comparing of which places, (as also of the former verse) it appeareth that it is here taken for the grave, with the adhering miserable and reproachful condition of the deceased wicked ones in hell] I caused a mourning, I covered the deep for him, [that is, I put it in such a condition that it was as if it mourned. (So below wrapped about) see 2 Sam. 15 on verse 30. See of the word deep, above verse 4.] And restrained the floods thereof, [I withheld my temporal blessing] and the great waters were stayed: and I made the Libanon black for him, [as if all the Cedars (that is, great ones) were in morning. See Psalms 35 on verse 14. And all the trees of the field were wrapped about for him [that is, a figurative description of the common terrour which God by this judgement of his upon the Assyrian, caused among all great ones, and the nations that had prospered (as above) by his riches. Compare above chapter 27.29. And the following verses there]
\p
\v 16 . I made the heathen to tremble at the sound of his fall, when I caused him to go down to hell with them that go down into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, [See above verse 8,9.] the choice and the best of Libanon, all (the trees) that drink water, [as above verse 14 comforted themselves in the lowermost (parts) of the earth. [It is spoken figuratively, as if one should say; it was a comfort to them, that they had such great companion with them in their suffering. Compare Isa. 14.8,9,10. With the Annotat. Also above chap. 14.22 and 16.54 and chap32.31, c.]
\p
\v 17 . They also went down into hell with him, unto them that are slain by the sword: and they that had been his arm, [that is, strength; that had hardened and upheld him] (that) had sat under his shadow [as above verse 6] in the midst of the heathen. [Or thus; with his arm (that is, his kingdome) under whose shadow they, c.]
\p
\v 18 . to whom art thou thus like in glory and gladness, among the trees of Eden? [Thou O Pharaoh that thinketh that there is none like unto thee. See above verse 2.] yea thou shalt be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the lowermost (parts) of the earth; thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, [see above chapter 28.on verse 10.] with them that are slain by the sword: that is Pharaoh, {as if God should say, behold here a lively picture and pattern of this proud king pharaoh: just so firm and sure is his condition, as this Assyrians was, and so shall he with all his pomp and pride] and all his multitude. [Understand this either of the riches or people, or with all his stir, rumour, or noise, see above chap. 29.19.]
\c 32
\s The time of these prophesies, verse 1,17, containing a lamentation for terrible fall by reason of his pride, cruelty, continual unquiet stirring and molesting of other people, 2 Also a rhetorical description of his and his ruine and descent unto the company of other uncircumcised, proud and tyrannical rulers and nations, 18.
\p
\v 1 Also it came to pass in the twelveth year, [after the carrying away of Jojachin, above chap. 1.2.] in the twelveth moneth, on the first (day) of the moneth; (that) the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:
\p
\v 2 . Child of man, take up a lamentation, [as below verse 16] for Pharaoh King of Egypt, and say unto him; thou wast like a young lion, [before thy power was dimished. See above chap. 30 on verse 21.] Among the heathen, or nations; that is thou wast among, or towards them like a young lion, fierce and cruel. Compare above chap. 19.2, &c.] and thou wast as a sea-dragon in the seas, [as above chapter 29.3. that is, thou wast cruel, dreadful, stirring, both by land and by water] and braketh forth in [Or, with] thy rivers, [thou didst put thy self forward and didst glory in thy kingdom, as being mighty and rich by reason of the commodious situation of waters] and troubledth the water with thy feet, [Or, trampledst upon the water; to wit, of other nations; that is, their land and trading: thou didst every truth in thy self and didst trouble other nations, stirring them up to rebellion, and hardening them in it] and muddiest their rivers.
\p
\v 3 . Thus saith the Lord LORD; I will therefore spread out my net over thee, [see above chapter 12, 13 and 17.22. Hos. 7.12. With the Annotat.] by a congregation of many nations: [that shall be in the army of the Babylonians] they shall draw thee up in my net. [Or, with my net that I have spread out over thee for to catch thee]
\p
\v 4 . Then will I leave thee upon the land, compare above chapter 29.5 with the Annotat.] I will cause all the fowls of the heaven to dwell upon thee, (I will) satisfie the beasts of the whole earth with thee. [Compare below chap. 39.17, c]
\p
\v 5 . And I will give away the flesh upon the mountains and fill the valleys with thy height. [This may be understood of Pharaoh himself, and his pride, compared with the great body of a sea-dragon, verse 2. Or, (as others) his slain multitude, wherein he formerly placed his eminency].
\p
\v 6 . And I will water [or, give to drink] with thy blood [The blood of thine own self, and of thy people that are slain] the land wherein thou swimmest, that is, dost now domineer with thy government, like a sea-dragon in the sea] (even) to the mountains: and the streams shall be filled be filled with thee.
\p
\v 7 . And when I shall put thee, [As a candle, lamp or fire or fire out. Compare Job 18. verse 5,6. With the Annotat. 2 Sam 14.7. and 21.17.] I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof black: I will cover the sun with cloud, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine. [That is, I will by this judgement of mine fill the world with terrour, and clothe the whole universe as it were in mourning. Compare Isa. 13.10. Joel 2.30,31. And above chap. 31.5. Also Genesis 15.12. With the Annotat.]
\p
\v 8 . All the shinning lights [Heb. Light of light] in the heaven, them will make black thy fake: and will make [Or, bring. Heb. Give, set] darkness upon thy land, saith the LORD.
\p
\v 9 . Moreover, I will trouble [or, grieve, vex] the heart of many nations: [By the tidings of the fall of this great king, and on the contrary, of the exaltation and greatness of the Babylonian. The Hebrew word (otherwise signifying anger) is also taken for grief, trouble, sorrow, vexation, Psalms 6.8. And 10.14 and 31.10. Eclas. 7.3. Jeremiah 7.19.] when I shall bring thy breaking [see Jerem. 4 on verse 6. That is here, the news of thy ruine] among the heathen, into the lands which thou hast not known.
\p
\v 10 . And I will make many nations to be amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, the hairs of their kings shall stand an end at thee, [as above chap. 27.35.] when I shall shake [or brandith] my sword [as above chap. 30.24.] before their faces: [smiting and felling thee down by my sword as it were before their eyes, which will cause greater fear and terror unto them, as followeth] and they shall tremble every moment, [Heb. Tremble in moments] every one for his (own) soul, [that is, life, or person, for himself; fearing that it will cost them their lives. See Genes. 19 on verse 17. ad 12 on verse 5.] in the day of thy fall.
\p
\v 11 . For thus saith the Lord LORD; the sword of the king of Babel shall come upon thee.
\p
\v 12 . I will throw (down) thy multitude [Compare above chap. 29.19.] by the sword of the champion, which are all of them together the most tyrannical of the heathen: [As above chap. 28.7.] they shall destroy the pride [or, pomp, glory, Excellency, as above often] of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be rooted out.
\p
\v 13 . And I will destroy all the beasts [Heb. Beast, or great cattel] from besides the great waters: [so that none shall go and feed any more by the great waters] and no foot of man shall trouble [Compare above chap. 29.11.] them [the waters: compare above verse 2] any more, neither shall any hoofs of beasts trouble them.
\p
\v 14 . Then will I cause their waters [The waters of the other nations that were troubled by Pharaoh, above verse 2.] to sink, and I will cause their river to run like oyl, [that is, I will quiet the tumults, and bring the land to rest, when I shall have cut off this troubler of waters; as the waters are calmed and run softly and clearly when the tempest is over and troubled filth is funk down. Compare below chap. 34.18.] saith the Lord Lord.
\p
\v 15 . When I shall have made the land of Egypt a desolation, and the land shall become desolate of her fullness, [that is, shall be bereaved of all that wherewith it was formerly filled and adorned by God. Compare above chap. 19.7.] When I shall have smitten all them that dwell therein: so shall they know that I am the LORD.
\p
\v 16 . That is the lamentation, [Related in the former part of the chapter. See above verse 2.] and that shall thy sing lamentably [the word sing is intended in the thing it self: see 2 Coron 35.25. as the foregoing Hebrew word also signifieth a, lamentation, from whence the Lamentations of Jeremia bear the name [the daughters of the heathen shall sing it lamentably: [as the women in the those times were wont to sing songs of triumph and lamentations. See Jeremi. 9. on verse 17. They shall sing it lamentably, for Egypt and for all her multitude, saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 17 . Moreover, it came to pass in the twelfth year, [see above verse 1] on the fifteenth (day) of the moneth, [meaning of the same twelfth moneth; as is expressed verse 1.] (that) the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:
\p
\v 18 . Child of man, lament for the multitude of Egypt, and cause her to descend, [that is, prophefie, tell her to descend, into the grave, &c. as followeth. See Jerem. 1 on verse 10 and Ezek. 3 on verse 8. some understand it, as if God should have said, conduct her to the grave, follow her as men do a corps, with mourning and lamenting, for a token that she shall surely go down to the pit] (her) and the daughters of the stately heathen) [see of the Hebrew word rendered here stately, Psalms 8 on verse 2] into the lowermost places of the earth, [Heb. The earth: or, the land of barrenness. Compare above chapter 26.19. And 31.14. Lament. 3.55. So below verse 24.] With them that are gone down into the pit.
\p
\v 19 . Above whom art thou in comeliness? [That is, whom dost thou excel in comeliness or grace? The meaning is, dost thou think that thou art fairer and comelier then all other kings that I should have more cause favour thee then I have done them? As if he should say, no: thou must go down to the pit as well as they] go down, and lay thy self [Heb. properly be laid down or lying] with the uncircumcised. [see above chap. 28 on verse 10 and 31. on verse 15 and so in the sequel.]
\p
\v 20 . They [To wit, the Egyptians] shall fall [or lie] in midst of them that are slain by the sword: she [to wit, Egypt] is delivered to the sword; [others, the sword is ordained, or appointed, or appointed; to wit, to smite he. Compare above c. 30.24, 25.] Draw her along [other, they shall draw, drag her; to wit, down into the grave, and consequently to the place of place of the wicked that are deceased] with all her multitude.
\p
\v 21 . The mightiest of the champions [Other kings and potentates that were dead before, and gone into the same place] shall seek to him, with his helpers, out of the midst of hell: [as it were welcoming him and his people and comforting themselves by coming and company, as is said below of Pharaoh, verse 31. a figurative kind of mucking. Compare Isa. 14.9.] They are gone down, the uncircumcised slain] slain by the sword.
\p
\v 22 . Assur [Meaning Assyria; that is, the Assyrians and principally the king. See above chapter 31.3, &c.] There is with all company her [his king of Assyrias] graves are round about him: they are all slain, fallen by the sword.
\p
\v 23 . Whose graves are set in set in the sides of the pit, and her company is round about her grave: they are all slain, fallen by the sword, which caused terrour [by their insolence, power, violence, and oppression. So in the sequel, and above chapter 26.17.] In the land of the living. [That is, here upon the earth, I this life. See Job 28 on verse 13 and Psalms 27 on verse 13. So in the sequel]
\p
\v 24 . There is Elam [Meaning Persia and Media, or a particular countrey therein. (see Genesis 10 on verse 22 and 14 on verse 1) and principally the king thereof] with all her multitude, round about her grave: they [the Elamites] are all slain, the fallen ones by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised unto the lowermost parts of the earth: [as above verse 18] which had given their terrour in the land of the living: now they bear their shame with them that went down into the pit.
\p
\v 25 . They have set her [namely Elam] a bed in the midst of the slain, among all her multitude: her graves are round about him; [The king of the Elamites] they are all uncircumcised, slain by the sword because terrour is given by them [Heb. Their terrour is, or was given by them] in the land of the living; now they bear their shame with them that are gone down into the pit. He [the Elamite, or the kings of the Elamites] is laid [Heb. Given] in the midst of the slain.
\p
\v 26 . There is Mesch, and Tubal, [see Genesis 10 on verse 2.] with all her multitude; her graves are proud about him: [the king of those countreys] they are all uncircumcised, slain by the sword, because they have given their terrour in the land of the living.
\p
\v 27 . But they lie not with the champions, [Which having been righteous, were honourably and stately buried. On the contrary, those were slain ignominiously and dragged away. Others, should not they (the Egyptians) lye by the champions, &c. surely yea, for why should they fare better then such champions that are gone down to the pit?] that are fallen among the uncircumcised: which are gone down to hell [that is, to the grave with their weapons, as followeth: but further, according to the soul, to the place of the damned] with their weapons of war, [in token of their valour: as is also usual even at this day in the burying of valiant souldiers] they whose swords men have laid under their heads; [Heb. They have laid, &c. as often; that is. Whole swords, according to the costumes of the times and countreys, were buried under their heads after they were dead, as a badge and token of their valour] whose iniquity [that is, the punishment of their iniquity. See Levit. 5 on verse 10 and above chapter 18 on verse 20] withstanding is upon their bones, because the terrour of the champions was in the land of the living. [those whom none durst touch in their life-time, because of their power and dreadfulness, they must in and after their death bear the punishment of their iniquity, putrifying in their bodies, and in their souls suffering with other uncircumcised and ungodly ones.]
\p
\v 28 . Thou [Thou king Pharaoh] also shall be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised and shall lie with them that are slain with the sword.
\p
\v 29 . There is Edom, [Idumea] her kings and all her prince, which with their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword: those lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that are gone down into the pit.
\p
\v 30 . There are the mighty men [Or, Deputies, Lievtenants, noble, princes. See Joel 13.21. Heb. Properly, poured upon, or anointed] of the north, [Or Syria, and thereabout, as Tyrians and Zidonians. See above chapter 28.21] which are gone down into the being ashamed because of their terrour, [which they shall caused unto others] (which proceede) from their power, [Or because of their power, because they were not able to save themselves by it] and they lie uncircumcised by them that are slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that are gone down into the pit.
\p
\v 31 . Pharaoh shall see them, [compare above verse 21.] and comfort himself over all his multitude; [as having companions with him in his misery and shame. See above chapter 31.16] they that are slain by the sword of Pharaoh, and all his army, saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 32 . For I have (also) given my terrour in the land the living: therefore shall he be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised by them that are slain by the sword; Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord LORD. [as if the Lord should say: it will be once my time also, that I should terrifie the world by my judgements, then will I assuredly execute my terrible judgements upon Pharaoh and his people. Others, when I shall cause my terrour, &c, then shall he, c.]
\c 33
\s By the parable of the faithful watchmen in the land, God sheweth the Prophet his duty, and the duty of all faithfull teachers, verse 1, c. he sheweth the murmurers and hypocrites among the captivity Jews, that he dealeth well and justly with penitents and backsliders and defendeth the justice of his way’s against their calumns, 10. The prophet’s tiding concerning the taking and destruction of the city of Jerusalem and prophesieth what shall become of those that I left in the land, 21. God’s judgement upon the hypocritical flatterers and mockers of the prophet, 30.
\p
\v 1 And the word of the lord came unto me saying:
\p
\v 2 . Child of man, speak unto the children of thy people, [see above chapter 3 on verse 11] and say unto them: when I bring the sword [that is, in my just judgement send war, hostile invasion, with all the consequents or concomitants thereof] upon any land; [Heb. A land, when I shall bring the sword upon, against, or, into it] and the people of the land take man out of their ends, [that is, plainly as much as out of or from among them; or out of their frontiers, uttermost borders, where the watchmen are commonly set, to heed all comings or approaches of the enemy. See the diverse use of this phrase Gens. 47.2. Judg. 18.2. 1 Kings 12.31. Also Genesis 19.4. Isaiah 56.11. With the Annotat.] And set him for a watchman for them:
\p
\v 3 . And he seeth the sword come [Heb. coming] upon the land, and bloweth with the trumpet and warneth the people:
\p
\v 4 . And one that beareth the sound of the trumpet, heareth (indeed), but taketh no warning; and the sword cometh, and taketh him away: his blood is upon his (own) head. [That is, he is the cause of his own destruction; or is guilty of his own destruction. Compare Lev. 20.9. With the Annotat and so in the sequel]
\p
\v 5 . He heard the sound of the trumpet, but took no warning, his blood is upon him; but he that taketh warning, saveth his soul. [That is, life, or person, himself. See Genesis 12.5 and 19.17 with the Annotat.]
\p
\v 6 . On the contrary, when the watchman seeth the sword come, and bloweth not will the trumpet, so that the people is not warned; and the sword cometh, and taketh away a soul [That is, a person or some one, as above] from among them: he is (indeed) taken away in his iniquity, but his blood will I require all the watchman’s hand. [As above chapter 3.18. I indeed by my secret providence have justly sent this punishment upon him; but that shall not excuse this unfaithful watchman]
\p
\v 7 . Now thou, o child man, I have set thee for a watchman over the house of Israel: therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. Compare this place with above chapter 3.17, c. and see the Annotat, there]
\p
\v 8 . When I say unto the wicked, o wicked man, thou shalt die the death, and thou speak not, to warn the wicked from his way: that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require [or, seek] at thine hand.
\p
\v 9 . But when thou warneth the wicked from his way, that he might turn from it, and he turneth not from his way: then shall he die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul.
\p
\v 10 . Therefore, thou child of man, say unto the house of Israel; thus ye speak, saying, seeing our transgressions and our sins are upon us, [That is, we bear the punishment thereof. Compare above chap. 32.27. And see Levit. 5 on verse 1] and we languish in them, [According to Gods threatnings. Compare above chapter 24.23. See there] how should we then live? [As thou dist promise us we shall: but (as if they should say) we find the contrary indeed. This they murmured at the plagues of God, without minding their repentance and upon condition whereof promises of life were made]
\p
\v 11 . Say unto them, (as true as) I live, saith the Lord LORD, if I have pleasure in the death of the wicked! [An abrupt kind of speech usual in oaths. See Numb. 14. On verse 23. As ye conceive and complain, that I take delight in killing you, though ye should turn from your wickedness; as if it were all one to me, whether ye did repent, or not; ye behave your selves, whether well, or ill, ye are sure notwithstanding to suffer; as wicked murmurets and hypocrites are wont to speak. Compare above chapter 18.23. With the Annotat.] But therein (have I pleasure) that the wicked turn from his way, and live: Turn ye turn ye from your evil ways, [as if God should say, that is the thing therein ye are wanting, that ye all continue in your wickedness, and yet murmur against my plagues, whereas ye ought to repent and turn from your sins] for why should ye die, o house of Israel? [As if he should say, how is it that ye continue so sottish, as that ye bring your own destruction upon your selves by your impenitency? If ye will go on as ye have begun nothing else can betide you, but that you must needs dye and perish in your perversness; think upon this seriously, for your own good.]
\p
\v 12 . Thou then, o child of man, say unto the children thy people, the righteousness of the righteous [see above chapter 3.20 and 18.24. with Annotat.] shall not deliver him [the aforesaid righteous man that is onely so in name and in account, but not in deed and in truth] in the day of his transgression; [or, of his backsliding] and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall [that is, perish through my judgements, whereof here is properly spoken. See Genesis 14 on verse 10] for it in the day when he turneth from his wickedness: neither shall the righteous be able to live by that (his righteousness) [mentioned verse 12] in the day when he sinneth]
\p
\v 13 . When I say unto the righteous, that he shall surely live [Heb. Living live; [Upon condition of sincerity and perseverance unto the end] and he trusteth in his own righteousness, and committeth iniquity; then all his righteousness shall not be remembred, but in his iniquity that he committeth shall he die.
\p
\v 14 . Also when I say unto the wicked, thou shalt dye the death: [Heb. Dying die, if thou repent not] and be turneth from his sin, and doth judgement and justice:
\p
\v 15 . The wicked restoreth the pledge, [as above chapter 18.7. [He payeth that he had robbed, [see Exodus 22.4. Leviticus 6.1, 4. Num. 5.6, 7.] He walketh in the statutes of life, so that he committeth no iniquity; he shall surely, [Heb. Living live. So in the next verse] he shall not die.
\p
\v 16 . All his sins that he hath sinned shall not be remembered unto him: [see Psalms 79 on verse 8] he hath done judgement and justice, he shall surely live.
\p
\v 17 . Ye the children of thy people say, the way of the LORD is not equal: whereas indeed their own way in not right. [Compare above chapter 18.25, 29. with the Annotat.]
\p
\v 18 . When the right turneth away from his righteous, and doth iniquity; then he shall die in it.
\p
\v 19 . And when the wicked turneth from his wickedness, and doth judgement and justice; then he shall live in it.
\p
\v 20 . Yet ye say the way of the LORD is not right: I will judge you one according to his wates, O house of Israel. [This is a short and pithy divine conclusion of this whole dispute between God and his impenitent murmuring people]
\p
\v 21 . And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captive away, [with Jojachin, or Jechonia. Compare above chapter 1.2. And 24.1 and below chapter 40.1. Jeremiah 29.10 with the Annotat.] in the tenth (month) [in the Ecclasiastical year called Tebath, answering to our December and January: after that Jerusalem was conquered by the King of Babel, on the ninth day of the fourth moneth of the former year, in the nineteenth year of his reign, and his chief captain Nebuzaradan had entered into it on the seventh day of the fifth moneth, 2 Kings 25.3,8. Jermiah 39.2.] on the fifth (day) of the moneth (that) one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, [according to God’s prediction, above chapter 24.26.] saying, the city is smitten. [Jerusalem is taken and destroyed and many of the inhabitants are slain. So 1 Sam. 30.1. 2 Sam 15.14. 2 Kings 9.13. 1 Chron. 20.1. And below chap. 40.1. compare Jeremiah 43.11 and 46.13. And 47.1, c.]
\p
\v 22 . Now the hand of the LORD had been upon me [see above chapter 1 on verse 3. in the evening before that escaped one came, and had opened my mouth until he [the foresaid messenger, or bringer of tidings] came to me in the morning: for my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb. [As was also foretold by God, above chapter 24.26. Compare chapter 3.26. With the Annotat.]
\p
\v 23 . Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:
\p
\v 24 . Child of man, the inhabitants of those wast places in the land of Israel [To wit, the inhabitants left in desolate Canaan, after Jerusalem was destroyed, the greatest part of the people carried away captive, & the land laid waste by the Babylonians] speak, saying; Abraham was but a single (man), possessed this land hereditary: but we are many; the land is given to us for an hereditary possession. [as if they had said, God did not promise this land unto Abraham for himself alone, for he had no need of such a great land as this is, neither did he ever inhabit it wholly himself, but for his children and posterity, which we are: (Compare Isaiah 51.2. Job 8.33, c) and though we be now fewer in number then formerly, yet we were the right heirs, and shall indeed continue in it. So obstinate were these men, though saw the punishment hand God before their eyes]
\p
\v 25 . Therefore, say unto them; thus saith the Lord LORD: ye eat (flesh) with the blood, [Contrary to the law, Genesis 9.4. Leviticus 7.26 and 13.10 and 19.26. Deuteronomy 12.16. Or should ye, c? Or because ye eat blood: and so in the following words] and lift up your eyes unto the dung-gods, [see above chap.18.6.] and shed blood: and should ye possess the land hereditary? [as if God should say, by no means: I have promised you the land upon condition of obedience, but your disobedience is manifest, as the foregoing and following words do shew]
\p
\v 26 . Ye stand [Or, have stood] upon your sword, [that is, ye trust in your valour and skill in war, thinking thereby to abide in the land for ever: or you are ready with your swords, as those that intend to offer violence to their neighbour. Compare the phrase with the above chapter 31.14.] Ye commit abomination and defile [by unchastely and adultery] everyone has neighbour’s wife: and should ye possess the land hereditary?
\p
\v 27 . Thus shalt thou say unto them, thus saith the Lord LORD: (as true as) I live, if they that are in the wast places shall not fall, by the sword, [a kind of oath, as above verse 11.] and (if) I deliver (not) him that win the open field. [Heb. Face of the field] to the wild beasts, to devour him and (if) they that are in the forts and in the caves [where they think to hide and secure themselves. See Judges 6.2. the annotate.] shal (not) die by the silence.
\p
\v 28 . For I will make the land a desolation and terrour, [Or utter desolation, or meet desolation or astonishment: or desolation, and or yea desolation: the Hebrew or signifying to make desolate, and to be astonished, to be afraid, or affrighted. So below chapter 35.3, 7.] And the pride of her strength shall cease: and the mountains of Israel [the hilly country of Israel] shall be desolate, that none shall pass through.
\p
\v 29 . Then shall they know that I am LORD when I shall have made the land a desolation and a terrour, for all their abominations which they have committed.
\p
\v 30 . And thou, O child of man, the children of thy people, thy talk still of thee by the walls, and in the doors the houses: [As neighbours are wont to talk together by the walls of the houses, and at one another’s doors] and the one speaketh with the other, every man with his brother, saying, come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh from the Lord.
\p
\v 31 . And they came unto thee as the people useth to come, [in multitude into the holy congregation to hear the word of God. Heb. As the coming of the people] and sit before thy face, [Compare above chapter 8.1 (as) my people, and hear thy words, but they do them not: for they make flatteries with their mouth, [that is, they flatter thee, commending thy prophesies with hypocritical signed gestures, because of the beauty thereof; as if they should say, oh how well and excellently doth he speak, c. Others, they make them (words) pleasant with their mouth; that is, they confess with their mouth that thy words are pleasant, but, c. the meaning being all one] but their heart walketh after their covetousness.
\p
\v 32 . And lo, thou art unto them as a song of loves, [Or sweet love-song, that foundeth pleasantly, or s full of pleasantness] (as) one that is fair of voice, or that playeth well; [upon Musick-instruments, as Psalms 33.3.] therefore they hear thy words, but they do them not.
\p
\v 33 . But when that cometh, [which thou hast prophesied unto them from me] (lo, it will come) then shall they know that a prophet [a true prophesie sent from God hast been in the midst of them.
\c 34
\s A prophesy against the wicked shepherds of God’s people, verse 1,2, c. God promiseth that he will seek out his sheep himself, deliver them and feed them aright, and put a difference between sheep and sheep, rams and goats, 10. For which end he will rise up and send their chief shepherd and prince of the church, Jesus Christ, under whose government his sheep shall be blessed and happy, 23.
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying:
\p
\v 2 . Child of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel: prophesy and say unto them, unto the shepherds; [the Ecclesiastical and political governours of my people. Compare this ensuing prophesy with Jeremiah chapter 23] thus saith the Lord LORD; Wo unto the shepherds of Israel that feed themselves should not the shepherd feed the sheep? [Ought they not (being contented with a convenient maintenance) principal to mind their own flock? As if God should say, surely they ought wholly so to do]
\p
\v 3 . To eat the fat, [as from the sheep they cometh milk, butter, cheese, &c. compare Zach 11, 16] and clothe you with the wooll, ye kill [see of the Hebrew word Gen. 31 on verse 54. The fatted (cattel), (but) ye feed not the sheep.
\p
\v 4 . Ye strengthen not the weak, [Meaning sheep and so in the sequel] neither do you heal that which is sick neither do ye bind up that which was broken, neither do ye bring again that which was driven away, neither do ye seek that which was lost: [Heb. decaying, perishing; that is, that which wandreth, goeth astray and is the danger of perishing. Compare Deut. 26 on verse 5.] But ye rule over them with severity and with hardness and cruelty. Compare 1 Peter 5.3 also Exodus 1.13,14 and below 27. Jeremiah 22.13, c.]
\p
\v 5 So they are scattered because there is no shepherd: to feed them, and to provide for them a right: neither spiritual shepherd to feed them with found and wholesome doctrines; no corporal shepherd, to feed them with their fatherly and kind government: but all was clean contrary: whereby the people became utterly corrupt in faith and life, and so incurred God’s fore displeasure, and consequently were mostly pitifully plagued with all kind of miseries: for all which the wicked shepherds were most of all guilty, as followeth] and they are become meat to all the wild beasts of the field, seeing they were scattered.
\p
\v 6 My sheep wonder upon all the mountains; and upon every high hill: yea my sheep are scattered upon the whole earth; [Or into all the land] and there is none that careth for them or any that seeketh them.
\p
\v 7 . Therefore ye shepherds hear the word of the LORD:
\p
\v 8 . (As true as) I live, saith the Lord LORD: if (i) not! [This is a special abrupt kind of speech, very usual in oaths, (as elsewhere often) which must be supplied from verse 10. As if the Lord should say: if I don’t punish them! If do not set my self against them! , c. see Numb 14 on verse 13 the same is likewise very usual in our own language (and in other languages also) both among good and bad men: if I do this o that: if I do this or that, c. then let me, c. Compare also Genes. 14 on verse 23, c.] Because my sheep have become a prey and my sheep are become meat to all wild beasts of the field, because there is no shepherd; and my shepherds care not for my sheep: and the shepherds feed themselves, but they feed not my sheep:
\p
\v 9 . Therefore you shepherds hear the word of the Lord:
\p
\v 10 . Thus saith the Lord LORD; behold, I (will be) upon the shepherds, [see of this phrase above chapter 13.8] and will require my sheep at their hand, [as above chapter 33.18. see Genesis 42 on verse 22] and will cause them to cease from feeding the sheep. [That is, I will depose them from their office, because they have the bear name of shepherds, but are not such indeed and in truth] so that the shepherds shall no more feed themselves: and I will pluck my sheep out of their mouth so that they shall not be (any more) meat unto them.
\p
\v 11 . For thus saith the Lord LORD, behold I, yea, I will care for my sheep, and I will seek out.
\p
\v 12 . As a shepherd seeketh out his flock [Heb. according to the seeking of a shepherd, as elsewhere] in the day when he is in the midst of his dispersed sheep; [all such time as the flock is pitifully scattered, and he cometh to visit, and to see what is wanting, and they might be, to bring them again together] so will I seek out my sheep: and I will deliver them out of all places whither they are scattered in the day of the cloud and of darkness [that is, in the time of grievous miseries, wherewith I have visited them justly. Compare Joel 2.2. With the Annotat.]
\p
\v 13 . And I will bring them out to the people, and I will gather them from the land, bring them into their (own) land: [Corporally, from Babel, c into the land of Canaan, and spiritually, to my church by the Messiah, c] and I will feed them upon the mountain of Israel, by the streams, and in all the inhabitable places of the land.
\p
\v 14 . I will feed them upon a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel [Heb. upon the mountains of the height of Israel] shall their fold be; there shalt they lie down in a good fold, and shall feed (in) a fat pasture upon the mountain of Israel.
\p
\v 15 . I will feed my sheep, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 16 . I will seek that which was lost, and I will bring again that was driven away, and I will bind up that which was broken, and I will strengthen that which was sick, but I will destroy the fat and strong: [That is, those that by their riches and strength are grown luxurious and wanton, rebelling against me, (as Duet. 32.15.) and oppressing their brethren. Compare the phrase with Psalms 22.30. Isaiah 5.17. and 10.16. Amos 4.1. With the Annotat, c] I will feed them with judgement. [Or I will feed them aright, discreetly. Compare Jeremiah 10 on verse 24]
\p
\v 17 . For ye, O my shepherds saith the Lord LORD: behold I will judge between small cattel and small cattel, [Meaning of sheep or goats. See Numbers 15.11. Deut. 14.4 and 17.1, c.] between the rams and the he-goats. [the meaning is, I will distinguish true believers’ from hypocrites that are in my church, and I will deliver them from my power and violence of false brethren. So below verse 22. Compare above chapter 20.37,38. Matthew 25.32, c.]
\p
\v 18 . Is it too little for you that you eat up the good pasture? Will ye besides tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? And I will ye drink the waters that are sunk, [Heb. the sinning, or that which is sunk of the waters, that is, the clear waters, whose mud is settled and sunk down to the bottom. Compare above chapter 32.14.] and soul the residue with your feet? [When ye have drunk enough pure and clear water your selves, when to soul the rest for others? As if the Lord should say, it’s a thing intolerable that ye enjoying and blessing in such great plenty as ye do, yet are not contented therewith, but ye must needs also spoil and wast that little reminder that should be for your poor and weak brethren.
\p
\v 19 . My sheep then shall they eat that which is trodden down with your feet and drink that which is souled with your feet? [It is spoken with detestation of the injustice of the thing. [Heb. the treading down of your feet, also the fouling of your feet]
\p
\v 20 . Therefore thus saith the Lord LORD unto [Or of] them: behold I, yea I will judge between the fat small cattel and between the lean small cattel. [See above verse 17]
\p
\v 21 . Because ye thrust [Heb. push] with the side and with the shoulder and push with the horns all the weak ones, till ye have scattered them abroad: [that is, hurting them by pushing and crushing the, so that they are not able to subsist near you]
\p
\v 22 . Therefore I will deliver my sheep that they shall be no more a prey: and I will judge between small cattel and small cattel.
\p
\v 23 . And I will raise up one onely shepherd over them, and he shall fees them, (namely) my servant David. [The Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ, the son of David according the flesh, and the father’s servant according to his office of Mediatourship. See Isaiah 42 on verse 1 and further, 2 Samuel 22 on verse 51. Jeremiah 23. On verse 5 and 30.9 and compare Isaiah 40.11 below chapter 37.24. Job 10.11, c. Heb. 13.20. 1 Peter 2.25 and 5.4] he shall feed them, and he shall be a shepherd unto them.
\p
\v 24 . And I the LORD will be a God unto them; [That is, their Saviour. See Genesis 17 on verse 7. Leviticus 18 on verse 2 and that by his son, whom he hath given unto us to be our priest, prophet and king] and my servant David shall be a prince [Compare Joshua 5.14,15. Isaiah 9.5. Acts 5.31.] in the midst of them: [Compare Matthew 18.20 and 28.20. Revelations 1.13.] I the LORD have spoken it.
\p
\v 25 . And I will make the covenant of peace with them, [see Jeremiah 31.31. see also Genseis 37 on verse 14 and Judges 6 on verse 24 and compare Isaiah 11.6,9 and 35.9 below chapter 37.26. Hos. 2.18.] And will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely [Heb. in safety or confidence, as verse 27, 28 and elsewhere often] in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.
\p
\v 26 . For I will make them, [To wit, the wilderness and woods wherein my sheep lie down, unto which the foregoing and the following words seem to have respect. Or them, wit, my sheep] and the places round about mine hill, a blessing: [that is, so abundantly grace them with my divine blessing, that they shall be as it were a pure blessing, and a pattern thereof. Compare Genesis 12.4 with the Annotat.. Spiritual blessings are here represented by corporal. Compare Joel 2 on verse 23.] I will cause the showre to come down in his season; there shal be showers of blessing.
\p
\v 27 . And the trees of the field shal yield her fruit, and the land shal yield her increase; [Compare Lev. 26.4] and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I am Lord LORD, when I shal have broken the daughter-trees of their yoke. [see Jereemiah 27 on verse 2 and understand here the spiritual yoke of bondage under sin and satan] and plucked them out of the hands of those that caused themselves to be served of them [Or that compelled them to serve. See Jeremiah 22.13 and 25.14 with the Annotat.]
\p
\v 28 . And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the wild beasts of the earth devour them any more: but shall dwell safely and there shal be none to make them afraid.
\p
\v 29 . And I will raise up for them a plant [The Lord Jesus Christ. Compare Jeremiah 23.5. With the Annotat.] Of name: [That is, a famous, a renowned plant. Compare the phrase with Genesis 6.4 or a plant for a name, that is, which shall be for a name, that is, for renown of glory. Compare Deut. 26.9. Jeremiah 33.9 and chapter 39.13. With the Annotat.] And they shall be no more taken away [Heb. properly gathered. See of such use of the Hebrews word. Psalms 26 on verse 9. Others consumed] by hunger in the land, neither hear the reproach of the heathen [or shame, blushing, which is done to you by the heathen] any more.
\p
\v 30 . But they shall know that I the LORD their God am with them: [See Genesis 21 on verse 22.] and that they are my people, [Understand (from the former words) they (the sheep) shall know that they are my people. See Deut. 7 on verse 6] the hose of Israel, [my true church. See Gal. 6.16, c.] saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 31 . Now ye O my sheep of my pasture, ye are men; (but) I am your God, saith the Lord LORD. [That the great inequality that is between the great God and us poor empty vain men might not frighten us, not the conscience and experience of our on impotency make us afraid, God assureth us here by a gracious and loving speech, that he notwithstanding all this will perfect the promised work of grace in his sheep; as if he had said, be comforted be of good chear, ye my beloved sheep, I am and continue for ever your Saviour. Compare Job 10.28, 29.]
\c 35
\s A prophesy concerning the utter destruction of the Edomites for their continual bitter hatred and reviling against the people of God, and their rejoicing at their miseries.
\p
\v 1 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:
\p
\v 2 . Child of man, set thy face against mount Seir: [see of this phrase above chap. 6 on verse 2. By mount Seir is meant the hilly country of the Edomites, the posterity of Esau. See above chap. 25.8,12, c.] and prophesy against it.
\p
\v 3 . And say unto it, thus saith the Lord LORD; behold I (will be) upon thee, [As above chapter 13.8.] O mount Seir: and I wil stretch out mine hand against thee, see above chapter 14 on verse 9.] And I will make thee a desolation and a terrour [or, utter desolation, or astonishment and desolation, as above chapter 33.28. and here below verse 7.]
\p
\v 4 . I will make thy cities solitariness, and thou shalt become a desolation: and shall know that I am Lord, LORD.
\p
\v 5 . Because thou hast an everlasting enmity, [Heb. Enmity of eternity, to wit, against my people. Compare above chap. 25.12, c. Amos 1.11.] And hast caused the children of Israel to flow [or shed; that is, poured out their blood like water by murderings, and caused to flow away. Compare Psalms 63.11 and Jeremiah 18.21. With the Annotat.] See Job 5 on verse 20] in the time of their destruction, [or ruine by the Chaldeans whom the Edomites helped, and stirred up to destroy Jerusalem to the very foundation. See Psalms 137.7.] in the time of the uttermost iniquity: [Heb. Iniquity of the end, or of the uttermost. See above chapter 21 on verse 25.]
\p
\v 6 . Therefore (as time as) I live, saith the Lord LORD, I will assuredly prepare thee unto blood, [that is, to be killed or murdered. See Gen. 4 on verse 10. and above chap. 16.36 and 21.32 or I will make thee (to be) blood, that is, I will so order thee, that the land shall be full of thine own blood, and shall (in a Manner) be nothing but pure blood] and blood [That is, slaughter and murder, and consequently slayers and murderers] shall pursue thee: [Or, blood shall flow thee, as being shed and flowing every where] sith thou bast not hated blood, [that is, hast with delight beheld, yea and helped forward the murder and slaughter of my people] blood shall also pursue thee.
\p
\v 7 . And I will make mount Seir utter desolation, [or meer desolation, as verse 3. though the Hebrew words (being of one root) do a little differ] and I will cut off from it him that passeth out, and him that entreth. [I will make it so desolate, that no man shall inhabit, neither go in nor out there]
\p
\v 8 . And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: thy hills, [O Edom] and thy valleys, and all thy streams, in [or upon, by] them shall they that are slain by the sword lie. [As above chap. 6.7.]
\p
\v 9 . I will make thee everlasting desolations, [Heb. Desolation of eternity] and thy cities shall not be inhabited: [Others return. The meaning is, that they shall not be built again to be inhabited] and ye shall know that that I am LORD.
\p
\v 10 . Because thou sayeth, those two nations, [Juda and the ten tribes] and those two lands shall be mine, and we will possess them hereditarily, [see below chapter 36.5] though the LORD hath been there. That is, hath dwelt there. The meaning is, every where, whether God will or no, (as wicked enemies use to speak) they shall be for us, we are now the next, none shall be able to alienate them from us. Others, when the Lord hath been, understanding this of Juda, where the temple of the Lord had been. Compare below chap. 36.2. With the Annotat.]
\p
\v 11 . Therefore (as true as) I live, saith the Lord LORD, I will also deal according unto thine anger and according to thy envy which thou hast exercised out of thine hatred against them: [Or as thou hast dealt with, or against them] and I will acknowledged among them, when I shall have judged [that is, punished] thee [that is, I shall be known among my people, who shall find that I am their friend when I shall have cut off their deadly enemies.]
\p
\v 12 . And thou shall know that I the LORD have heard all thy blasphemies, [Or, that I (am) the lord, &c.] which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, they are laid waste, (that) they are given to us for meat. [See Deut. 31 on verse 17.]
\p
\v 13 . Thus with your mouth you have magnified yourselves against me, [that is, spoken stoutly and proudly against me, as it were daring me with boasting and bragging language. See of this phrase Psalms 35 on verse 26] and (have) multiplied your words against me: [that is, ye have used much prating against me. The Hebrew Athar, or Gnathar signifieth multitude or abundance of words or things, for the most part in a good sense, when it is taken for much entreting and earnest, or servant praying, wherein a multitude of words is used or abundance of all manner of blessings. See Gen. 25.21. Exod. 8.8. c. Jeremiah 33.6. But here of the proud Edomites it is taken in a bad sense, for much prattling and prating. So it is used above for abundance of Idolatrous incense] I have heard it.
\p
\v 14 . Thus saith the Lord LORD, as the whole land joyceth, (so) [this article is here inserted to fill up the sense from the following verse] will make thee desolate. [As the whole land of the Edomites rejoiced at Israel’s desolation, so will I also for it make their whole land again desolate? See the next verse. Others, when the whole earth rejoyceth, (then) will I, &c. that is, when there shall be ever where joy and gladness for the mercies that I will bestow on my people, principally by the Messiah, then shalt thou be plagued and be made desolate.]
\p
\v 15 . As thou didst rejoice [Heb. According to thy joy. Compare above verse 11. and elsewhere often] at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was made desolate; [that is, didst rejoice at the desolation of the land of Canaan, which I gave unto Israel (and not unto thee) for an inheritance] so will I do unto thee: Mount Seir, and all Edom, shall be wholly a desolation: [as the whole land of Edom shouted at Israel’s calamity, as is said in the former verse] and they shall know that I am the LORD.
\c 36
\s By the speech directed to the mountains of Israel, God foretelleth that he will in great zeal execute vengeance upon the enemies of his church, that had deaded, oppressed, and made havock of her, verse 1, c. and that he will most gloriously restore, multiply, and bless her, 8. He sheweth that he was necessitated to punish and chastise her for her sins, for the honour of his holy name, 16, but that he will again for his names sake out of his free grace and mercy, abundantly favour her, cleanse her, sanctifie her by holy spirit and fill her with all manner of blessings, and everlastingly save her, 21, c.
\p
\v 1 And thou child of man, prophesie unto the mountains of Israel, and say, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD, [as above chap. 6.2,3. God speaketh to the mountains, that is, the hilly countrey (as verse 6) of Israel, for the instruction of men (for whose sins they lay waste, and were divided) and to shew that the wicked scornings and directions of his land and people did concern himself. Compare Joel 2.18 and see further of such speeches above chap. 14 on verse 17.]
\p
\v 2 . Thus saith the Lord LORD; because the enemy saith of you, Aha! [See Job 39 on verse 28 and Psalms 35 on verse 21 and compare above chap. 25.3 and 26.2.] Even the everlasting high places [Heb. High places of eternity; the ancient famous mountains, also strong, lasting, &c. Deut. 33.15. Hab. 3.6 with the Annotat. This might otherwise be also understood of mount Zion and Moria, where David’s tower and temple had been. Compare Psalms 78.69 and above chap 35.10.] And become our inheritance! [Thus this should be wicked boasting at God, and at the destruction of his sanctuary, called Gods everlasting habitation, as being now fallen into the enemies and possession. Here it is said are become; in the Hebrew is become; meaning every one of those high places. See below verse 5.]
\p
\v 3 . Therefore prophesie, and say, thus saith the Lord LORD; therefore because they have made you desolate, ad swallowed (you) up on every side [Compare Psalms 56.2 you; the mountains of Israel, environed by Ammonites, Moabites, Edomites, Philistines, Tyrians, Zidonians, Syrians, &c. that ye might be an inheritance [or so that ye are become, c] for the remnant of the heathen, [to the east, to the residue that are left, or might be left of the common desolations. So verse 4,5. Compare also verse 3, 6.] and ye are brought [Heb. Brought up] upon the prattling lip, [Heb. Lip of the tongue; that is, as if one should say, tongue; that is as if one should say, tongue, lip; that is, prattling, prating lip, so that every one’s mouth is full of you, and speak scornfully of you, maketh taunts and proverbs of you] and (in) the taunts of the people.
\p
\v 4 . Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord LORD: thus saith the Lord LORD to the mountains and to the hills, to the streams, and to the valleys, and the desolate solitary places, and to the forsake cities, that are become a prey and derision for the remnant! Of the heathen that are round about:
\p
\v 5 . Therefore thus saith the Lord LORD; if I have not spoken in the fire of my zeal [or in my zealous zeal; to wit, for my land and people, and against mine and their enemies. Compare above on verse 1 and below verse 6 and above chapter 5.13. Deut. 4.24. with the Annotat.] Against the remains of the heathen, and against all Edo, which have given my land [Canaan See Psalms 68 on verse 10. Hos. 9 on verse 3. So below verse 20] unto themselves for an inheritance, [see above chap. 35.10.] with the joy of all (their) heart, with desirable plundering, [Heb. Plundering, or contempt of the foul; that is, despise or plundering my people and land with an inward delight and servant affection or desire, without any pity or compassion at all. See Psalms 27 on verse 12.] That the countrey thereof [of my land of Canaan] might be for a prey. [The Hebrew word rendered here countrey, signifieth suburbs, lands or fields, near empty ruinous places, lying before, without and about cities or other buildings: farmers, out-gardens inheritance, c. because they are separated therefrom: whereunto the original Hebrew word hath respect, which otherwise sinifieth casting out, driving out: wherefore others render these words thus; to set out the same land (land) for a prey. Heb. That the countrey, or setting out, casting out (might be) for a prey. See of this abrupt sentence usual in oaths, above chap. 34.8. With the Annotat. And fill up the sense from verse 7.
\p
\v 6 . Therefore prophesie concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains and to the hills, to the streams, and to the valleys, thus saith the Lord LORD; behold, I have spoken in my zeal, and in y fury, because ye have born the reproach of the heathen: [As above chap. 34.29 and below verse 15.]
\p
\v 7 . Therefore thus saith the Lord LORD; I have lifted up mine hand, [That is, sworn by my self: as men swear by God by lifting up, or putting up of the hand. See Genesis 14 on verse 22.] If the heathen that it are round about you shall not bear their (own) shame!
\p
\v 8 . But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall yield your branches (again), [That is, flourish again, and become fruitful] and bear your fruit for my people of Israel: for they are at hand to come. [The Israelites shall soon return out of captivity: whereupon the most principal thing of all shall follow, to wit, the redemption and restauration of the universal church by the Messiah]
\p
\v 9 . For lo, I am with you; [O ye mountains of Israel, to deliver your and do you good. Others I (will be) upon you; which phrase must not be taken here (as elsewhere: see Jeremiah 21 on verse 13 and above chapter 13.8) in a bad, or in an hostile way, but in good sense, and in a friendly and loving way: as we also sometimes do in our own language, when we will be upon a man in a hostile manner, or also in a good sense; to deliver a man, or to do him a good turn, &c.] And I will look towards you, [or turn my face towards you; that is, graciously, accept you, sending the Messiah unto you, at whose coming and benefits towards his church this happeneth chiefly, and principally looketh, as appeareth in the sequel] and ye shall be tilled and sown.
\p
\v 10 . And I will multiply men [Heb. man: and so in the next verse, man and beast. Compare below verse 37.38. Jeremiah 31.27. with the Annotat] upon the whole house of Israel, (yea) that whole: [my whole Church, the whole body, under one head, the Messiah. See Eph. 2.12,13,19,21,22. Col. 2.19. and compare below chapter 37.16,17,19,24, c.] And the cities shall be inhabited, and the solitary shall be builded.
\p
\v 11 . Yea I will multiply men and beasts upon you and they shall be multiplied, and be fruitful, and I will cause you to be inhabited as in your former times, yea I will make it better then in your beginnings. Therefore the new covenant is called a better covenant, and the time of the Messiah, times of bettering, or of reformation, Heb. 8.7 and 9.10, &c] and ye shall know that I am the LORD.
\p
\v 12 . And I will cause men to walk upon you, (namely) my people Israel, they shall possess thee hereditarily; and thou shall be for an inheritance unto them: and thou shalt henceforth bereave them no more [Heb. not adde to bereave them any more, c, or] henceforth, to wit, or anything that is dear unto them, as children, men in general, fruits of the earth, &c. see Jeremiah 15 on verse 7. So below verse 13,14,15. The meaning is that the land should be no more in such a café as it was formerly, when man perished in it through war, famine, and pestilence, thou wast bereaved of them, and they were bereaved of thee: for which cause reproachful terms used concerning the land, such as are mentioned in the following verse. God speaketh to the land done it in a Rhetorical kind of speech; of the saying of the enemies, which held it to be a cursed land, wherein no man could prosper, or dwell in peace. Compare Numb. 13.32.]
\p
\v 13 . Thus saith the Lord LORD; because they say unto you, [in a jeering and mocking way] thou art (a liid) that catest up men: and thou art (a land) that bereaveth thy nations, [Of the twelve tribes: so in the two next chapters and below chapter 37.22. see on the former verse.[
\p
\v 14 . Therefore shall eat up men no more, neither cause thy nations to stumble [And consequently bereave them. See above on verse 12.] Any more, saith Lord LORD.
\p
\v 15 . And I will cause that men shall hear no more the taunt of the heathen against thee, and thou shalt bear no more the reproach of the nations: [As above verse 6] neither shall thou cause the people to stumble any more, saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 16 . Furthermore, the word of the Lord came unto me saying:
\p
\v 17 . Cild of man, the house of Israel when they dwelt in their (own) land, then they defiled it by their way. See Gen. 6 on verse 12.] And by their dealing: their way was before my face as the uncleanness of a separate (woman). (See Levit. 1519, 24. With the Annotat.]
\p
\v 18 . Therefore I poured out my fury upon them. [See Psalms 79 on verse 6] because of the blood that they had shed in the land: [Or, upon the earth] and for their dung-gods, [see Levit. 16 on verse 30] (wherewith) they had polluted the same.
\p
\v 19 . And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed in the lands: I judged them according to their way, and according to their dealings.
\p
\v 20 . Now when they came into the heathen whither they were gone, they profaned my holy name: [Heb. the name of my holiness; and so in the sequel. The reason is, because the Israelites themselves were the cause that God has cast them out of his own land: which enemies continued to God’s ignominy and dishonor, as if he had not been able enough to preserve his own land and people, or not faithful in his promises. Adde hereunto this, that they everywhere, where forever they came, so behaved themselves that God reaped nothing but dishonour by them, whereby he was necessitated to do all this for his own name’s sake, whereof in the sequel] because they said because of them, these are the people of the Lord, and are gone forth out of the land. [As above verse 5. others they are gone one after another out of their land: that is, they were sain to leave it, everyone for his own part Israel first, and after Juda: some strange accident hath befallen his people and the land]
\p
\v 21 . But I had pity on (them) for my holy name, [Or, I had pity on my holy name] which the house of Israel profaned among the heathen, whither they were come.
\p
\v 22 . Therefore say unto the house of Israel, thus saith the Lord LORD; I do it not for your sakes, ye house of Israel, but for mine holy names sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen whither ye are come.
\p
\v 23 . For I will hallow [Compare above chap. 28 on verse 22.] my great name, which is profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them, and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, saith the Lord LORD, when I shall be hallowed in you [or, shall have hallowed my self. That is, shall have manifested my holiness, power, and faithfulness in you] before their eyes. [Others, your eyes]
\p
\v 24 . For I will fetch [Heb. Take. See Jerem. 37 on verse 17. so below chap. 37.21.] you from among the heathen, [first, and partly you Jews with a few Israelites from Babel, &c. but this shall be a type of the figure of the great spiritual work of the grace which I will work in the time of the Messiah and of the New Testament, gathering my universal church from among the whole world, and blessing them as followeth. Compare above chap. 11.17] and will gather you out of all countreyes, and I will bring you unto your (own) land.
\p
\v 25 . Then I will sprinkle clean water upon you, [I will by my word and spirit apply unto you the precious blood of the immaculate lamb Jesus Christ. For the cleansing of your soul. See 1 Pet. 1.2,19 and Eph. 5.26. Heb. 9.14. 1 Job 1. 7, &c.] And ye shall be clean from all your uncleanness; and from all your dung-gods will I cleanse you. [Compare below chap. 37.23 and 43.7.]
\p
\v 26 . And I will give you a new heart, [See hereof above chap. 11 on verse 19.] and I will give a new spirit in the innermost (part) of you: and I will take away the stony heart of out of your flesh, and will give you a fleshy heart.
\p
\v 27 . And I will give my spirit in the innermost (part) of you: and I will cause you to walk in my statutes, and to keep my judgement, and to do (them)
\p
\v 28 . And ye shall dwell in the land but I give to your fathers, and ye shall be a people unto me, [see Deut. 7 on verse 6] and I will be a God unto you. [See Gen. 17 on verse 7.]
\p
\v 29 . And I will deliver you from all your uncleannesses, and I will call for the corn, [by my powerful working send all manner of blessings, which is elsewhere called God’s commanding, (see Levet. 25 on verse 21.) as the Lord is also said to call for the plagues. See Psalms 105.16. Jerem. 25.29 With the Annotat. By these corporal blessings for the most part (as elsewhere) spiritual blessings are represented yet so as that Godliness hath also the promise of the life that now is (see Joel 2 on verse 23 and 1 Tim. 4.8) but without excluding the conflict and cross. (see Psalms 37 on verse 1) whereof below chap. 38] and will multiply it, and I will lay no famine upon you.
\p
\v 30 . And I will multiply the fruit of the trees, and the increase of the field, that ye may receive no more the reproach of famine among the heathen.
\p
\v 31 . Then shall ye remember your wicked waies, and your dealing that were not good: [see above chap. 6.9. with the Annotat] and you shall loathe your selves [Heb. Your faces, as above chap. 6.9.] for your iniquities; and for your abominations.
\p
\v 32 . I do it not for your sakes, [Ye have not deserved it in the least: but I do it out of free grace, for the honour of my holy name] saith the Lord LORD, beit known unto you: be ashamed, and blush for your (own) waies, ye house of Israel. [God will earnestly have them to know this and to confess it with a humble and dejected confession and acknowledgement of their own unworthiness]
\p
\v 33 . Thus saith the Lord LORD, in the day when I shall cleanse you from all your iniquities, then will I cause the cities to be inhabited, [plant them with inhabitants] and the solitary places shall be builded.
\p
\v 34 . And the desolate land shall be tilled, in stead that it was a desolation before the eyes of everyone that passed by.
\p
\v 35 . And they shall say, this land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden: [that is, garden of pleasure. Compare above chap. 28.13. With the Annotat.] And the solitary and the desolate and destroyed cities are strong and inhabited.
\p
\v 36 . Then shall the heathen that shall be left in the places round about you, know that I am the LORD build the destroyed places, (and) plant that that was desolate: [Or, have builded, planted the destroyed (cities)] I the LORD have spoken it, and will do it.
\p
\v 37 . Thus saith the Lord LORD; moreover, I will for this be sought of the house of Israel, to perform it unto them: I will multiply them with men like sheep. [Or, as (with) flocks of men. Or, I will suffer my self to be sought, or enquired of, &c. that is, willingly yield to this, suffer myself to be found in it. (Compare Isa. 65.1.) that (in regard the grace is plentiful and exceeding ample and spacious, so that these seemeth to want but men to enjoy it) I may adde yet this mercy thereunto, that I may fill up my church with believing men, like sheep, both of Jews, and chiefly of Gentiles. Compare Job 10.16. Cant. 8.8, c. Isa. 49.19, 20 and 54.2, c and above verse 10.]
\p
\v 38 . As the halloweth sheep, as the sheep of Jerusalem on her appointed feasts: [Heb, sheep of holiness. Meaning the cattel for sacrifice, that in great multitudes were brought into Jerusalem against the yearly feasts for sacrifice] so shall the cities be full of flocks of men: and they shall know that I am the LORD.
\c 37
\s By the vision of the resurrection of the dead, God assureth his people that he will surely deliver them out of the captivity of Babel, where they were now like men that were dead and buried, and will bring them again into their own land, verse 1, c. he prophesieth also under the token of joining two sticks together in one hand, that he will gather his catholick church of Jews and Gentiles, and unite them under one King and shepherd the Messiah Jesus Christ, and will make his everlasting covenant of grace with them, and dwell for evermore among them, 15,16, c.
\p
\v 1 The hand of the Lord was upon me, [see above chap. 1 on verse 3.] and the Lord carried me forth in the spirit, [That is, in a vision or trance. Others it (the hand of the Lord) carried me out by the spirit of the Lord] and set me down [Heb. caused me to rest] in the midst of the valley: the same now was full of bones. [Meaning dry dead bones of men that were deceased, as followeth. By this vision, and the following token of two pieces of wood, God would assure the accomplishing of the promises of grace, which are amply made in the former chapters, both concerning the corporal deliverance from Babel and the spiritual redemption by the Messiah, and the gathering of the universal church out of Jews and gentiles, all which surpassed the capacity and power of man: to teach his people, that it is as easie for him (who is the Almighty God) to perform all these things, as to raise and quicken dead men, (whereof God here representeth a lively pattern for the confirmation of the faith of his church) and to joyn two pieces of wood together
\p
\v 2 . And he [Namely the Lord] caused me to pass by them, quite round about: [Heb. Round about round about. Otherwise the prophet might have been naturally afraid of them, and been in the fear of contracting ceremonial pollution thereby] and behold, there were very many upon the ground [Heb. Face of the valley] and lo they were very dry.
\p
\v 3 . And he [The Lord] said unto me, child of men, I shall these bones become alive? [As if God should say, is it possible that they should ever grow alive? Dost thou know any natural, conceivable means, counsel, or power for it? Doth it seem a thing possible unto thee to be done by the skill and power of man? Compare this question with Job 6.4,5. Otherwise the article of the future universal resurrection of the dead was a point well known, and without all doubt among the people of God. See Matthew 22.29, &c. Hebrews 11.13, 14, 35.] And I said Lord LORD, thou knoweth (it). [As if the prophet should say; I know thy power well, but what thou at present intendeth hereby these bones, and what thou wilt do to them, that is best known to thee, and is not yet revealed unto me by thee: otherwise the prophet had the general the faith of the godly Patriarchs. See Genesis 23 on verse 4 and 50 on verse 25. Exodus 13.19. Isaiah 26.19, c. without which believers would have been of all men the most miserable, 1 Corinthians 15.19. see further Job 11.24.]
\p
\v 4 . Then said he unto me; prophesie upon these bones, and say unto them; ye dry bones, bear the word of the LORD. [Compare this speech with above chapter 36.1 and 14.17 with the Annotat, also Romans 4.17.]
\p
\v 5 . Thus saith the Lord LORD unto these bones, behold I will bring the spirit unto you, [That is, the soul into every body. So verse 8.10. See Numbers 16 on verse 22.] And ye shall become alive.
\p
\v 6 . And I will lay [Heb. give] sinews upon you, and cause flesh to come upon you, and draw a skin over you, and give spirit in you, and ye shall become alive: and ye shall know that I am Lord LORD.
\p
\v 7 . Then I prophesied as I was commanded, and there was a sound when I rophesied, and behold, a stirring; [Or, shaking, trembling, moving. Others, (earth) quake, concerning which the Hebrew word is frequently used: but it is also used to signifie other stirrings. As above chapter 38.19,20. Nahum 3.2. This sound and motion or shaking were tokens and messengers of the present Majesty of God, of his powerful working, as in the sequel the wind was] and the bones approached (every) bone to his bone. [So that the very same bones which in their life-time had been together in every body, came again together in this vision: a lively representation of that which God will work at the resurrection of the dead]
\p
\v 8 . And I behold, and lo, they grew sinews upon them, and there came up flesh and he drew a skin over them above but there was no spirit in them. [As above verse 5]
\p
\v 9 . And he said unto me, prophesie unto the wind: [That is, declare in my name, that I by my divine power will bring the souls again into these dead bodies, &c. some understand here by the word spirit, the wind; and so in the following words of this verse. Not that the wind can blow life or the soul into those that are dead: but that God is pleased to use the wind as a token and message of his powerful working, because of the likeness that there is in some sort between the working of God and the power or efficacy of the wind; and between the blowing of the wind (whereof in the following words is spoken) and the blast or breath which the soul produceth and causeth in the living. Compare Acts 2.2 and Job 20.22, c.] prophesie, child of man and say unto the spirit, thus saith the Lord LORD; thou spirit, come from the four wids, [that is, from the four corners or parts of the worlds. See above chapter 5 on verse 10.] And blow into these slain, [Or blow upon these slain] that they may become alive.
\p
\v 10 . And I prophesied like as he had commanded me: then the spirit [That is, the soul, as above verse 5 came into them, and they became alive; and flood upon their feet, and exceeding great [Heb. very very great] army.
\p
\v 11 . Then he said unto me, child of man, these bones they are the whole house of Israel: [That is, they are a token, or representation of the house of Israel, they signifie it, and their present condition in Babel] Behold, they say, our bones are dried, and our expectation s lost, [there is as little hope of our deliverance from Babel, and of our return into our own land as is that dead, buried, and rotten men, and their dry and withered bones should live again. These speeches of unbelief and discomfort were the occasion and shew the scope of the former vision] we are cut off. [Like branches that are cut off, and can draw no jayce from the root, and therefore must necessarily perish]
\p
\v 12 . Therefore prophesie, and say unto them, thus saith the Lord LORD; behold, I will open your graves, and will cause you to come up out of your graves. O my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel. [God executeth here briefly the corporal and spiritual promises that are made at large in the former chapters, using to this end figurative phrases, taken from the former vision, and from their own words]
\p
\v 13 . And ye shall now that I am Lord LORD, when I shall have opened your graves, and when I shall have caused you to come up out of your graves, O my people.
\p
\v 14 . And I will give my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I will place your (own) land: and ye shall know that I am the LORD have spoken and done (this [Others, that I (am) the LORD, I have spoken it and will do it.
\p
\v 15 . Moreover, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:
\p
\v 16 . Now thou child of man, take thee one stick, [A little rod, or flat piece of wood. Compare Numb. 17.2, c] and write upon it, for JUDA, and for the children of Israel his companions: [meaning Benjamin and Levi. See 2 Chronicles 11.12, 13.] and take another stick, and write upon it, for JOSEPH, the stick of Ephraim, and of all the house of Israel [meaning the ten tribes, that had held fast with Ephraim (as the strongest side) and are often understood under that name] his companions.
\p
\v 17 . Cause thou them to approach the one to the other, to one stick: and shall become one in thine hand. [That is, bring them near, and to one another, that they may become one]
\p
\v 18 . And when the children of thy people [see above chapter 3 on verse 11] shall speak unto thee, saying wilt thou tell us what these things are unto thee? [That is, what they mean or signifie, and what thou intendeth by them, what is hereby meant to be understood. See above chapter 24.19.]
\p
\v 19 . Then speak unto them, thus saith the Lord LORD: behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, [that is, Joseph, or the Ephraimites with their adjoined tribes, which were together signified by this stick] which was in the hand of Ephrain, [that is, belonged to the ten tribes, whereof Ephraim had formerly been the head] and of the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will joyn the same with them unto the stick of Juda; and will make them one stick, and they shall become one in mine hand. [As the division and enmity between Juda and Ephraim (whereof Samaria was the chief city) was as it were a representation of the two hostile parts or divisions of men, namely, Jews and Gentiles; so was the uniting of them a representations or figure of the uniting of the universal church, or of all the elect throughout the whole world, both of Jews and Gentiles, by one spirit and one faith, under one head, King and savior, which is our Lord Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah: though now indeed some of the ten tribes joined themselves unto Juda, ad so went up together out of Babel, 1 Chron. 9.3 yet the true spiritual conjunction and uniting began in the time of our Saviour Christ and his Apostle, (see Job 4.9,12,23,35,39,41. Acts 2.9,10,11 and 8.5, 14. And 9.31) and is consequently prosecuted among the Jews and principally among the Gentiles and shall continue to the en of the world, until all the spiritual Israel be called, and be united into one body and one church, and saved; in the hand of God that is, in the Lord Christ, who is herein the father’s servant, into whose hand he hath delivered all things and unto whom he drewth all the elect. See Matthew 28.19. Acts 1.8. Romans 11.25,26. Ephesians 2.13, c.]
\p
\v 20 . Now the sticks whereon thou shalt have written shall be in thine hand before their eyes. [As the prophets were often commanded to represent lively, and as it were really set before the eyes of the people, that which was revealed unto them selves by God. Compare above chapter 12.3,4, &c. with the Annotat. Jeremiah 23. 2, &c.]
\p
\v 21 . Say thou unto them; thou saith the Lord LORD, behold, I will fetch [As above chapte 36.24.] the children of Israel out of the midst [Or, from between] of the heathen, whither they are gone, and will gather them from round about, and bring them into their (own) land. [The spiritual Canaan, Jerusalem, mount Zion; that is, into the Church of God, first the militant and then the triumphant church, (see Galatians 4.25,26. Hebrews 12.22) represented by the earthly Canaan whereinto God first brought again the Jews out of Babel.]
\p
\v 22 . And I will make them an onely nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and they shall have all of them together one onely King for (their) King: [The Messiah, our Lord Jesus Christ] and they shall be no more two nations, nor be henceforth any more divided [Heb. as if on should say, beloved] into two kingdoms.
\p
\v 23 . Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their dung-gods, [see Levit. 26 on verse 20.] nor with their detestations, [see above chapter 20 on verse 7] nor with all [or any] their transgressions: and will deliver them out of all their dwelling-places wherein they have sinned, [namely, in Babel, Egypt, &c. See Jeremiah 44.8. Above chapter 14.3 and 20.30,39, c.] And will cleanse them; shall they are people unto me, and I will be a God unto them.
\p
\v 24 . And David my servant [See above chapter 34 on verse 23. Isaiah 40.11. Jeremiah 30.9.] Shall be king over them, and they all shall have on shepherd: [see Job 10.16.] and they shall walk in my judgments, and keep my statutes, and do them.
\p
\v 25 . And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt: yea they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children’s children for ever, and my servant David shall be their Prince for ever.
\p
\v 26 . And I will make a covenant of peace with them; [see above chapter 34.25. Psalms 89. 4.] It shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will set them in, [Bring them in, place them, and cause them to abide there in my Church: Heb. give] and will multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore. [This phrase is taken from the state and condition of the Old Testament (as elsewhere often) signifying the gracious indwelling of God among and in his church, by his word. Spirit, savour and blessing. See Levit. 26.12. 1 Cor 3.16. And 2 Cor. 6.16. Ephe. 2.21, 23. Revelations 21.3.]
\p
\v 27 . And my Tabernacle shall be with them, and I will be a God unto them, and they shall be a people unto me. [See above chapter 11.20 and 14.11.]
\p
\v 28 . And the heathen shall know that I am the LORD that hallow Israel, [see above chapter 20 on verse 12] when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.
\c 38
\s This thirty eight chapter containeth a prophesie concerning the great preparation of Gog, and his marching up against Israel, together with his terrible overthrow by the mighty hand of God.
\p
\v 1 Furthermore, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:
\p
\v 2 . Child of man, set thy face against Gog, [see of this phrase above chapter 6 on verse 2] the land of Magog; [Or Gog of the land of Magog, or (of) the land of Magog. By this Gog may be understood first and partly the kings of Syria and Afia the less, especially that famous Tyrant Antiochus] Epiphanes, who in the time of the Machabees cruelly tyrannized over the people of The Jews and used all kind of nations in his armies: the more, because the fierce Sythians (descended from Magog) or Tartarians, &c not long before the time of these prophesies (Euseb. In Chron.) when Nebuchadnezzar was besieged elsewhere, (see Jeremiah 49 on verse 35.) were entred into Syria and into the land of Juda, and gave the name into the Scythopolis; that is, the city of the Scythians, (Plin. Lib5. Chapter 18.) and unto the Idolatrous city of Hierapolis the name of Magog, (plin.lib 5 chapter 23.) after their forefathers and native country, (Gen. 10 on verse 2) and besides that the name of the King Gog, or Gyg, that is, Gyges, agreeing with Gog, as well known there: and that this Antochus was in cruelty very like unto these his foreign predecessours. Secondly, and principally, by Gog and Magog must be urther understood all the enemies of the church of the new Testament, and especially Antichrist with all his adherents, who excelleth them all in in Scythian cruetly, and bloudy persecutions of the church. Compare Rev. 20.8, &c. some understand especially the Turk] the chiefly prince of Mesech and Tubal: [others, prince (and) head, or prince of the head, or of the heads of, c. it is as much soveraignity, Monarchy, great cham. See of these twain Mesech and Tubal, Genesis 10 on verse 2 and above chapter 27.13 and prophesie against him, [forasmuch as God in the former chapter hath made very great both corporal and especially spiritual promises unto the church of the old Testament, but especially unto the church of the new Testament; to the end thereof that the Jews after their deliverance from Babel, and the Christians after the coming of Christ, might not thereupon frame to themselves imaginations of perpetual rest and peace on earth, nor be daunted nor discouraged I times of trial and trouble, he hath foretold in these two chapters (this and the next) the fore combates, enmity and war that should betide the Jewish church before the coming of Christ, and the universal church after the coming of Christ, especially in the latter times: with most glorious promises of his faithful assistance care and providence in all this, and at last a blessed ad joyful issue]
\p
\v 3 . And say, thus saith the Lord LORD: behold I (will be) upon thee, [see above chapter 13 on verse 8] O Gog, thou chief prince of Mesech and Tubal.
\p
\v 4 . And I ill turn thee about, [Wind and turn thee as a horse is turned about with a bridle, and fishes with hooks and angles] and put hooks in thy chaws: [See above chapter 29 on verse 4] and I will bring thee forth together with all thine army, [by my secret providence I will be sure to meet with thee, that I may get glory upon thee. Compare below verse 16.17] horses and horsemen which are all very well armed and appointed, [Heb. clothed ones, or arrayed ones of perfection. That is, exceeding well armed, and well provided of all things] a great congregation (with) buckler and shield, all of them handle swords.
\p
\v 5 . Persians, Ethiopians, and Puteans with them: all of them (bear) shield and helmet. 27 .14.] (on) the sides of the north, and all his hands: many nations with thee.
\p
\v 6 . Gomer, [See Genesis 10 on verse 2. All is bands, the house of Togarma, [see Gen. 10 on verse 3. And above chapter.
\p
\v 7 . Be prepared, and make thy self ready, and thy whole congregation that are gathered unto thee: [that is a derision of Gogs great preparation for war] and be thou a guard unto them: [be as their centinel, wait upon them, do thy endeavour to go couragiously before them, and to protect them. It’s spoken in an ironical way.
\p
\v 8 . After many daies thou shalt be visited, [that is, be punished. See Genesis 21 on verse 1] in the last of years [at the time that is foretold by my prophets, after the deliverance from Babel, and especially after the coming of the Messiah] thou shalt come into the land, that is brought back again from the sword, that is gathered out of many nations upon the mountains of Israel, which have ever been ever a desolation: [that is, whose inhabitants shall be brought back, c. that is, be delivered out of Babel. So in the sequel. And especially all believers that shall be spiritually redeemed by the Messiah in the time of the new Testament, and shall dwell with spiritual confidence in the church of God (typified by the mountains of Israel) and shall be saved out of many persecutions] when the same (land) [that is, the inhabitants of the aforesaid land] shall be brought forth out of many nations, and they shall dwell safely all of them. [That is, the inhabitants shall dwell without suspicion and in peace in their own land. Compare verse 11.]
\p
\v 9 . Then shalt thou march up, thou shalt come on like a tempestuous desolation, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land: thou, all bands, and many nations with thee.
\p
\v 10 . Thus saith the Lord LORD, it shall also come to pass in that day that counsels [Heb. words, things: but the Hebrew word is also elsewhere taken for counsel. See 1 Kings 1.7 with the Annotat.] shall arise in thine heart, and thou shalt think an evil thought,
\p
\v 11 . And shalt say; [with thy self, that is, think and purpose] I will march up to (that) village-land, [wherein are no walled, fenced cities, as followeth, where men live peaceably and quickly without any evil suspicion, as verse 8] I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely all without a wall, and have no bars nor doors:
\p
\v 12 . To prey a prey, and to spoil a spoil: to turn thine hand [That is, to extend thy power. So 2 Sam 8.3. see there] against the wast places that are (now) inhabited, and against a people that is gathered out of the heathen, that hast gotten [Heb. properly is making] cattel and substance, dwelling in the midst [or upon the height. Heb. the navel. See Jud. 9.37.] of the land.
\p
\v 13 . Sheba and Dedan, [see of both Genesis 10 on verse 7. Also above chapter 27.15, 20, 22] and the merchants of Tharsis, [as above chapter 27.12,25. See Genesis 10 on verse 4] and all the young lions thereof [meaning the hard and greedy merchants and traders that long after the prey like young lions they shall accompany thee and follow thee, to participate of the prey of Israel, as followeth] shall say unto thee; comest thou a prey? Hast thou gathered thy company, assembled thine assembly to spoil a spoil, to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattel and goats to prey a great prey?
\p
\v 14 . Theredore prophesy, O child of man and say unto Gog, thus saith the Lord LORD; in that day when my people Israel dwelleth safely shalt thou not perceive? [That is, have experience of my wrath and punishment? By comparing of verse 16 and 18. As if the LORD should say, assuredly thou shalt: thou shalt know and find what is to disturb my quiet and still people.]
\p
\v 15 . Thou shalt then come out of thy place, [Or and shalt not come of thy place, [Or and shat thou not come? C by way of interrogation, as in the end of the former verse, so in the sequel] of the sides of the north, thou and many nations with thee: they shall all ride upon horses, a great assembly, and a mighty army.
\p
\v 16 . And thou shalt march up against my people Israel, as a cloud to cover land: in the last of dates it shall come to pass, then will I bring them against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be hallowed up on thee [as above chapter 28.22 below verse 23 and chapter 39.2.17, c.] before their eyes.
\p
\v 17 . Thus saith the Lord LORD, art thou be (of) whom I have spoken in former days by the ministry [Heb. hand] of my servants the prophets of Israel, [as in special by Ezekiel here, Daniel 8 and 11 and many others before in the old Testament: as was also done in conformity to them by the Apostles Paul and John in the New Testament, &c. Se Revelations 10.7.] which prophesied in those daies whose yeares, [others, which prophesied in the day of those years] that I would bring thee against them? [Israel my people, art thou, c. that is, thou art surely the same therefore thou shalt do so, and it shall at last be so with thee, as I have decreed and prophesied by my servants under divers names and titles given to the enemies of my church]
\p
\v 18 . But it shall come to pass in that day, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord LORD, that my wrath shall come up in my nose. [Or face, countenance. It’s spoken of God after the manner of men, to express his jealousie and anger]
\p
\v 19 . For I have spoken [Heb. I will speak] in my jealousie, [over and for my people, and against their enemies] in the fire of my wrath: if there shall not be in oaths. See above chapters 34.8.]
\p
\v 20 . So that the fishes of the sea and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all the creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the man that are upon the earth, [Heb. face of the earth] shall tremble at my face: that is, dreadful presence, or wrath, (see Psalms 21 on verse 10) which I will by my judgements manifest upon these enemies, whereby all creatures (in a manner) shall be astonished and afraid it’s a figurative kind of speech] and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places [or stairs, ascent, high towers] shall fall down, and all walls shall fall down to the ground. [Heb. wall shall, c in the singular number]
\p
\v 21 . For I will call for the sword upon him [hat is, I will send war, murder and desolation upon Gog. See Jerem. 25 on verse 9.] Upon all my mountains, [or for, c. that is, for the good of, or for the sake of my mountain; that is, of my church] saith the Lord LORD: the sword of every one [of the enemies] shall be against his brethren. [This hath respect to the enmity and wars that have risen between the king of Syria, whereby they destroyed and devoured one another: in like manner have the ministers of Antichrist often done, for the deliverance and rest of the church of God. Compare further the histories Judges 7.22. 2 Chron. 20.23.
\p
\v 22 . And I will plead with them by pesulence, and by blood: that is, slaughter and murder] and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many nations, that shall be with him, an overwhelming showre and great hail-stones, fire and brimstone. [See Psalms 11.6 and above 13.11 with the Annotat.]
\p
\v 23 . Thus will I magnify and hallow my self and (wil) be known before the eies o many heathen: and they shall know that I am the LORD. [that is, I will manifest that I am the God of Israel, the onely true, almighty, faithful, and righteous God, who indeed chastise and correct my people for their sins, but do not forsake them, but at last deliver them, and vanquish and subdue all their enemies, and cause myself to be extolled as such an one. Compare above verse 16 and Rev 15.3,4.
\c 39
\s A further prophesy of Gods judgement upon Gog and Magog, verse 1, c. the greatness of this overthrow is lively poutrayed by divers circumstances, 9. God wil make it known that he did punish his people for their sins, 23 but that he will graciously gather them all again, restore them, pour out his spirit upon them, and shew them everlasting favour and mercy, 25.
\p
\v 1 Moreover, thou child of mine, prophesie against Gog, and say; thus saith the Lord LORD; Behold, I (will be) upon thee, O Gog, prince of Mesech and Tubal. [see above chap. 38.2]
\p
\v 2 . And I will turn thee about, [As above chap. 38.4.] and smite a sixth book into thee, [Heb. properly, as if one should say, I will fix thee: which is diversely rendred; that which is set down here in the text is taken by comparing it with chap. 30.4. where God said, I will turn thee about, and put hooks into thy checks, or Jaws; whereupon he seemeth here to imply that he would hold him fast as t were with fix hooks, or with a fix-hooked hook, and would carry and lead him about therewith at his will and pleasure so as that he should not escape out of his hands, or skip out of the circle of his providence, but should receive his punishment at the place whither he should be carried as a condemned malefactor: as they were wont among the heathen to malefactors, hale and diag them along to the place of execution, with an hook smitten or driven into their bodies. Some render the words, I will punish thee fix-fold, to wit the fix plagues that are related, chap. 3.22. others, I will leave but a sixth part of thee, or but one part of six, or smite the by sixes; or I will deal so with thee as they were wont to deal with the sixth (with the tenth, twentieth, &c.) man that is taken prisoner in war, that is, to put him to death, &c.] And (will) pul thee up out of the sides of the North: and I will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel.
\p
\v 3 . But I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and I will cause thine arrows to f all out of thy right hand. [That is, I will bereave thee of all warlike power and courage, blunt and make void thy weapons, and as it were disarm thee and consequently cause thee to fall before thine enemy.
\p
\v 4 . Thou shalt fall [Or lie: as elsewhere] upon the mountains of Israel, thou and al thy hands, and nations that are with thee: I have given thee unto the ravenous birds, [Heb. ravenous bird] to the bird of every wing, [that is, every sort, as below verse 17.] and to the beasts of the field for meat.
\p
\v 5 . Thou shalt fall upon the open field: [Heb. face of the field] for I have spoken it, saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 6 . I will send a fire on Magog, [To wit, the fire of war, plagues and miseries, proceeding from the fire of mine anger, above chapter 38.19. see Amos 4, c.] and among them that dwell safely in the isles: [see Psalms 72 on verse 10.] and they shall know that I am the LORD.
\p
\v 7 . And I will make my holy name known [Heb. the name of my holiness. So in the sequel. That is, myself with my power, justice, goodness, glory, c.] In the midst of my people Israel; and will not let my holy name be any more profaned: [see Lev. 18 on verse 21. And above chapter 20.9.] And the heathen shall know that I am the Lord, the holy one in Israel.
\p
\v 8 . Behold it cometh, and shall be done, [Assuredly without fail, all this shall be accomplished] saith the Lord LORD: this is the day whereof I have spoken.
\p
\v 9 . And the inhabitants of the cities of Israel shall go forth, [To gather the prey of them that are slain] and kindle (a fire) [this is here inserted from the sequel] and burn of the weapons, both (of) the shields and bucklers, of the bows and of the arrows, [Heb. shield, bucklers, c. in the singular number] both of the hand staves [or poles] and of the spears: and of the spears: and they shall kindle a fire therewith seven years.
\p
\v 10 . So that they shall bring no wood out of the field, neither hew (down any) out of the forests, but set fire on the weapons: [this long burning and setting on fire, as also the following great space of the place of burial for Gog and his company, likewise the long time of burying must be taken as a figurative representations of the greatness and dreadfulness of the overthrow] and they shall spoil those that had spoiled them, and rob those that had robbed them, saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 11 . And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give into Gog there a burial-place in Israel, the valley of passengers towards the east of the sea: [Of this place there is nowhere else mention made in the scripture. Some conceive that the name of this place was give by the passengers that passed through the land, below verse 14,15. Or it may be it was a valley where the ordinary passage was along the sea-cost of kinereth or Genefareth towards Syria, &c. in the north east: or the Dead Sea towards Egypt, Arabia &c. in the south east of Canaan. The reader may herewith compare Joel 2.20.some understand the low grounds in Gilead in the east beyond Jordan, where the merchants frequently travelled through and traded. See Gen.37.25.] And it shall stop (the nose) of the passengers: [their nose and mouth, by reason of the stink and strong smell. Compare Joel 2.20. Others, stop, shut up, (their passage, or their fight) by reason of the multitude of dead men: or, (as some) stop their mouth so that they should no more mock at their passing by] and they shall they bury Gog, and his multitude, and shall call it the valley of Gog’s multitude. [Heb. the Hamon Gog]
\p
\v 12 . Now the house of Israel shall bury them, [Heb. shall bury, c. in the plural number] to cleanse the land, [of the dead bodies, which according to the ceremonial law defiled the earth, and therefore they were to be buried. See Deut. 21.23] seven months (long).
\p
\v 13 . Yea the people of the land shall bury (them) [Heb. shall bury, in the plural number] and it shall be to them a name: [that is, glory and honour. Compare above chap. 34.29. And the Annotat. There] in the day when I shall be glorified, [or shall have glorified my self; to wit, by my judgement upon these enemies of my church] saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 14 . And they shall sever out men go continually through the land, (and) buriers of the dead with the passengers (to bury) those that remain upon the earth, to cleanse it: [they shall sever out, c. for they were unclean by the law that had any thing to do with the dead, Num. 19.11.c. others, that with the passengers bury that remain upon the earth: meaning that they would also make use of the way-faring men for that purpose, if occasion should serve. Heb. men of steadfastness, or continuance, c. that is, such as go continually round about in the land, to give order for the burying of al those that here or there might be left, after the common of general burying of seven months, as followeth] at the end of the seventh months they shall make search.
\p
\v 15 . And these passengers shall pass through the land, and (when any one) seeth a mans bone, [Heb and he seeth ,c . that is, (in such a connexion of words) when anyone, or one of them seeth, c, others, and the passengers that pass through the land, when any one of them, c. then shall he, &c.] then shall he set up[Heb. build] by it [To the end that buries of the dead seeing the same, might bury the said bone. As followeth] til the buriers of the dead shall have buried it in the valley of Gogs multitude.
\p
\v 16 . Thus shall also the name of the city [That lay in or near that valley where the buriers, as long as that time lasted, meet together] be Hamona: [that is, multitude as above verse 11. Others, the city (Jerusalem) shall (have) a name from the multitude, to wit, of those slain men] thus shal they cleanse the land.
\p
\v 17 . Thou child of man, thus saith the Lord LORD; say unto the fowls of every wing, [That s, every sort, as above verse 4.] and to all the beasts of the field, assemble your selves and come, gather your selves from round about to my slay-offering [See Isaiah 34.6. Jerem. 46.10. Zeph. 1.7,8. With the Annotat. And of the Hebrew word, Gen. 31 on verse 54. Or slay-mea, slay-feast, from Rev. 10.17. And here below verse 20.] That I have slain for you, a great slay-offering, upon the mountains of Israel: and eat flesh and drink blood. [This serveth to represent this great overthrow. Compare above verse 9 and likewise Isaiah 18.6. Jerem. 12.9. c]
\p
\v 18 . Yea shall eat the flesh of the champions, and drink the blood of the prince of the earth: of rams, of lambs and goats, (and) bullocks, [that is, the choisest of all ranks and qualities of men, that have fought against the people of God. Compare Isaiah 34.6.] Which are all fatted (beasts) [or fatlings] of Basan. [that is, like unto the well-fed beasts of Basan. Compare Psalms 22.13. With the Annotat.]
\p
\v 19 . And ye shall eat fat unto satiety, and drink blood unto drunkenness, of my slay-offering which I have slain for you.
\p
\v 20 . And ye shall be satisfied at my table with (riding) horses and charets (horses), [also mules, asses, c. Compare the Annotat. On 2 Sam. 8.4.] With champions and all souldiers, [that is, all manner of souldiers, or all these, or many valiant men of war. Heb. champion-man of war] saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 21 . And I will set mine honour [that is, make it plainly appear. Heb. properly give. But the Hebrew word is thus diversely used according to the nature and quality of things. See further on verse 23.] among the heathen: and all the heathen shall see my judgement that I have done, and my hand that I have laid upon them. By slaying them, to wit, the enemies, see Genesis 33 on verse 22. Or my plagues, which I have inflicted upon them. See Job 13 on verse 21]
\p
\v 22 . And those of the house of Israel shall know [Heb. the house of Israel shall know: the verb in the plural number] that I the LORD am their God, from that day and forward.
\p
\v 23 . And the heathen shall know, that those of the house of Israel were carried away captive for their iniquity, [Which among the heathen shall tend to mine honour and glory, in regard I have manifested my holiness and justice by the just punishment of my people, as afterwards my truth and faithfulness by their gracious deliverance] because they had transgressed against me, and I hid my face from them. [See Deut. 13. On verse 17.] And delivered them unto the hand of their adversaries, so that they are fallen by the sword. [To wit, a great multitude of them, in all the countries of the land, of all ranks and qualities of men]
\p
\v 24 . According to their uncleanness, and according to their transgressions have I dealt with them: and I have hid my face before them.
\p
\v 25 . Therefore saith the Lord LORD; Now [That is, soon. See Hos. 10 on verse 3.] Will I bring back the captives [Heb. captivity] of Jacob, and will have mercy upon the whole house of Israel: and I will be jealous for my holy name. [Heb. the name of my holiness]
\p
\v 26 . When they shall have born their shame and all their transgression, [That is, the punishment thereof. Compare Levit. 5 on verse 1, c] whereby they have transgressed against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and (there) was none to make them afraid. When there were in prosperity, and enjoyed all things according to their hearts desire, when they ought to have been thankful towards me]
\p
\v 27 . When I shall have brought them again from the nations, and shall have gathered them out of the lands of their enemies, and I shall be hallowed in them before the eyes of many heathen: [As above chapter 38.16]
\p
\v 28 . Then shall they know that I the LORD am their God, seeing, I have caused them to be carried away captive among the heathen, but (i) have gathered them (again) into their (own) land, and have left none of them any more there. [I have not left or forgotten, and neglected so much as one of those that are mine, of mine elect people, but have faithfully shewed my salvation unto all in general, and to every one in particular]
\p
\v 29 . Neither will I hide my face any more from them: when I shall have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, [Or for, because I shall have poured out my spirit, c. see joel 2.28. Acts 2.17, whence it appeareth that this and other like promises of grace have respect to the universal church of Jesus Christ. As the punishments of the enemies of the old and new Testament are intermixt and mingled one among another in the prophetical writings: so are also the promises made unto both churches. And as the enemies of the old and new Testament make up one body, so do also believers and the churches of both Testaments make up one body, and pertain unto one fold, (notwithstanding in the diversity of administration, &c.) whereof the head and the shepherd is the LORD Jesus Christ, the true Messiah. See Job 10.16. Rom. 4.16,17,23,24. Eph. 2.12, 13, 19, c.]

\s A Preface to the nine following Chapters
\p As God In the beginning of the book invested the prophet Ezekiel in his office by an extraordinary vision, so it pleased him here in the nine following chapters as it were to conclude and seal up all his prophesies and visions, (especially the immediate forgoing prophesies concerning the corporal deliverance from Babel, and from other enemies, and the spiritual redemption by the messiah, with all adhering promised blessings) with a very great and exceeding glorious vision, being full of spiritual mysteries intended fro the comforting of his church, in a very troublesome time, when the people of God (Ezekiel with Juda) had been now fro a long time together carried out of Canaan Captive unto Babel (As the apostle John Banished into Pathmos, wo in his revelation by the inspiration of the same spirit, wrote may things like Ezekiel’s) Jerusalem, the Temple, and the kingdom of Juda had been destroyed, so that the judgment of men there seemed to be an utter end of the people of God and no hopes of being ever restored again. Against which God here most lively ppourtrayeth and foretelleth a most certain restauration of his house, city people land, that is, his Universal church in the new Testament out of Jews and gentiles) the spiritual service of God, together with the Christian fellowship and incomprehensible happiness of the Church both militant, and especially triumphant, with the abundance of their spiritual gifts and blessings under high Priest, King and Prince, head and Lord, Jesus Christ. And all this under types and figures, and in phrases that are taken from the state and style or manner of writing of the old testament, which are also frequent and usual with the other Prophets, but no where so fully executed and performed as here. In so much that the restuaration of Juda, Jerusalem, and the Tempe, which happened in the tie of Zerubbabel, Ezra and Nehemiah, is no more but a small shadow of his perfect work of work of grace of Messiah that is here revealed unto the prophet. And therefore this vision next to the visions of Daniel may justly and upon good ground be called a Revelation of the Old Testament; and ought likewise to be diligently searched into with all humility & reverence, and compared with other Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, as also with the nature and condition of the spiritual Kingdome of Jesus Christ, but not profanely and presumptuously in all particular circumstances applied to this or that thing without the direction of the holy Scripture. For the Substance and principal cope may be known, yet notwithstanding there will much lie hid and be kept Secret, which will cause us to call to mind the words of the Apostle, 1 Cor. 13.9,10. By these propositions that are here set down other scriptural interpretations that may fitly be applied thereunto are not rejected.
\s The time and manner of this vision, verse. 1.2. A man instructed the prophet concerning the end of the vision, 3 concerning the wall that went round about, and the measures, 5 concerning the gates and courts, to wit, the outermost court, and its appurtenances, where the people did use to assemble, 6 the innermost or middlemost court, with its appurtenances, where the furniture of the Levites was, and where the offerings were prepared, 28. The third or innermost court or court of the Priests where the Alter of the burnt-offering stood, 44. The porch of the Temple, 48.
\p
\v 1 . In the five and twentieth year of our captive-carrying away, [With King Jojachin See above c. 1.3 and 24.1 and 33.21] in the beginning of the year, [Heb. The head of the year: this is held by the Jews to be the beginning of the civil year. Others understand it is Ecclesiastical year] on the tenth (day) of the month, [Meaning the fifth month] in the fourtenth year after the city [Jerusalem] was smitten: [see above chap. 33.21 and 24.1,2. With the annotat. There] even on the same day, [see above chap. 2.3 and 24.2 with the annotata. Heb. In the bone, or in vigour of that day] was the hand of the LORD upon me, [See Above Chap.1. on vers.3] and he brought me thith. R. [to wit, into the land of Israel. Understand in a vision as followeth]
\p
\v 2 . In the vision of God [see above chap.1. on verse 1. and 8 on vers.3.] brought he [the Lord] into the land of Israel: and he set me upon a very high mountain; [compare Revel. 21.10. See of the Hebrews word rendered here set, above chap 37.1] and by it it was as the fabric of a city toward the south: [Ezekiel standing in the north, (where the temple had been. See Psalms 48 on verse 3.) Saw a city before him in the south. It is worth our observation that neither mountain, nor city, is named both here and in the sequel, save onely with the particle as, covertly as it were with the finger, pointing at Zion or Moria and Jerusalem: which might save to draw away our thoughts the more from the earthly Zion and Jerusalem, and to lead them to heavenly and spiritual Zion or Jerusalema to with the Church of God the mother of us all, Galatians 4.26. Whole name shall be, the LORD is there, below chapter 48.35. to the like purpose might serve the difference that is between the whole fabric and the former Temple of Solomon, and the other that was built after the return of the Jews from Babel. Therefore also, it is no where found in Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai, and Zachariah that they regulated themselves in the reedification of the temple according to the vision, which even diyers Jewish Rabbines are said to confess that it looketh at the time of the Messias.]
\p
\v 3 . when he had brought me [or, had caused me to go in, had brought me in]thither, behold then there was a man whose form was like the form of copper; [or steel being dry, hard and durable compare Revelations 1.15 also above chapter 1.7 and further, Pslams 45.3 and 102.27,28. Yet here not like burning Hasmel, above chapter 1.4, 27.] And in his hand was linen [like a land meter. For in those times there were wont measure and divide land with lines r rods. See below Chapter 47.3,13 with the annotat. And compare Revelations21.15 Zachariah 2.1. it is called a measuring or meting-line] and a measuring reed: [as having the measure exactly this fabric which in those times there wer’nt to do much with the reeds, (being very fit for that purpose) for which we may well use the word in asuring-rod, see Revelations 11.1. in like manner must the house of God be formed and squared according to his counsel and word as according to the onely rule and direction and the principal square of all institution: thereunto harth respect the phase that is used, Isa.28.10, Gal.6.16, Phil 3.16 and hence the books of the Holy scripture are called Cannonical. Compare Exodus 25.9,40, acts 77.44, Hebrews 8.5. We may likewise concerning the whole measuring of this spiritual building compare Ezekiel 3.17,18,19. We may hereby this man so describe,9as aforefaid)understand with most interpreters, the Lord Jesus Christ, as the supreme builder of his house, who doth not here appeal in dreadful majesty as a judge, but kindly and friendly as a Master-Builder: or at least an angel, whom the son Of God was pleased to use the purpose. Compare above Chapter 1.26 and 9 and 10.2.zachariah 6.12, &c and Revelation 11.1. Likewise below chapter 43.6 where it seemed that this man distin-guished from the Lord, that spake out of the Tempe] and he flood the gate. [As Lord of the house and heir of all, opening and shutting: or at least as one having charge and commission from him. See Hebrews 1.2 and 3.3,6 and Job 10.2,3, Revelation3.7 others, by the gate or in the gate]
\p
\v 4 . And the man said unto me, child of man, [see above chapter 2 on ver.11] behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall cause the to see; [This, is consider diligently and with singular attention all that thou seeth and hearth, to the intent that thou mayest faithfullysheew the fame unto the people of GOD, as followeth compare Matthew 10.27. luke 12.5. Acts 20.20, 27. 1 Corinthians 12.7 So chapter 43.10,11.] for the intent that I might cause thee to see (them) art thou brought hither: declare (afterwards) all that thou seeth to the house of Israel.
\p
\v 5 . And behold there was a wall on the outside of the house round about, [Hebrews round about, round about: and so into the sequel. This wall is foursquare by compass about the whole place of all this building. Compare Isa.26.1. Zachariah 2.4, 5. See of the circumference of this wall below chapter 42.15, 16,17,18,19,20] and in the man’s hand was a measuring reedof fix ells (or cubits) (every ell) of an ell and band breadth; [the measure of every ell was a common ell and a and breadth, so that the measuring reed was fix common ells and fix hand breadths long: one had-breadth is counted to be the breadth of four fingers oined together, or three thumbs] and he measured the breadth of the building [That is the thickness of the wall] One reed and the height one reed [ the depth of the outer wall some take as if it were to be as if it were representation; first, of Christ’s utmost humiliation, from whence he went on and increased, until he having finished the work of our redemption was exalted and entered into the Holy of Holies, see Philippians 2.7, & John 3.30. Hebrews 9.11,12,24, Secondly, of the first beginning and so consequently of the progress and increase of Christendom, and the divers measures of the gift of all members of Christ in this life, till he bring them to be with him in the heavenly places, which he hath prepared for them. See 1 Corinthians 13.9,10,12. Elijah 4.12,13,14,16. Also Luke 17.5, Revelation 12 .11]
\p
\v 6 . Then came he unto the gate, [meaning the first gate] which looked the way toward the east; [Hebrews whose face (was) the way, etc.] and he went up to the steps thereof, [how many they might have been is not here mentioned, as indeed there is mention made of others in the sequel] all measured the threshold of the gate, one read the breadth, and the other threshold, one read the breadth.
\p
\v 7 . And (every) little chamber, [Hebrews, the little chamber that is , very one of the little chambers, or little cells, which were on both sides in the north and south part, between the first and second gate over against one another for an abode of keepers o the gate and threshold and those that came in from abroad; which some hold to be a type and figure of the coming, entrance , admission, and receiving of members Of Christ into his house or (in a manner) under his roof, custody and protection on earth, and afterwards in the heavenly mansions. See Psalms 22.31 and 87,4,5,6 Isaiah 54.3 etc and 60.4, etc. Acts 2.41,42 etc. Matthew 25.10. Luke 16.9.] One reed the length, and one reed the breadth; and between the little chambers, [That is the place, one room, space between the little chambers] five ells, and the threshold [that is, both the thresholds] (as some) as Verse 6.] of the gate, by porch [or portal; and so in the sequel, as some do take this] of the gate within one reed.
\p
\v 8 . He measured also the porch of the house within [Or inward] one reed. [Others, and when he had measured etc and then Verse 9 then measured him, c.]
\p
\v 9 . Then Measured he the (other) porch of the gate, eight ells, and posts thereof [To wit, of the gate, or of the porch or portal] two ells: and the porch of the gate was within. [Others to wit, the porch of the gate within]
\p
\v 10 . And the little chambers of the gate of the way towards the east were three from this (side) and three from that side; [Hebrews three from hence, and three hence that is, from thence, the meaning whereof (according to the nature of the Hebrew language) is the fame that is here set down in the text: and so in the sequel] those three had one kind of measure: also posts on both (sides) and on that side, had one kind of measure.
\p
\v 11 . Moreover, he measured the wideness of the door of the gate thirteen ells.
\p
\v 12 . And there was a space, [Hebrews border bound] before [Hebrews before the face] the little chambers, of one ells (on this side) and a space of one ell on that side: and 9every) little chamber fix ells on this (side) and fix ells on that side.
\p
\v 13 . Then measured he the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another; [Others, from the roof of the little chamber to their roof, to wit the roof of the gates] the breadth was five and twenty ells: door was over against door.
\p
\v 14 . He made also posts of threescore ells: [That is, He measured them, as many understand this here, fifth the building was made or prepared already. See above verse 5.] namely, unto the post of the court round about the gate [Some hold the court of the lord (into which the people of God were wont to resort, whereof there were dives for the temple, as is related to the sequel) to be a type of the spreading out of the church of the new statement and branching out it feel to many particular churches gathered throughout the whole world but all pertaining to the body of the universal Church, and having fellowship and interest in the Lord Christ and his benefits, represented and figured out by the temple. See Psalms 87.4,5,6, Isaiah 54 2,3 & c. and 60.8, & c and 62.9 also Psalms 65.5 and 84.3 and 100.4, & c.]
\p
\v 15 . And from the fore-part {Hebrews face; and so in the sequel] of the gate of the entrance, [Or, where men come in] unto the fore-part of the porch of the inner gate, or (namely unto) the inner gate] were fifty ells.
\p
\v 16 . And there were shut windows [meaning glazed, or shut with glass: or straight narrow windows, (as if they had been shut) yet so as that they gave inwardly a fair light, (compare 1 Kings6 on verse 4.) typifying the true light, which the Lord Jesus Christ should bring into the church by his word and spirit See Isaiah 42.6,7 and 49, 6 and 60.19,20. Job1.7, 8. & 8.12 & R v. 21.23, 24, & c.] to the little chambers and to their posts inwards in the gate round about; so likewise to the porches: [ others galleries, arches] now the windows were round about inward, and upon the posts were palm-trees. [Others, now (upon) the windows & c and upon the posts were palm trees. The palm trees figured out the spiritual beautiful, ever flourishing, fruitful and incomparable condition of the church, see Psalms 92, 13 Cant.7.7, 8 Revelations 7.9.]
\p
\v 17 . Moreover, he brought me into the innermost court [which some call the women’s court] and so, there chambers, and a pavement that was made in the court round about; there were thirty chambers upon the pavement. [ in my fathers house there are many mansions, faith our saviour, Job 14.2 and on earth he provideth for his own a place and shelter against the storm, rain and scorching heat of the sun; that is, sure and lasting comfort in all affliction, see Isaiah 4.5,6 and 32.2, & c]
\p
\v 18 . Now the pavement was by the side of the gates, over against the lengths of the gates: [or, all along the gates] (this) was lowermost [Or, low] pavement [others, over against the length of the gates; (there was) the lower pavement. Some understand this thus, that this pavement did rise up high in the midst; and went flopping down the sides, that it might the better wash away all the foil and filth.]
\p
\v 19 . And he measured the breadth, from the fore-part [Hebrews face] of the lowermost gate, before the innermost court, [Hebrews before the face & c, or (as some) into the face, & c that is, unto the for-part of the innermost court] without, an hundred ells, eastward and northward.
\p
\v 20 . Now concerning the gate that looked the way towards the north, [Hebrews whose face was, &c. see verse 22] at the outermost courts: he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.
\p
\v 21 . And the chambers thereof, three on this (side), and three on that side, and the posts thereof, and the gates there of were [Hebrews was; to wit, each of them] after the measure of the first gate: fifty ells the length thereof, and the breadth of five and twenty ells, [Hebrews five and twenty in the ell]
\p
\v 22 . And their windows, and their porches, and their palm-trees, were after the measure of the gate that looked the way towards the east: and men went up [Hebrews they went up, or, there were to go up, as elsewhere often. Compare below verse 38, 41, 42.] Into it by seven steps, and the porches thereof were before them. [Hebrews, before their face. So verse 26]
\p
\v 23 . Now the gates of the innermost court was over against the gate of the north, and of the east: and he measured from the gate a hundred ells.
\p
\v 24 . After that he carried me the way towards the south, and so, the was a gate the way towards the south: and he measured the posts thereof, and the porches thereof, according to their measures [that is according as the other measures aforesaid were]
\p
\v 25 . And it had windows also in the porches thereof round about, like these windows: [as the other windows were] the length was fifty ells, and the breadth five and twenty ells.
\p
\v 26 . And the ascents thereof were of sever steps and the courts thereof were before them: and it had palm-trees one on this (side), and one on that [side upon the posts thereof.
\p
\v 27 . There was also a gate in the innermost court, the way towards the south, and he measured from gate to gate the way towards the south, a hundred ells.
\p
\v 28 . Moreover he brought me through the South-gate to the inner court: [meaning the second or middlemost court to distinguish it from the innermost or third court, verse 44] and he measured the south-gate according to these measures. [That is, as the others were: as above and in the sequel]
\p
\v 29 . And the little chambers thereof and the posts thereof, and the porches thereof were according to these measures; and it had windows also in the porches thereof round about: the length was fifty ells and the breadth five and twenty ells.
\p
\v 30 . And there were porches round about: the length was five and twenty ells, and breadth five ells [some transpose these words and read fifty for five ells, thus: the length was fifty ells and breadth five and twenty ells, by comparing of verse 21, 25, 33, 36.]
\p
\v 31 . And the porches thereof were in the outermost court, there were also palm-trees upon the posts thereof: and the goings up thereof were of eight steps.
\p
\v 32 . After that he brought to the innermost court, the way toward the east, and he measured the gate according to these measures.
\p
\v 33 . Also the little chambers thereof and the posts thereof, and the porches thereof were according to these measures; and it had windows also in the court thereof round about: the length was fifty ells and the breadth five and twenty ells.
\p
\v 34 . And the porches thereof were in the uttermost court; there were also palm trees upon the posts thereof, on this (side) and on that side: and the goings up thereof were of eight steps.
\p
\v 35 . After that he brought me to the north-gate: and he measured according to the measures.
\p
\v 36 . The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof and the porches thereof; it had also windows round about: the length was fifty ells and the breadth five and twenty ells.
\p
\v 37 . And the posts thereof were in the outermost court; there were also palm trees upon the posts thereof, on this (side) and on that side: and the goings up thereof were of eight steps.
\p
\v 38 . Now the chamber thereof and the doors thereof [Hebrews chamber-door; that is, everyone] were by the posts of the gates: there men washed the burnt-offering. [Hebrew they washed, or rinsed or c. or they should wash, &c. compare above verse 22 and see Exodus 29.17 Leviticus 1.9,13 and 14. Typifying the holy baptism, as also the spiritual cleaning and purifying which they have all need of that would serve God acceptably: whereof often mention is made in scripture. See Acts 22.16. Titus 3.5 and 1 Corinthians 6.11. 2 Timothy 2.21. Hebrews 10.22,23. James 4.8, &c, of burnt offering see Genesis 8.20. Leviticus 6.9. with the Annotat. Understant here the flesh that should be offered]
\p
\v 39 . And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this (side) and two tables on that side, to lay thereon the burnt-offering, [ that is, the cattel that were used for these offerings] and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering, [Hebrews sin: also, trespass, or guilt: as often in the sequel. See Leviticus 4. On verse 3. By this flaying, and consequently by these offerings or sacrifices was typified, first, the onely flay-offering, and sweet-smelling propitiatory sacrifice of the high priest Jesus Christ, presented unto us in the gospel, and signified and sealed by the blessed Sacraments, especially the Lord’s supper. Secondly, the work of the ministry, whereby men are as it was spiritually sacrificed, and prepared for an acceptable sacrifice unto God. Thirdly, the spiritual flaying, killing, and crucifying of selves, that is, the old man: and the thankfulness of believers, which they themselves, as spirituals priests, yea a royal priesthood, owe and offer up unto their savior. See Psalms 40.7,8,9. Isaiah 53.7, 10. Hebrews 10 1, 4,5, &c. Galatians 3.1 1 Corinthians 11.24,25. Also, Isaiah 66.20. Romans 15.15, 16. Philipans 2.17 and Malach 1.11 and 3.3, 3. 1 Peter 2.9. Revelations 1.6. Romans 6.6 and 12. 1 Colossians 3.5. Hebrews 13.15,16 c]
\p
\v 40 . there were also at the side [Hebrews shoulder, which is also taken for side so in the sequel] without the going up at the door of the north gate, two tables and at the other side which was the porch of the gate, two tables.
\p
\v 41 . Four tables on the (side) and for tables on that side at the side of the gate: eight tables whereupon slew. [Compare above Verse 22.3, 8]
\p
\v 42 . But the four tables for the burnt offering were of hewn stones, the length an ell and a half and the breadth an ell and a half, and the height an ell: now upon them men laid the furniture wherewith men flew [compare above verse 22, 38,41] the burnt offering and flay offering.
\p
\v 43 . Now the Hewn stones, [Compare Psalms 68, 14 with the annotate. Others, books; to wit to hang the beasts thereon, to flay off their skins or hide and so cut them into pieces, &c] were a hand breadth (thick), orderly placed in the house [or, within] round about: and upon the tables was flesh of the offering]
\p
\v 44 . And without the innermost gate were the chambers of the singers, [the Levites, that were appointed to praise God in his house with singing and playing of musical instruments. See 1 chronicles 6.31 and 16.4 and 23, 5, 30, 31. By these and other ministries mentioned in the sequel, in the description of the new house of the Lord, were typified the divers administration that are in the church of the new testament, as also in general divers exercise of Godliness amongst the members of the church that should assist their leaders and pastors, and should obediently follow them see Romans 12.6,7,8. 1 Corinthians 12.5, &c. Ephesians 4.11,12. 1 Timothy chapter 3. Titus chapters 1 and 2. Ephesians 5.19 Hebrews 13.7,17, &c] in the innermost court, [Meaning the most innermost or third court which was by the porch of this temple] which was at the side of the north-gate and forepart thereof [to wit, of the chambers] was the way towards the south: there was one at the side of the east gate, another (row of chambers,) c.] Looking the way towards the north [Hebrews the face of the way, c.]
\p
\v 45 . And he said unto me, this chamber [that is, chambers, of each of these chambers, as some understand this: so in the next verse. Compare below chapter 42.1,4, 5.] Whose fore-part [Hebrews face. So, in the next verse] is the way towards the south, is for the priests that keep the watch of the house. [That is, the service of the house of the God. Compare Leviticus 8 on verse 35 and Numbers 3 on verse 7 and below chapter 44.8,14,15. Some understand here and in the next verse, by comparing below chapter 44.10,14. The Levites reckoned among the priest, or their name, because they were given and added to the priests to help and assist them. See 1 chronicles 23.27,28 also Numbers 3.6,7,8,9 &c 18.2,3,4. Or called priests, (as also 2 Kings 23.9) because they had been formerly priest, but were degraded, as is said of some, below Chapter 44.12.13, 14. However is seemeth plain, that here a difference is made between the watch of the house and the watch of the Alter, as appeared in the next verse, as below chapter 44.14,15. Between the watch of the house and the watch of the sanctuary]
\p
\v 46 . But the chapter whose fore-part is the way towards the north, is for the priests that keep the watch of the Alter: [That is, the administration of the alter of burnt-offering; whereby some ( as in the former verse) understand the service of the Levites, which in they offering were to perform unto the priests by the Alter of the burnt-offering but the attentive reader may compare below chapter 44.15.] those are the children of Zadok, [see further of this man below chapter 44 on verse 15.] which out of the children of Levi come near to the Lord to the minister unto him. [ this coming near and approaching unto to the LORD (whereof also mention is often made in the sequel) was a type of the approaching and drawing near to Jesus Christ our mediator unto the father for us and consequently of the prayers and intercessions of pastors for their flock, and of all believers (as spiritual priests) in general by their prayers and services in the name of Christ see Jeremiah 30 on verse 21 and Romans 1.9,10, Ephesians 1.17, Colossians 4.12, Hebrews 13.17 also 10.19,22, &c)
\p
\v 47 . And he measured the court, the length a hundred ells, and the breadth a hundred ells, four-square: and the altar [The Altar of burnt-offering] was before the face] the house. [That is, the Temple. So, in the sequel. See chapter 41.1]
\p
\v 48 . Then he brought me to the porch of the house and he measured (each) posts of the porch, five ells on this (side) and five ells on that side: and the breadth of the gate, three ells on this (side), and three ells on that side:
\p
\v 49 . The length of the porch twenty ells and the breadth eleven ells; and it was with steps [without mentioning how many, as above verse 6] whereby men went up to it: there also pillars by the posts on this (side), and one on that side.
\c 41
\s The measures, pieces or parts, chambers and garments of the temple or of the holy place with the altar of the incense.
\p
\v 1 Moreover, he [the man, of whom above chapter 40.3] brought me to the temple: and he measured the posts, fix ells the breadth on this (side), and fix ells the breadth on that side, the breadth of the tent. [That is, (according to the opinion of some) as broad as the tent of the congregation, or tabernacle was, which was set up by Moses at God’s appointment: where there was a breadth of eight boards, each one ell or cubicle and a half broad, making together twelve ells. See Exodus 26.22,23,24,25. With Annotat.
\p
\v 2 . And the breadth of the door [Or, of the entry; to wit, of the holy place] ten ells and the sides of the door, five ells on this (side), and five ells on the other side; also he measured the length [Or, (as some) one length: likewise in the sequel, one breadth, which may agree in the sense with these words, the length and breadth when they followeth another length and breadth, as doth here verse 4.] thereof [to wit, of the temple] forty ells, and the breadth twenty ells.
\p
\v 3 . Then went he inward, [to the holy of holies, or the most holy place, as verse 4.] and measured the post of the door, two ells, and the door fix ells, and the breadth of the door seven ells.
\p
\v 4 . he measured also the length thereof twenty ells, and the breadth twenty ells before [Hebrews against, or before the face] the temples, and he said unto me, this is the holiness. [That is, the holy of holies or of the most holy place. See Exodus 26.35. And concerning the phase, Leviticus 2 on verse 3. And compare Cant.1 on verse 1. Here indeed mention is made of the fabric of the holy place, and of the most holy place, but not what was on them (as is well enough known concerning Moses his Tabernacle, and Solomon’s temple) beside the wooden Altar, below verse 22. Standing before the most holy place]
\p
\v 5 . And he measured the wall of the house, fix ells: [in thickness, as some take it, and the thing it self seemeth to show] and the breadth of (every) side chamber, [these side chambers were built without, round about the temple, compare 1 Kings 6.5,6,8,10. And see the Annotat. There] four ells round about the house round about.
\p
\v 6 . Now the side-chambers were side chambers above side-chambers, three, [That is, (according to the common opinion) each chamber-building had three stories and over them three chambers one above another] and that thirty times, [Or, (as others) three and thirty times; that is, there were thirty of such chambers, or (as others) three and thirty divided into ten, or (as others) eleven-chamber buildings, each building having three chambers one above another] and they entered into the wall which was at the house for those side chambers, round about, that they might be held fast: [Understand here a special wall, which was made at the wall of the temple for these chambers, as some expound it: but others conceive that they rested upon the beams which lay upon narrow rests of the wall of the temple under every story, without being fastened into the wall of the temple. Compare 1 Kings 6.6. With the Annotat.] For [or, but] they were not held fast in [or, on] the wall of the house.
\p
\v 7 . And it was for the side-chambers upwards towards above somewhat wider: for the house was compassed about [what this chamber-building] upwards towards above, round about the house; [or thus; and there was a widening and a winding about (or, going about; that is, a winding-stairs, as some conceive, by comparing 1Kings 6.8.) upwards above to the side-chambers; for the winding about the house (went) upwards towards above round about the house, c. others, for (the wall) was the longer the broader, in regard it was compassed above with side-chambers, &c.] therefore the breadth of the house was towards above; and so the lowermost went up to the uppermost through the middle-most. [That is, the lowest chamber increased by little, grew in breadth, so that the side-chambers waxed still broader or wider in regard of the narrowed rested of the wall of these chambers, or of the temple, as is noted on verse 6. Others, they went up from the lowermost (part) or the lowest, to wit, chamber, c.]
\p
\v 8 . And I saw the height of the house round about; the foundation of the side-chambers were of a full reed [Hebrew the fullness of a reed] fix ell, (the ell taken) to the hole. Otherwise every ell of the measuring reed was a common cubit, or ell-bowe, and but a hand-breadth more, above chapter 40, 5. Others fix ells to the end]
\p
\v 9 . The breadth of the wall, which was for the side-chambers [Hebrew side-chamber] without was five ells: And that which was left empty, was the place [Or, the weapon-space. Hebrew properly house, which is also elsewhere taken for places, see 2 Samuel 15 on verse17, c.] Of the side chambers that were at the house. [Or that were taken within]
\p
\v 10 . And between the chambers [That is, between the other chambers and these side-chambers [was a breadth [that is, a space, place] of twenty ells round about the house, round about.
\p
\v 11 . Now the doors of the side-chambers [Heb. The doors, or entry, opening of the side-chamber, that is, of everyone] were towards the (place) that was left empty, the one door the way towards the north, and the other door towards the south: and the breadth of the place that was left empty was five ells round about.
\p
\v 12 . Moreover, (of) the building that was before [Heb. Before the face] the place that was that was cut off in the corner by the way towards the west, [Heb. The sea, as throughout. By this wall some understand the wall on the east, south and north, which a back wall in the west, by which a part of the court was cut and separated. Compare chapter 42.1.] The breadth was seventy ells, and (of) the wall of the building the breadth was five ells round about and the length thereof ninety ells.
\p
\v 13 . Moreover, he measured [Or, so he, &c. the house, [The Temple] the length a hundred ells, also the place that was cut off, [or, so that c.] and the building, and the walls thereof, the length a hundred ells.
\p
\v 14 . And the breadth of the fore-part [Heb. Face] of the house, and of the place that was cut off towards the east, a hundred ells.
\p
\v 15 . He also measured the length of the building before [Heb. At, or against the face] the place that was cut off, which was behind it, and the galleries thereof [Or, separate walking places, walks paled off with pillars] thereof on the side), and on the side, a hundred ells: with the innermost Temple, and the porches of the court.
\p
\v 16 . The thresholds, and the shut-windows, [see above chapter 40 on verse 16.] and the galleries round about those three [or which had those three pieces round about, to wit (as some the) place that was cut off the temple and the outermost court. Others, in the three rows thereof. Compare chapter below chapter 42.3.] Over against the threshold were ceiled [Heb. Covering over, and overlaying; ceiling] with wood round about and (from) the earth [or ground. So verse 20] to the windows; and the windows were covered. [Or covered over, overlaid]
\p
\v 17 . To that which was above the door and [or namely] into the innermost and outermost house, and on all the walls round in the innermost and outermost (parts) (all by) measures [That is, it was all measured exactly and accurately.
\p
\v 18 . and it was made with Cherubim’s, [That is, forms or shapes of cherubim’s, that is, angels. See above chapter 10.15, 20.] And palm trees, [see above 40 on verse 16.] sp that there was a palm tree between cherub and cherub, and (every) cherub had two faces:
\p
\v 19 . Namely, the face of a man towards the palm tree on this (side) and the face of a young lion towards the palm-tree on that side: [To signify, that the Angelical understanding, will, affection and friendly service, are at Christ’s command, continually present in his house about the palm-trees, (that is, the righteous) and like young lion do boldly and with the strength and power which they have received from God, and defend it. Compare above chapter 1 on verse 5 and 10 and so Hebrews 1.14, &c. and likewise that all believers in general should be followers of the virtues of the holy angels, and each one in his calling, of their willing and servant obedience in executing God’s commands and so spiritual to adorn the house of God until they become in heaven like unto the angels of God. See chapter 1 on verse 9 and 11 also Luke 15.7,10. Hebrews 12.22. Revelation 19.10 and 22.9, &c. made in the entire house round about.
\p
\v 20 . From earth unto above the door, were cherubim’s, the palm-trees made, also (on) the wall of the Temple.
\p
\v 21 . The posts of the temple [Heb. The post, &c. that is, every post of the holy place, here distinguished by the name of temple from the most holy place which is called the sanctuary, or the holy place, in the words following, as also Leviticus 4.6 and 16.2,3,17,27. See the Annotat. There. So, likewise Psalms 20.3 c.] were four square: and concerning the fore-part of the sanctuary, [Heb. Face, &c. where the Altar stood before the Vail of the most holy place, whereof in the sequel] the (one) shape was as the (other) shape. [this likeness, uniformity is construed of divers things, but the nearest seemth to be, that we should understand it of the likeness of the posts or sides, and the Cherubim’s and palm tress, whereof is spoken in the former words, and verse 20.]
\p
\v 22 . The height of the wooden Altar [Hereby is meant the Altar of incense, standing before the holy of holies, called even now the sanctuary. In Solomon’s Temple and Moses his Tabernacle this Altar was overlaid with fine Gold. See Exodus 30.1,2. 2 Chronicles 4.19.] was three ells and the length [meaning the uppermost board or leaf whereon set the incense] thereof two ells, [The measures of this Altar were greater in this New Testament then they were formerly either in Moses his Tabernacle or in Solomon’s temple, typifying the intercession of our advocate the Lord Jesus Christ, who continually appeareth for us before the face of his father, not onely for believing Jews, but also for all believing Gentiles in all corners of the world: as all the prayers that we make, and ascend up before the face of the almighty God. See hereof 1 job 2.1,2. Also Psalms 141.2. Revelations 5.8, c. and it had its corners, and the length thereof, and the corners [that is, sides] thereof were of wood, and he [to wit, the man that led the prophet, and showed him all theses things. See above chapter 40.3] said unto me; this is the table shall be before the face of the Lord. [A most sweet and pleasant name given to the Altar of incense, intimating , that the LORD Christ is not onely our Altar, but also our host and table, inviting, entertaining, and satisfying all true faithful worshippers with the enjoyment and communion of his soul-saving merits, here initially and in part, and hereafter perfectly. Compare Psalms 16.11 and 23.5 and 36.9. With the Annotate. Proverbs 9.2, c. also Malachi 1.7,12. With Annotat. Matthew 8.11 and 22.2 c. Luke22.29, 30, Revelations 3.20.
\p
\v 23 . Now the temple and sanctuary had (both) two doors: [hereby we may understand with some the Lord Jesus Christ, presented in the scriptures of the New And Old Testament, by which two doors must all enter with true sincere faith into the blessed fellowship of Christ and his church. The Christian reader may compare Job 10.7,9. Acts 15.27, 1 Corinthians 16.8,9. 2 Corinthians2.12, Colossians4.3, Revelations 3.8, &c.]
\p
\v 24 . And there were two leaves at the door, (to wit) two leaves which one might turn about; or, wind about, fold about] two at the one door and two leaves at the other (door).
\p
\v 25 . And (there) were made on them, (namely) on the doors of the temple, Cherubim’s and palm trees, lie as there were made upon the walls: and the wood [that is, beams, thick planks] upon the fore-part [Heb. Face of the porch without was thick.
\p
\v 26 . And (upon) the shut-windows were also palm-trees on this (side), and on the side o the porch: and (upon) the side-chambers of the house, and (upon) the thick planks. [Or thus: and (there were) shut-windows and palm-trees on this (side), one and on that side of the porch, and upon the side chambers, c.]
\c 42
\s A description of the outermost court wherein the hinder part of the Temple stood, with the chambers thereof; verse 1 c. the use of those chambers, 13. The measuring of the whole outer wall, 15.
\p
\v 1 . Afterwards he, [The man mentioned above chapter 40.3.] brought me forth to the outermost court, in the west, wherein the hinder part of the Temple flood, and whereof a part was cut off. Compare above chapter 41.12 with the Annotat.] the way toward the way of the north: and he brought me to the chambers, [Hebrews chambers, that is, chambers chamber-building, row of chambers, as below verse 4,5. compare above chapter40.45,46. where also the singular number is used, but is not there expounded by the plural number, as is indeed done here in the sequel, and therefore it seemeth it ought to be so expounded in the fortieth chapter from this place: though some do here also retain the singular number in the text, as well as in the fortieth chapter] which were over against the place that was cut off, and which (were) over against the building towards the north.
\p
\v 2 . Before [Hebrews towards the face] the length of the hundred ells (towards) [Others, (was)] the door of the north; and the breadth was fifty ells:
\p
\v 3 . Over against twenty ells which the innermost court had, and over against the payment which the outermost court had, (was) gallery against [Hebrews against the face of] gallery in there (rows).
\p
\v 4 . And before [Hebrews before the face] the chamber was the walk of ten ells the breadth inward, (and) a way of one ell: and the doors of them [to wit, of the walks or galleries] were towards the north.
\p
\v 5 . Now the uppermost chambers were narrower: [Or straiter] Hebrew shorter] (because the galleries were higher than they) [or excelled them. Hebrews prevailed more than they overpowered them. Others, did eat of them, that is, by their height they took away from the uppermost chambers a great part of their room, as also the prospect into the Temple, and made them so narrow that they were unfit for dwelling, according to the opinion of some] then the lowermost and then the middlemost of the building. [Others, of the lowermost and of the middlemost were the building, that is, the lowermost and the middlemost were onely fit for dwelling.
\p
\v 6 . For they were indeed in three (stories), but had not pillars of the courts: therefore they were [Hebrews it] straightened more than the lowermost and the middlemost from the ground.
\p
\v 7 . Now the wall, [Meaning a partition-wall, making a partition. See of the Hebrews word, Psalms 62 on verse 4. So verse 10.12.] That was without over against the chambers the way to the outermost courts before [Hebrews towards the face] the chambers; the length thereof was fifty ells.
\p
\v 8 . For the length of the chambers which the outermost court had was fifty ells: and lo, before [Hebrews at or before the face] the temple was a hundred ells.
\p
\v 9 . Now form under [Or from the place] these chambers was the entry of the east, as one goeth into them from the outermost court. [Others, when he that had brought me in from the east from the place of these chambers, went into the other {chambers) out of the outermost court (and then so on in the next verse) then there were in the breadth, c.]
\p
\v 10 . In the breadth, [Or in, upon the thickness] of the wall of the courts, the way towards the east, before [Hebrews towards the face; and so straightway again] the place that was cut off, and before the building were chambers. [Meaning other chambers, or (as some) these chambers aforesaid]
\p
\v 11 . And the way [Or manner, situation] before [Hebrews before the face] then was like the shape of the chambers which were the way towards the north, according to their length, so (according to) their breadth: and their entire goings out were according to their fashions, and according to their doors. [That is, they were like unto them, in length, breadth, goings out, fashion and doors]
\p
\v 12 . And according to the doors of the chambers that were that way towards the south; there was a door in the head of the way, the way before the straight wall, [Hebrews in the face of the straight (Or immediately ascending, fair) wall. Others, the way directly, or immediately before the wall] the way towards the east, as one entreth into them.
\p
\v 13 . Then said he [That man above chapter 40.2] unto me; the north-chambers, and the south-chambers, which are before [Hebrews towards the face] the place that is cut off, they are holy chambers, [Hebrews chambers of holiness] wherein in priest that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: [Hebrews the holiness of holiness. So in the sequel. See Leviticus 2 on verse 3.] There shall they lay the most holy things, and [or namely] the meat-offering, [see Leviticus chapter 2] and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; [see above chapter 40. on verse 39.] for the place is holy.
\p
\v 14 . When the priests shall have entered in, [Into the sanctuary] then shall they not go forth (again) out of the sanctuary, [to wit, in, or with their holy garments, wherein they ministered] into the outermost court, but there [in the holy chambers] (they shall) lay their garments where they ministered, [Our high priest Christ Jesus is arrayed with sweet smelling garments of salvation, with the robe of righteousness wherewith he clotheth and covereth his church, Psalms 45.9. Isaiah 61.10 and 63.1. his ministries that approach unto the Lord must be arrayed with such virtues in particular as are required unto their office. See 1 Timothy 4.12. Titus 2.7 of the spiritual garments of the whole church see Psalms 45.14. Cant. 4.11. Romans 13.14. 2 Corithians 5.3. Galatians 3.27. Ephesians 4.24. Colossians 3.10. Revelations 3.4,5,18 and 19,8, c.] For there is holiness: [that it, exceeding holy. Meaning the garments, or the chambers, which were both holy: therefore they: therefore they were to put off the holy garments of their ministry and to leave them there] and they shall put other garments, and approach to that which is for the people. [That is, they must come into those places in the outer court, (as was said in the former words of this verse) which is for the common people, with other garments]
\p
\v 15 . Now when he had finished the measures of the innermost house, then he brought me forth the way towards the gate that looked the way toward the east: {Hebrews whose face (was) c.] and he measured it round about [the meaning is, he measured the east gate with the wall in its four-square, which compassed about the whole place of this whole new building, in the east, north, south and west. That is, he measured the whole circumference from the east unto the west. See above chapter 40 on verse 5.]
\p
\v 16 . He measure the east-side [Hebrews wind, (so in the sequel) that is, the side that lay towards the east-wind] with the measuring reed: five hundred rods, with [or after, from: and so in the sequel] the measuring, round about. [All along the whole side. So in the sequel]
\p
\v 17 . He measured in the north-side, five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.
\p
\v 18 . He measured the south-side, five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
\p
\v 19 . He went about to the west-side, [Hebrews the sea] (and) he measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
\p
\v 20 . He measured it on the four sides; it had a wall round about it, the length was five hundred (reeds) and the breadth five hundred: to make a difference between the holy and profane. [Hebrews, holiness, c. Meaning between the spiritual and ecclesiastical, temporal or civic, that is, between this holy circumference, 9see below chapter 43.12) and the city with her appurtenances, see below chapter 48.15. As there was also still some differences between the sanctuary and the places of the people. See above verse 14.]
\c 43
\s The glory of the Lord cometh from the east into this new temple and filleth it verse 1.2 c. the lord speaketh unto the prophet and promiseth that he will dwell there for ever among his people, and cleanse them from sin, which had caused him to remove out of the old temple 7. He commandeth the prophet to represent exactly this whole building unto the people to the end, that they may repent and be made partakers of this whole work of God’s grace 10. A general law concerning the holiness of this whole place, 12. The measure, dedication and use of the Alter for burnt-offering, 13.
\p
\v 1 . Then he led me to the gate, the gate that looked the way towards the east.
\p
\v 2 . And behold the glory of the God of Israel [Which was before removed from the Temple. See above chapter 1.28 and 10.4,18,19. With the Annotat. And compare Malachi 3.1] came from the way toward the east: and his voice [or found, noise] was like the noise of many waters, [or great waters, compare above chapter 1.24. where the majesty of God appeared like the majesty of a judge: as here on the contrary was a token of grace and mercy, when the glory of God returned to dwell in his own, and to restore it fully and perfectly, and to bless it. See the sequel] and the earth was enlightened [Hebrews gave light, or (hind] with his glory. [Compare Rev. 18.1 and 21, 23 and see Isaiah 60.19,20 c. Matthew 4.16. Acts 13.47. 2 Corinthians 3.18. and 4.6 c. Some conceive that light is here opposed to the cloud of the Old Testament. See 1 kings 8.10, 11, 12.]
\p
\v 3 . And so was the appearance of the vision [Or it was as the appearance of the vision] that I saw, as the vision that I had seen, when I came to destroy the city; [that is, when God sent me to declare in his name the destruction of Jerusalem, whereupon the destruction would certainly follow. See above chapter 9.10 & compare Jeremiah 1 on verse 10. The prophet doth intimate, that the same God did here manifest himself in grace and favor, which had there showed himself in great wrath & indignation] and there were uniforms like the uniform that I had seen by the river ch bar: and I fell upon my face. [See above chapter 1 on verse 28. so blow chapter 44.4.]
\p
\v 4 . And the glory of the LORD came into the house: [That is, the Temple] (by) the way of the gate, that looked the way towards the east. [Hebrews whole face was the way, c. as it was departed through the east-gate out of the former old Temple, (see above chapter 10.19.) to go afterwards and dwell in the new. See 2 Corinthians 5.17. Revelations 21.5. Also, Haggai 2.7, 8, 9. The Christian reader may also compare Luke1.78, 79.]
\p
\v 5 . And the spirit took me up [see chapter 2.22. and 3.12 and 8.3. with the Annotat.] and brought me into the innermost court: and behold, the glory of the Lord had filled the house. [Compare below chapter 44.4. and Exodus40.34,35.1. 1 Kings8.10.11. Jeremiah6.1 and 24.23 and 35.2 and 16.1,2. and 66.18,19. Hbak.2.14. Haggai2.7, 9. Zacchariah2.5. Matthew17.5. Job1.14 and 6.12,13. 1 Corinthians16.28.2. 2 Thessalonians1.10. 2 Peter 1.16,17,18. Revelation15.8. and 21.23. and 22.5.]
\p
\v 6 . And I heard one that spoke with me out of the house: [namely, the Lord, whose glory filled the temple, in the former verse: and who speaketh unto the prophet in the next verse. Compare above chapter 1.28 and 2.1] and the man [Others, a man. See above chapter 40 on verse 3.] Was standing by me?
\p
\v 7 . And he [The Lord that talked with me out of the house, as is said in the former verse] said unto me; child of man (this) this is the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, were I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, [Compare Leviticus26.11,12. Isaiah 60.13 and see Job 14.23. 1 Corinthians3.16, 17 and 6.19. Revelations 21.3 and 22.3, c.] forever. [see Jeremiah 31.32,33,36 and 32.40 and 33.20,21,25,26, c.] And those of the house of Israel shall defile no more [Hebrews the house of Israel shall defile no more [Hebrews the house of Israel defile, c. the verb in the plural number] my holy name [Hebrews the name of holiness: so in the sequel] they, no Kings by their wheredome, [that is, idolatry, all kind of superstitions, wil-worship, humane inventions, and traditions in the service of God. See Leviticus17. On verse 7 and 20 on verse 5.] And by the dead bodies of their kings, [that is (as some conceive) by the bodies of some deceased kings that were buried about the temple. Others understand hereby the bodies of those men whom they had slain and sacrificed by the honor of their idols, which idols they in a hethenish way were wont to call their kings, especially that same Molec, or Milcom, or Malcam, or Melech, c. that had the name thence. For Melech signifieth King. See Leviticus 18.21. Jeremiah48.7. and 1.15 and 5.26. with the Annotat.. Some understand it of the idols themselves, which are justly called dead bodies, because they are without life, and like a filthy rotten carcafe stink before God. See Leviticus 26.30 and Jeremiah16.18. With the Annotat.] (On) their high places: [or, (and) their high places; so that the high places (as often) are taken for a special kind of idolatry. The sum of all in brief is, by the gracious inhibition of my spirit, I will cause that my spiritual Israel (that is, my church) shall serve me holily, and be estranged from all that is repugnant thereunto, especially from all idolatry, whereof some kinds are related in the sequel of the abominations which the people of God had committed in Canaan. This may in a manner be applied (according to some) to the time of Ezra and Nehemia after the deliverance of the Jews out of Babel, although those men of God were sain continually to encounter with many gross abuses of the people, and the Jews afterward from time to time grew still worse and worse, (as appeared about the time of Christ’s coming) but all this looketh principally to the time of the Messiah, and sending forth of his spirit, and shall fully accomplished in the life to come in the heavenly Canaan, Revelation 21,27 and 22.3, c.]
\p
\v 8 . When they did set their threshold by my threshold, and their post next to my post, [That is, impudently brought into and committed in mine house all manner of idolatry, superstition and traditions of men, intending thus to serve me and the Devil together to build Temple by or in Temple, as it were in spite of me. Compare herewith above chapter 8 and especially verse 7, 8, 9, 10, c. and further 2 Kings16.14 and 21.7 and above chapter 23.39] (so) that there was (but) a wall between me and between them: [see above chapter 8.8,9. Others, and (made) a wall between me and between them; that is separated themselves from me by their abomination. See Isaiah 59.2.] And defiled my holy name by their abominations which they committed; wherefore I have confirmed them in my anger.
\p
\v 9 . Now [In the time of this new temple, when is shall bestow upon my people the aforesaid grace by the Messiah. And they shall put away their whoredom and the dead bodies of their Kings [as above verse 7.] far from me: and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.
\p
\v 10 . Thou child of man, show this house to the house of Israel, [that is, give them a fight of the fashion of this house, and show them the scope and meaning thereof. See above chapter 40.4.] that they may blush because of their iniquities: [by consideration of their own unworthiness, (as followeth) and this my underserved incomprehensible mercy which I promise unto my people, and will surely perform thereafter, as I have showed thee this new building; and they shall by the receive the pattern thereof, as followeth, and be able clearly to perceive by all that it is no devise or invention of thine, but my work] and let them measure the pattern. [Or the shape, having its due proportion, fashion, or form measure, c. (Compare 2 Chronicles 24. on verse 13.) so as thou at present hast seen it]
\p
\v 11 . And if they do blush because of all that they have done, then show them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, yea all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: [The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, to make it known unto him. Psalms 25.14. but not for dogs and swine, Matthew7.6.] And write it before their eyes, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them. [That is, picture it out or portray it unto them, and describe it unto them, that by true repentance they may seek to be living stones of this building, and likewise my spiritual house, &c. see 1 Peter 2.4, 5. and Ephesians 2.20, 21, 22.]
\p
\v 12 . This is the law of the house; upon the top [Hebrews head] of the mountain [some conceive, that God thus secretly pointeeth at the Jerusalem which is above, Galatian4.26. Compare Psalms15.1. Matthew 5.14. Hebrew 12.22.] the whole limit thereof round about shall be an holiness of holiness, [that is, most holy, a most holy place: because the Lord had now hallowed all things, and the father and the son by the Holy Ghost had taken up their had taken up their habitation there, sanctifying all the elect; howbeit the church militant initially and in part, by degrees and measure, but the triumphant perfectly and completely.]
\p
\v 13 . And these are the measures of the Altar [Meaning the altar of burnt-offering, typifying the Lord Jesus Christ with his onely propitiatory sacrifice, with whom all the faithful in the four corners of the world have fellowship, likewise in and upon whom they offer up unto God their spiritual sacrifices. See Hebrew13.10. And 1 Peter2.5.] After the ells, the ell being an elle and a hand breadth: [see above chapter 40.5.] the bosom [or lap. That is, the foot or bottom, which beneath compassed about and received (as it were) into its bosome all tat rested upon it, and fasted, and upheld the same. See the next verse. And verse 17.] Then one ell, [meaning in height] and one ell the breadth, [that is, thickness] and end thereof [Hebrews about a span: and this is the back [that is, the lowermost part, the stay of all the rest, as when one lieth upon his back] of the Altar.
\p
\v 14 . Now from the bottom (upon) the ground, unto the lowermost draught, [that is, lat sticking out, compassing about and as it were butting forth. Hebrews help] two ells, and the breadth one ell; and from the least settle to the greatest settle source ells, and the breadth one ell.
\p
\v 15 . And the barel, [That is, the hearth, gridiron, or place above upon the altar, where the wood and the sacrifices were laid and burnt, called barel, that is, the mountain of God, by reason of its height, (as some conceive) because they went up to it by steps, below verse 17. and Ariel, that is, the lion of God, because it consumed the offerings as a strong lion that devoureth all that before him. See Isaiah 29. on verse 1 and compare Exodus 27.4 with the Annotat. So is our altar (the Lord Jesus Christ) indeed and in truth as a mountain of God, whither all believes, both Jews and Gentiles, from all corners of the world go for refuge and ascend; and the lion of God, the lion of the tribe of Juda, that consumeth and devoureth all the sets it self against us. See Isaiah2.2, 3 and 60.7. And 63.1,&c. Revelation5.5.] Four ells: and from the Ariel and so upward, the four horns. [Compare Exodus27.2. with the Annotat.]
\p
\v 16 . Now the Ariel, twelve (ells) the length, with twenty (ells) the breadth; four squares in the four sides thereof [Hebrews four quadrangles or four square nesses: as above chapter 1.8. see there. So in the next verse]
\p
\v 17 . And the settle [or (every (settle) fourteen (ells) the length, with twelve (ells the) breadth in the four sides thereof: and the edge about it half an ell, and the bosome thereon, [as above verse 13.] an ell about; and his steps looking towards the east.
\p
\v 18 . And he said unto me, child of man, thus faith the Lord LORD; these are the ordinances of the Altar, [that concern the altar, that were to be observed both in the making of it, and ministering at it] In the day when they shall make it: to offer burnt-offering thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.
\p
\v 19 . And thou shalt give to the Levitical Priests that are of the seed of Zadok, [see above chapter 40.46. and below chapter 44.15.&c.] which approach unto me (faith the Lord) to minister unto me, an heifer, a young bullock [Hebrews a son of bullock: and so in the sequel] for a sin offering.
\p
\v 20 . And thou shalt take the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the edge round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it. [Forasmuch as neither altar nor sacrifice had of themselves any ceremonial cleanness or holiness, neither would bring any to the person that was unclean, therefore all things were first to be purged and consecrated by blood, typifying the spiritual purging of our consciences, services, and heavenly things by the precious blood of our Lord Jesus Christ; for application or imputation whereof the ministers of Christ as his instruments are serviceable unto us by the sincere preaching of the Gospel concerning Christ crucified, and the administration of the holy sacraments, prayers, &c. as the Levitical priests did in the time of the ceremonial law. See Hebrews 9. From verse 9 to 24. And 2 Corinthians 3.6. And 4.5,7. Galatians 3.1, &c. Compare above chapter 40 on verse 39.]
\p
\v 21 . After that thou shalt take the bullock of the sin-offering, and he shall burn it in an appointed [Or, commanded] place of the house without the sanctuary. [Compare Hebrews 13.11, 12]
\p
\v 22 . And on the second day thou shalt offer a perfect he-goat for a sin-offering: and they shall cleanse the Altar, like as they cleanse (it) with the bullock.
\p
\v 23 . When thou shalt have made an end of cleansing it (then) shalt thou offer an heifer, a perfect young bullock, and a perfect ram of the flock.
\p
\v 24 . And thou shalt offer them before the face of the Lord: And the priests shall cast salt upon them. [Compare Leviticus 2 on verse 13. Numbers 18. On verse 19. 2 Corinthians13 on verse 5. also Matthew 5.13. Mark9.49, 50. Colossians 4.6] and shall offer them (for) a burnt-offering unto the LORD.
\p
\v 25 . Seven days shalt thou prepare every day an begoat for a sin-offering: they shall also prepare [Others, as they, c. shall have prepared] a heifer, a young bullock, and a ram of the flock 9both) perfect.
\p
\v 26 . Seven days shall they purge the Altar and cleanse it, and fill the hands thereof. [That is, dedicate and consecrated it to a holy use. Compare Leviticus 7. On verse 37. And 8.33, c. Others, they shall (every one) fill his hands; that is, hallow and consecrate themselves for the offering up of sacrifice upon the altar.]
\p
\v 27 . Now when they shall have ended these days, then it shall come to pass on the eighth day, and so forward, that the priests shall prepare your burnt-offerings and thanksgiving upon the altar; [see above chapter 40 on verse 39. and here above on verse 20.] and I will take pleasure in you, saith the Lord LORD.
\c 44
\s The special use of the east-gate of the sanctuary for the prince, verse 1,7c. The Lord whose glory was in the temple, speaketh again unto the prophet, exhorteth him to go on, with a command to reprove his people for their former putting in of unlawful, unmet and unfit ministers into his house, 4 who are to be utterly removed from thence, 9 who shall be abased in their ministry, 10. The children of Zadok are settled in their ministry, instructed concerning their duty, and assured of their maintenance, 15.
\p
\v 1 . Then he caused me to return the way (towards) the gate of the outermost sanctuary, which looked towards the east: and the same was shut.
\p
\v 2 . And the Lord said unto me; this gate shall be shut, [That is, continue shut, see Jeremiah 27 on verse 22. so in the sequel] it shall not be opened, neither (shall) any man enter in by it, because the Lord, the God of Israel entered in by it: [see above chapter 43.2,4.] therefore it shall be shut.
\p
\v 3 . The Prince, [Or Ruler: whereby (with some) we may here understand the high priest, (see Jeremiah 35 on verse 4.) typifying our Lord Jesus Christ, as the only high priest, also prince, ruler, and King (above chapter 34.22,23.) of his church: or (as others) the Lord Christ himself, who is the Lord of this spiritual house, and onely fit to approach unto God in our behalf, and to appear before his face, (see Jeremiah 30 on verse 21.) who alone knoweth and revealeth the Father, alone shutteth and openeth, the onely gate and door of heaven, who alone hath opened and prepared for us the way and entrance into the sanctuary, and is set as king at the right hand of the majesty of God, taking his joy and delight in his work of grace and spiritual building, whereunto this whole vision hath principally respect. Compare Matthew 3.17. And 11.17. Job 1.18 and 3.13. and 10.9. Hebrew 6.19,20. And 8.1,2. And 9.8. And 10.19,20. Revelation 3.7 and 5.5, c. likewise Isaiah 53.11.] the prince he shall fit in it, [or by it] to eat bread before the face of the Lord: [that is, to take their repasts (as was done aforetime with part of the offerings) and consequently to converse famithartly before the face of the Lord. Compare Exodus 29. Leviticus 8.31. And 24.9. And further genesis 31. On verse 54. These circumstances seem to put a difference between this Prince, and the prince of whom is spoken below, Chapter 45 and 46. But both the princes (the high priest and king) may be considered as types, (each in his own particular, and according to the nature of things) of the Lord Jesus Christ. See the former Annotat.] He shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go out by the way of the same. [Or his own way]
\p
\v 4 . Then brought he me the way of the north –gate, before [Hebrew towards the face] the house, and I looked and behold, the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the LORD: then I fell upon my face. [As above chapter 43.3.]
\p
\v 5 . And the Lord said unto me; child of man, set thine heart upon it, and behold with thine eyes, and bear with thine ears all that I shall speak with thee, concerning all the ordinances of the house of the Lord, and concerning all the laws thereof: and set thine heart upon the entrance of the house, with all the going s forth of the sanctuary.
\p
\v 6 . And say to the rebellious one, to the house of Israel, thus saith the Lord, it is too much for you, by reason of all abominations, o house of Israel: [That is, ye have been too gross and too exorbitant in your ways, let it suffice, you must needs cease from, &c. Compare Numbers 16.3. 1 Kings 19.4. with Annotat. So below chapter 45.9. by this inserted reproof God would a new instruct his people, (to whom the prophet was commanded to show this vision) and acquaint them with their abominable sins, for which he had forsaken the former temple, city and land, to end that by true repentance and faith they might see to have fellowship with this new undeserved work of grace, which God would effect and bring to pass by the Messiah, and was typified by this vision.]
\p
\v 7 . seeing that ye have brought in strangers, [Hebrew children, or sons of a stranger, or one; that is, such as no Israelites, nor were in covenant with God, nor were members of his Church. See 2 Samuel 22.45. with Annotat. So verse 9. Or, faith as were not of the family of the priests, as Leviticus 22.10. (see the Annotat there) and were moreover wicked, as followeth] uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, [some take these to be two sorts of ministries of the sanctuary: some being Israelites, but wicked; other aliens, and not Israelites, utterly estranged from God and his people. Others understand here such as had neither any true godliness within, being wicked both in heart and life. See deutronomy 10.16. Jeremiah 4.4 and 9.25,26. with the Annotat.] to be in my sanctuary to prosane it, [by their unworthiness, idolatries, superstitions, and humane traditions. Compare 2 Kings 23.5. 2 Chronicles 34.5. and above chapter 43.7,8. with the Annotat.] (to wit) mine house: when ye offered my bread, [that is, meat. Meaning those things that were offered. See Leviticus 3 on verse 11 and 21.8. Numbers 28.1. Mal. 1.12.] the fat and the blond, [Compare below verse 15 and Leviticus 3.16,17. but they had offered these but unlawful and wicked priests] and they broke my covenant, [they, to wit, the strange priests, doing contrary to all mine ordinances, and so breaking and disannulling the covenant of the priesthood] beside all your abominations. [over and above other abominations which ye have committed yourselves. Others, for, because of, in regard of, &c.]
\p
\v 8 . And ye have kept the watch [compare above chapter 40.45. with Annotat.] of mine holy things; [Hebrews, of my holiness] but ye have for yourselves set (some to be) watchmen of my watch in my sanctuary. [Whom ye have chosen yourselves, without and against my command]
\p
\v 9 . Thus saith the LORD; no stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised to flesh enter into my sanctuary, [Hebrews every child, or son of a stranger, &c. shall not &c. that is, none of them, none than is in regard of faith, or doctrine and life. Here now follow the laws concerning reformation in church-offices showing who are unfit or fit for the same. Compare the Apostolical commands, especially in the epistles to Timothy and Titus: also Revelations chapter 2 and 3 c. of any stranger that is in the midst of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 10 . But [or, yea also, even, &c.] the Levites [hereby some understand the priests, that were of the Levites, descended from Ithamar and Arathar, from verse 13 and the opposition of verse 15. and above chapter 40.46. and 43.29. see 1 Kings 2 on verse 27.] that are gone away far from me, with Israel went astray, which went astray from me after their dung-Gods; [see Leviticus 26 on verse 30] shall indeed bear their iniquity. See Leviticus 5 on verse 1. this is a representation of the disciple which ought to be exercised in the church of God against all such ministries of God’s house, that departing from the true service of God and religion, are become unfaithful to God and his church, when they come to represent thereof. Compare 2 Kings 23.9. With the Annotat. There]
\p
\v 11 . Wit they shall be ministers, in my sanctuary, [be in meaner and lower places then there were formerly, as followeth; (that is, they shall be degraded). See 1 Chronicles 23.28,29. Also Numbers 3.7,8. And below verse 14.] (in) the offices at the gates of the house; and they shall minister to the house; they shall flay the burnt-offering and the flay-offering, for the people, and shall stand before their face to minister unto them.
\p
\v 12 . Because they ministered unto them [unto the people] before the face of their dung-gods, and were a stumbling block of iniquity unto the house of Israel: therefore I have I lift up mine band [that is, I have sworn. See Genesis 14. On verse 22.] Against them, saith the Lord LORD, that they shall bear their iniquity.
\p
\v 13 . And they shall not come near unto me to execute the priest office unto me, and to come near to all mine holy things, [Hebrew holiness] to the most holy things; [or in the most holy places. Heb. Holiness of holiness] but shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.
\p
\v 14 . therefore I will make them watchmen of the watch of the house [compare above chapter 40.45. with the Annotat. And here above verse 11.] in all the service thereof, and in all that shall be alone therein.
\p
\v 15 . But the Levitical priests, [others, the priests (and) the Levites. Compare above chapter 40.45,46. With the Annotat] the children of Zadok, [that is, the posterity of Zadok, who descended from Aaron by Eleazar and phinchas, (to whom an everlasting priesthood was promised, Numbers 25.13.) and was made high-priest in Abrathars Stead. See 1 Kings 2.27,35. with the Annotat. Zadok signifieth as much as to be righteous, or a justified man] that kept the watch of my sanctuary, [faithfully and constantly performed their office, or continue pure and in the faith, and in the true worship of God] when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and shall stand before my face, to offer unto me the fat and the blood, faith the Lord LORD. [these children of Zadok are here set forth as a pattern of all lawful, worthy and fit ministers of the church of Christ, (the king of righeousness, and high-priest after the order and manner of Melchezedek) who are here placed, honoured and blessed by God in their ministry.
\p
\v 16 . They shall enter into my sanctuary and they shall come near to my table [see above chapter 41 on verse 22.] to minister unto me: and they shall keep my watch. [See Leviticus 8 on verse 35 and Numbers 3 on verse 7.
\p
\v 17 . And it shall come to pass, when they shall enter in at the gates of the innermost court, that they shall put on linen garments;] which are pure, bright, white, pleasant, not cumbersome, or hindering them in the service, as a woolen garment is, whereof is spoken in the sequel. See of the priestly garments, above chapter 42 on verse 14 and compare Matthew 17.2 and 28.3. Revelation 4.4 and 7.13] but no wool shall come upon them, when they minister in the gates of the innermost court, and temple.
\p
\v 18 . Linen quorf, shall be upon their head. [the Hebrew word rendered here quorf, hath its name from adorning and the covering of the head is taken for a token of subjection and submission, 1 Corinthians 11.10. so the ornament of ministers is to submit and to be subject unto their head Christ. Compare exodus 28,40 and 39.28] and linen drawers shall be upon their loins: they shall not gird themselves in the sweat, [or with sweat. That is, so, or with such girding or clothing that they should sweat with: or (as some) on the sweaty places of their body, where a man commonly sweateth most. Others, according to the sweat. Some hold this to be a representation of the heedfulness and purity of the heart, which ought to be in ministers of God’s church in the performing of their ministry.]
\p
\v 19 . And when they go forth into the outermost court, (namely) into the outermost court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and flay them away in the holy chambers: [Heb. Chambers of the holiness. See above chapter 42.14.] And shall put on other garments, that they may not hallow the people with their garments. [by touching of the holy garments, which were anointed with the holy oil, and were onely for the priests, that were consecrated for the service of God, which consecration might not be communicated unto others. See Exodus 29.37 and 30.29. Also below chapter 46.20. Some take it, as if God would thereby forbid his ministers to carry a hypocritical show of holiness before the congregation, and on the contrary would command them to be familiar with and among their brethren. Compare Matthew 6.5, 6,16, 17, 18.]
\p
\v 20 . Neither shall they shave their head off, [to wit, with a rafour, as some take it] nor suffer (their) locks to grow long: [Hebrew suffer them to shoot out, shoot forth; that is, suffer them to grow long] they shall decently poll their heads. [Heb. Polling they shall poll. Others, quite, or every manner of way cut off, and then in the former words, shave. The Hebrew word is onely found here. The meaning of this verse is, they shall not have their heads quite bold, nor let their hair grow exceeding long, but shorten, cut off, or shave it moderately. Compare Leviticus 21.5 signifying honesty, modesty ad sobriety in life and conversation.
\p
\v 21 . Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they shall enter into the innermost court. [Heb. Every priest shall not, &c. the verb in the plural number. That is, he shall execute his ministry with a sober, attentive, considering and holy mind, and avoid all things that might any way hinder him in it. Compare Leviticus 10.9. 1 Timothy 3.3. Titus 1.7. also Matthew 24.48,49,&c.]
\p
\v 22 . Neither shall they take (their) wives a widow, or her that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the feed of the house of Israel, or a widow that shall have been the widow of a priest. [this ordinance doth intimate, that which might any waies prejudice the honour and dignity of their ministry or occasion a scandalous ordering of their family. Compare 1 Tim. 3.2,4. also 1 Cor. 7.39 and 9.5.]
\p
\v 23 . And they shall teach my people (the difference) between threshold and profane, and show the difference between the unclean and the clean. [compare Leviticus 10.10 and above chapter 22.16. Malach.2.7 and 1 Tim.6.20 and 2 Tim.1.13 and 2.15,16. Tit.1.9. Revelations 2.2,14,15,16,20, c.]
\p
\v 24 . And upon a controversy they shall stand to judge; [or abide by judgment; that is, steadfastly persevere in that which is just and right and agreeable to my word. Compare 2 Kings 23 on verse 3 and the phrase also Deut. 25.8.] they shall judge it according to my judgment: [compare Deut.17.8,8,9, c. 2 Chronicles 19.10,11. this hath respect to the Ecclesiastical judicature, or the judgments which ought to be kept in the house of God by ecclesiastical assemblies according to the word of God, for the instructing of the conscience in matters of faith and life, removing and preventing of scandals and preferring of peace and unity among brethren] and they shall keep my laws and statutes [compare 1 Tim.13.14,&c.] on all mine appointed feasts, [others, in or with all mine assemblies; that is, the one as well as the other; whatever is ordained by me, they shall keep it, especially that which concerneth the congregations of believers and the public worship of God in them] and hallow my Sabbaths. [See Exodus 20 on verse 8 also Hebrew 4.9, 10, 11.]
\p
\v 25 . Neither shall any of them go into a dead man, [Hebrew he shall not, &c. that is, none of the priests] that he should be unclean; but for a father, of for a mother, or for a son, or for daughter, for a brother or a father that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves [compare Leviticus 21.1,2,3,4,&c. this ordinance enjoyeth such moderation in mourning, as that the service of God be regarded, and the bond of nature and of the spirit be not despised among Christians, and also the hope of eternal life be not obscured among them: with an acknowledgement of our frailty and defect herein, for which we are to crave pardon in and through Christ. Compared 1 Thess. 4.13, &c. also John 11.33,35. Acts 9.39.]
\p
\v 26 . And after his cleansing, [the cleansing of the priest, that defiled by reason of a dead man. Compare Numbers 6.9, c. and 19.11, 12, c.] They shall reckon unto him seven days.
\p
\v 27 . And in the day when he shall go into the holy place, into the innermost court, to minister in the holy place, be shall offer his sin-offering, saith the Lord, LORD.
\p
\v 28 . (Now) this shall be unto them for an inheritance: I am their inheritance ye shall give them no possession in Israel; I am their possession. [Compare these laws with Numbers 18.8,20,24. Deuteronomy 10.9. And 12.12 and 14.27 and 18.1, 2. And 26.12. By them a due maintenance is ordained by God for the Ministers of the church. See Matthew 10.11 and Luke 10.7. 1 Corinthians 9.4, 6, 7, c. and very plainly, verse 13, 14. there]
\p
\v 29 . The meat-offering, and the sin-offering, and the guilt-offering, they eat them: also every burnt thing [Heb. Ban. See Leviticus 27. On verse 21.] In Israel shall be theirs.
\p
\v 30 . And the firstling of all the fruits [or, of that which first cometh] of all things, [that is, of all manner of things: and so in the sequel. Heb. The first, the chiefest of all the firstlings of all things. See Exodus 13.2 and 22.29,30. Numbers 18.11.] and every heave offering of all things, [or, every oblation, &c.] of all heave offerings, shall be the priests: ye shall also give unto the priest the firstlings of your dough, [compare Numbers 15.20. Nehemiah 10.37. &c.] To cause the blessing to rest upon thine house. [Compare Deut. 14.29. and see the contrary above chapter 5.13.]
\p
\v 31 . No carcass, nor that which is torn of fowls, or of cattle, shall the priest eat. [Heb. Every carcass, &c. shall they (the priests) not, &c. that is, no carcass, nothing torn. Compare Exodus. 22.31. Levit. 22.4,8 and above chapter 4.14 signifying, that the minister of the church ought to be unrebukeable, and holy, not prone to destroying, anger, making prey, filthy lucre. Compare 1 Timothy 3.3. Matthew 23.25. Which also ought to be recommended to all believers, (as spiritual priests) as this law was likewise given to all Israel, Exodus 22. 31.]

\s A separation of a certain portion of new land, hereditary land of inheritance, for the sanctuary, the priests, Levites, the city and the prince, verse 1, c. a promise and exhortation for the princes of Israel, concerning judgment and justice, 8,9,&c. Ordinances concerning manifold offering, for the people and the prince, both ordinary and on the feasts, 15.
\p
\v 1 . Now, when ye shall cause the land to fall for inheritance, [that is, shall by the falling or casting of the lot divide the land among you. See Psalms 16.5,6 with the Annotat. So below chapter 47.14,22. and 48.29. in every café fee the phrase in the casting or drawing of lots; though the lot be not expressly mentioned here, nor in the sequel. And it is worthy observation, that the tribes had their borders assigned to them not by casting of lots, as in the book of Joshua, but the express ordinances of God, in c. 48. compare Matthew25.34.] then shall ye offer a heave-offering unto the Lord, [or, gifts, &c. Heb. Heave a heaving: whereby respect is had to the heave-offering of the law, that were (as it were) lifted up, or taken up from the rest, and were presented and consecrated unto the Lord] (for) a holy place of the land; [to wit, separating it from the rest of the land for a holy life. Or, we may (with some) joy these words to the word offering, thus, ye shall offer unto the Lord a holy portion of the land: so verse 4. Heb. A holiness. Forasmuch as not onely the former temple was burnt, but also the city and all the land laid waist. And the people of God carried away captive, and in the former chapters is treated of the new temple; therefore now in the sequel here mention is made of the land and the people with their prince, representing a full and perfect restauration of this spiritual common-wealth under the Messiah] the length shall be the length of the five and twenty thousand (measuring reeds), and the breadth thousand: [This that is here inserted is taken from above chapter 42.15,16,17,18,19,20 and here the next verse; where after the first measure of the reeds, the ells in particular are specified, for the empty, or free outward space] that shall be holy [Heb. A holiness. See above chapter 43.12.] In the whole border thereof round about. [That is, as wide and as far as it reacheth]
\p
\v 2 . At this (there) shall be [Heb. Shall be, in the singular number] for the sanctuary five hundred with five hundred square round about: [Or, by, &c. that is, (according to the opinion of some) five hundred reeds in length, with like five hundred reeds in length, with like five hundred in breadth: Or five hundred answering to other five hundred measured in the square round about. Compare below chapter 48.20.] And it shall have fifty ells for an outer space round about. [see of the Hebrew word rendered here space, (which otherwise is rendered suburbs, when there is mention made of cities) above chapter 36 on verse 5. this matter that is begun here, and broken off verse 9 is prosecuted in chapter 48 on verse 8, c. we may in general sitly understand it (with some) thus: that this separate portion of the land of five and twenty thousand reeds in the length and breadth, and so forth in four square, was further divided into three parts; the first ten thousand in breadth, for the sanctuary with its outwards space, and the habitations of the priests: the second ten thousand for the Levites, the remaining five thousand for the city: and which remained eastward and westward, between the south-borders of Juda and the north-borders of Benjamin, for the offices or ministers of the city, (chapter 48.18,19.) and besides chiefly for the prince: which is to be heeded in the sequel]
\p
\v 3 . So of this measure [that is, with, according to this measure] shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand? And the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary, (with) the holy of holies. [Heb. Holiness of holiness. See Exodus 26.33,34 Leviticus 4.6. With Annotat.]
\p
\v 4 . That shall be a holy place of the land; [as verse 1 it shall be for the priests which ministers in the sanctuary, which come near to minister unto the Lord: and it shall be unto them a place for houses, and a holy place for the sanctuary.
\p
\v 5 . Moreover, the Levites, the ministers of the house, shalt have the length of five and twenty thouse, and the breadth of ten thousand, [see below chapter 48.13.] for a possession into themselves (for) twenty chambers.
\p
\v 6 . And (for) the possession of the city [Which is not named. See above chapter 40. On verse on verse 2.] Ye shall give the breadth of five thousand, and the length of five and twenty thousand, over against the holy heave-offering: [Heb. Heave-offering of holiness: whereof above verse 1. so in the sequel] it shall be for the whole house of Israel.
\p
\v 7 . Now the Prince shall have (his portion) on this (side) and on that side of the holy heave-offering, and of the possession of the city, before [Heb. Before, or toward the face. So in the sequel) the holy heave-offering, and before the possession of the city; from the west corner westward, [Heb. Corner of the sea, toward the sea. So in the sequel, sea for west] and from the east-ward: and the length shall be over against one of the portions, from the west-border unto the east-border. [by this prince (of whom much is spoken in this and the next chapter) some understand (as above chapter 44.3.] the high priest, or our Lord Jesus Christ the Messiah himself, who not onely dwelleth in his house, and filleth it with his glory, but also (in manner) encampeth round about it, as a King to defend and protect it: and was our high priest and surety, having taken all our debts upon himself, hath made full payment and satisfaction for them, (as if they had been his own) and hath willingly offered up himself for us, as if it had been for himself because he stood in our room: yea, who is not onely a King or Prince, but also a brother and companion of believers, whom he maketh joint-heirs with himself, being continually in the midst of them, and with them unto the end of the world, making intercession for them as their mediator, having alone powder and priviledge to go in and out where over he lifteth, to lay down his life and take it again, to open and shut the gate of the sanctuary, &c. Others understand here a political or civil Christian Prince or ruler, and thereby also all Christian rulers and magistrates (which God would grant unto his church in the new testament, according to sundry prophesies of the old testament) whose first and chiefly care should be for the welfare of God’s church, which they ought as it were to compass about with their protection, and in the exercise of the true worship of God, and due reverence and respect to the ministers, God’s Ministers of the church, to go before the people by their own example, and likewise to behave and carry themselves herein as brethren, companions and fellow-members of the church: moreover, to practice and maintain judgment and justice, to extirpate all injustice, oppression, tyranny and violence, and take care that their subjects may lead a quiet and peaceable life, until perfect justice, holiness and peace do thereupon follow in that life which is to come.
\p
\v 8 . As for this land it shall be unto him a possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people, [compare Psalms 72.2,4,14. Isaiah 11.3,4,5, c. and 29.18, 19.20 and 42.1,3,4 and 60.17,18 Zeph. 3.13] but (shall) leave [Heb. Properly give] the land to the house of Israel, according to their tribes.
\p
\v 9 . Thus saith the Lord LORD, it is too much for you, ye princes of Israel; [see above chapter 44 on verse 6. as if God had said; you have land more than enough for yourselves in that which I have proportioned out for you, therefore, &c. Others take it to be a rhetorical reproof of the deceased kings of Juda, to whom God speaketh as if there were present: or of the antichristian ecclesiatistical and political tyrants, that that should forely and a long while plague and torment the people of God] remove violence and destruction, and do judgment and justice: take up your thrusting out from my people. [In that ye drive them away, and thrust them out of their possessions, drawing the same unto yourselves: such oppression shall ye take away from them, and free them therefrom. See the like phrase Isaiah 57.14] saith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 10 . Ye shall have a just balance, [Heb. Balance, or scales of justice: and so in the sequel; as Leviticus 19.33.] And a just Epha, [of Epha see Levit. 5. on verse 11.] and a just bath. [See of bath 1 kings 7. on verse 26.]
\p
\v 11 . And Epha and Bath shall be [Heb. shall be, in the singular number] of one kind of measure, [an Epha in dry, and a Bath in moist wares, [that a Bath may contain the tenth part of a Homer: [The greateth measure of dry wares, otherwise also called Cor. See 1 Kings 4 on verse 22 and below verse 14] also an Epha tenth part of a home; the measure thereof shall be after the homer. [As being the greatest measure, according to which other measures were to be regulated]
\p
\v 12 . And the shekel [see of this Genesis 23 on verse 15. and 24 on verse 22.] shall be of twenty Gerahs: [Of Gera see Levit. 27 on verse 26. it is with us (as some have fitly counted it according to our coin) as much as a half penny and a little more, whereof twenty make about half a ryx-doller; as much as a common or civil shekel (whereof mention Is made here) is in value] five and twenty shekels, and fifteen shekels shall be unto you a pound. [Heb. Maneh; that is mina. See 1 Kings 13.10,17. 2 Bron 9.16. Ezra 2.69 with the Annotat. The meaning is that threescore shekel makes a pound or mina of gold or silver. This is counted by some to be new ordinances, in regard the old mina contained but fifty shekel of the sanctuary and a hundred common shekels; but here mention is made of threescore shekels, which must need be so much more both in the holy and civil pound or mina. Some are of opinion that there were three such sorts of coins that made together a pound or mine. It implieth, that justice shall be kept in the strictest and most exact manner]
\p
\v 13 . This is the heave-offering that ye shall offer: [Or, the offerings which, c. Heb. The heaving that ye shall heave. Some understand this of tat which the people should bring in all the year long for the ordinary offering of the temple. Others apply it to the dedication of the temple. Of the offerings in general see above chapter 41 on verse 39.] The sixth part of an Epha of a Homer of wheat, also ye shall give the sixth part of a homer of barly. [Heb. As if one should lay, ye shall fix, &c. that is, gives the sixth part: as tithing is giving the tent part]
\p
\v 14 . Concerning the ordinances of oil, of a Bath of oil (ye shall offer) the tenth part of the Bath out of a Cor, [see above on verse 11.] which is a Homer of ten Baths: for ten Baths are a Homer.
\p
\v 15 . Moreover, one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the watry land of Israel; [That is, out of the best and fattest pastures of Israel. Others, above the wines or the drink of Israel that this which Israel should bring in for drink offering. Compare verse 17.] For a meat offering and for a burnt-offering, and for thank-offering to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord LORD
\p
\v 16 . All the people of the land shall be in this heave-offering [Or, shall be (bound or engaged) for this heave-offering whereof mention was made before] for the prince of Israel. [Or, for the prince his sake, &c. some understand this thus, that by this contribution should supply that which otherwise the prince was to do. Compare 2 chronicles 31.3 with the Annotat. Others, with the prince, &c. like wise, unto the prince; so as that the prince was not bound to it, as whose particular offerings are related in the sequel. It might be also taken as the substance or contents of that which followeth and thereunto thus’ concerning the prince of Israel: or of the prince, c. 9as the like is found in other prophets) he shall do as followeth]
\p
\v 17 . And it shall lie upon the prince [Heb. It shall be upon the prince: that is, it shall be his duty] (to offer) the burnt-offerings, and the meat-offering on the feasts, and on the new moons, and on the Sabbaths, on all appointed solemnities [Or, in all appointed assemblies] of the house of Israel: he shall perform [or prepare’; that is, give, bring in, cause to be prepared] the sin-offering, and the meat-offering and the burnt-offering and the thank-offering, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel
\p
\v 18 . Thus saith the Lord LORD; in the first (moneth) on the first (day) of the month, that shalt take a perfect young bullock; [Heb. Chills or son of a bullock] and thou shalt cleanse the sanctuary [some have rightly observed, that this ensuring ordinances was no where given unto Moses, as also besides the difference that there is between new offerings and ceremonies that are mentioned here and the old former sacrifices and ceremonies, may appear by comparing both together: which doth signify the repealing of the old ceremonies and of the former priesthood by the manner of writing, coming and the onely perfect sacrifice of the Messiah, which is here typified by the many sacrifices according to the style of the Old Testament and the condition of those times when the clearness of light and the time of reformation was not yet come. See Galatians 3.23,24,25 and 4.1,2,3. Also Hebrws 9.8.10.]
\p
\v 19 . And the priest shall take of the bloud of the sin-offering and put it upon the posts. [Heb. Post: and so in the sequel] of the house and upon the four corners of the settle of the Altar: and upon the posts of the gate of the innermost court.
\p
\v 20 . So shall thou also do on the seventh (day) in that moneth, because of him that erreth, and because of him that is simple: so shall ye reconcile the house. [that is, for such as it as it may be through error, or simplicity, ignorance, want of the understanding have offended, or defiled the house of God, but not through wilfulness and with a high hand; this ordinances representing how we should fuccor and restore him that is fallen through weakness and repenteth of his sin, namely, by means of a well-ordered and Christian discipline. Compare Matthew 16.19. And 18.18, 21, c. Job 20.23. Romans 14.4, 10, 13, Galatians 6.1, c. James 5.19, 20.1 Job 5.16,c.]
\p
\v 21 . In the first (month) on the fourteenth day of the month, shall the Passover be unto you, a feast of seven dayes; unleavened bread (loaves) shall men eat [Heb. Shall be eaten.]
\p
\v 22 . And upon that day the prince prepare for himself and for all people of the land, a bullock of sin-offering, as continually in this matter. See Leviticus 4 on verse 3.]
\p
\v 23 . And the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt-offering unto the Lord, seven bullocks and seven rams, (that) are perfect, daily, the sevent days (long;) and a sin-offering of a he-goat daily.
\p
\v 24 . He shall also prepare a meat-offering, an Epha for a bullock and an Epha for a ram, and hin [see Leviticus 19 on verse 36.] of oil for an Epha.
\p
\v 25 In the seventh (moneth) on the fifteenth day of the moneth; shall he do the like [Heb. According to, or like that: that is, so as he hath done on the former feast, with all these offerings that are mentioned before and are here briefly touched upon] on the feast, [meaning the feast of leaf-hats, or tabernacles. Observe that the feast of Pentecost is not here mentioned. Compare Zach. 14 verse 16, 19.] Seven days (long) as the sin-offering, as the burnt-offering, as the burnt-offering, as the meat-offering, and as the oil.
\c 46
\s Ordinances for the Prince in particular in the worship of God, and for the people of the land and the prince together, verse 1.2 &c. Also, of the continual burnt-offering, 13, and of the gifts of the prince to his sons and to his servants, 16. A description of the kit chins for the priests and Levites, 19.
\p
\v 1 The faith of the Lord; the gate of the innermost court, [Where the altar of the burnt-offering was] that looketh towards the east, shall be shut the other fix working days, but on the Sabbath it shall be opened; [Compare Exodus 20.9. Some conceive, hat hereby is typified, that we see but afar off, and as it were through a glass darkly in this life, but we shall see face to face in the life to come, on the everlasting rest or Sabbath-day; 1 Corinthians 13.12. Hebrews 4.9, 10, 11. Compare Exod. 20.10,11. Also Col. 2.16, 17.] It shall also be opened on the day of the new moon. Compare Isaiah 66.23.]
\p
\v 2 . And the prince shall enter (by) the way of the porch of the gate without, and stand by the post of the gate; and the priests shall prepare his burnt-offering and his drink-offering; and he shall worship [Heb. bow down himself. See Gen. 24 on verse 26. So in the next verse] at the threshold of the gate, and (then) go forth: but the gate shall not be shut until the evening. [Compare Mat. 25.10, 11, 12]
\p
\v 3 . Likewise the people of the land shall worship (before) the door of the gate, [Or for the people, c or that the people of the land may worship, c] on the Sabbath, and on the new moons, before the face of the LORD.
\p
\v 4 . Now the burnt-offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD, shall be on the Sabbath day, fix perfect lambs, and perfect ram. [Compare this new ordinance with the old, Num. 28.9,10. The old was much less because the grace of the New Testament (as some observe) is much more glorious then the former, and extended it self much wider]
\p
\v 5 . And meat-offering, Epha for a ram, but for the lambs, the meat-offering shall be a gift of his hand: [That is, according to his ability, according as the Lord hath received of the Lord. Compare verse 7.11 and Deut. 16.] And oil, an bin to an Epha.
\p
\v 6 . But on the day of the new moon, a bullock, a young bullock [Heb. a son of an ox] of the perfect, and fix lambs, and a ram; they shall be perfect. [Compare this new ordinance with Numb. 28.11,c. The old was greater because the light (as some interpret it) was then much less]
\p
\v 7 . And (for) the meat-offering, shall be prepared on Epha for the bullock, and an Epha for the ram; but for the lambs so as his hand shall attain unto, [Or shall have gotten. Compare above verse 5 and the phrase with Num. 6.21 also Lev. 5.11. And 12.18 and 14.21 and 25.28, c] and an bi of oil to an Epha.
\p
\v 8 . And when the prince entreth, he shall go in (by) the way of the porch of the gate, and (he shall) go forth [Or go on] (again) by way thereof. [Or his way]
\p
\v 9 . But when the people of the land came before the face of the LORD on the appointed solemnities; he that entreth in (by) the way of the north-gate to worship, shall go out (again by) the way of the south-gate: and be that entreth (by) the way the way of the south-gate, shall go forth (again by) the way of the north-gate: he shall not return (by) the way of the gate whereby he went in, [Some compare this with Luke 17.32. ! Cor. 9.24. Phil 1.13,14 also Gal. 4.9. and 5.7. 2 Peter 2.20, 23, 22.] But (shall) go forth straight forward [Others, they shall go forth right over against it]
\p
\v 10 . Now the prince shall go in the midst of them, [to wit, among the people of the land] when they go in, and when they go forth, [Others, go on: and so immediately again] they shall go forth (together)
\p
\v 11 . Moreover, on the feasts and on the appointment solemnities, the meat offering shall be an Epha to the bullock and on Epha to a ram; but to the lambs, a gift of his hand: [as above verse 5.7] and oil, an hin to an Epha.
\p
\v 12 . And when the prince shall make a free-will-offering, a burnt-offering, or thank-offering (for) a free-will-offering unto the LORD, one shall then open him the gate that looketh towards the east; and he shall make his burnt-offering and his thank-offerings, according as he shall have done on the Sabbath-day: and when he goeth forth (again) one shall shut the gate after that he shall be goneforth.
\p
\v 13 . Moreover, thou shalt dayly prepare aperfect lamb of a year old [Heb. a son of his year] (for) a burnt-offering unto the LORD: thou shalt prepare it every morning. [Heb. in the morning, in the morning, that is, every morning. So in the sequel. Compare this ordinance with Num. 28.3,4. Here no mention is made of the evening sacrifice. Compare Hebrews 9.26]
\p
\v 14 . And thou shalt add thereto (for) a meat-offering every morning a fixth part of an Epha, and oil a third part of a hin, to drop the meal floure: (for) a meat-offering unto the LORD, (for) everlasting Ordinances [Heb ordinances of eternity] continually.
\p
\v 15 . They shall then prepare the lamb and the meat-offering, and the oil every morning, (for) a continual burnt-offering, (properly ascension) of continuance]
\p
\v 16 . Thus saith the Lord LORD; when the prince shall give a gift (of) his inheritance unto any of his sons [Or children] his sons shall have it: [it shall continue to be his sons, they shall keep it. So in the sequel] it shall be their possession by inheritance.
\p
\v 17 . But when he shall give a gift of inheritance to one of his servants, he shall have it to the free year; [otherwise called the year of Jubile. See Levit. 25.10, c.] Then it shall return to the prince: it is indeed his inheritance, his sons shall have it. [As for the lord Christ, he giveth to his elect and true children durable and everlasting gifts, an everlasting inheritance, and that of his own, for all that the father hath is his, John 16.15 and he is heir of all things, Heb. 1.2. doing with his own what he will, Matth. 20.15. But unto others, which do also like servants’ minister in his house, he giveth temporal gifts. Compare Matth. 7.22,23 and 23.21,23 and 35.14, c. Luke 19.1, &c. and see John 8.35, &c. it may be also a lesson for Christian magistrates of liberality and rewarding of good services, also of justice towards their subjects: and so in general a lesson of enjoying our own possessions and such as are justly and honest gotten, &c.]
\p
\v 18 . And the prince shall take nothing of the people’s inheritance, to bereave them [Or thrust them out] of their possession; he shall leave inheritance to his sons of his (own) possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his inheritance.
\p
\v 19 . After that he brought the entry which was at the side of the gate of the holy chambers, [Heb. chambers of holiness] (belonging) to the priests, [or to the priests] which looked towards the north: and behold there was a place on both sides towards the west. [Heb. Toward the sea]
\p
\v 20 . And he said unto me, this is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt-offering, and the sin-offering: [That is, the flesh of those sacrifices. So verse 24. [Heb. trespass and sin] (and) where they shall bake the meat-offering, that that they should not bring it out into the outermost court, to sanctifie the people, [that is, whereby the people should be sanctified: which might not be, since God had in a special manner chosen and sanctified the priests for the work of his holy ministry. Compare above chap. 44 on verse 19. By the priests boyling and baing the offerings in the place aforesaid, is typified the work of the ministry in all the particular churches and flocks of Christ, where the faithful teachers and pastours do feed themselves and the sheep of Christ with the wholesome and saving doctrine of the gospel, and prepare, present, and apply it unto the people, as sound and wholesome food for their souls, together with the administration of the blessed sacraments, & Christian church government, according to the exhortation, Acts 20.28. 1 Peter 5.2, c. See also Matth. 24.45. Job 21.15,16,17. 1 Tim. 3.13 and 4.16. Rev. chap. 2 and 3.]
\p
\v 21 . Then he brought me forth into the outermost court, and carried me about in the four corners of the court: and behold, to every corner of the court (there) was another little court, [Heb. a court in a corner of the court, a court in a corner of the court, that is, in every corner of the great court there was a little court]
\p
\v 22 . In the four corner of the court (there) were little courts with chimneys; [Or smoke-places. Heb. as if one should say, chimneyed or smoked; that is, made with chimneys or holes to convey the smoke away. Others, joined, as kitchins are often joined to the building: but this cannot take place without changing of a letter in the Hebrew word] of forty (ells) the length, and thirty the breadth: those four corner-little-courts [meaning the forementioned four kitchens that were in the corners of the court. Heb. square or cornered] had one kind of measure.
\p
\v 23 . And there was round about in them [In the kitchins] a ring-wall [In Hebrew word signifieth properly a row, or an high building, that goeth all along like a raw. Some understand it not of a wall, but of a high sloping roof for defence of the building] round about those four: and there were made kitchins [or boiling places; or it was made (with) c.] below (at) the ring-wals [others, under the portals, or little courts: meaning that they boiled and dressed their meat below as in kitchins, and id eat above] round about.
\p
\v 24 . And he said unto me, these are the kitchins, [Heb. the house, or the place of cooking ones of them that cook] where the ministers of the house shall cook the slay-offering [that is, the flesh of the slay-offering, as verse 20] of the people.

\p
\v 1 Afterwards he brought me again into the door of the house [The new temple and the sanctuary, (as verse 12) which indeed was before in Jerusalem, but was now destroyed. Compare Isa. 2.3. Mich. 4.2. Zach. 14.8. Also Luke 24.47,49. Acts 1.8 and 2.2,4 and Rev. 22.1. Where it is said, that these wholesome streams of Jerusalem and Zion (whereof in the sequel) proceeded from heaven, & out of the throne of God and of the lamb] and behold there flowed forth waters, [typifying the wholesome & saying doctrine of the gospel, abundant gifts of the holy ghost, under the New Testament. Compare Isa. 11.9 and 12.3 and 51.1. Jerem. 31.9. Joel 3.18. Zach. 14.8. Likewise Isa. 35.7. And 41.18. And 44.3. Joel 2.28. Job 7.38 and Revel. 22.1] from under the threshold of the house towards the east; for the forepart [Heb. face] of the house was (in) the east: and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, from the south [or toward, at the south; that is, the south side] of the altar. [meaning the altar of burnt-offering that before the holy place: of which see above chapter 43.13, c. a type of our Lord Jesus Christ, and his only sacrifice upon the cross: where he merited for such the gifts of the Holy Ghost, which he sendeth to us from the father; typified (as some conceive) by the water that flowed forth out of his side, Job 19.34, 35.]
\p
\v 2 . And he brought me out (by) the way of north-gate and carried me about (by) the way without unto the outer-gate, the way that looketh toward the east: and behold the waters sprang out of the right side.
\p
\v 3 . (Now) when that man went forth (toward) the east, there was then a measuring line in his hand: and he measured a thousand ells, and caused me to pass through the waters, (and) the waters reached unto the ankles, [Heb. (they were) waters of the ankles; and so in the sequel, waters of the knee waters of the loins, typifying the progress, course and increase of the revelation of the gospel together with the divers measures of the gifts of the holy ghost in this life, and the perfection thereof in the life to come.]
\p
\v 4 . Then he measured (yet), and caused me to go through waters, and the waters reached unto the knees: and he measured (yet) a thousand, and caused me to go through, c the waters reached unto the loins.
\p
\v 5 . Moreover, he measured (yet) a thousand, and it was a brook where I could not pas through: for the waters were high waters, where one was sain to swim through; [Heb. waters of swimming] a brook were one could not pass through.
\p
\v 6 . And he said unto me; child of man, hast thou seen it? [That is, heeded all; whereby the prophet was instructed diligently to heed or mind all things] then he caused me, and brought me again to the brink [Heb. lip. And so in the next verse] of the brook.
\p
\v 7 . When I returned, behold there were then at the brink of the brook very many trees on this (side) and on that side. [shadowing out the multitude of the elect, which by virtue of these waters should every where in God’s house grow and be fruitful in all good works, to the honour of God, and to the edificat on their neighbor, as verse 12 is further related. See Psalms 1.3 and 92.13. Isaiah 44.3,4. And 55.11,13. Jeremiah 17.8. Job 15.2, c. 1 Cor. 3.6,7, c.]
\p
\v 8 . Then said he unto me, these waters flow forth towards the foremost Galilee, [Or east-Galilee, whereby some understand a part of Galilee lying beyond the Jordan, where Corazim also lay at the east side of the Galilean sea, or the sea of Genes areth, where the Jordan ran through. But this ought especially to be compared with Isaiah 8.23. and 9.1. Mat.4.12,13,14,15. Where it is related that the light of the gospel did likewise first arise in these countries. See further of a twofold Galilee, 1 Kings 9 on verse 11. Otherwise it might also be generally taken for the east countries or borders: also for the country of Gilgag, out of Joel 18.17 compare with Jos. 15.7. lying also in the east side of Jerusalem, but that way they went through the plains of Jericho, Jeremiah 52.7,8. Also 2 Samuel 2.29 and 17.29. and so forth over the Jordan toward the plain of Moab, whereof in the sequel] and go down into the plain: [of the Moabites see Numb. 22.1 Deut. 1.1 and 3.17 and 34.1,8.] after that they go into the sea; [the dead sea or salt sea, where Sodom and Gomorra were in times past, and where Engedi and En-eglaim lay, whereof verse 10. See further Gen. 1 on verse 3.] Being brought forth into the sea, the waters [of the Dead Sea, which were deadly before] become wholesome.
\p
\v 9 . Yea it shall come to pass (that) every living soul [That is, all living creatures, that have life, and sense and motion in them. See Gen. 1 on verse 20.] Which moveth, [see Gen. 1 on verse 20.] Whither forever one of the two brooks come, [Heb. the two brooks shall come; the verb in the singular number; that is, on of the two. It seemeth that these waters in running along divided themselves into two parts, through this be not mentioned here: see Zach. 14.8. Or else we may with some take the dual number for the plural (as else where is often done) and render it, streams] shall live, & and there shall be very much [or great excellent. So verse 10] fish; [because these waters shall come thither] by the great store of fish here mentioned, understand the multitude of the elect, that should be certainly converted by the breaching of the gospel, & by the powerful working of the holy Ghost] and they [the other waters by the flowing in of these] shall become wholesome, and every thing shall live whither this brook shall come.
\p
\v 10 . Also it shall come to pass, that there shall stand fishers [that is, teachers of the new Testament, who as instruments of the powerful working Holy Ghost, shall by the net of the Gospel draw up men out of their sinful and deadly condition to the fellowship of Christ and his benefits. See Matth. 4.19 And 13.47. Luke 5.10. By it, [the Dead Sea] from Engeds [formerly called Hazeron-Tamar, lying by the Dead Sea. See Genes. 14.7. 1 Sam. 24.1. 2 Chron. 20.2. with the Annotat.] unto En-eglaim; [lying also by the dead sea, where the Jordan runneth into it] there shall be (places for) for the spreading forth of nets: [or fish, above chap. 26.5] their fish [to wit, the fish of the fisher which they shall catch: or the fish of the aforesaid waters] shall be according to its kind as the fish of the great sea. [The mid-land sea, so distinguished from the land seas or lakes. So verse. 15, 20.]very manifold [or great, glorious. So verse 9.]
\p
\v 11 . but the misery places thereof, [Namely, of the Dead Sea] and the marshes thereof shall not become wholesome, [Others, which shall not become wholesome, c.] there are given up to salt. [See Deut. 29.23. Psalms 107.34. Jerem. 17.6. Heb. 6. Hereby may be understood the difference that there shall be between the elect, that shall be partakers of the grace aforesaid, and the reprobate, that shall continue ad perish in their filthiness and sin. See Acts 13.48. 2 Cor. 2.15, 16, c. some join this verse to the former in another sense, thus: the misery (places) and the marshes, and the Moorish places thereof, I say, which were not wholesome, which were delivered to the salt: meaning they shall all become wholesome and abounding with fish. Others, the misery places thereof, and the marshes thereof which were not wholesome are giving to salt. That is, for any use and service. Whereof the attentive reader may judge]
\p
\v 12 . Now by the brook, upon the brink, [Heb. lip] thereof, on this (side) and on that side, shall come up all manner of trees for meat, [Heb all trees of meat, that is, all manner of trees bearing fruit, that are fit for meat, or eatable. See above on verse 7.] Whose meat shall not fall off, [see Psalms 1 on verse 3] neither (shall) the fruit thereof perish, [or cease, be consumed] it shall bring forth new fruits [or excellent fruits, like the first ripe fruits, which are very acceptable. See Mich. 7.1] in his moneths; [that is, those trees shall bear new fruit every moneth. Compare Rev. 22.2] for their waters, [beside which they grow, and wherewith they are watered] they flow out of the sanctuary; [see above on verse 1 therefore they shall surely prosper and bear fruit] and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for healing. [Or stamping, beating; as we used to beat leaves or herbs sin all to use them in physic-drinks or plaisters]
\p
\v 13 . Thus saith the Lord LORD; this shall be the border (according to) which ye shall take the land for (your) inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel: [Compare with the borders mentioned in this chapter, Numb. Chap. 34 and Jos. Fro chap. 15 to chap. 20. And see the Annotate by comparing them together the difference will appear that is between both; which ay be a further motive unto us to contemplate and meditate on the spiritual Israel and heavenly Canaan] Joseph (two) strings. [That is, portions, which were wont to be measured out with strings or cords. See Psalms 16 on verse 5, 6. One line or portion was for Mansseh, and one for Ephraim. See below chap. 48.4,5 and Gen. 48.5. 1 Chron. 5.1, 2.]
\p
\v 14 . And he shall inherit it, one as well as another: Heb the man as his brother; that is, one shall inheritance as well or as much as another, for there will be room enough to made or be prepared by Christ in the heavenly Canaan or in the house of our heavenly father for all believers, Job 14.2. See further in the next chapter] (concerning) which I lifted up mine hand, [that is, swore. See Gen. 14 on verse 22] to give in unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance. [To wit, by lot: that is, ye shall divide it by casting or drawing of lots. So above chap. 45.1 and below verse 22. To signifie that it was a gracious gift of God and a filial inheritance: but se above chap. 45 on verse 1. If it be taken that it is as much as if the word lot were express in the text, then the casting of drawing of lots may be applied to every one particular portion; for the common borders of the tribes are expelled by God in the next chapter]
\p
\v 15 . Now this shall be the border of the land at the north corner, from the great sea, [As above verse 10. But in these parts it was also called the sea of Phoenicia or Syria] the way of Herhlon, where one cometh to Zedad.
\p
\v 16 . Hamath, Berotha, Sibraim that is between the border of Damascus and between the border of Hamath: Hazer-Hattichan, [or the villages that are in the midst, with &c.] which is by the border of Hauran. [Heb. Hauran; also the country laying at the east end of Labnus over the Jordan, where it taketh its original]
\p
\v 17 . So the border from the sea shall be Henzar-Enan, the border of Damascus, and the North-ward, and the border of Hamath: and (that) shall be in the North-corner.
\p
\v 18 . Now the east-corner ye shall measure from between Hauran, and from between Damascus, and from between Gilead, and from between the land of Israel by the Jordan; [Where the Jordan taketh its original] from the border unto the East-sea: [that is the salt-sea, or the Dead-sea] and that shall be the East-corner.
\p
\v 19 . And the South-corner south-ward, [Others, towards Teman; that is, Edom, where one Teman lay. See Jeremiah 49.7. the sense agreeing, for Edom lay in the south of Canaan] from Tamar, [laying over against the east-end of Edom, on the wilderness of Tsin, or Kades, where the city of Kades is also placed by some maps, by the water of strife, or water of Meriba, where Miriam, Aarons sister, died and was buried. See Numb. 20.1,13,14, &c and 27.14. So below chapter 48.28.] unto the water of strife of Kades, (so on) towards the brook, [the river Sichor. See Jos. 13.3 and 15.47. also 1 Chron. 13.5. With the Annotate.] Unto the great sea: [the mid-land sea: as above verse 10 and here in the next verse] and (that) shall be the south-corner south-war.
\p
\v 20 . And the west-corner, [Heb. corner of the sea. See Genesis 12 on verse 8] the great sea; from border still where one cometh right against Hamath: that shall be the west-corner.
\p
\v 21 . Now ye shall divide thus land unto you according to the tribes of Israel.
\p
\v 22 . But it shall come to pas, that ye shall cause it [The aforesaid land] to fall for inheritance [To wit, by lot, as above verse 14 and chapter 45.1] for you, and for the strangers that sojourn in the midst of you, that shall have begotten children the midst of you; and they shall be unto you as a native among the children of Israel; they shall fall into inheritance with you [that is, have their lot as well as you, the lot shall be likewise cast for them in the midst of the tribes of Israel. [By this new ordinance is signified that the Christian church that as to partake the benefits of Christ, and inheritance the heavenly Canaan, should not only conflict of Jews, but also (according to the manifold prophecies of the Old Testament) of Gentiles, or all nations, without difference or distinction. See Acts 25.7,8,9. Rom. 3.29. And 4.11, &c. and 10.12 and 15.9, &c. 1 Cor. 12.13. Gal. 3.28, 29. Eph. 3.6. Colos. 1.12 and 3.11. Revel. 7.9, 10, &c.]
\p
\v 23 . Also it shall come to pass, (that) in the tribe among whom the stranger Sojourneth, there shall ye give (him) his inheritance, saith the Lord LORD. [Wheresoever he shall joyn himself to the obedience of the gospel and the true church of Jesus Christ, (which is the spiritual Israel and feed of Abraham) he shall be reckoned among the whole body of the church, and a fellow-heir with Jesus Christ]
\c 48
\s The direction of the new land of inheritance amongst the twelve tribes of Israel, so that the place (whereof there was first mention made chapter 45) which was set apart for the sanctuary, the priests, Levites, city, and the prince, came to be divided between the seven northern, and the five southern tribes, verse 1 &c. the measure, and gates of the new city, with the names of the gates, and of the city, 30
\p
\v 1 Now these are the names of tribes: [so as they one next to another shall have their inheritance] from the end northward, at the side [Hebrews hand: so immediately again] of Hethlon, were one cometh to Hamath, [here beginneth the description of the first portion, which Dan should possess] Hezar-Enan, in border of Damascus, north-ward at the side of Hamath, (he(Dan, as appeareth by the sequel] shall also have the east (and) west-corner) [That is , that which lieth from the aforefaid north border, between the east and west-border in breadth. So, in the sequel. Hebrews the sea-corner. So, in the sequel. The south corner is not mentioned, except in the holy separate portion and in general of all Israel, (after Gad, Verse 28.) which some hold to be token of the spreading forth of the kingdom of Christ unto the ends of the earth] Dan(shall have) one (line). [That is portion. This is here and verse 23 inserted to fill up the sense, from chapter 43.13.And must be like-wise so understood in the sequel. Here and in the sequel, as also above chapter 47.14. appeareth again a manifest difference between the former old canal, and this new spiritual Israel. For before the inheritance was unequal, here is equality in the fellowship of the saints and spiritual children of Abraham, every tribe having as much as any (notwithstanding some particular difference in the placing) and are quite other waies placed then they were before. Also the order of naming or reckoning up of the tribes (which beginneth in the North at the meanest and formerly most sinful tribe of Dan) is worthy our observation. In Revelations 7.5 &c. Dan is left out: see there]
\p
\v 2 . And by the border of Dan, from the east-corner unto the west-corner, Affer one.
\p
\v 3 . And the border of Affer, from the east-corner unto the west-corner, Naphtali one.
\p
\v 4 . And by the border of Naphtali, from the East-corner unto the West-corner unto the West-corner, Manasseh one.
\p
\v 5 . And by the border of Manasseh, from the east-corner unto the west-corner, Ephraim one.
\p
\v 6 . And by the border of Ephraim, from the East-corner unto the West-corner, Reuben one.
\p
\v 7 . And the border of Reuben, from the East-corner unto the West-corner, Juda one.
\p
\v 8 . And by the border of Juda, from the East-corner unto the West-corner shall be the heave-offering, [See above chapter 45.1,2, c. with the annotate. There] which ye shall offer, five and twenty thousand and (measuring reeds) in breadth, and the length as of one of the (other) parts, from the East-corner unto the west-corner and the sanctuary will be in the midst of it.
\p
\v 9 . The heave-offering which ye shall offer unto the LORD shall be the length of five and twenty thousand, and breadth of ten thousand.
\p
\v 10 . Ant therein shall be the holy heave-offering for the priests, northward (the length) of five and twenty thousand and west-ward the breadth of ten thousand, and east-ward the breadth of ten thousand and south-ward the length of five and twenty thousand: And the sanctuary of the Lord shall be in the midst thereof.
\p
\v 11 . It shall be for the priests, that are sanctified, [Hebrews that is &c. that is, everyone that is consecrate] of the children of Zadok, which have kept my watch: which w.nt not astray when the children of Israel went astray; like as the other Levites went astray. [Or, when, &c. that is, when the (other) Levites went astray.]
\p
\v 12 . And that which is offered of the heave-offering of the land shall be unto them a holiness [See Leviticus 2; on verse 3.] by the border of the Leviticus.
\p
\v 13 . Moreover, the Levites shall have over against the border of the priests, the length of five and twenty thousand, and breadth of ten thousand: the whole length shall be five and twenty thousand and the breadth ten thousand.
\p
\v 14 . And they shall not fell of it, neither change, nor alienate the firstlings of the land: [That is, that which is given and consecrated to God, as the first-fruits of the land were wont be consecrated to him] for it is a holiness unto the LORD.
\p
\v 15 . But the five thousand, (that is) that which is left in the breadth before [Hebrews at the face] the five and twenty thousand the same shall be profane, for the city, for dwelling, and for suburbs: [That is, it shall be a common place for a common and civil use, being profane in comparison of the other place, that was in a special manner consecrated and set apart for the service of God, and for the consecrated persons. Compare Deuteronomy 20 on verse 6 and Jeremiah 31.5. This might serve here to show the difference that there is between Ecclesiastical or spiritual, and secular or civil things. Otherwise the city is also taken, as signifying the heavenly Jerusalem, or the Church: as below verse 31, &c and verse 35. And elsewhere often: and in that sense it is called the holy city, Revelations 21.2, &c. unless we should take it so, as that this city (that is, the church) shall be on earth in these places that were before unclean and profane. See Jeremiah 31 on verse 40. But compare above chapter 42.20. With annotate.] And the city shall be in the city thereof.
\p
\v 16 . And these shall be the measures of thereof; the north-corner four thousand and five hundred (measuring reeds: and the south corner four thousand and five hundred: and on the east-corner four thousand and five hundred; and the west-corner four thousand and five hundred.
\p
\v 17 . Now the suburbs of the city shall be north-ward two hundred and fifty and south-ward two hundred and fifty, and east-ward hundred and fifty, and west-ward two hundred and fifty.
\p
\v 18 . And the residue in length over against the holy heave-offering of holiness. So in the sequel] shall be ten thousand east-ward, and ten thousand west-wards; and it shall be over against the holy heave-offering: and the increase thereof shall be for maintenance [Hebrews bread; that is, maintenance, and livelihood] for them that serve the city.
\p
\v 19 . And that serve [Hebrews serveth] the city, shall serve it out all the tribes of Israel. {Others, shall till, or manure, maintain the (remaining part :) or shall out of all the tribes of Israel serve the same (Israel) that is, they that serve in the city shall be helpful and serviceable unto all other Israelites in dispatching of the business: or they shall take those ministers out of all the tribes.
\p
\v 20 . The whole heave-offering shall be of five and twenty thousand (measuring reeds) with five and twenty thousand: [To wit, 25000 reeds in length, and so many reed in breadth. Compare the phrase with above chapter 45.2] ye shall offer the holy heave-offering four squares, with the possession of the city. [That is, the city (according to the exposition of some) being therein also comprehended. Concerning the four-square ness, we may compare this with Revelation 21.16. Others, ye shall offer the fourth part of the holy heave-offering for the possession of the city: taking the place of the sanctuary for the fifth part, of the priests for the second, of the Levites for the third and of the city for the church.]
\p
\v 21 . And the residue shall be the prince, on this (side) and on that side of the holy heave-offering and of the possession of the city, before [Hebrews towards, or at, before the face. So, in the sequel] this five and twenty thousand (measuring reeds) of the heave-offering, unto the east and west-border, before the five and twenty thousand and west border, over against the (other) [or fore mentioned] portions (that) shall be for the prince: and holy heave-offering, [others over against the portions of the prince, and it shall be an holy heave-offering, &c] and the sanctuary of the house shall e I the midst thereof.
\p
\v 22 . Now from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, being in the midst of that which shall be the princes: (that which) is between the border of Benjamin, shall be the prince.
\p
\v 23 . Moreover, concerning the rest of the tribes: from the east-corner unto the west-corner, Benjamin one (line.)
\p
\v 24 . And by the border of Benjamin from the East Corner, Simeon one.
\p
\v 25 . And by the border of Simeon, from the east-corner unto the west-corner, Issachar one.
\p
\v 26 . And by the border of Issachar, from the east-corner unto the west-corner, Zebulon one.
\p
\v 27 . And the border of Zebulon, from the east-corner unto the west-corner, Gad one.
\p
\v 28 . Now the border of Gad, at the south-corner south-ward; [Or toward Tem in, see of this place, and the next following above chapter 47 on verse 19] there shall be the border from Thamar, (towards) the water of strife of Kades, (so on) towards the brook, unto the great sea:
\p
\v 29 . This is the land which ye shall cause to fall for inheritance, [In the Hebrews the phase is somewhat obscure, and seemeth to be cleared by another, used above chapter 45.1 and 47. 14, 22. which is also here for clearness fake put in the text. Hebrews properly from the inheritance, or for the inheritance sake, which may be understood, either of dividing the common inheritance of every whole tube unto the particular person thereunto belonging, or casting the lot upon the particular inheritances, the meaning being all one. Others, from the brook (Sichor) that is, from the border of Egypt] for the tribes of Israel: and those shall be their [the tribes] portions, faith the Lord LORD.
\p
\v 30 . Moreover, these shall be the goings out of the city; [See above verse 16 where it seemeth to be expounded, what we are here to understand by this goings out, to wit, the whole compass of the four parts of the city, from which they went according to the several respective gates, as far as every part reached, at whose utmost end were the gates. Others understand by the goings out, the gates themselves] from the north-corner, four thousand and five hundred measures. [That is, measuring reeds. See above chapter40.5]
\p
\v 31 . And the gates of the city shall be according to the names of the tribes of Israel: [whereby maybe understood, that there shall be an open entrance unto the church of God or into Jerusalem, not onely for the elect of Israel, but also for the elect of the Gentiles, or of all nations from the four corners of the world, as followeth. Compare Mal. 1.11. Matthew 8. 11. Luke 13.29. Revelations 21.12,13,14,21,25. likewise 7.9,10] three gates northward: one gate of Reuben, one gate of Juda, one gate of Levi.
\p
\v 32 . And at the east-corner, four thousand and five hundred (measures) and three gate: namely, one gate of Joseph, one gate of Benjamin, and one gate of Dan.
\p
\v 33 . The south-corner also four thousand and five hundred measures, and three gates: one gate of Simeon, one gate of Issachar, one gate of Zebulon.
\p
\v 34 . The West-corner [Hebrews corner of the sea, as above often] four thousand and five hundred: their gates three, one gate of God, one gate Asher, one gate of Naphthali.
\p
\v 35 . Round about eighteen thousand: and the name of the city from (that) day shall be. The LORD is THERE. [And consequently, health and salvation. Hebrews JEHOVAH SCHAMMA. See. Jeremiah 3 .17. Joel 3.21. Zachariah 2.10,11. Revelation 21.3,22. and 22.3,4 c.]
