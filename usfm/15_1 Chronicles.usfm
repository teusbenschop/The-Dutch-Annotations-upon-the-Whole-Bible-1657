\mt2 THE FIRST BOOK OF THE
\mt CHRONICLES.
\s THE ARGUMENT OF THIS BOOK
\p This first book, and the next following, are with the Hebrews but one book: But it was of old times divided into two books, and is called by the Hebrews the words of days: By the Greeks, Paralipomena: And by us The book of the Chronicles. The words of days, that is, such wherein any thing worthy observation and remembrance, hath from time to time passed in the Church of God, in the lands and cities of Israel. The Greeks call these books Paralipomena, that is, things passed by, or, omitted. Because in them divers things are related, which being passed over, or omitted in the former books of the holy Scripture, yet are indeed worthy to be recorded, and to be communicated to the Church of God. We call them The books of the Chronicles, as they are also called the Latines, and other Nations, that is, Descriptions of times, because in them there are divers memorable things succinctly related, which were done in ancient times. Who it was that compiled and gathered together that which is contained in these books, is not certainly known, but it’s thought that Ezra wrote the same, and left it to the church of God: Making use for that purpose not only of the five books of Moseh, but also of the books and writings left by divers Prophets that lived before him, and largely put down in writing the most remarkable passages of their times, but are not come to our nor to our Fore-fathers hands. That which is said concerning the gathering of these Chronicles of the Bible out of the writings of the other Prophets, that appeareth thence, that in these books it’s every time said thus: The rest of his words, or acts, are written in the book of Gad, of Iddo, Jessaias, & c. As touching this first book of the Chronicles, in the first nine Chapters are described the pedigrees and genealogies of many of the Fore-fathers from Adam unto Abraham, and then Abrahams posterity by Jacob, divided into divers Tribes, which is not so amply and fully written in any of the former books. There is in this book described the reign of King David, and how he before his death, by the inspiration of the holy Ghost, ordered and disposed all things most fitly, both in Church and Commonwealth; As also the great preparation which he left behind toward the building of the Temple, which Salomon his son was to build in Jerusalem, to the honor and for the pure worship of the only true God of Israel. So that this first book of the Chronicles, from the beginning of the world until the reign of Salomon, is as it were a brief relation of things that are occurred, according to the computation of some, in the space of two thousand nine hundred fourscore and five years. In this first book of the Chronicles, is briefly set forth unto us, the beginning of the church of God, and how the same after the flood was kept and preserved in the house and posterity of Sem, and onward in the house and family of Abraham, and particularly in the posterity of Abraham from Jacob unto David, of whose posterity JESUS CHRIST was to be born, as was promised to him.

\p
\v 1 . Adam, Seth, Enos.

\v 2 . Kenan, Mahaleel, Jered.
\p
\v 3 . Henoch, Methusalah, Lamech. [In these three verses, and the next following are for brevities sake only set down the bare names of thirteen Patriarchs, that lived before the flood. And the words of these verses are thus to be taken and understood; of Adam was born Seth; of Seth was born Enos, and so forth.]
\p
\v 4 . Noah, Sem, Cham, and Japhet. [From and by these three sons of Noah, was the Noah, was the world, as it were renewed and planted with men. See the annotate on Genesis 10. 1.]

[Uz, Hud, Gether, and Mesech, (called Mas, Gen. 10. 23.) were Arams sons, and Sem was their Grandfather: see Gen. 10. 23. Therefore some say here, this (mans) to wit, Arams) sons were Uz, & c. And remember this once for all, that the Hebrews give divers names to one and the same person, as also to one and the same place, as is often found in the Registers of names recorded in this book, and elsewhere besides.]
\p
\v 18 . Now Arphacsad begat Selah, and Selah begat Heber.
\p
\v 19 . Now unto Heber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg, Because in his days the earth was divided, [Understand that the inhabitants of the earth were divided and distinguished one from another, when God confounded their Languages at the building of the Tower of Babel, Gen. 11. V. 9, 16. Peleg is interpreted A Division] and his brothers name was Joktan.
\p

[Although Juda was not the eldest among Jacobs children, yet the Writer of this book beginneth the description of the Genealogy of the children of Jacob from Juda, both in respect of the Royal Dignity, which was promised to his Posterity, Gen.49.8. and also because the Massiah the Lord Jesus Christ was to be born of that Tribe.]
\p

\p
\v 17 . And Abigail bare Amasa: And the Father of Amasa was Jether, [Oth. Jethro] an Ismaelite. [He is called here an Ismaelite, because he was of Ismaels family: but 2 Sam.17.25. he is called an Israelite, because he had imbraced the Israelitish Religion.]
\p
\v 18 . Now Caleb the son of Hezron [He is not that Caleb, whom Moseh sent forth to spy out the Land of Canaan, Numb.13.6. for he was the son of Jephunne.

This Machir was a son of Manasseh] the Father of Gilead, [Father signifieth here (according to the opinion of some) as much as Head, Ruler, Governor, Commander. So in sundry other places following. Others understand by Gilead Machirs own son. See Numb.26.29,30. So below chap.7.14.] and he took her (to wife) when he was threescore years old, [Hebr. when he was a son of threescore years] and she bare him Segub.
\p
\v 22 . Now Segub begat jair: [Who is called a son of Manasseh, Numb.32.41. because his Grandmother was of the Tribe of Manasseh, to wit, a daughter of Machir, v.21. But Machir was a son of Manasseh, Numb.26.29.] And he had three and twenty cities in the land of Gilead.
\p
\v 23 . And he took Gesur and Aram with the towns of Jair from them, with Kenath, [One Nobach took this city, Numb.32,v.42. This was formerly a mighty great city, as appeareth by this, that is had threescore towns under her command or dominion, as in the following words is set forth] and her dependant places [Hebr. daughters, as elsewhere often] threescore cities: all these [to wit, sons of Hezron, which were immediately before named, to wit, Segub, Jair, and also Nobach, mentioned Numb.32.42.] are sons of Machir [they are the sons of Machir by the mothers side: for their mother was a daughter of Machir: but by the Fathers side they were of the tribe of Juda] the Father of Gilead.
\p
\v 24 . And after the death of Hezron, in Caleb Ephratha, [This seemeth to have been a place so called by Caleb after his own and his wifes name. Oth. When Caleb (had either married, or taken) Ephrata] Abja Hezrons wife bare him also Asschar, the Father of Tekoa. [Of whom sprung the Inhabitants of Tekoa. See of the city of Tekoa, 2 Sam.14.2. in the annotate. It seemeth that this Asschar was born after his Father Hezrons death.]
\p
\v 25 . Now the children of Jerahmeel, the first-born of Hezron, were (these); the first-born was Ram, besides Buna, and Oren, and Ozem, (and) Ahia. [Otherw. By, or, of Ahia, conceiving this to have been the mother of the children even now named. See the sequel.]

\p
\v 31 . And the children of Appaim were Jisei, and the children of Jisei were Sesan, and the children of Sesan Achlai. [Here, and elsewhere besides, the word children is put kin the plural number, whereas there is but one son or daughter meant. As above v.8. and below v.34. So likewise Gen.21.7. & 46.23. is the word children, or sons put in the plural number for one child or son. This Achlai here mentioned, was a daughter, as appeareth by v.34, & 35.]
\p
\v 32 . And the children of Jada the brother of Samai were Jether, and Jonathan: and Jether died without children.
\p
\v 33 . Now the children of Jonathan were Peleth, and Zaza: These were the children of Jerahmeel.
\p
\v 34 . And Sesan had no sons, but daughters; [That is, one daughter called Acklen, ver.31.] And Sesan had an Egyptian servant, whose name was Jarha.
\p
\v 35 . Now Sesan gave his daughter [Called Achlai, vers.31.] to Jarha his servant to wife: and she bare him Attai.
\p
\v 36 . Now Attai begat Nathan, and Nathan begat Zadab. [He is again mentioned below chap.11.verse 41.]

\p
\v 46 . And Epha Calebs Concubine bare Haran, and Moza, and Gazez: and Haram begat Gazez.
\p
\v 47 . Now the children of Jothdai were Regum, [Oth. And the children (of Moza) were Jothdai, whose children are Regum] and Jotham, and Gesan, and Pelet, and Epha, and Saaph.
\p
\v 48 . Caleb by (his) Concubine Maacha begat Seber, and Tirhana. [Oth. Maacha, Calebs Concubine, bare Seber, &c.]
\p
\v 49 . And (the wife) of Saaph the Father of Madmanna Seva the Father of Machbena, and the Father of Gibea: [Madmanna, Machbena, and Gibea, were names of cities in the tribe of Juda: so that by Father, the word in this verse must be understood the first inhabitant and planter of these cities, from whom the inhabitants of those cities descended; as v.42,45,51,52.] and the daughter of Caleb was Achsa. [she was the first Calebs eldest daughter.]
\p
\v 50 . These were the children of Caleb, the son of Hur, the first-born of Ephratha. [This Caleb is the second of that name, a son of Hur, whom Caleb the first of that name had begotten by his Concubine Ephrath, vers.19. So that this Caleb, of whom mention is made in this 50. Verse, was a sons son or grandchild of the first Caleb.] Sobal the Father of Kiriath-Jearim.]
\p
\v 51 . Salma the Father of the Bethelehemites, [Understand this thus, that this Salma was but in part Father of the inhabitants of Bethlehem: for Boaz the Bethlehemites was of another Salma, who was the son of Nahession: see v.11.] Hareph [below chap.4.4. he is called Pemel] the Father of beth-Gader.
\p
\v 52 . The children of Sobal the Father of Kiriath-Jearim were Haroe, (and) Hazi-Hammenuchoth. Oth. The half of Menuchoth; that is, of those that inhabited the half part of the land of Menuchoth. Now that Menuchoth was a certain country, some do gather it from chap.8.ver.6. where it is called Manahath. It lay on the borders of Juda, Benjamin, and Dan.]
\p
\v 53 . And the Families of Kiriath-Jearim were the Jerites, [These, and those that follow in this verse, seem to have been Families or houses in the city of Kiriath-Jearim, which descended from Sobal] and the Pharites, and the Sumathites, and the Misuites, of these came the Zorarites, and the Esthaulites.
\p
\v 54 . The children [i.e. The Posterity] of Salma were the Bethlehemites, and the Netophatites, Atroth, [See Jos.chap.16.2,5,7.] Beth-Joab: And half of the Manathites, (and) the Zorites.
\p
\v 55 . And the households of the Scribes, [These Scribes came of Jethro, Moseh his father in Law, and that dwelt as strangers among the people of God: And that they might likewise be some way serviceable to the people of God, they were appointed to be Scribes, that is, as it were publike Notaries, which made Contracts, and such like Deeds and Instruments, and kept books of them. They are here mentioned, because they dwelt among the tribe of Juda: see Judg.1.16.] that dwelt at Jabes the Tirathites, the Simithites: These are Kinites, [i.e. the posterity of Jethro, Judg.1.16.] that came of Hamath, the Father of the house of Rechab. [This Hamath seemeth to have been one of the chiefest among the Kinites, and a Father of the Rechabites, which had taken up their dwelling in the tribe of Juda: see Jerem.35.2. And these Kinites are likewise distinguished from the Kinites that came of Chebar, and had taken up their dwelling place by Kedesch in the tribe of Naphthali, or Manasseh. See Judg.4.11. Of Rechab, or the Rechabites, see Jer.35.2.]

\p
\v 10 . Now Salomons son was Rehabeam, his son was Abia, his son was Asa, his son was Josaphat. [In this and the following verses are set down the Kings of Juda, that came of Salomon unto Jechonia.]
\p
\v 11 . His son was Joram, his son was Ahazia, [Hebr. Achazjahu] his son was Joas.
\p
\v 12 . His son was Amazia, [Hebr. Amatsaihu] his son was Azaria, [otherwise called Uzzia, 2 Kings 15.30. and 34.] his son was Jotham.
\p
\v 13 . His son was Achaz, his son was Hizkia, [Hebr. Chizkiahu] his son was Manasseh.
\p
\v 14 . His son was Amon, his son was Josia: [Heb. Josijahu.]
\p
\v 15 . Now the sons of Josia were (these), the first-born Johanan, [He is called Joahaz, 2 Kings 23.30. also Sallum, Jer.22.11.] the second Jojakim, [he is also called Eliakim, 2 Kings 23.34.] the third Zedekia, [Heb. Tsikijahu. He is also called Mathania, 2 Kings 24.17.] the fourth Sallum.
\p
\v 16 . Now the children of Jojakim were: Jechonia [He is also called Jojachim, 2 Kings 24.6. and in a contemptible way Chonia, Jerem.22.v.24. and 28.] his son, Zedekia his son. [this Zedekia (according to the opinion of some) was the same Zedekia, that was mentioned in the former verse, to wit, the son of Josia, and Uncle of Jechonia, 2 Kings 34.17. but called here a son of Jechonia, because he suceedeth him in the Kingdom, as children do succeed their fathers in the inheritances. So likewise might Sealtheel be called a son of Jechonia, because he as the next heir, succeeded him in the Princely government: And Jechonia died at Babel without children, as appeareth by Jerem.22.30. and Sealthie was properly a son of Neri, of the posterity of Nathan, the son of David, the brother of Salomon, Luke 3.27,31., Others say that this Zedekia mentioned v.16. was another Zedekia, then is mentioned v.15. First, because in no genealogy two fathers are expressly attributed to one son. Secondly, because the Uncle cannot be the son of him that is his nephew: And because (according to their opinion) as yet no example hath been found in any genealogy, where the word son, (although it otherwise be diversly used) did, or doth signify a successor in the government. For Sealthiel v.17. is properly called the son of Jechonia, because he was begotten of him, Mat.1.12. and differed of Neri, Luke 3.27. so that the same names are no sure tokens of the same persons: As appeareth Luke 3.24. compared with v.29. And 1 Chron.6.7,8. Compared with v.11.12. as also Jer.22. seed is attributed to Jechonia, v.28.30. against which the Hebrew word Arari (there used) is not repugnant, which signifieth strip, made naked: sometimes in regard of children, sometimes in regard of lands and goods or estates, that is, out all; which agreeth with the 28 verse of the 22 Chapter of Jeremie. Of both these opinions the reader may judge.]
\p
\v 17 . And the children of Jechonia were Assis, [Oth. Of the captive, or, prisoner; he was carried captive to Babylon, 2 Kings 24.17.] his son was Sealthiel.
\p
\v 18 . This (mans) [To wit, Sealthiels] (sons) were, Malchiram, and Pedada, and Senazar, Jekamja, Hosama, and Nedabja.
\p
\v 19 . Now the children of Pedaja were Zerubbabel, and Simei: And the children Zerubbabel were Mesullam, and Aanahia, and Selomith was their sister.
\p
\v 20 . And Asuba, and Ohel, and Berchia, and Hasadja, Jusabhesed, five. [He doth not say, that these five were Zerubbabels sons, they were Mesullams sons, and Zerubbabels was their Grand-father.]
\p
\v 21 . Now the children of Hananja were Pelatja, and Jesaia: The children of Rephaia, the children of Arnan, the children of Obadja, the children of Sechanja.
\p
\v 22 . Now the children of Sechanja were Senaja: And the children of Senaja were Hattus, and Jegeal, and Bariah, and Nearja, and Sephat, six. [Among these six Senaja himself must also be counted; Senaja was properly the son of Sechanja, the other were his Nephews.]
\p
\v 23 . And the children of Nearja were Eljoenai, and Hizkia, and Azrikam, three.
\p
\v 24 . And the children of Elioenai were Hodajeva, [Heb. Hodajevahu. Besides the above mentioned proper names with the Hebrews ending in hu, there be yet many more in the histories of the bible, which to set them all down would be too long, and likewise tedious for the Reader to observe] and Eliasib, and Pelaja, and Accub, and Johanan, and Delaja, and Anani, seven.

Item, how they took possession of Gedar, and of the pasture-grounds thereabout, 39. And smote the rest of the Amalekites, and took possession of mount Seir, 42.
\p
\v 1 . The children of Juda were Perez, [Perez (to speak properly) was the son of Juda, but those that are named here after him, sprung from Perez] Hezron, and Charmi, [he is called Chelubai, chap.2.9. and also Caleb, chap.2.v.18.] and Hur, and Sobal. [Hur was Sobals grand-father, above chap.2.50. so that Caleb the son of Hur is here left out.]
\p
\v 2 . And Reaja the son of Sabal [This Reaja is called Haroe a son of Sabal, chap.2.vers.52.] begat Johath, and Johath begat Ahamai, and Lahad: These are the household of the Zoathites; [these dwelt at Zora, lying in the tribe of Judsa, Jos.15.33.]
\p
\v 3 . And these are of the Father of Etam: [i.e. which dwelt at Etam. See 2 Chron.11.6.] Jizreel, and Isma, and Jobas, and their sisters name was Hazelelponi.
\p
\v 4 . And Pnuel [Chap.2.v.51. he is called Hareph] was the father of Gedor, and Eser the Father of Husah: [v.11. by a transposition of the letters he is called Suha] these are the children of Hur the first-born of Ephrata [see 1 Chron.2.v.9.] the Father of Bethlehem. [it is to be noted that this Hur was but in part the Father of Bethlehem, for this is also ascribed unto Salomon, 1 Chron.2.51. and 5.4. See the annotate there.]
\p
\v 5 . Now Asschur [He was born after his Father Hezrons death. See chap.2.v.24.] the Father of tekoa had two wives, Hela and Naara.
\p
\v 6 . And Naara bare him Ahuzzam, and Hepher, and Teneni, and Haahastari; These are the children of Naara.
\p
\v 7 . And the children of Hela were Zereth, Jozohar, and Ethnam. [Understand withal; and Roz, (out of the following verse) who was a son of Hela, or the beginning of the 8.verse may be thus translated, and Roz (who) begat Anub. See the like transposition above chap.2.47. and here below v.14.]
\p
\v 8 . And Roz begat Anub, and Hazobeba, and the households of Aharhel the son of Harum.
\p
\v 9 . Now Jahez was more honorable then his brethren: [He was one of the chiefest, of whom the families of Aharmel came, whereof mentioned is made v.8.] and his mother had called his name Jahez, saying; For I bare him with sorrow. [Jabez converted or turned out of Jazeb, signifieth a maker, or causer of sorrow.]
\p
\v 10 . For Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying; if thou shalt richly bless me, [Hebr. blessing bless me] and enlarge my border, and thine hand shall be with me, and (shalt) (so) deal with the evil, that it may not grieve me: [this is an imperfect phrase or manner of speaking , wherein the promise is concealed ,which this man made unto God, if he should obtain the blessing, which he had craved of God. As the Hebrews in swearing do usually conceal the punishment, which they do imprecate or wish unto themselves, if they do swear falsely; so do they sometimes conceal the promise in their wishes, and desires, or prayers. In Gen.28.vers.20.21,22. Its set down fully, namely, both the prayer, and the promise] And God caused (the thing) to come to pass, which he desired. [that which is recorded in this verse, is added as by a reason, to shew why Jabez was become more honorable and more excellent the his brethren, namely, because he by his prayer unto God, had obtained the blessing of God in a more abundant manner upon his house.]
\p
\v 11 . And Chelub the father of Suba [Called vers.4. Husa] begat Nechir, he is the Father of Eston.
\p
\v 12 . Now Eston begat Bethrapha, and Pasea, and Tehima, the Father of Ir-Nahas: [Oth. The Father of the city of Nahas] These are the men of Kecha.
\p
\v 13 . And the children of Kenaz [He was the Father of Jephunne, whose son was Caleb, who is therefore also called a Kenezite, Numb.32.12.] were Othiel, and Seraja: And the children of Othiel, Hathath: [Understand withal: and Meonothai (out of the following verse) which name is not set down in the Hebrew but it must of necessity be also understood.]
\p
\v 14 . And Meonothai begat Ophra: And Seraja begat vernor of those that dwelt in the valley of craftmen: See above chap.2.on v.21. This valley lyeth by the border of Juda and Benjamin, so that it is under two jurisdictions, Nehem.11.25. The valley of Craftmen, or smiths. Some translate it tradesmen, or, Handicraftmen, as Nehem.11.35.] for they [to wit, Joabs posterity] were craftsmen, [the meaning of these words is, therefore was this valley called the valley of trademen, because they that inhabited the same were craftmen or carpenters.]
\p
\v 15 . Now the children of Caleb the son of Jephunne [See Num.32.12.] were Iru, Ela, and Naami; and the children of Ela, to wit, Kenaz. [oth. Ukenaz.]
\p
\v 16 . And the children of Jehalelel were Ziph, and Zipha, Thirea, and Asareel.
\p
\v 17 . And the children of Ezra were Jether, and Mered; and Zepher, and Jalon: And she [To wit, Bitja, Pharaos daughter, Mereds wife. See v.18.] bare Mirjam, and Sammai, and Isbah, the Father of Estemoa.
\p
\v 18 . And his jewish wife [This woman is thus distinguished from Mereds other wise, namely, from Bithja, who was an alien, being a daughter of Pharao out of Egypt. Some conceive that this, to wit, Jehudijah, that is, Jewish (woman) was a proper name: Or, at least Hodijah, as she is called ver.19. which also signifieth Jewels. Others are of opinion that Hodija was Mereds third wife, and that consequently he had three sorts of children] bare Jered the Father of Gedor, and Heber the father of Socho, and Jekuthiel the Father of Zanoah: And those [to wit, that are mentioned v.17. are the children of Bitja the daughter of Pharaoh, which Mered had taken (to wife).
\p
\v 19 . And the children of (his) wife Hodijah, [Oth. The Jewish (woman), or, Jewess] the sister of Naham, were Abikehila the Garmite, and Estemoa the Maachathite.
\p
\v 20 . Now the children of Simeon were Amnon, and Rinna, Ben-Hanan, and Tilon: [Oth. Tulon] and the children of Isei were Zoheth, and Ben Zoheth.
\p
\v 21 . The children of Selah the son of Juda were Er, the Father of Lecha, and Lada the Father of Lecha, and Lada the father of Maresa: And the families of the house of the linen-workers [i.e. of those that wrought in costly fine linen, which is made fine Egyptians flax. This flax was as fine as silk, and therefore some do render it handicraftsmen in silk, or, silk-workers] in the house of Asbea.
\p
\v 22 . Besides, Jokim, and the men of Cozeba, [This city is called Chezib, Gen.38.5. See the annot. There] and Joas, and Saraph, (who had dominion over the Moabites) [that is, who in the Kings stead had dominion over the Moabites] and Jasubi-Lehem. But these things are old. [as if he had said, its superfluous to speak or write much of these, for although many of these in their time were men of note, yet their posterity were such base and low spirited persons, that they had rather be potters, gardeners, &c. then that returning to their own land, they should have kept their ancient and fatherly freedom, as v.23. is related.]
\p
\v 23 . These were potters dwelling by plants and hedges: [Or, paled fences] There they abode with the King, [some understand here the King of the Moabites, from v.22. Others the King of Babylon, in this sense, that the posterity of Selah had rather to tarry in Babylon, and to be servants there, then to return home to their own country, and there to enjoy their ancient liberty, and from thence they conclude that this Book was written by Ezra, after the Babylon captivity. Others understand here by the word king, the king of Juda, unto whom Selah’s posterity performed that service, that they kept and took care of the gardens and plantation s of the Kings of Juda] in his work. [to wit, in the planting of, and looking to his gardens.]
\p
\v 24 . The Children of Jamin, Jerib, [otherwise called Jakin] Zerah, [otherwise called Tsohar] Saul. [see of the three last, Gen.46.10.]
\p
\v 25 . Sallum was his son, Mibsam [See Gen.25.13.] was his son, Misma was his son.
\p
\v 26 . The children of Misma were (these) Hammuel his son, Zacchur his son, Simei his son.
\p
\v 27 . Now Simei had sixteen sons, and six daughters, but his brethren had not many children: And their whole family was not so much increased, as (the family) of the house Juda (was). [Hebr. not increased to the children of Juda.]
\p
\v 28 . And they dwelt at Ber-Seba, and at Molada, and at Hazra-Saul. [See Jos.19.2, &c. where these cities mentioned in this and the following verses are likewise rehearsed, though with some alteration in the names of them.]
\p
\v 29 . And at Bilha, and at Ezem, and at Tholad.
\p
\v 30 . And at Bethuel, and at Horma, and at Ziglag.
\p
\v 31 . And at Beth-Marboth, and at Hazar-Susim, and at Bethbiri, and at Saaraim: These were their cities, the David became king. [Oth. As long as David reigned. Understand this thus, to wit, as long as David and his posterity reigned, and the kingdom of Juda yet stood, namely, unto the Babylonish Captivity, but when that was disturbed, then were the posterity of Salomon (that dwelt in the tribe of Juda) likewise disturbed and cast out of their dwellings.]
\p
\v 32 . And their villages were Etam, and Ain, Rimmon, and Tochen, and Asan, five cities: [For wit unwalled. Otherwise that which goeth before may be thus Taken: And besides their villages were Etham, etc. five cities.]
\p
\v 33 . And all the villages that were in the circumference of these cities unto Baal: These are their habitations, and their genealogy for them.
\p
\v 34 . But Mesobab, and Janlech, and Josa, the son of Amazia.
\p
\v 35 . And Joel, and Jehu the son of Jesibja, the son of Seraja, the son of Asiel.
\p
\v 36 . And Eljoenai, and Jaacoba, and Isohaja, and Asaja, and Adiel, and Jesimeel, and Benaja.
\p
\v 37 . And Ziza the son of Ziphi, the son of Allon, the son of Jejada, the son of Zimri, the son of Semaja.
\p
\v 38 . These [To wit, that are named from v.34. hitherto] came to names, [i.e. they came to be men of note] being Princes in their families, and the families of their Fathers brake forth in multitude. [i.e. they were greatly increased or multiplied.]
\p
\v 39 . And they went to the entrance of Gedor [Otherwise called Gedera, or, Giderothaim, Judg.15.36.] to the East-(side) of the valley, [understand here that valley which reached from Ephes-Dammim unto Ekron, as appeareth by 1 Sam.17.1. and 52.] to seek pasture for their sheep.
\p
\v 40 . And they found fat and good pasture, and a land wide in compass, [Heb. wide in hands] and still, and quiet; for those of Cham dwelt there in former time. [this is here added, to shew that the Israelites had just cause to take these cities, and to drive out thence the ancient inhabitants, to wit, because the posterity of cursed Cham had them in their possession. See of Cham, Gen.9.25.]
\p
\v 41 . Now these that are described by name, came in the days of Hizkia the King of Juda, and they smote the tents and habitations of those that were found there, [To wit, the tents of Chams posterity, and understand here the inhabitants of the tents and habitations] and they burned them, [i.e. they utterly destroyed them, as that which was banned of God] unto this day, [to wit, wherein this was written; understand unto the tune of Ezra, who wrote this book, about which time the kingdom of David, and of his posterity ended. See the annotate. Above ver.31.] and they dwelt in their room: for there was pasture for their sheep.
\p
\v 42 . (There) went also of them, to wit, of the children of Simeon, five hundred men to mount Seir: And Pelatja, and Nearja, and Rephaja, and Uzziel, the sons of Isei, were their heads (or captains.)
\p
\v 43 . And they smote the rest of those that escaped among the Amalekites: [To wit, those that were left, and made an escaped, when Saul destroyed the Amlekites, 1 Sam.14.48. and which also afterward escaped Davids hands, 2 Sam.8.12.] And they dwelt there unto this day.
\c 5
\s The sons and posterity of Reuben, to the Babylinish captivity, v.1.&c. Their war against the Hagarens, 10. The habitations, and the chiefest men of the tribe of Gad, 11.

The dwelling places of the half tribe of Manasseh, 23. Their chiefest men, 24. Those three tribes are carried captive unto Assyria because of their sins, 25.
\p
\v 1 . Now the children of Reuben the first-born of Israel (for he was the first-born, but forasmuch as he defiled his fathers bed [Lying with Bilha his fathers concubine, Gen.35.22. See also Gen.49.3.] his birth-right was given to the children of Joseph the son of Israel: [that is, the right which the first-born had above his brethren, enjoying a double portion or part in the inheritance, Deut.21.17. this was given to Joseph and his sons; for in the division of the land of Canaan, Ephraim and Manasseh were placed among the rest of the tribes, to have their share with them. See of Joseph Gen.48.22. and of his sons, Gen.48.5.] yet not (so), that he might reckon himself in the genelogy according to the birth-right.
\p
\v 2 . For Juda waxed mighty among his brethren, [Of Juda’s dominion and excellency, see Gen.49.v.8.etc.] and he that was a leader, was of him; [Oth. Be became a leader for, or, over him; to wit, over Joseph: or; as concerning the Leader he was more then he; to wit, then Joseph. First the Kings, then Princes or Rulers of the land, were of the tribe of Juda, of the house and family of David, until the time of Herod, when Silo came, Gen.49.10.] but the birth-right was Josephs.) [to wit, as much as concerned the double portion of the goods or estate as was said v.1. See Gen.48.5. and 49.22. etc.]
\p
\v 3 . The children of Reuben the first-born of Israel are Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Charmi.
\p
\v 4 . The children of Joel, Semaaja his son, Gog his son, Simei his son.
\p
\v 5 . Micha his son, Reaja his son, Baal his son.
\p
\v 6 . Beera his son, whom Tilgath Pilneser [He is also called Tilgath-Pileser, 2 Kings 15.29. and 16.7.] the king of Assyria carried away captive, he was Prince of the Reubenites [he, to wit, Joel, who seemeth to have been the son of Hanoch, the first-born of Reuben, and therefore Prince of the Reubenites.]
\p
\v 7 . As for his brethren, [To wit, Hanochs brethren, who are expressed v.3.] in their families, when they were according to their generations put in the genealogys: [see below v.17.] the heads (or chief) were Jeiel and Zacharja.
\p
\v 8 . And Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Sema, the son of Joel, the same [Understand this Bela, or of his Family, or in general of Reubens inheritance is also described] dwelt at Aroer, and unto Nebo, and Baal Meon.
\p
\v 9 . And he dwelt East-ward, unto the entering in of the wilderness, from the River Phrath: [i.e. from the River Euphrates unto the Jordan] for their cattle [to wit, the cattle of the brethren of Joel, of whom is spoken v.7.] were multiplied in the land of Gilead.
\p
\v 10 . And in the days of Saul they waged [Heb. made, or, did] war against the Hagarens [these were Ismaelites, and are called Hagarens because they came of Hagar, Abrahams maid-servant, Ismaels mother: They dwelt in Arabia the desert] those [to wit, the Hagarens] fell by their hand: and they [to wit, the Israelites] dwelt in their tents toward all the East-side of Gilead.
\p
\v 11 . Now the children of Gad dwelt over against them, in the land of Basan unto Salcha.
\p
\v 12 . Joel was the head (or chief) and Saphan the second: But Jaenai and Saphat (tarried) in Basan. [To wit, to defend their own borders, while their brethren waged war.]
\p
\v 13 . Now their brethren, according to the houses of their fathers, were Michal, and Messullam, and Seba, and Jorai, and Jachan, and Zia, and Heber, seven.
\p
\v 14 . These [To wit, those, of whom even now was spoken, v.13.] are the children of ABihail, the son of Huri, the son of Harvah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jesisai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz.
\p
\v 15 . Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Gani was the head (or chief) of the house of their Fathers.
\p
\v 16 . And they dwelt in Gilead, in Basan, and in their dependant places: [That is, in the small cities, towns, and villages, resorting under the great cities. Hebr. daughters] and in suburbs of Saaron, [where there was good pasture. This Saron lay in Gilead. See of another Saron in Ephraim, Cant.2.1.] until their goings out.
\p
\v 17 . All these are numbered according to their genealogies the days of Jotham king of Juda: [When he as Deputy of his Father governed the Kingdom, while his Father was smitten with leprosy, 2 Kings 15.5.] and in the days of Jerobeam the king of Israel. [understand here Jerobeam the second of the name, the son of Joas, 2 Kings 13.13. and 14. For Jerobeam the son of Nebat had been dead long before.]
\p
\v 18 . Of the children of Reuben, and of the Gadites and of the half tribe of Manasseh, of the most warlike men, bearing shield and sword, and bending the bow, [See the annotate. Below chap.8.20.] and expert in the war, (there) were four and fourty thousand, and seven hundred and threescore that went forth into the host.
\p
\v 19 . And they waged war against the Hagarens: And (against) Jetur, and Nephis, and Nodab. [See of these Gen.25.14. where it appeareth, that they were Ismaelites.]
\p
\v 20 . But they were helped [To wit, of God, v.22.] against them, [to wit, against the Hagarens] and the Hagarens were delivered into their hand, etc all that werewith them: because they cryed to God in the battle, he suffered himself to be intreated of them, for as much as they trusted in him.
\p
\v 21 . And they carried away captive their cattle, of their camels fifty thousand: And two hundred and fifty thousand sheep, and two thousand asses, and an hundred thousand souls of men.
\p
\v 22 . For there fell many wounded, [i.e. who being mortally wounded, died of their wounds] because the battle was of God: [i.e. God fought for them against their Enemies] And they dwelt in their room until they were carried away captive. [to wit, unto Assyria. See 2 Kings 17.6. and 15.29.]
\p
\v 23 . Now the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in that land: they were multipled from Basan unto Baal Hermon, and Senir, and mount Hermon. [See Deut.3.9.]
\p
\v 24 . Now these were the heads of their Fathers houses: To wit, Hepher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremia, and Hodavjah, and Jahdiel, men strong in power, men of name, heads of the houses of their Fathers.
\p
\v 25 . But they transgressed against the God of their Fathers: and went a whoring after the Gods of the nations of the Land, [To wit, by many fearful idolatries, as is mentioned 2 Kings 17.7. etc.] whom God had destroyed before their face.
\p
\v 26 . So he the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, [See 2 Kings 15.ver.2.19.] and the spirit of Tiglath-Pilneser king of Assyria, who carried them captive away, (to wit), the Ribenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh: And he brought them to Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the River Gozan, [understand this of the first captivity, of which see 2 Kings 15. Vers.29. but 2 Kings 17.6. is related the last carrying away by Salmanasser] unto this day. [that is, they are there unto this day. Understand that this captivity lasted unto that very day, or that they dwelt there unto that very day, in which this was written.]

\p

\p

\p
\v 22 . Therefore Ephraim their Father mourned many days. [To wit, because his children were slain] and his brother [that is, his Kinsman, or Kindred; for Ephraim had but one brother, to wit, Manasseh] came to comfort him.

\v 21 . And Adajah, and Beraja, and Simrath, were children of Simei. [Vers.13.he is called Sema.]
\p
\v 22 . And Ispan, and Eber, and Eliel.
\p
\v 23 . And Abdon, and Zichri, and Hanan.
\p
\v 24 . And Hananja, and Elan, and Antothija.
\p
\v 25 . And Iphdeja, and Penuel were sons of Sasak.
\p
\v 26 . And Samferai, and Seharja and Athalja.
\p
\v 27 . And Jaaresja, and Elija, and Zichri, were sons of Jeroham.
\p
\v 28 . These [To wit, of whom mention is made from v.14. hitherto] were heads of the Fathers [That is, heads of the Fatherly houses or Families; as ver.6. and elsewhere] heads according to these Families that dwelt at Jerusalem.
\p
\v 29 . And at Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon: among the Israelites. Gibeon is called Jeiel. Chap.9.35.] and his wifes name was Maacha.
\p
\v 30 . Amd his first-born son was Abdon, then Zur, and Kis, and Baal, and Nadab.
\p
\v 31 . And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zecher.
\p
\v 32 . And Mikloth begat Simea; and these also dwelt over against their brethren at Jerusalem with their brethren. [To wit, certain heads of these Families dwelt at Jerusalem with the Benjamites, over against those Benjamites that dwelt at Jerusalem, with other Benjamites, over against those Benjamites that dwelt in the border of Gibeon.]
\p
\v 33 . Now Ner [Oth. Called Abiel, 1 Sam.9.1.] begat Kis, and Kis begat Saul: and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malcha-Sua, and Abinadab, [oth. Called Ischo, 1 Sam.14.49.] and Esbaal. [oth. Called Isboseth, 2 Sam.2.6.]
\p
\v 34 . And Jonathans son was Meribbaal; [Oth. Called Mephiboseth, 2 Sam.9.6,10. Hence it appeareth that the names Baal, and Boseth are interchanged. Baal signifieth Lord or Master, and is a known name of Idols; Bescheth signifieth shame, disgrace. Compare Jer.30.v.24.] and Meribbaal begat Micha.
\p
\v 35 . Now the children of Micha were Pichon and Melech, and Thaarea, and Achaz.
\p
\v 36 . And Achaz begat Jehoadda, and Jehoadda begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri: now Zimri begat Moza.
\p
\v 37 . And Moza begat Bina, Rapha was his son, Azel was his son.
\p
\v 38 . Now Azel had six sons, and these are their names, Azrikam, Bochru, and Ismael, and Searia, and Obadia, and Hanan: all these were sons of Azel.
\p
\v 39 . And the sons of Ezek his brother, were Ulam his first-born, Jeus the second, and Eliphelet the third.
\p
\v 40 . And the sons of Ulam were men, valiant champions, bending the bow, [Hebr. treading the bow; that is, that could bend the bow, and shoot well with it. The bows of steel must be bent with great strength, and with all ones might: Therefore the arches use to tread upon them with their feet, and pull up the string with all their strength and power. Therefore its called the foot-bow to distinguish it from the hand-bow. They are called in Kings Courts Archers that handle the same.] and they had many sons, and sons sons, [Hebr. they multiplied son, and sons] an hundred and fifty: all these were of the children of Benjamin.

\s Here are rehearsed the chiefest of the tribe of Juda, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh, that being returned from the Babylonish captivity, came to dwell at Jerusalem, vers.1,&c. As also the Priests and Levites, and how they executed their office in the Temple at Jerusalem, Whereunto is lately rehearsed the Family Saul, 35.
\p
\v 1 . And all Israel were numbered in Genealogies, and behold, they are written in the book of the Kings of Israel; and those of Juda were carried away to Babel for their transgression.
\p
\v 2 . Now the first inhabitants that (came) into their possession, into their cities, [From this verse beginneth the Register of those, that after the Babylnish captivity returned home into their own land] were the Israelites, [to wit, the common people among the Israelites] the Priests, the Levites, and the Nethinims. [Nethinims, that is given up. These were Gibeonites, who had freely and willingly given up themselves to the Israelites, to be their servants and bond men for ever, Jos.9.21. See also Ezra 8.20. Neh.11.3.]
\p
\v 3 . But at Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Juda, and of the children of Benjamin: and of the children of Ephraim [i.e. Of the ten tribes, that had severed and divided themselves from Juda: As also many of this tribe had joined themselves to Juda, that they might partake with them in the pure Worship of God. See 2 Chron.34 6 32.] and Manasseh. [they dwelt at Jerusalem, to wit, after that they were returned out of the Babylonish captivity, with King Cyrus his consent.]
\p
\v 4 . Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the children of Perez the son of Juda. [Nehem.11.4. These, and many likewise of those that follow are rehearsed; but some with other names then are mentioned in this Chapters.]
\p
\v 5 . And of the Silonites [Heb. Of Siloni; that is, of the family of the Silonites] was Asaja the first-bern, and his children.
\p
\v 6 . And of the children of Zerah was Jeuel, and their brethren [i.e. Kinsmen: so also below ver.9,25. And elsewhere] were six hundred and ninety.
\p
\v 7 . And of the children of Benjamin were, Salla the son of Mesullam, the son of Hodava, the son of Hassenua.
\p
\v 8 . And Ibneja the son of Jerobam, and Ela the son of Uzzi, the son of Michri: and Mesullam the son of Sephatja, the son of Reuel the son of Abija.
\p
\v 9 . And their brethren according to their Families, nine hundred and six and fifty: all these men were heads of the fathers in the houses of their Fathers.
\p
\v 10 . Now of the Priests, Jedarih, and Jachim.
\p
\v 11 . And Azarja [Otherwise called Seraja, Nehem. 11.11. where these Priests and Levites are again rehearsed, with alteration of some of their names] the son of Hilkija, [see of this man 2 Kings 22.8. It’s he that found the book of the Law] the son of Mesullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the Ruler [he was the first among the priests after the high Priest] of the house of God. [i.e. in the temple, as v.13.]
\p
\v 12 . And Adaja the son of Jeroam, the son [i.e. kinsman, or cousin, as appeareth Neh.10.11.] of Pashur, the son of Malchija: And Masai the son of Adiel, the son of Jahzera, the son of Mesullam, the son of Mesillenith, the son of Immer.
\p
\v 13 . Besides, their brethren, heads in the houses of their Fathers, a thousand and seven hundred and threescore: Valiant champions for the work of the service of the house of God.
\p
\v 14 . Now of the Levites were, Semaja the son of Hasub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hasabija, of the children of Merari.
\p
\v 15 . And Bakhakkar, Heres, and Galal, and Mattanija, the son of Micha, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph.
\p
\v 16 . And Obadja the son of Senaja, the son of Galal, the son of Asa, the son of Elkana, dwelling in the villages of the Netophathites. [These villages lay in the tribe of Juda, as appeareth by 1 Chron.2.54.]
\p
\v 17 . Now the porters, [It was their office daily to open and shut the temple, and to look that no man did enter into the Temple, of those that by order of the law were barred from it] were Sallum, and Talmon, and Ahiman, and their brethren, [i.e. kinsmen] Sallum was the head.
\p
\v 18 . Also hitherto at the Kings gate [This was gate of the temple, thorough which the King entered into the Temple, 2 Kings 16.v.18.] East-ward, these [To wit, that are named, v.17.] were the porters among the camps of the children of Levi: [i.e. they were the chiefest that kept their turn among the Levitical porters. See below v.22. etc.]
\p
\v 19 . And Sallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren [i.e. kinsmen] of the house of his Father, the Korahites, were over the wood of the service, keepers of the thresholds of the tabernacles: As their Fathers [to wit, the Kahathites, Num.4.4.] in the camp of the LORD [that is, in the wilderness, where God carried the Levites as an host, and camped them even round about the Ark] had been keepers of the entry, [to wit, into the holy and most holy place in the tent of the Lord.]
\p
\v 20 . As Pinehas the son of Eleazar was in time past leader with them, with whom the LORD was. [See Num.25.11. etc.]
\p
\v 21 . Zacharja the son of Meselemja was porter at the tent of the Congregation. [Understand this thus, that this Zacharja was chief of the waiters or keepers, for there were many waiters or keepers, v.19.22.]
\p
\v 22 . All that were chosen (to be) porters at the thresholds, were two hundred and twelve: These were put into the genealogy according to their villages: David, and Samuel, and Seer [i.e. Prophet. See the annotate. On 1 Sam.9.9.] had confirmed them in their office. [Heb. properly, in their truth, faithfulness, so likewise v.26. That is, in the office that they were entrusted with: And it is so called, because in the execution of such an office, faithfulness and truth is required, 1 Col.4.2. of Davids ordaining and settling them in their office. See bel.cha.26.23,36. When Samuel did this the scripture no where mentioneth. Some are of opinion that it was done when the Ark was brought out of the land of the Philistines, 1 Sam.7.]
\p
\v 23 . They then and their sons were at the gates of the house of the LORD, in the house of the Tent, [Some do here distinguish the house of the LORD from the house of the tent: so that by the house of the LORD should be understood the tent, which David had pitched by his house, where the Ark of the covenant stood: And by the house of the Tent they understand the tabernacle at Gibeon, 2 Chron.1.3,5. And 1 Kings 3.2. etc.] by the wards. [to wit, every one in his course, relieving one another every seven days. See verse 25.]
\p
\v 24 . These porters were at the four winds, [i.e. at the four corners of the world] toward the East, toward the west, [Hebr. toward the sea, which lyeth west-ward of the land Canaan] toward the North, and toward the South.
\p
\v 25 . And their brethren [i.e. kindred, kinsmen] were in their villages, coming in moon the seventh day from time to time [i.e. into Jerusalem to wait upon the worship of God in the Temple, when one went off, another came on, always from seven days to seven days] (to serve) with them. [to wit, with the chief men or Rulers, of whom is spoken above vers.1. and 21. These chief men or Rulers dwelt always at Jerusalem in the Temple.]
\p
\v 26 . For in that office [See v.22.] were four chief porters that were Levites: And they were over the chambers, and over the treasures of the house of God. [see the order and division that was made concerning this, 1 Chron.26.1.]
\p
\v 27 . And they continued all night round about the house of God; [this is, they had their nights rest in the chambers that were round about the temple. See 1 Kings 6.5.] for the guard was upon them, and they were over the opening, [To wit, of the Temple] and that every morning, [Heb. and unto morning unto morning; that is, every morning.]
\p
\v 28 . And (some) of them were over the vessels of the service, [To wit, of the holy service] for by tale they carried them in, and by tale they brought them out.
\p
\v 29 . For there were (some) of them appointed over the vessels, and over all the holy vessels: and over the mealflower, and wine, and oil, and frankincense, and spices.
\p
\v 30 . And (some) of the sons of the Priests were the preparers of the incense of the spices. [That is, those that prepared the incense were the children of the Priests, not of the common or ordinary Levites. How these spices for the incense were ordered, and what ingredients were required to make up the incense. See Exod.30.34.]
\p
\v 31 . And Matthathja (one) of the Levites, who was the first-born of Sallum [See above v.17. and 19.] the Koraite, was in the office over the work that is boiled in pans. [Heb. the work of pans. See Lev.2.5. and 24.v.5.]
\p
\v 32 . And (some) of the children of the Kahathites of their brethren were over the bread-(loaves) of preparation, [Hebr. over the bread of order, or ordination: meaning the shew-bread-(loaves) which were twelve in number, Exod.35.v.13. so that here the singular number is put for the plural] to prepared them on all Sabbaths. [Heb. on Sabbaths on Sabbaths. See Exod.25.30. Lev.24.5. etc.]
\p
\v 33 . (Of) these [To wit, Levites] are the singers, heads of the fathers [that is, of the Fatherly houses] among the Levites in the chambers [understand here the chambers of the Priests, which were by the temple] free from service: [to wit, from other services] for it was (or lay) upon them day and night, to be (employed) in that work. [as if he should say, forasmuch as they were always to be busy with singing, or making, or ordering of songs, according to the order made by David, 1 Chron.25.1. therefore they were also exempted from other services and employments.]
\p
\v 34 . These are the heads of the Fathers among the Levites, heads in their families: These dwelt at Jerusalem.
\p
\v 35 . But at Gibeon there had dwelt Jeiel the Father of Gibeon: [To wit, in Sauls time. And thus the writer of this book commeth here again to the relation of the pedigree and family of Saul and his posterity, of whom he began to speak above chap.8.29.] (now his sisters [above chap.8.29. it’s said, his wifes: which may be taken in such a sense, as Abraham said, that Sara was his sister, Genes.20.2,5,12.] name was Maacha.)
\p
\v 36 . And Abidon was his first-born son, then Zur, and Kis, and Baal, and Ner, [not the Father of Abner, but another Ner, for this man was not Kis his Father, but his brother, 1 Sam.14.52.] and Nadab.
\p
\v 37 . And Gedor, and Ahjo, and Zacharja, and Mikloth.
\p
\v 38 . Now Mikloth begath Simeon. These also dwelt at Jerusalem, over against their brethren, with their brethren. [See above chap.8.32.33,34.]
\p
\v 39 . And Ner begat kis, and Kis begat Saul; and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchi-Sua, and Aminadab, and Eshaal.
\p
\v 40 . And Jonathans son was Merib-Baal, and Merib-Baal begat Micha.
\p
\v 41 . Now the children of Micha were Pihon, and Melch, and Taerea. [Understand withal, and Achaz, out of the following verse. See chapter 8.35.]
\p
\v 42 . And Achaz [This Achaz was also a son of Micha] begat Jaera, and Jaera Begat Aleneth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri, and Zimri begat Moza.
\p
\v 43 . And Moza begat Bina; whose son was Rephaja, whoso son was Elasa, whose son was Azel.
\p
\v 44 . Now Azel had six sons, and these are their names, Azrikam, Bochru, and Ismael, and Searja, and Obadja, and Hanan: These are Azel sons.
\c 10
\s The Philistines smite the camp of the Israelites, vers.1. &c. Sauls three sons are slain, 2. Sauls three sons are slain, 2. Saul desireth his armor-bearer to stab him, he refusing to do it, Saul stabbeth himself, 4. His armor-bearer stabbeth himself also, 5. All Sauls house is destroyed, 6. The Israelites leave their cities, for fear of the Philistines, who take possession of them, 7. They find Saul and his sons lying dead on mount Giboa, 8. They cut off his head, and send it with his armor round about throughout their land, 9. After that they put it in the house of Dagon, 10. Those of Jabes in Gilead take down the bodies of Saul and of Jabes in Gilead take down the bodies of Saul and of his sons, and buried their bones there, and fast seven days, 11. Why God suffered Saul to perish thus 13.
\p
\v 1 . And the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled before the face of the Philstines, and they fell (down) slain on mount Gilboa. [See the annotate. On 1 Sam.28.4. See the exposition of this chapter, 1 Sam.31. which agreeth almost verbatim with this chapter.]
\p
\v 2 . And the Philistines held close after Saul, and After his son: And the Philistines smote Jonathan, and Aminadab, and Malchi-Sua the sons of Saul.
\p
\v 3 . And the battle waxed heavy against Saul, and the archers hit him: and he was sore afraid of the archers [See the annotate. On 1 Sam.31.3.]
\p
\v 4 . Then said Saul to his armor-bearer, draw out thy sword, and thrust me thorough therewith, left peradventure these uncircumcised come, and make a laughing-stock of me; [To wit, if I should fall into their hands alive] but his armor-bearer would not, for he was sore afraid: Then Saul took (his) sword, and fell upon it.
\p
\v 5 . When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, than he also fell upon the sword, and died.
\p
\v 6 . So Saul died, and his three sons: His whole house also died likewise. [Understand all that were with him: for Isboseth was not slain, as appeareth by 2 Sam.3. See 1 Sam.31.6. Also Mephiboseth the son of Saul remained alive, of whose posterity see above chap.8.34. and cha.9.40.]
\p
\v 7 . When all the men of Israel that were in the valley, saw that they were fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead: then they their cities, and they fled, then came the Philistines and dwelt in them.
\p
\v 8 . Now it came to pass the next day, when the Philistines came to despoil the slain: Then they found Saul and his son lying on mount Gilboa.
\p
\v 9 . And they stript him, and they took his head, and his armor, and they sent them into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish (this) to their Idols, And to the people.
\p
\v 10 . And they put his armor in the house of their God: And they fastened his head in the house of Dagon. [For they fastened the dead body to the wall at Beth-Sean, 1 Sam.31.v.10.]
\p
\v 11 . When all Jabes in Gilead [See the annotate. On Judg.21.8.] heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul, then all the warlike men gat them up, and they took the body of saul, and the bodies of his sons, and they brought them to Jabes: And they burnt their bones [to wit, after they had first burnt the bodies, 1 Sam.31.12.] under an oak-tree at Jabes, and they fasted [thus shewing their grief] seven days. [this is not so to be understood, as if they had fasted seven days and seven nights together, but seven days one after another, to wit, every day till the evening.]
\p
\v 12 . So Saul died in his transgression, [Oth. For his transgression. Compare num.27.3.] wherewith he had transgressed against the LORD, against the word of the LORD, which he had not kept. [namely, when God had expressly commanded Saul utterly to destroy and ban the Amalekites, 1 Sam.15.28. Here the accomplishment of the threatening there made, is described] and also because he had asked counsel of the sooth-sayer, [see the annotat. On Lev.19.31.] seeking to her.
\p
\v 13 . And had not sought unto the LORD: Therefore he slew him, and turned the Kingdom unto David the son of Isai.
\p
\v 14 No text on verse.
\c 11
\s All the Israelites assembled at Hebron, v.1. &c. and anoint David King over them, 3. Therefore they repair to Jerusalem,4. David subdueth the city 5. By means of Joab,6. David goeth to dwell in the fort at Jerusalem, 7. That city is repaired, 8. David waxeth daily greater and greater, 9. Furthermore mention is made of the Champions, and chiefest Commanders and Officers of David, and if their valiant acts, 10. As of Jasobam, 11. Eleazar, 12. Davids longing to drink water out of the well under the gate of Bethlehem, 17. Which those three Champions fetch him, but he would not brink it, 18. Abisai is the third among these champions, 20. Benaja smitteth two Lions, 22. And a great Egyptian man, 23. The Champions in the army, 26.
\p
\v 1 . Then all Israel gathered themselves unto David at Hebron, [Not that all and every individual person of all Israel was gathered together, but besides a great multitude of the commonalty, there were especially gathered together the eldest of the people and the heads of the tribes v.3. See below chap.12.23. So that this was as it were an assembly or convention of States or Parliament after Osboseths death] saying; Behold, we are thy bone, and thy flesh. [that is, thy kindred, and thy kinsmen. See the annotate. On Gen.29.14.]
\p
\v 2 . Even also in time past, when Saul was yet king, [Hebr. also yesterday, also ere yesterday, also when Saul was the King] thou Leddest forth, and broughtest in Israel: Also the LORD thy God said unto thee, thou shalt feed people Israel, [to wit, as a sherperd feedeth his sheep. See Psal.78 71. Kings are often called shepheards of the people] and thou shalt be leader of my people Israel.
\p
\v 3 . Also all the Eldest in Israel came unto the King to Hebron, and David made a covenant with them at Hebron, before the face of the LORD: And they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by the ministery [Heb. hand] of Samuel.
\p
\v 4 . And David, and all Israel, [That is, certain of the host out of all the tribes of Israel. See below chap.12.13.] went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus: For there the Jebusites were the inhabitants of the land.
\p
\v 5 . And the inhabitants of Jebus said unto David, thou shalt not come in hither: Never the less David took the fort of Zion, [To wit, the Fort that lay on mount Zion] which is the city of David.
\p
\v 6 . For David said, who so ever smiteth the Jebusites first, shall be an head, [An head in this place signifieth a General over the host, or men of war] and a commander: then Joab the son of Zeruja went up first to them, therefore he beadme on head.
\p
\v 7 . Now David dwelt in the Fort, therefore it was called the city of David.
\p
\v 8 . And he built the city round about, from Millo, and round about: And Joab repaired the rest of the city. [Hebr. he made alive, etc. that is, he renewed, or he healed, repaired, or mended that which was fallen to decay. Oth. Let live, etc.]
\p
\v 9 . And David went on still, and waxed great, [Hebr. went going, waxed great] for the LORD of host was with him.
\p
\v 10 . Now these were the heads of the Champions which David had, who behaved themselves valiantly in his Kingdom with all Israel, [i.e. in the transaction concerning the kingdom. Therein did those men acquit themselves with all the Israelites very valiantly and courageously, especially kin the taking of Jebus] to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel. [i.e. that he that in time past was anointed king by Samuel, might after Sauls death be settled and confirmed in the kingdom. For which end these champions assisted him against his enemies.]
\p
\v 11 . Now these are of the number of the champions which David had: [Out of these did David chuse commanders, that were commonly with him in the camp] Jasobam the son of Hachmoni was the head of the thirty, who lifting up his spear against three hundred, smote them at once. [compare this with 2 Sam.23.8.]
\p
\v 12 . And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite: He was among those three champions. [Understand Jasobam, who was the first, Eleazar the second, and Samma the third, who is here passed by, but expressed 2 Sam.23.11. These three are those that fetch the water for David from the well at Bethlehem.]
\p
\v 13 . He was with David at Has-Damuim, [Otherwise called Dammin, 1 Sam.17.1.] when the Philistines were gathered there together to battle, and the parcel of ground was full of barley, and the people fled before the face of the Philistines.
\p
\v 14 . And they [To wit, the forementioned champions. See 2 Sam.23.11.] set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and defended it, and they smote the Philistines: And the LORD delivered then by a great deliverance.
\p
\v 15 . And three of the thirty heads went down to the rock unto David in the cave of Adullam: And the host of the Philistines had camped themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
\p
\v 16 . And David was then in the hold; And the garrison of Philistines was then at Bethlehem.
\p
\v 17 . And David longed, and said, who will give me to drink (of) the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is under the gate? [That is, I wish there were some body that would give me to drink of that well, &c.]
\p
\v 18 . Then those three brake thorough the camp of the Philistines, and drew [Oth. Filled] water out of the well of Bethlehem, which is under the gate, and they carried it, and they brought it unto David: But David would not drink it, but he poured it out before the LORD. [i.e. to the honor of God.]
\p
\v 19 . And he said, my God cause that to be far from me, [Heb. be that far to me of, or, from my God] from doing it: should I drink the blood of these men? With Jeopardy of their lives, yea with jeopardy of their lives [Heb. with, or, upon their souls: That is, with peril of their lives. David repeateth or iterateth his former words, through great admiration. See the like phrase Gen.49.4.] have they brought it: And he would not drink it. This the three champions did.
\p
\v 20 . Now Abisai the brother of Joab, he was the head of three, [to wit, of whom straightway mentioned will be made, of Abisai in this 20. Verse, of Benaja, vers.22. and of Asahel, v.26. according to the opinion of some] and he lifting up his spear against three hundred, smote them. So he had a name among those three. [oth. But he had not a name among those three. The diversity of exposition ariseth out of the diversity of writing and reading the Hebrew text.]
\p
\v 21 . Of those three he was honored above the two, therefore he became chief: But he came not (up) to those (first) three. [The meaning is, that for strength and valiant acts he was not to be compared with the former other three, of whom is spoken v.15.]
\p
\v 22 . Benaja the son of Jojada, a valiant mans son of Kabzeel, [This was a city lying in the tribe of Juda, Jos.15.21.] was great in acts: He smote two strong lions of Moab: [see 2 Sam.23.20. Some understand here by Lions, strong men like lions] he also went down and smote a lion in the midst of the den [i.e. in a pit, or ditch] in snow-time. [Heb. in the day of snow, or, in a snowy-day.]
\p
\v 23 . He smote also an Egyptian, a man of great stature [Heb. a man of mature. That is, that is man of great measure and tallness. See 2 Sam.23.21.] of five ells, [Goliath was six ells and span long, 1 Sam.17.4.] and that Egyptian had a spear kin (his) hand like a weavers beam; [i.e. as thick as a weavers beam. Goliaths spear was as thick] but he went down to him with a staff, [a staff and sling were also Davids weapons, when he went to fight with Goliath] and he pluck the spear out of the Egyptians hand, and he slew him with his (own) spear. [David had likewise done this, 1 Sam.17.51.]
\p
\v 24 . These things did Benaja the son of Jehojada: therefore he had a name [That is, he was famous, to wit, by reason of his strength and power] among those three Worthies. [these three champions were in the second rank, and were these, ABisai, Benaja, and Asahel.]
\p
\v 25 . Behold, he was the most honorable of those thirty [See 2 Sam.23.24. where these thirty, and other besides are named] yet he came not (up) to the three: [to wit, of whom is spoken, ver.18.] and David set him over his guard. [Heb. over his obedience; that is, over his obedient (servants), understanding by them his Lifeguard, which were always with and about the King, to obey and execute his commands.]
\p
\v 26 . Now the chamions of the hosts were Asahel, the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem. [Otherwise, Elehanan his Uncles son of Bethlehem.]

\s Here are mentioned some of Davids Champions that came to him, when he was yet pursued by Saul, v.1, &c. First, some of Sauls own Family. Secondly, next some out of the tribe of Gad, 14. Likewise some out of the tribes of Benjamin and Juda, 16. And out of the tribe of Manasseh, 19. Lastly, here are rehearsed the Commanders of the souldiers, that came to David at Hebron, to make him King, together with the number out every tribe, 23. All Israel agree with one accord to make David King over them, 38. They feast one with another three days together, 39.
\p
\v 1 . Now these are those that came to David to Ziklag [See of this city the annotate. On 1 Sam.27.6.] when he was yet shut up before the face of Saul the son of Kis: [To wit, when for fear of Saul, he was sain to hide himself in caves, dens, in rocks, and on mountains. Oth. Shut out, to wit, out of the publike meeting of the people of God, yea out of all the land of the Israelites, because of Sauls tyranny] they were also among the champions [to wit, that are named in the fore-going Chapter] that were assistant to that war:
\p
\v 2 . Armed with bows, throwing stones with the right and left hand, [That is, they were as able to throw with their left, as with their right hand: see the like Judg.20.16.] and shouting with arrows out of the bow: they were Sauls brethren, [That is, of his Kindred, or Kinsmen. This did those men do, laying aside kindred and consanguinity, and looking on the just cause of David, in the injury and wrong done him by Saul. Thus did Jonathan himself, the son of Saul, maintain and defend Davids cause, although he continued with his Father] of Benjamin.
\p
\v 3 . The head (or chief) was Ahiezer, and Joas, the sons of Semaa the Gibeathite, next Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmavet, and Beracha, and Jehu the Antothite.
\p
\v 4 . And Ismaja the Gibeonite was a champion among the thirty, and (put) over the thirty: and Irmeja, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Jozahad, the Gederathite.
\p
\v 5 . Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealja, and Semarja, and Sephatja the Haraphite.
\p
\v 6 . Elkana, and Issia, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Josobam the Korhites.
\p
\v 7 . And Johela, and Zebadja the son Jerobam of Gedor.
\p
\v 8 . Also of the Gadites (there) separated themselves unto David [As if he should say, they separated themselves from the other Israelites that yet adhered unto Saul, and joined themselves with David] into that hold to the wilderness, [some understand this of the Fort at Ziklag; others of the cave of Adullum; others of Engedi] valiant champions, men of war, prepared (or armed) with [Hebr. ordering] shield and buckler, and their faces were faces of lions: [to wit, terrible to behold, as if they were lions] and they were like the Roes on the mountains in swiftness. [this commendations is likewise given to Asahel the brother of Joab, 2 Sam.2.18.]
\p
\v 9 . Ezer was the head (or chief): Obadja the second Eliab the third.
\p
\v 10 . Mismanna the fourth, Irmeja the fifth.
\p
\v 11 . Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh.
\p
\v 12 . Johanan the eight, Elzabad the ninth.
\p
\v 13 . Irmeja the tenth, Machbannai the eleventh.
\p
\v 14 . These were of the children of Gad, heads of the army: one of the least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.
\p
\v 15 . These same were they that went over the Jordan in the first month, when it was full in all its banks: [See Jos.3.15.] and they drave out all (the inhabitants) of the low grounds [To wit, that were by the Jordan] toward the East, and toward the West.
\p
\v 16 . There came also of the children of Benjamin and Juda into the hold unto David.
\p
\v 17 . And David went out to meet them [Heb. Before their face] and answered, and said unto them: If ye be come to me in peace [i.e. For peace, or peace sake] to help me, then shall mine heart ne likewise towards you: but if it be to deliver me up treacherously to mine enemies, whereas there is no violence in mine hands, [That is, whereas I am not guilty of having done any wrong or violence to any] the God of our Fathers look upon it, and rebuke it.
\p
\v 18 . And the spirit seized on Amasai, [Or clothed, that is, the spirit of the LORD, that is, the spirit of valour and clothed therewith as with a garment, in so much that he had an extraordinary courage and boldness to speak thus unto David, as is exprest in the following words. See of this phrase Judg.6.34. and elsewhere] the chief [Heb. head] of the Captains, [oth. Of the thirty] (and he said): We are thine, O David, and with thee are we, thou son of Isai, peace, peace be unto thee, and peace (be) to thy helpers, for thy God Helpeth thee: Then David received them, and made them heads of bands.
\p
\v 19 . There fell also (some) of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines to fight against Saul, although they helped them not: [Understand that David with his men helped not the Philistines in this battle against Saul and the Israelites] for the Princes of the Philistines upon advice left him, [that is, after they having advised with one another about it, found it not sitting that David should abide with them in the camp] saying, he would fall to his Lord Saul (to the jeopardy of) our heads. [Heb. with our heads he would fall to his Lord Saul. See the like phrase above chap.11.19. Oth. He will fall to his Lord Saul; to wit, if he be permitted to go with us into the battle.]
\p
\v 20 . When he went to Ziklag, [To wit, after that he was dismist by the King of the Philistines, 1 Sam.29.10,11. The King of the Philistines had given the city of Ziglag unto David, 1 Sam.27.6.] (there) fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozahad, and Elihu, and Zillethai: heads of the thousands that were in Manasseh.
\p
\v 21 . And these helped David likewise against those hands, [Understand here the companies or parties of those Amalekites, that had taken and burnt Ziglag, while David was gone away from thence, 1 Sam.30.1.] for all these were valiant champions: and they were Commanders in the army. [to wit, in Davids Army.]
\p
\v 22 . For at (that) time day by day there came to David to help him, until (it was) a great camp, like a camp of God. [That is, a very great and excellent camp. So it’s said, Psal.36.6. Mountains of God, and Psal.80.11. Cedars of God, that is, high tall. And Nineve a city of God; that is, a very grea city. See the annotate.on Gen.13.10.]
\p
\v 23 . And these are the numbers of the heads of those, that were prepared (or ready armed) for the host which came to David to Hebron, to turn the Kingdom of Saul to him, [See above at the end of chap.10. and at the beginning of chap.11.] according to the mouth of the LORD: [i.e. as the Lord had commanded, when he caused David to be anointed King by Samuel, 1 Sam.16.]
\p
\v 24 . Of the children of Juda, that bare shields, and spears, (there) are six thousand, and eight hundred, ready armed for the host.
\p
\v 25 . Of the children of Simeon valiant champions for the host, seven thousand, and an hundred.
\p
\v 26 . Of the children of Levi, four thousand and six hundred.
\p
\v 27 . And Jehojada was chief of the Aaronites: [Understand this thus, that he was the chiefest of the Priests, under or next to the High-Priest Abiathar: see 1 Sam.23.9. or chief of those priests that here are said to come to David] and there were with him three thousand and seven hundred.
\p
\v 28 . And Zadok was a young man, a valiant champion: and out of his Fathers house [That is, Family] were two and twenty Commanders.
\p
\v 29 . And of the children of Benjamin, the brethren [that is Kinsman] of Saul three thousand: for hitherto there were many that held with the house of Saul. [This is the reason why but three thousand Benjamites were come to David. Hebr. which held with the house of Saul. The Benjamites held a long while on Sauls side, because he sprung from their tribe: see 2 Sam.2.]
\p
\v 30 . And of the children of Ephraim, twenty thousand, and eight hundred valiant champions, men of name [See the annotate. On Gen.6.4.] in the houses of their Fathers.
\p
\v 31 . And the half tribe of Manasseh [To wit, that dwelt on this side Jordan in the land of Canaan; for the other half that dwelt on the other side of Jordan, came with the Reubenites, andGadites, to David, ver.37.] eighteen thousand, which are expressed by name, that they came to make David king.
\p
\v 32 . And the children of Issaschar that are expert in the understand of the times, to know what Israel ought to do: [i.e. Understand and expert men, which are able to give good advice and counsel at what time it were best to attempt any thing, or desist from it, whether in war and civil affairs, as Esth.1.13. or also in husbandry and country affairs] their heads were two hundred, and all their brethren (had regard) to their word. [Hebr. mouth.]
\p
\v 33 . out of Zebulon going forth into the army, prepared (or ready armed) for the battle with all instruments of war, fifty thousand: and to keep a battle-aray [Understand withal, they were ready or skilful: or came; as ver.38.] with an unwavering heart. [Heb. With not heart and heart; that is, not with a divided or double heart, but upright and counstant.]
\p
\v 34 . And out of Naphtali a thousand Commanders; and with them, with shield and spear, seven and thirty thousand.
\p
\v 35 . And out of the Danites prepared for battle, eight and twenty thousand and six hundred.
\p
\v 36 . And out Aser, going forth into the army, to keep battle-aray, were fourty thousand.
\p
\v 37 . And of the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and Gadites, and half tribe of Manasseh, with all warlike Furniture for War, an hundred and twenty thousand.
\p
\v 38 . All these men of war that were able to keep themselves in battle-aray, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David King over all Israel: [i.e. After they had well considered of the matter before with themselves, they came with a single and upright heart] and also all the rest of Israel were (of) one heart to make David King.
\p
\v 39 . And they were there [To wit, at Hebron] with David three days together, eating and drinking: [i.e. Making good chear] for their brethren [to wit, the Israelites that dwelt at Hebron] had prepared (somewhat) for them. [intimating that the Hebronites had provided meat and drink to entertain their brethren withal.]
\p
\v 40 . And also the next to them, [That is, that dwelt hard by them, or thereabouts, or round about them] unto Issaschar, and Zebulon, and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, meat of meal, and lumps of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and small cattle [i.e. sheep and goats] in multitude; for there was joy in Israel.
\c 13
\s David consulteth with the officers and Commanders of the army, vers.1,&c. concerning a general meeting, 2. And the fetching of the Ark from Kiriath-jearim to Zion, 3. This pleaseth the whole Congregation well, 4. To this end David himself marcheth up with all the Congregation, 6. They put the Ark into a new Cart, 7. Declared great joy with singing, and musical instrument, 8. Uza putteth forth his hand to hold the Ark, 9. Therefore God smitteth him, that he dieth, 10. David calleth the place where this was done Perez-Uza, 11. And he is afraid to let the ark be brought unto him, 12. But causeth it to be brought into Obed-Edoms house, 14.
\p
\v 1 . And David consulted with the Commanders of thousand sands, and of hundreds, (and) with all the Princes. [To wit, after that he had taken Jerusalem, and was become master of the Fortof Zion, into which he would cause the Ark of the Lord to be brought.]
\p
\v 2 . And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good unto you, [Heb. If it (be) good to, or, with you,] and to be of the Lord our God, let us spread forth our selves, Let us send to our remaining brethren, in all the Lands of Israel, [Heb. Let us burst out, or break out, and let us send, etc. that is, Let us send forth far and near into all places in Israel. It is a Rhetorical phrase, or figurative kind of speech taken from the overflowing of waters that break out and overflow] and to the Priests and Levites (that) are with them in the cities, with their suburbs, [Heb. of their suburbs] that they may be gathered unto us.
\p
\v 3 . And let us fetch back the Ark of our God unto us; for we sought it not in the days of Saul. [i.e. We heeded it not much, or minded it not greatly: For in regard the Ark was at Kiriath-Jearim, and the Tabernacle with the Altar, on which the sacrifices were offered at, were at Gibeon, there many of the Israelites made no great ado about the Ark, bit they performed their worship to God in the Tabernacle which was without the Ark.]
\p
\v 4 . Then all the Congregation said, that it should be so done: for that thing was right in the eyes of all the people. [i.e. This proposition of the King pleased all the people well, and they found it to be very good.]
\p
\v 5 . David then gathered all Israel together from Sichor of Egypt, till where they come to Hamath, [See of the river Sichor, Jos.13.3,5. This was the uttermost border of the Land of Canaan Southward, as Hamath was the uttermost border of it Northward: so that here the whole length of the Land of Canaan is described] to bring the Ark of God from Kiriath-Jearim. [This History is first described, 2 Sam.6.2,&c. The Ark was brought to Kiriath-Jearim, when it came out of the Philistines Land, 1 Sam.6.21. & 7.1.]
\p
\v 6 . Then David went up with all Israel to Baala, that is, to Kiriath-Jearim, [Baala and Kiriath-Jearim was one and the same city, Jos.15.9,60.] which is in Juda, to bring up thence the Ark of God the LORd, that dwelleth between the Cherubims, [see the annotate. On 1 Sam.4.4.] where (his) name is called upon.
\p
\v 7 . And they carried the Ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: [This was against the express command of God, Numb.4.ver.15. where the Lord commandeth that the priests shall carry the Ark upon their shoulders: see below chap.15.2, and 13.] now Uza and Ahio led the cart.
\p
\v 8 . And David and all Israel played before the face of God [Who manigested his presence above the Ark. So ver.10. See 2 Sam.6.7.] with all (their) might, both with Songs, and with Harps, and with Lutes, and with Timberels, and with Cymbals, and with Trumpets.
\p
\v 9 . When they were come to the Threshing-floor of Chidon, [Oth. Called Nachon, 2 Sam.6.6.] then Uza stretched forth his hand to hold the Ark, for the oxen stumbled. [see 2 Sam.6.on v.6.]
\p
\v 10 . Then the anger of the Lord kindled against Uza, and he smote him, because he had stretched forth his hand to the Ark: [No man might touch the Ark with his hand save the priests onely, Numb.4.15. of which Family Uza was not, although he was a Levite] and he died there before the face of God.
\p
\v 11 . And David was kindled [See 2 Sam.6.on ver.8.] because the Lord had rent on Uza: Therefore he [To wit, David, as 2 Sam.5.20.] called that place Perez-Uza, [that is, rent, or breach of Uza] unto this day. [the sentence will be made full and perfect thus, which is so called unto this day.]
\p
\v 12 . And David was afraid of the LORD that day, saying: How shall I bring the Ark of God (home) to me?
\p
\v 13 . Therefore David suffered not the Ark of God to be brought to him into the city of David; but caused it to turn aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gethite. [This Obed-Edom was a Levite.]
\p
\v 14 . So the Ark of God remained with the Family of Obed-Edom, in his house, three months, and the LORD blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that he had.
\c 14
\s King Hiram sendeth messengers to David, with Carpenters and Cedar-wood, vers.1. David increaseth in might, 2. He taketh more wives, and getteth many children, 3. Their names, 4. The Philistines marched up to battle against David, and David against them, 8. David enquireth of God what he shall do: who commandeth him to march up, promising him the victory, 10. David smiteth them, and calleth that place Baal-Perazim, 11. David causeth their Idols to be burnt, 12. The Philistines re-assume the Rear, 13. David enquireth again of the Lord, who telleth him what he should do, 14. Promising him also his help and assistance, 15. David smitteth the Philistines the second time, 16. Whence he getteth a great name, and is every where feared, 17.
\p
\v 1 . Then Hiram King of Tyre sent messengers unto David, and Cedar-wood, and Masons, and Carpenters, to build him an house.
\p
\v 2 . And David perceived that the Lord had confirmed him King over Israel: for his Kingdom was advanced to the highest (degree) for his people Israels sake.
\p
\v 3 . And David took more wives at Jerusalem: And David begat more sons and daughters.
\p
\v 4 . Now these are the names of the children which he had at Jerusalem] Sammua, and Sobab, Nathan, and Salomon.
\p
\v 5 . And Ibchar, and Elisua, and Elpelet.
\p
\v 6 . And Noga, and Nepheg, and Japhia.
\p
\v 7 . And Elisama, and Beeljada [Called El-jada, 2 Sam.5.16.] and Eliphelet. [above chap.3. is some alteration in these names.]
\p
\v 8 . When the Philistines heard that David was anointed King over all Israel, then all the Philistines marched up to seek David: [They marched up, to wit, with their forces, to make war against him] when David heard that, then he marched forth against them. [that is, he tarried not till they came and made war against him in his own Land; but having received a charge from God, went forth himself to meet them, Compare 2 Sam.5.17.19.]
\p
\v 9 . When Philistines came, then they spread themselves in the low ground of Rephaim. [See Judg.15.8. and 2 Sam.5.18. it lay in the tribe of Juda.]
\p
\v 10 . Then David enquired of God, [To wit, by Abjathar the high Priests, that put on the Ephod, etc. See 1 Sam.23.9. and 30.7.] saying; shall I marched up against the Philistines, and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the Lord said unto him, marched up, for I will deliver them into thine hand.
\p
\v 11 . Now when they [To wit, the Israelites] marched up to Baal-Perazim, [That is, rent-places, or, breach-plains. Or, the Lord of the rents, or, breaches] then David smote them there, and David said, God hath rent mine Enemies by mine hand, as a rent of waters: [see 2 Sam.5.on v.20.] therefore they called the name of that place Baal-Perazim.
\p
\v 12 . Ad they left their Gods [2 Sam.5.21. they are called Idols] there, and David commanded, [Heb. said] and they were burnt with fire.
\p
\v 13 . But the Philistines went on still, and they spread themselves in that valley. [Meaning the valley of Rephaim, into which they were fallen in an hostile manner, above, v.9]
\p
\v 14 . And David enquired once more of God, and God said unto him, thou shalt not marched after them: (but) compass them about from above, [or, turn about from them. Compare 2 Sam.5.23.] and come to them over against the mulberry-trees.
\p
\v 15 . And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt hear the noise of a going in the tops [Heb. in the heads] of the mulberry-trees, [that is, a noise as if some body walked upon the tops of the trees. See 2 Sam.5.24. Some understand this of the going of the Angels, that should fight for the Israelites] come then forth to battle; for God is gone forth before thy face, to smite the camp of the Philistines.
\p
\v 16 . Now David did according as God had commanded him: And they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon unto Gazer.
\p
\v 17 . So Davids fame went forth into all those lands: And the LORD gave [Oth. Brought] his terror upon all those heathens. [that is, God made many of the heathenish nations to be afraid and to stand in awe of David.]
\c 15
\s David prepared a place for the Ark of God; v.1. &c. and chargeth the Levites to carry the Ark, 2. All Israel come to Jerusalem, to bring up the Ark thither, 3. The namems of the Levites that came thither for this end and purpose, 4. David giveth order to the chief of them, what they should do, and how they should do it, 11. They obey David, 14. This is done with great triumph ad Music, 16. Michal, Sauls daughter, spying David dancing and playing before the Ark, disdaineth him, 29.
\p
\v 1 . And David made him houses in his city: [This was the uppermost part of the city of Jerusalem, which David had by force taken from the Jebusites: And it was called the city of David, because David had taken up there his dwelling-place. Hebr. and he made him houses in Davids city] And he prepared a place for the Ark of God, and pitched a tent for it. [see 2 Sam.6.v.17.]
\p
\v 2 . Then David said, none ought to carry the Ark of God, but the Levites: For them hath the Lord chosen to carry the Ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever. [see Num.4.15.]
\p
\v 3 . Also David gathered all Israel together at Jerusalem: to bring up the Ark of the LORD unto its place, which he had prepared for it.
\p
\v 4 . And David assembled the children [To wit, the posterity] of Aaron, and the Levites.
\p
\v 5 . Of the children of Kebat, Uriel was the chief, and of his brethren [That is, kinsmen: and so in the following chapters] (there) were an hundred and twenty.
\p
\v 6 . Of the children of Merari, Asaja was the chief, and of his brethren (there) were two hundred and twenty.
\p
\v 7 . Of the children of Gersom, Joel was the chief, and of his brethren an hundred and thirty.
\p
\v 8 . Of the children of Elizaphan [He was the son of Uzziel the son of Kehat, Exod.6.22.] Semaja was the chief, and of his brethren [to wit kinsmen] (there) were two hundred.
\p
\v 9 . Of the children of Hebron, [He was a son of Kehat, Exod.6.17.] Eliel was the chief, and his brethren were fourscore.
\p
\v 10 . Of the children of Uzziel, [He was also a son of Kehat, Exod.6.v.17.] Amminadab was the chief, and his brethren were an hundred and twelve. [these were other posterity of Uzziel, then are mentioned v.8. but they also called Uzziel their grand-father.]
\p
\v 11 . And David called the Priests, Zadok and Abjather, [Or Abjathar, he was high Priests, and Zadok was next unto him, according to the order instituted by God, Num.3.32.] and levites, Uriel, Asaja, and Joel, Semaaja, and Eliel, and Amminadab.
\p
\v 12 . And he said unto them, ye are heads of the Fathers among the Levites; hallow your selves, [That is, prepared your selves for this holy work, by outward ceremonial cleansing & purifying, but especially by cleanness and purity of heart. See Exod.19.10. and 15.] ye, and your brethren, that ye may bring up the Ark of the LORD the God of Israel, unto (the place which) I have prepared for it.
\p
\v 13 . For because he (did) not (this) [Understand withal, but did put the ark into a cart, above chap.13.7.] at the first: [to wit, when I intended the ark should be brought into mione house, 1 Chron.13.10.] the LORD our God hath made a breach among us, [understand this of the death of Uza, above chap.13.10. 2 Sam.6.6.] because he sought him not according to (that which is) right. [or, after the manner; that is, as it is just and besitting, Numb.4.15.]
\p
\v 14 . So then the Priests and Levites hallowed themselves, to bring up the ark of the LORD the God of Israel.
\p
\v 15 . And the children of the Levites [To wit, that were of Kehats family. See Numb.4.4.] carried the ark of God upon their shouldiers, with the bearing-staves that were upon them, according as Moseh had commanded according to the word of the LORD. [see Exod.25.14. Num.4.15.& 7.9.]
\p
\v 16 . And David said to the chief of the Levites, that they should appointed their brethren the singers with instruments of Musik, with Lutes, and Harps, and Cymbals, that they should cause them to be heard, lifting up the voice with cheerfulness.
\p
\v 17 . So then the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel, and out of his brethren Asaph the son of Berechja: And out of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan [otherwise called Jeduthun] the son of Rusaja.
\p
\v 18 . And with them their brethren of the second order: [These following were a degree lower then the former three principal] Zecharja, Bea, and Joaziel, and Seniramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaja, and Maaseja, and Mattithja, and Eliphele, and Nikneja, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel the porters.
\p
\v 19 . Now the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, [Otherwise called Jeduthun: his Father is called Kisi, 1 Chron.6.44.] caused themselves to be heard with copper Cymbals.
\p
\v 20 . And Zecharja, and Aziel, [Called Jaziel v.18. Ben. Mentioned v.18. is here left out. Some think that it is Azazia, whereof v.21. Others, that it belonged to the name of Zacharia] and Seniramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseja, and Benaja, with Lutes upon Alamoth. [that is, with a maiden-like and woman-like voice, which Musicians call the Superius, or Treble: or the Altus, and Counters-tenor, which must be sung with a woman-like voice. Oth. With fine, or, clear voices. Oth. Upon the Virginals. Understand this according to the opinion of some; and so in the sequel.]
\p
\v 21 . And Mattithja, and Eliphele, and Mikneja, and Obed-Edom, and Jeizel, and Azazia with harps upon the Scheminith, [So he calleth the Bassus, or Tenor, which indeed differ on octave or eight notes from the Superius or Counters-tenor. See Psa.6.1. with the annotate.] to strengthen the tune.
\p
\v 22 . And Chenanja the chief of the Levites, was over the lifting up: [That is, of the voices, or of the song, as v.27. that is, he was singing-master, or master of the song, who gave order for the tunes and voices, and when the singers should lift up their voice, or begin to sing. See ver.27. Others conceive that he was the chiefest in the lifting up of the ark; that is, that he had the ordering and managing of it] he instructed them in the lifting up, [oth. He was chief in, etc.] for he was skilful.
\p
\v 23 . And Berechja and Elkana were porters of the ark, [These, as is conceived, went immediately before the ark, And took care that no man should rush in upon it or come near unto it, as the door is kept, 24. Verse, there are two porters more named, which for the same end and purpose followed immediately after the ark of the covenant.]
\p
\v 24 . And Sebanja, and Josaphat, and Nathaniel, and Amasai, and Zacharja, and Benaja, and Eliezer the Priests did blow with the trumpets before the Ark of God: And Obed-Edom, and Jehijah were porters of the ark.
\p
\v 25 . Now it came to pass that David and the Eldest of Israel, and the commanders of thousands went to bring up the Ark of the covenant of the LORD, out of the house of Obed-Edom with joy.
\p
\v 26 . So it came to pass, for as much as God helped the Levites that carried the ark of the LORD, that they offered seven Bullocks, and seven Rams.
\p
\v 27 . Now David was cloathed with a mantle of finedinen, also all the Levites that carried the Ark, and the singers, and Chenanja the chief of the lifting up of the singers: [Oth. Of the song. Or thus: with the singers] Also David had altnen upper-garment on. [where with he covered his royal dignity and greatness before transcendened excellency and Majesty of God, behaving himself as the other servants and minister did in the service and worship of God. Heb. and upon David was an Ephod.]
\p
\v 28 . So all Israel brought the Ark of the covenant of the LORD, with shouting, and with the sound of the Cornet, and with Trumpet, and with Cymbals, making a sound with lutes, and with Harps.
\p
\v 29 . Now it came to pass when the Ark of the covenant of the LORD was come to the city of David: That Michal Sauls daughter looked thorough a window, and saw David leaping and playing; so she despised him in her heart.
\c 16
\s David and the people offer burnt-offering and thank-offering, when they brought the Ark into the Tent, that David had appointed for it, v.1. &c. and he blessed the people, 2. And giveth to every one Bread, flesh, and wine, 3. And he ordaineth Levites for the service of the Ark, and to praise the God of Israel, 4. Who were the heads over those that praised God with instruments of music, 5. There is described a psalm which David delivered to Asaph and his brethren, to bless and praise the LORD therewith, 7. Which being sung, all the people with one consent spake Amen, praising the LORD, 36. David appointeth singers, 37. Porters, 38. Priests to offer burnt-offerings, for the service of the Ark, 39. This being done, every man went home to his own house, 43.
\p
\v 1 . When they brought in the Ark of God, [That is, the Ark of the covenant made to the honor of God] then they set in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: And they offered burnt-offerings and thank-offerings [understand this of extraordinary special offerings which David and the people of Israel offered at this time] before the face of God. [see above chap.13.on v.8.]
\p
\v 2 . When David had made an end of offering burnt-offering and the thank-offerings: then he blessed the people in the name of the LORD. [That is, he let the people return home to their own dwelling places, praying unto God for them.]
\p
\v 3 . And he dealt to every one in Israel, from the man to the woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a fair piece (of flesh), [To wit, a piece of beef roasted at the fire, as the Hebrew word is interpreted by some. See 2 Sam.6.on v.19.] and a bottles (of wine)
\p
\v 4 . And he appointed (certain) of the Levites (to be0 ministers before the Ark of the LORD: and that to record, and to land, and to praise the LORD the God of Israel.
\p
\v 5 . Asaph was the head; and Zecharja the second after him: [Heb. his second] Jeiel, and Seniramoth, and Jehiel, and Maitithja, and Eliab, and Benaja, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel with Istruments lute, and with Harps: and Asaph caused himself to be heard with Cymbals.
\p
\v 6 . But Benaja, and Jabaziel the Priests, continually [That is, every day at certain hours] with Trumpets before the Ark of the covenant of God.
\p
\v 7 . Then on that day David delivered first (this psalm) to praise the LORD by the ministery [Heb. hand] of Asaph and his brethren. [That kis, kinsmen. The word rendered here first, is I the Hebrew, in the head; that is, in the beginning, or the first time. And this is so to be understood, that David first delivered this Psalm to the Levites to praise the LORDF therewith in the public service of god; after that he endited more Psalms. And delivered them to the Levites to be sung. See 2 Sam.23.1.]
\p
\v 8 . Praise the LORD, call upon [Oth. Preach, publish] his name, make known his deeds among the nations [this verse, and the 14. Next following verses, are a part of the 105. Psalm. Compare them together.]
\p
\v 9 . Sing unto him, sing Psalm unto him, speak attentively of all his wonderous works.
\p
\v 10 . Glory ye in the name of his holiness, let the heart of them that seek the LORD, rejoice. [As if he had said, remember that this is a special favor of God: That it is given to you to seek the LORD, therein you may rejoice indeed.]
\p
\v 11 . Enquire after the LORD and his strength, [That is, after the strong and Almighty God, See 2 Chron.6.41.] seek his face [to wit, the Lords face, who manifesteth his presence above the ark between the Cherubims. See Jos.4.13, etc.] continually.
\p
\v 12 . Remember his marvelous works which he hath done, his wonder-tokens, and the Judgements of his mouth. [That is, the punishments and plagues, which he commanded Moseh to denounce against Pharao and the Egyptians, which are described Exod. Chap.7. ver.8,9.10,11,12.]
\p
\v 13 . Ye seed of Israel his servant, the children of Jacob his chosen.
\p
\v 14 . He is the LORD our God, his judgements are over all the whole Earth. [That is, although he be a governor over the whole world, yet is Israel his peculiar and proper people by grace. Or, his judgements, that is, his punishments, which he hath caused to come upon the Enemies of his people, are made known and become famous throughout all the world.]
\p
\v 15 . Remember his covenant for ever, the word (which) he instituted [See Psa.105. on v.1.] to the thousandeth generation.
\p
\v 16 . (The covenant) which he made with Abraham, [See Gen.15.v.18. in the exposition] and his oath unto Isaac.
\p
\v 17 . Which he also appointed unto Jacob for a statute, (unto) Israel for an everlasting covenant:
\p
\v 18 . Saying; I will give thee the land of Canaan, a line [That is the land measured and divided with a line, See of this phrase, Due.32.9.] of your inheritance.
\p
\v 19 . When ye were few men in number; [Hebr. people, or, men of number, that is, people that could easily be told, because they were few. See Gen.34.30. Deu.4.27. and 33.6.] yea few [to wit, in respect of the great number of the Canaanites] and strangers in it.
\p
\v 20 . And they [To wit, your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, as ye may read of them in the book of Genesis, from the eleventh chapter to the end of the book] walked from people to people, [that is, from one people to another] and from one kingdom to another people.
\p
\v 21 . He suffered no man to oppress them, [Or, to do them wrong] he also reproved [or he checked, he rebuked] kings [to wit, the King of Egypt, Gen.12.17. and the king at Gerar, Gen.20.3.] for their sake (saying.)
\p
\v 22 . Touch not [Meaning so as to do them hurt, hurt not] mine anointed, [that is, my prophets, as immediately followeth: for the Prophets were endowed with the anointing of the Holy Ghost: as God also commanded to anoint Elisa outwardly. And here are first understood Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, which may be called Prophets, because the Lord revealed himself unto them, and communed with them, to that end that they might likewise instinct others concerning the will of God, Gen.20.7. Abraham is called a Prophet. Concerning Isaac, see Gen.27.4,28,29,30,40. And of Jacob, Gen.49. As concerning the anointing of the Holy Ghost, the same may likewise be understood of all the elect and faithful, that have received the anointing of the Holy Ghost, 1 Job 2.27.] and do my Prophets no harm.
\p
\v 23 . Sing unto the LORD ye all the earth, [That is, the inhabitants of all the land, or the Israelites all together] publish his salvation [to wit, which he performeth or sheweth towards us] from day to day. [This verse, and the ten next following are recorded in the 96. Psalm.]
\p
\v 24 . Declare his glory among the Heathen, his marvelous works among all Nations.
\p
\v 25 . For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised, and he is terrible above all Gods. [That is, he is more to be feared and dreaded then the gods of the Heathen. The meaning is, men ought to fear and stand in awe of him, and not the Idols; for here these things are not so set one against another, by way of comparison, as if the true God were to be feared, and Idols also, saving that the true God should be feared more then Idols. But by an absolute opposition, thus that we ought to fear and tremble before God, and not before Idols, who can neither help nor hurt. See the like opposition, Luke 18.14. where the meaning is, that the publican went to his house justified, and not the Pharisee.]
\p
\v 26 . For all the Gods of the Nations are Idols: [Heb.Elilim, that is, valianties, nothings. The Apostle Paul saith, 1 Cor.8.4. We know that the Idols is nothing. See Levit.19.4.] but the LORD hath made the Heavens.
\p
\v 27 . Majesty [Oth. Glory, or, ornament] and glory are before his face, strength and gladness are in his place. [That is with him, to wit, in heaven, or in his sanctuary, where he revealeth himself. See Psal.96.6. The Meaning is, he is a cause of strength, and of gladness, or joy of the Spirit, to those in whom he dwelleth by his Spirit.]
\p
\v 28 . Give unto the LORD, ye of the Nations, give unto the LORD honor and strength. [That is, know and praise the LORDS honor and might: acknowledge his glory and strength, giving him that honor that belongeth to him.]
\p
\v 29 . Give unto the LORD the honor of his Name, [That is, the honor which thou doest owe him] bring (an) offering, [or, bring hither the meat-offering, or, a gift. By a part of Gods worship, he understandeth the whole worship of God] and come before his face: worship the LORD [see Gen.22.on ver.5.] in the glory of the sanctuary. [that is in the glorious sanctuary.]
\p
\v 30 . Tremble before his face, ye all the earth, [that is, all the inhabitants of the earth] the world also shall be established, that it be not moved.
\p
\v 31 . Let the heavens [That is, the Angels in Heaven] be glad, and let the earth [that is, the inhabitants of the earth] rejoice, and let them say among the Heathen, the LORD reigneth. [that is, he sheweth and maketh it appear indeed, that he is a King that government all things.
\p
\v 32 . Let the Sea roar [Heb. Thunder; that is, give a sound, as the thunder doth; that is, roar, rage, make a noise] with the fullness thereof, [that is, all that is in it. To wit, the fishes, and monsters that are in it] let the field leap for joy, with all that therein is.
\p
\v 33 . Then shall the tree of the wood shout before the face of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth. [That is, the men on the earth.]
\p
\v 34 . Praise the LORD for he is good, [Otherwise, for it is good] for his kindness is for forever.
\p
\v 35 . And say, Deliver us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, [That is, seeing we are now united together, keep us together still, that we do to again rent asunder, as we have been formerly rent and divided. See hereof above chap.12.29. But this may further be understood of all future misery and calamity befalling the Church of God] and deliver us from the Heathen, that we may praise thy holy Name, and that we may glory in thy praise. [to wit, thereof, or therein, that we have cause and liberty to praise thee.]
\p
\v 36 . Praised be the LORD the God of Israel from eternity: and all the people said, Amen, [That is, all the people shewed, that they assented unto, and commanded such kind of praise, and that which was sung, was also the desire of their heart. See Deut.27.15.] and they praised the LORD. [Others, also praising the LORD.]
\p
\v 37 . So be [to wit, King David] left there before the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD, Asaph and his brethren, [That is, Kinsmen posterity] to minister before the Ark continually, according to what was every day appointed. [or, as every days work required. Hebr. according to the word, or, the thing of the day in its day.]
\p
\v 38 . Now Obed-Edom with their [To wit, his, and Hosa’s, of whom mentioned is made in the sequel] Brethren, [that is, kinsmen, posterity] were threescore and eight, and (he appointed) Obed-Edom the son of Jedithun, [oth. Called Jeduthun] and Hosa, (to be) Porters.
\p
\v 39 . And Zadok the Priests, and his brethren the Priests before the tabernacle of the LORD on the high place, which is at Gibeon: [Where the Tabernacle was brought and set up, after that Saul had slain the Priests at Nob, 1 Sam.22.19. See also 1 Chron.21.29. and 2 Chron.1.3.]
\p
\v 40 . To offer continually unto the LORD burnt-offerings upon the altar of burnt-offering, morning and evening: and that according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he had commanded Israel.
\p
\v 41 . And with them Heman, and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, [To wit, to the office of singing] who were expressed by name, to praised the LORD: for his kindness is for ever.
\p
\v 42 . With them then were Heman and Jeduthun, (with) trumpets and cymbals [Oth. And with them (to wit) Heman and Jeduthun, were trumpets, etc.] for those that caused themselves to be heard, and (with) instruments of music of God: [or, with musical instruments of God: that is, wherewith they praised God, singing and playing holy songs and hymnes upon them] but the sons of Jeduthun were at the gate.
\p
\v 43 . So all the people departed, every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house. [That is, to pray unto God for the welfare and prosperity of it; as above v.20.]
\c 17
\s See the Contents of this Chapter, 2 Sam.7.
\p
\v 1 . Now it came to pass when David dwelt in his house: [That kis, when he had attained to rest and peace] that David said unto Nathan the Prophet, Behold, I dwell in an house of Cedar, but the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD (remaineth) under curtains. [this History is also described, 2 Sam.7. almost verbatim. See there a more large Exposition of obscure places.]
\p
\v 2 . Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart for God is with thee.
\p
\v 3 . But it came to pass the same night, that the Word of God came to Nathan, saying,
\p
\v 4 . Go, and say unto David my servant, Thus saith the LORD: Thou shalt build me no house to dwell in.
\p
\v 5 . For I have dwelt in no house from that day that I brought up Israel [Understand, out of Egypt, from 2 Sam.7.5.] unto this day: but have gone [Hebr. been] from Tent to Tent [heb. out of the tent unto the Tent] and from Tabernacle (to Tabernacle.) This is said in regard the Tabernacle continued not in any fixed place, neither when Israel was in the wilderness, nor when they were in the land of Canaan.]
\p
\v 6 . Where so ever I have walked with all Israel, [That is, where so ever the Ark of the Covenant was brought, upon which I do manifest my presence] spake I a word to one of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, why do ye not build me an house of Cedar?
\p
\v 7 . Now then, thus shalt thou say unto my servant, unto David, thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepfold, from after the sheep, that thou shouldest be a Leader over my people Israel.
\p
\v 8 . And I have been with thee whither so ever thou hast gone, etc I have destroy all thine enemies from before thy face: and I have made thee a name, as the name of Great (men) is, that are upon the earth.
\p
\v 9 . And I have appointed a place for my people Israel, and planted him, that be may dwell in his place, and be no more driven to and fro, [That is, they shall not be transported from one place to another] and the children of perverseness [that is, wicked men that are wholly given up to iniquity] shall not weaken them any more as at the first.
\p
\v 10 . And from those days that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel: and have humbled [That is, quelled, subdued] all thine enemies: I have also told thee, that the LORD [that is, I; for the Lord speaketh here] will build thee an house. [that is, that he will give thee posterity to inherit thy Kingdom. See below v.25,27.]
\p
\v 11 . And it shall come to pass, when thy days [To wit, the days of thy life] shall be fulfilled, that thou goest to thy Fathers, [that is, that thou shalt die] then I wil cause thy seed to rise up after thee, [Compare 2 Sam.7.v.12. with the annotate.] which shall be of thy sons, and I will establish his kingdom. [Understand here not onely Salomon, and other of Davids posterity, but also Christ himself; for Salomon Kingdom did not continued always, but Christs Kingdom continueth for ever, Luk.1.32,33.]
\p
\v 12 . He shall build me an house: [Salomon built an house of wood and stone, but Christ a spiritual house, which is his Church] and I will establish his throne for ever. [this suiteth onely with Christ, not with Salomon.]
\p
\v 13 . I will be a Father unto him, and he shall be a son unto me: and I will not turn my mercy (away) from him, as I took (the same) away from him that was before thee. [He meaneth hereby Saul, who for his disobedience was deposed from the Kingdom.]
\p
\v 14 . But I will settle him in mine house, and in my kingdom [that is, in my church] for ever, and his throne shall be establish forever.
\p
\v 15 . According to all these words, and according to all this vision; [That is, according to all these words, revealed and commanded by visions] so did Nathan speak unto David.
\p
\v 16 . Then David the King came in, and continued [To wit, so long, until he had finished his prayer, which followeth here.] before the face of the LORD: [understand this thus, that David sat before the Ark of the Covenant, which was a token of Gods presence] and he said, who am I, LORD God? [see Gen.32.10.] and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hither to? [to wit, to the Royal Dignity.]
\p
\v 17 . And this was (a) small (thing) kin thine eyes, O God, therefore thou hast spoken of thy servants house for a great while hence, [That is, of things that are yet altar off, and which should not come to pass till along while after my time] and thou hast furnished me with this exaltation [or, excellence, or, eminency] after the manner of men, [to wit, speaking unto me most graciously by Nathan. Heb. after the manner (or order) of a man. See 2 Sam.7.9. Or thus: Thou hast regarded me after the manner of a man of high degree to wit, whereas I was before but a shepherd.] O LORD God.
\p
\v 18 . What shall David add thereunto more with thee, concerning the honor [To wit, done, or shewed] to thy servant? [as if he had said, Words do fail me, to set forth and publish thy mercies as they ought to be proclaimed] but thou knowest thy servant well.
\p
\v 19 . LORD, for thy servants sake, [By the servant of the Lord some do here understand our Saviour Jesus Christ promised unto the fathers; as Isa.chap.49. vers.6. and elsewhere] and according to thine heart [that is, according to thy loving kindness] hast thou done all these great things: to make known all these great things.
\p
\v 20 . LORD, there is none like unto thee, and there is no God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. [Which appeareth, and is made manifest by all the wonderful works & acts, which thou hast done since the world began, especially unto our Fathers, as we have heard of them.]
\p
\v 21 . And who is like unto thy people Israel, an onely people upon the earth, whom God went to redeem (to be) a people unto himself, [Israel sought not God, but God sought Israel, and chose them for his people, to consecrate and set them apart for himself. This is also to be understood of spiritual Israel; that is, the elect children of God: for no man cometh to Christ the fountain of life, unless the Father draw him.] that thou mightiest make thee a name of great and terrible things, by driving out the Heathen from the face of thy people, whom thou hast delivered out of Egypt.
\p
\v 22 . And thou hast made thy people Israel (to be) a people unto thee for ever: and thou LORD didst become a God unto them.
\p
\v 23 . Now then, LORD, that word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, let that be versified for ever; and do according as thou hast spoken.
\p
\v 24 . Yea let it be verified [To wit, that which thou hast spoken unto thy servant] and let thy Name be magnified for ever; let it be said, The LORD of hosts, the thy servant be established before thy face.
\p
\v 25 . For thou, my God, hast revealed before the ear of thy servant, [to wit, discovering unto him by Nathan the Prophet, what thou in thy counsel hast determined concerning him] that wilt build him an house: therefore hath thy servant found (in his heart) [this is here inserted out of 2 Sam. Chap.7. ver.27.] to pray before thy face. [what David prayed at this time is described more largely, 2 Sam.chap.7.]
\p
\v 26 . Now then, LORD, thou art that God: and thou hast spoken this good (thing) concerning thy servant.
\p
\v 27 . Now then, it hath pleased thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thy face for ever: for thou, LORD, hast blessed it, and it shall be blessed for ever.
\c 18
\s In this Chapter is related the very same, that is recorded 2 Sam.8.
\p
\v 1 . Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them; and he took Gath, and her depensdant places, out of the hand of the Philistines. [That which tendeth to the further exposition of this Chapter, thou mayest find 2 Samuel, chapter 8.]
\p
\v 2 . He smote also the Moabites: so that the Moabites became Davids servants, bringing Presents. [To wit, yearly for a token of subjection.]
\p
\v 3 . David smote also Hadarezer [Oth. Called Hadad-Ezer, 2 Sam. Chap.8. ver.3,5.] King of Zoba unto Hamath, when he [some do here understand David. Others, Hadar-Ezer] went to place his hand [that is, his camp. Compare 3 Sam.chap.8.on ver.3.] by the river Phrath.
\p
\v 4 . And David took from him a thousand charets, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand foot-men, [See the expounding or comparing of these words with that which is recorded 2 Sam.8.4. in the exposition there] and David houghed all the charet-(horses:) but he [to wit, David] reserved an hundred charets of them.
\p
\v 5 . And the Syrians of Damascus [Otherwise called Damascus: so likewise ver.6.] came to help Hadarezer, King of Zoba: but David smote of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
\p
\v 6 . And David put (Garison) [This is here inserted out of 2 Sam.8.6.] in Syria of Damascus, so that the Syrians became Davids servants, [Understand that they were made tributary] bringing gifts: and the LORD preserved David [that is, gave salvation, victory unto David] whither so ever he went.
\p
\v 7 . And David Took the golden shields, that were with Hadarezer servants: [Hebr. That were on, or, with Haderezer servants] and he brought them to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 8 . Also David took very much copper from Tibchath, and from Chun, [These cities are called Betarch, and Berothai, 2 Sam.8.8.] cities of Hadarezer: whereof Salomon made the copper sea, [Understand here by the sea, a huge great vessels, cast of brass metal, or copper, called Sea by the reason of abundance of water that it contained] and the pillars, and the copper vessels.
\p
\v 9 . When the King of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer the King of Zoba.
\p
\v 10 . Then he sent Hadoram [He is called Joram, 2 Sam.8.10.] his son to King David, toask him concerning (his) welfare, and to bless him, because he had fought with Hadarezer, and had smitten him, [That is, to visit, and to congratulate him, because o the victory that he had obtained] (for Hadarezer made war against Tohu) and all [that is, all manner of] golden, and silver, and copper vessels.
\p
\v 11 . These also King David hallowed unto the LORD with the silver, and the gold which he had brought with (him) from all the Heathen: [Intimating, that David dedicated unto God as well all the Presents that Tohu sent him, as that which he had gotten by conquest of his enemies] from the enemies, and from the Moabites, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from the Amalekites.
\p
\v 12 . Likewise Absai [He was the brother of Joab, and is commonly called Abisai] the son of Zeruja [she was David sister, as appeareth above chap.2.ver.16.] smote of the Edomites [2 Sam.8.13. the Syrians are named, not the Edomites. These two Nations combined together; and the camp of the one was smitten, as well as the camp of the other. See further Psal.60.on v.2.] in the valley of salt eighteen thousand: [this heroical fact that is here related, is 2 Sam.8.13. ascribed to David himself, that being usually ascribed unto Kings in War, which is done by their Officers or Commanders.]
\p
\v 13 . And he put garrison in Edom, so that all the Edomites became Davids servants: and the LORD preserved David whither so ever he went.
\p
\v 14 . So David reigned over all Israel: and he did judgement and justice [See concerning this phrase, Genes.18.v.19.] unto all his people.
\p
\v 15 . Now Joab the son of Zeruja was over the host; and Josaphat the son of Ahilud was Chancellor. [See the annotate. 2 Sam.chap.8.v.16. and 1 Kings chap.4. verse 3.]
\p
\v 16 . And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech, [He is called Abimelech, 2 Sam.8.17.] the son of Abjathar, were Priests, and Susa (was) Scribe. [He is called Seraja, 2 Sam.8.17. or it may be, that Seraja being dead, this Susa was made Scribed or Clark in his stead.]
\p
\v 17 . And Benaja the son of Jojada was over the Crethi and Plethi: but the sons of David were the first at the Kings hand. [That is, they were the chiefest Commanders or Officers that the King used in the chiefest matters of Government, that he might so sit and prepare them for the managing of the Affairs of the Kingdom, and in matters of state. See 2 Sam.8.18.]
\c 19
\s See the Contents of this chapter, 2 Sam.10.
\p
\v 1 . And it came to pass after this, that Nahas the King of the children of Ammon died, and his son became King in his stead. [That which is written in this Chapter, is first related, 2 Sam.chap.10. See the further clearing and exposition of dark places there.]
\p
\v 2 . Then David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahas, for his Father shewed kindness unto me: therefore David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his Father: When Davids servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.
\p
\v 3 . Then the Princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun; doth David honor thy Father in thine eyes, because he hath sent comforters unto thee? Are not his servants come unto thee, for to search, and to overthrow, and spy out the land? [That is, to waste and destroy the land, after they have passed thorough it, and spied it out.]
\p
\v 4 . Wherefore Hanun took the servants of David, and shaved them, [That is, he caused them to be shaved, to wit, their heards half off, or on the side: Thus mocking and abusing Davids Ambassadors. See 2 Sam.chap.10.v.4.] and cut their garments half off, unto the hips, [oth. Buttocks] and let them go.
\p
\v 5 . Now they departed, and it was told David of these men: [Oth. And they went and told David by men, etc.] and he sent to meet them; for those men were greatly ashamed: [that is, a great deal of shame an disgrace was put upon them] The King then said, tarry at Jericho, until your beards grown again, then return.
\p
\v 6 . When the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves stinking before David: then Hanun, and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver, to hire them charets, and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, [Heb. Aram, or, Syria of the two rivers. See the annotate. Gen.24.10.] and out of Syria Maacha, and out of Zeba.
\p
\v 7 . So that they hired them two and thirty thousand charets, [This may be understood of so many souldiers, that fought in charets] and the King of Maacha, and his people, they came and camped themselves before Medeba: Also the children of Ammon gathered themselves together out of their cities, and they came to battle.
\p
\v 8 . When David heard it, then he sent Joab, and all the host with the champions.
\p
\v 9 . When the children of Ammon were came out, then they put the battle in aray before the gate of the city; [To wit, before Medeba, of which city is spoken v.7.But others conceive that they camped themselves before their (own) city Rabba, which was the Metropolis or chief city of the Ammonites, of the siege & taking whereof is spoken below chap.21.] but the Kings that were come, were by themselves in the field.
\p
\v 10 . When Joab saw that the fore-front of the battalia was against him before and behind: Then he chose (Some) out of all the chosen (men) of Israel, and he put them in aray against the Syrians.
\p
\v 11 . And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Absai: [Otherwise called Abasai, 2 Sam.10.10.] and they put them in aray against the children of Ammon.
\p
\v 12 . And he said, [To wit, unto Absai] if the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt come to deliver me; [Heb. be for (a) deliverance] and if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will deliver thee.
\p
\v 13 . Be strong, and let us be strong for our people, and for the cities of our God: let the LORD now do what is good in his eyes.
\p
\v 14 . Then Joab, and the people that were with him, drew nigh to battle before the face of the Syrians? And they [To wit, the Syrians] fled before his face.
\p
\v 15 . When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians fled, then they also fled before the face of Absai his brother, and they came into the city, [To wit, into the city of Medeba, which the Amonites were possessed of at this time] and Joab came to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 16 . When the Syrians saw, that they were smitten before the face of Israel, then they sent messengers, and brought forth the Syrians that dwelt on the other side of the River: [Understand here the River Euphrates] and Sophach [he is called Sobach, 2 Sam.10.16.] Hadarezers [see above chapter 18.vers.5.] chief Captain, (marched) before their face.
\p
\v 17 . When it was told David, then they gathered all Israel, and passed over the Jordan, and he came to them, and he put the battle in aray against them: when David had put the battle in aray against the Syrians, then they fought with him.
\p
\v 18 . Put the Syrians fled before the face of Israel, and David smote of the Syrians seven thousand charets, [See the annotate. On 2 Sam.chap.10.v.18.] and fourty thousand footmen: Moreover he slew Sophach the commander in chief.
\p
\v 19 . When Hadarezers servants saw that they were smitten before the face of Israel, then they made peace with David, and served him: [That is, they became subject to him, and payed him tribute.] and the Syrians would not deliver the children of Ammon any more.
\c 20
\s See the contents of this chapter, 2 Sam.11.1. and chap.12.26. and chap.21.28.
\p
\v 1 . Now it came to pass at the time of the return of the year, at the time when kings marched forth, [To wit, into the field with their armies] then Joab led forth the power of the army, and spoiled the land of the children of Ammon, and he came and besieged Rabba, [the Metropolis or chief city of the Ammonites. See 2 Sam.12.v.26. and 29.] but David tarried at Jerusalem: And Joab smote Rabba, and laid it waste. [that is, destroyed it, and raised it. See the further cleaving and opening of divers dark places of this chapter, 2 Sam.11.1. etc. and chap.12. v.16. etc.]
\p
\v 2 . And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and he found it (to be) in weight a talent of gold, and there were precious stones on it: And it was (set) upon Davids head: [See 2 Sam. Chapter.12. verse 27, etc.] and he carried (away) very much prey out of the city. [Hebr. and the prey of the city be carried out, very much, or, which was very much.]
\p
\v 3 . He likewise carried out the people that were in it, and he sawed them with the saw, and with iron, and with axes, [Oth. With saws] and so did David deal with all the cities of the children of Ammon: Then David returned, with all the people, to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 4 . And it came to pass after that, when (there) arose war with the Philistines at Gazer: [See 2 Sam.5.25. and chap.21. vers.18.] then Sibbechat the Husathite smote Sippai, [ he is called Saph, 2 Sam chapter 21. Verse 18.] who was of the children of Rapha, [See Deut.2.11.] and they [To wit, the Philistines] were subdued.
\p
\v 5 . After that there was yet a war against the Philistines, and Elhanan the son of Jair [He is called Jaare Oregim, 2 Sam. Chap.21.vers. 19.] smote Lachmi the brother of Goliath the Gethite, whose spear-staff was like weavers-beam.
\p
\v 6 . After that there was yet a war at Gath: And there was a very tall man, [Heb. a man of measure; that is, whose body required much measure, a very great or tall man. As Nun.chap.13.v.33. and 2 Sam. Chapt.21.v.20.] and his fingers were six, and six four and twenty, [that is, he had on each hand six fingers, and on each foot six toes, making in all four and twenty, both fingers and toes] and he was also born of Rapha.
\p
\v 7 . And he reproached Israel: [See 1 Sam.17.10.] but Jonathan the son of Simea [Oth. Called Samma, 1 Sam.16.9.] Davids brother smote him.
\p
\v 8 . These were born to Rapha at Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants. [See 2 Sam.21.on v.22.]
\c 21
\s In this chapter is related that which is written, 2 Sam.24.
\p
\v 1 . Then Satan stood up against Israel, and stirred up, [Oth. Provoked, moved, excited, instigated] David to number the people. [See the further annotate. On this chapter 2 Sam.24.]
\p
\v 2 . And David said unto Joab, and to the Rulers of the people, Go your ways, number Israel from Berseba unto Dan [To wit, from the South to the North, from the one end of the Kingdom to the other. So likewise, Judg.20.1. and elsewhere] and bring them to me, that I may know their number.
\p
\v 3 . Then said Joab, The LORD add unto his people, as they are (now), an hundred times more: are they not all, O my Lord the King, my Lords servants? Why doth this (thing)? Why should it be trespass to Israel?
\p
\v 4 . But the Kings word prevailed against Joab: therefore Joab went out, and passed throughout all Israel: [Joab spent in and about this employment nine months and twenty days, As appeareth 2 Sam.24.8.] After that he returned to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 5 . And Joab delivered unto David the sum of the people that were numbered: and all Israel were eleven hundred thousand men [Heb. thousand thousands, and an hundred thousand. ]that drew the sword: and Juda four hundred thousand, and threescore and ten thousand, that drew the sword. [see 2 Sam.24.9.]
\p
\v 6 . But Levi and Benjamin, he counted not among them: [Heb. in the midst of them] for the Kings word was an abominable unto Joab.
\p
\v 7 . And this thing [To wit, that David had caused the people to be numbered] was evil in the yes of God: therefore he smote Israel. [to wit, with the pestilence.]
\p
\v 8 . Then said David unto God, I have greatly sinned, (in) that I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, take away the iniquity of thy servant, [that is, mine initiquity: See 2 Sam.12.on v.13.] for I have done very foolishly.
\p
\v 9 . Now the LORD spake unto Gad Davids Seer, [That is, Prophet and Teacher, who was with David, whither so ever he went. Of the word Seer, 1 Sam.9.9.] saying:
\p
\v 10 . Go and speak unto David, saying; Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; chuse thee one out of them, that I may do (it) to thee.
\p
\v 11 . And Gad came to David, and said unto him, thus saith the LORD, chuse thee;
\p
\v 12 . Either three years famine, or three months to be consumed before the face of thine adversary, and that the sword of thine enemies may overtake (thee): or three days the sword of the Lord, that is, the pestilence in the land, [The Angel of the LORD smote and slew the Israelites with the pestilence, as with a sword. See below vers.16,27.] and a destroying Angel of the LORD [that is, that shall kill and destroy many of the inhabitants of the land with pestilence] in all the borders of Israel; now then, look, consider, what answer I shall carry back to him, that sent me.
\p
\v 13 . Then David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me, I pray thee, fall into the hand of the LORD [That is, I chuse the pestilence, and not war: let meonely fall into the hand of the LORD] for his mercies are very many, but let me fall into the hand of men.
\p
\v 14 . The LORD then gave pestilence in Israel: and there fell of Israel threescore and ten thousand men.
\p
\v 15 . And God sent an Angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, and when he destroyed the same, the LORD saw it, and it repented him of that evil, [That is ceased to destroy with the pestilence: spoken of God after the manner of men. See Gen.6.6.] and he said unto the destroying Angel, it is enough, withdraw now thine hand: now the Angel of the LORD stood by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. [Oth. Called Arauna, and Arania, 2 Sam.24. 16.18. where is also shewed why he is called a Jebusite. See the annotate. There.]
\p
\v 16 . When David lift up his eyes, then he saw the Angel of the LORD standing between the earth, and between the heaven, with his drawn sword in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem: Then David, and the Eldest covered with sacks [that is, with mourning garments. See the annotate. On Gen.chap.37.v.14.] fell (down) upon their faces.
\p
\v 17 . And David said unto God, Am not I he that said [That is, commanded] that the people should be numbered? Yea I my self am he that sinned, and dealt very ill, [Heb. doing ill, have done ill] but these sheep what have they done? [it is true indeed that the subjects had not offended in or by numbering the people: yet notwithstanding they were justly punished of God for other sins of their] O LORD my God, let, I pray thine hand be against me, and against me, and against my fathers house, [as if David should say, slay me, and my fathers house, that is, my friends and kindred, with the pestilence] but not against thy people for a plague.
\p
\v 18 . Then the Angel of the LORD said unto Gad, that he should tell David, that David should go up, to rear up an Altar unto the LORD, in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\p
\v 19 . So then David went up, according to the Word of Gad, which he had spoken in the Name of the LORD.
\p
\v 20 . When ornan turned himself about, then he saw the Angel, and his four sons that were with him, hid themselves; and Ornan threshed wheat.
\p
\v 21 . And David came to Ornan, and Ornan looked, and saw David, son he went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself down before David, with the face to the ground.
\p
\v 22 . And David said unto Ornan, Give me [That is, sell me, as straightway followeth] the place of the threshing-floor, that I may build an altar upon it unto the LORD: give it me for the full money, [as Gen.23.9.] that this plague may cease from the people.
\p
\v 23 . Then Ornan said unto David, Take it but away, [Hebr. Take it to thee, or, for thee] and let my Lord the King do that which is good in his eyes: Behold, I give these oxen [to wit, wherewith I even now thresh: for in those times they were wont to cause the oxen to tread out the corn] for burnt-offerings, and these sledges for wood, and the Wheat for meat-offering, I give it all.
\p
\v 24 . And King David said unto Ornan, Nay, [As if David had said, I will in no wise receive anything as a free gift, which thou offerest to me] but I will surely buy it [Heb. buying, I will buy it] for the full money: for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD, [that is, to give unto the LORD] that I should offer a burnt-offering for nothing, (or, without cost.)
\p
\v 25 . And David gave unto Ornan for that place, six hundred shekels of gold by weight. [If these were common shekels, then every shekels weighteth two drams, or French Crowns. So that David gave for that place 1200. French Crowns. For the oxen, and the other Furniture, he gave fifty shekels of silver. See further the annotate. Gen.24.on v.22. & 2 Sam.24.on v.24.]
\p
\v 26 . Then David built there an altar unto the LORD, and he offered burnt-offerings, and thank-offerings: when he called upon the LORD, then the LORD answered him by fire from heaven, by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering. [God caused fire to fall from heaven upon the burnt-offering, thereby witnessing, that he had heard Davids prayer. Compare herewith that which is recorded, Lev.9.v.24. & 1 Kings 18.38. & 1 Chron.7.1.]
\p
\v 27 . And the LORD said unto the Angel, that he should put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.
\p
\v 28 . At that time, when David saw, that the LORD answered him on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite then he offered there.
\p
\v 29 . For the Tabernacle of the LORD, which Moseh had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt-offering, were at that time on the high place at Gibeon. [See above chap.16.39. and 2 Chron.1.3.]
\p
\v 30 . Now David could not go before it [To wit, the altar of burnt-offering: or, the Tabernacle which was at Gibeon] to enquire of God: for he was afraid of the sword of the Angel of the LORD.
\c 22
\s David stirreth up provision for the building of the Temple, ver.2, &c. He exhorteth Salomon to fear God, and to be diligent in building the Temple, 6. And he commandeth the Princes to be faithfully assisting to Salomon in this business, 17.
\p
\v 1 . And David said, Here shall be the house of God the LORD, and here shall the altar of burnt-offering be for Israel. [Oth. Here is the house, &c. To wit, where the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite was as if David had said, I perceive now that God hath made choice of this place, that he will dwell there, and that we must ordinary serve him there, for as much as he hath now answered me by fire from heaven, above chap.21.ver26. Deut.12.v.5,6,7.]
\p
\v 2 . And David said, that they should gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel, [These strangers were men that dwelt among the people of Israel, and served as hirelings: see 2 Chron.chap.2.ver.17. and chap.8.ver.7.] and he appointed Masons to hew stones, that were to be hewed, [Heb. stones of the hewing. [That is, which are sit to be hewed and cut] to build the house of God.
\p
\v 3 . And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails at the doors of the gates, and for the joinings: also the copper in abundance, without weight. [That is, so much that it could not be weighed, nor counted: so verse 4.]
\p
\v 4 . And Cedar-wood without number: for the Zidonians and the Tyrians brought Cedar-wood to David in abundance.
\p
\v 5 . For David said, Salomon my son is a youth, and tender, [That is, he is yet but a young man: yet he had a wife at that time, as may be gathered from Rehabeams age, 2 Chron.12.13.] and the house that is to be builded for the LORD, must be made great in the highest (degree) for a name, and for glory in all lands, [that is, that it shall become famous and renowned in all the world, by reason of its beauty and costliness] I will now prepared (provision) for it: so David prepared (provision) in abundance before his death.
\p
\v 6 . Then he called Salomon his son, and charged him to build an house unto the LORD the God of Israel.
\p
\v 7 . And David said unto Salomon: my son, as for me, it was in mine heart [That is, I intended, or purposed] to build an house unto the Name of the LORD my God.
\p
\v 8 . But the word of the LORD came unto me, [to wit, by Nathan the prophet, 2 Sam.7.17.] saying, Thou hast shed blood in abundance, and hast waged great wars: thou shalt build o house unto my Name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the eart before my face. [This is not so to be understood, as if just wars that are made upon good grounds, were forbidden of God, but because whereof Christ is the Head, who is a Prince of Peace, and hath made peace between God and us: Therefore his Kingdom, which is a Kingdom of peace, is likewise typified by Salomon, who reigned in peace.]
\p
\v 9 . Behold, the son that shall be born to thee, he shall be a man of rest, for I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Salomon, [That is, peaceful, or, peaceable] and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.
\p
\v 10 . He shall build a house for my Name, and he shall be to me a son, and I (will be) to him a Father; and I will establish the throne of his Kingdom over Israel for ever. [This promise of an everlasting Kingdom over Israel for ever. [This promise of an everlasting Kingdom is properly made good in Christ, Luke 1.3. whereof Salomons transitory Kingdom was a type.
\p
\v 11 . Now my son, the LORD shall be with thee: [Oth. The Lord be with thee] and thou shalt be prosperous, and shalt build the house of the LORD thy God, according as he hath spoken of thee.
\p
\v 12 . Onely the LORD give thee courage and understanding, [Or, understanding, and reason] and give thee charge concerning Israel, and that to keep the Law of the LORD thy God.
\p
\v 13 . Then shalt thou be prosperous, when thou shalt take heed to do the statutes, and the judgement, which the LORD commanded Moseh concerning Israel: be strong, and of Good courage, dread not, nor be dismayed.
\p
\v 14 . Behold there, I have in my oppression [During the troubles and miseries of war which l have undergone]prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, [see Exod. Chap.25.on ver.39.] and a thousand times a thousand talents of silver, and of the copper, and of the iron (there) is no weight, for it is in abundance: I have also prepared wood and stones, add thou yet more thereto.
\p
\v 15 . There be also with thee in abundance, that are able to do the work, [Heb. doers of the work] hewers, and work-men in stone and wood: and all manner of men in all manner of work.
\p
\v 16 . Of gold, of silver, of copper, and of iron (there) is no number: get thee up, and do it, and the LORD shall be with thee. [Oth. The Lord be with thee.]
\p
\v 17 . David also commanded all the Princes of Israel; to help Salomon his son, (saying,)
\p
\v 18 . Is not the LORD your God with you, and hath given you rest round about? For he hath given the inhabitants of the Land into mine hand, and this land is subdued before the face of the LORD, and before the face of his people. [That is, to the service of God, and to the use and benefit of the people of Israel.]
\p
\v 19 . So then give up your heart, and your soul, to seek the LORD your God, and get you up, and build the Sacntuary of God the LORD, that they may bring the Ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God into this house, which shall be built unto the Name of the LORD.
\c 23
\s David a little before his death declareth that Salomon his son should be king, vers.1. &c. And he caused the Levites to be numbered from thirty years old and upward: who were found to be eight and thirty thousand in number, 3. They are divided into several officers, according to their Families, 4.&c.
\p
\v 1 . Now when David was old and full of days, he made Salomon his son King over Israel.
\p
\v 2 . And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, likewise the Priests and the Levites. [To wit, before he declared Salomon king, as may appear below from chapters 28. And 29.]
\p
\v 3 Ands the Levites were numbered from thirty years (old), [Heb. from the son of thirty years; that is, from such as were thirty years old. See hereof a law, Num. 3.15. and 4.33. and chap.8.vers.24.] and upward: and their number was according to their heads, [Heb.skuls, also below vers. 24. That is, according to the number of their heads] men, eight and thirty thousand.
\p
\v 4 . Of these there were four and twenty thousand, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD: And six thousand officers and judges. [See below chap.26.29. and Deut.16.18.]
\p
\v 5 . And four thousand porters, and four thousand praisers [Heb. praising] of the LORD with Instruments, [under these are comprehended those that tune the Psalm or song, or the chief Masicians, which were in number 288. Below chap.25.ver.1.7. &c. Hebr. praising the Lord, etc.] which I have made, (said David) to sing praise. [Heb. to praise.]
\p
\v 6 . And David divided them into divisions; [Or companies, classes, course. He did this as a Prophets, 2 Chron.8.14. and by Gods appointment by the ministry of Gad and Nathan, 2 Chron. 29.25.] according to the children of Levi, Gerson, Kehath, and Merari. [See Gen.46.11. Exod.6.16. Num.26.57. and 1 Chron.6.1.]
\p
\v 7 . Of the Gersonites were Ladan, [Otherwise called Libni, Numb.3.18. and 1 Chron.6.17.] and Simei. [see of this man.on v.20.]
\p
\v 8 . The children of Ladan, [That is, the posterity of Ladan, that lived in Davids time, and were heads of their families. So is the word children taken v.9.] were (these) Jehiel the head, [That is, the chief, or chiefest and so forward] and Zetham, and Joel, three.
\p
\v 9 . The children of Simei [This Simei was not the son of Garson, but the son of Ladan. Of the posterity of Simei the son of Gerson is spoken v.10.] were Selomith, and Haziel, and Henan, three: These were the heads of the Fathers [that is, of the Fathers families] of Ladan.
\p
\v 10 . Now the children of Simei [The brother of Ladan above v.7.] were Jahath, Zina, [otherwise called Ziza v.11.] and Jeus, and Beria: These were the children of Simei, four.
\p
\v 11 . And Jahath was the head, and Ziza the second: But Jeus and Beria had not many children, [Heb. did not multiply children] therefore they were but of one reckoning in the Father house. [that is, they were reckoned to be Fathers house, to wit, in the house of their Father Simei.]
\p
\v 12 . The children of Kehat were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
\p
\v 13 . The children of Amram were, Aaron and Moseh, Now Aaron was separated, that he should hallow the most holy things, [To wit, that he might handle and administer holy things holy, whereunto they were hallowed and ordained by God. By the holy things may be understood the two altars, the tables, the golden candlestick, the Ark of the covenant, &c. When any of the other priests medled with these things, those things were then said to have been polluted and prophaned. The words rendered here the most holy things, are in the Hebrew, the holiness of holinesses] he, and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the face of the LORD, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name [see the form of blessing Num.6.14.] for ever.
\p
\v 14 . Now concerning Moseh, the man of God: His children were numbered among the tribe of Levi. [Intimating that the sons of Moseh in the administration of spiritual things, remained equal with the Levites or Kehathites, which were not of Aarons Priestly house, although their Father was a civil Magistrate. See further below chap.26.on v.29.]
\p
\v 15 . The children of Moseh were Gersom, and Eliezer.
\p
\v 16 . Of the children of Gersom, Sebuel was the head.
\p
\v 17 . Now the children of Eliezer were (these) Rehabja the head: [Here mention is made of children for child, as Gen.46.23. and 1 Chron.2.v.8,31. And he is called the head, that is, the first, though there be no second expressed, because he was his fathers first-born. So it is laid Mat.1.25. That Jesus was the first-born son of Mary; whence no ways can be proved, that the blessed virgin Mary had afterward any more sons or children] And Eliezer had no other children: But the children of Rehabja increased exceedingly.
\p
\v 18 . Of the children of Izhar, Selomith was the head.
\p
\v 19 . Concerning the children of Hebron Jeria was the head, Amaria the second, Johaziel the third, and Jekamini the fourth.
\p
\v 20 . Concerning the children of Uzziel, Micha was the head, and Jassia the second.
\p
\v 21 . The children of Merari were Maheli, and Musi: The children of Maheli were Eleazar, and Kis.
\p
\v 22 . And Eleazar died, and he had no sons, but daughters: And the children of Kis, their brethren, [That is cousins, to wit, their Fathers brothers sons] took them. [to wit, in marriage, or to be their wives, married them.]
\p
\v 23 . The children of Musi were Maheli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
\p
\v 24 . These are the children of Levi, according to the house of their Fathers, the heads of the fathers, as they were counted in the number of their heads, doing the work of the ministry of the house of the LORD, from twenty years old, [Hebr. from the son of twenty years] and upward.
\p
\v 25 . For David had said, [Or, David said, to wit, after that he had taken the Ark of God home to himself, and cause it to be brought into the strong hold of Zion] The LORD the God of Israel hath given rest unto his people: and he will dwell at Jerusalem for over.
\p
\v 26 . And also concerning the Levites, [To wit, had David said] that they should no (more) carry the Tabernacle, nor any of it (pertaining) to the service therefore. [This charge or task was laid upon them, Num.chap.4. but no longer then the Tabernacle was to removed and carried from one place to another. Here David gives the reason why he laid another task upon the Levites in or about the Temple, then they had about the Tabernacle, which sometimes was displaced, was displaced, or removed from one place to another: which was not done after that God had chosen a certain place, where he thence forward would be continually worshipped. And because the Levites were now to have a heavier task and service about the Temple, then when Tabernacle yet stood; therefore more persons were to be used and employed in that function or administration, and therefore there were admitted unto this service such as were of the age of twenty years and upward, v.24.]
\p
\v 27 . For according to the last words of David [That is, injunction, ordinance, which he made by the instinct of the holy Ghost, or according to what was brought unto him by the Prophets] the Levites were numbered, [Heb. were these the number of the Levites] from twenty years old and upward.
\p
\v 28 . Because their station was at the hand of the sons of Aaron [That is, the Priests. So likewise ver.32.] in the service of the house of the LORD, [see Num.3.6.9. and 18.2,3.] concerning the courts, and concerning the chambers, and concerning the purifying of all the holy things, [Heb. of all holiness] and the work of the service of the house of God.
\p
\v 29 . To wit, for the bread of ordering [Which was orderly laid in two rows upon the Table before the vail of the most holy place] and for the meal-flower for the meat-offering, [see Lev.2.1.] and for the unleavened cakes, and for the pans [that is, for that which is baked in pans] and for that which is broiled [oth. Roasted, fryed] and for all measure, [understand this thus, that the Levites were to take heed, that the meat-offering had its just and due measure of fine flower, oil, and wine] and dimension. [that is, they were to take the right measure of the places that were in the Temple, wherein this or that part of Gods worship was to be performed, or where any thing might be done, or not done.]
\p
\v 30 . And to stand every morning, [Heb. in morning, in morning] to thank and praise the Lord: And likewise at even.
\p
\v 31 . And for all the offering of burnt-offerings of the LORD, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set high times [Yea they were also to heed daily evening end morning sacrifices, also those, which were offered by the priests for particular persons] in number, according to the manner among them, continually before the face of the LORD.
\p
\v 32 . And that they should keep the charge of the Tent of the Congregation, and the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, [That is, their kinsmen] in the service of the house of the LORD.
\c 24
\s David divideth the Priests into 24 companies or classes, for the execution of their Officers, v.1. And he alloteth minister unto them out of the Levites, out of the tribe of the Kahathites and Merarites, 20.
\p
\v 1 . Now concerning the children of Aaron, (these) were their divisions: The sons of Aaron were Nadab, and Abihu, Elezar; and Itharmar.
\p
\v 2 . But Nadab and Abihu died before the face of their Father, [That is, in the presence of their Father: Or in the life-time of their Father. See Gen.11.28.] and they had no children: And Eleazar and Itharmar administered the Priests office.
\p
\v 3 . Now David divided them, both Zadok of the children of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the children of Itharmar, [Compare herewith below.v.6.31. where it is said that they were lifted or written down, and that the lots were cast before the face of David, and Zadok and Ahimelech, &c.] according to their office [or, according to their service.
\p
\v 4 . And of the children [That is, posterity; and so in the sequel] of Eleazar (there) were more found (to be) heads of men, then of the children of Itharmar, [To wit, as many more, as immediately followeth] when they divided them: [to wit, those that are numbered v.3.] of the children of Eleazar there were sixteen heads of (their) Fatherly houses, but of the children of Itharmar, according to their Fathers houses, (there were) eight.
\p
\v 5 . And they divided them [To wit, those that are named, v.3.] by lots, [as for the order and distinction among them, they left that to God, who ruleth and disposeth the Lots as seemeth good unto him] these with those: For the Rulers of the Sanctuary, and the rulers of God, [that is, who were set by God over all them that ministered in the sanctuary] were of the children [that is, posterity] of Eleazar, and of the children of Itharmar.
\p
\v 6 . And Semaja the son of Nethaneel the Scribe, (one) of the Levites, wrote them down, before the face of the king, and of the Princes, and of Zadok the Priests, and of Ahimelech the son of Abjathar, and of the heads of the Fathers among the Priests, and among the Levites; one fatherly house was taken [to wit, by lot] for Eleazar, and was likewise taken for Itharmar. [Heb. and taken for Itharmar: which some understand thus, that double or two-fold was taken for Itharmar: Others, that which was formerly taken for him, did still remain taken for him.]
\p
\v 7 . Now the first lot came forth [The lot was drawn out of a pale or some other vessels] for Jorarib, the second for Jedaja.
\p
\v 8 . The third for Harim, the fourth for Seorim.
\p
\v 9 . The fifth for Melchija, the sixth for Mijamin:
\p
\v 10 . The seveneth for Hakkoz, [Or, Koz] the eight for Ahija: [of this Abias order, or course, and of his posterity was Zacharias the Father of John the Baptist, Luke 1.5.]
\p
\v 11 . The ninth for Jesua, the tenth for Sechanja:
\p
\v 12 . The Eleventh for Eljasib, the twelfth for Jakim:
\p
\v 13 . The thirteenth for Huppa, the fourteenth for Jesebeab.
\p
\v 14 . The fifteenth for Bilga, the sixteenth for Imner.
\p
\v 15 . The seventeenth for Hezir, the eighteenth for Happizes; [Oth. Pitses.]
\p
\v 16 . The nineteenth for Petahja, the twentieth for Jehezkel:
\p
\v 17 . The one and twentieth for Jahim, the two ad twentieth for Jahim, the two and twentieth for Gamul;
\p
\v 18 . The three and twentieth for Delaja, the four and twentieth for Maazja.
\p
\v 19 . The office of these (men) in their service was, to go into the house of the LORD [To wit, on the Sabbath, and they continued there all the week long, until the next Sabbath, and that was so continued among them by turns. See 2 Kings 11.5. and 1 Chron.9.25.] according to their appointment by the hand of Aaron their Father: [that is, so as the same law was kept and observed by Aaron, according to Gods institution as followeth. Oth. Under the hand of Aaron: that is, under the direction of Aaron; to wit, of one of Aarons posterity, that executed the high Priests office, and therein succeeded Aaron] according as the LORD the God of Israel had commanded him. [to wit, Aaron.]
\p
\v 20 . Now of the rest of the children of Levi [Above chap.23. the Gersonites were described, here are described the Kahathites and the Meratites, which were the two other families of the Levites] of the children of Amram was Subael [chap.23.v.16. he is called Sebuel. He was Mosehs Grand-child, or sons son, and so of the posterity of Amram] of the children of Subael was Jehudeja.
\p
\v 21 . Concerning Rehabja: Of the children of Rehabja, Jissija was the head.
\p
\v 22 . Of the Izharites was Selomoth: Of the children of Selomoth was Jahath.
\p
\v 23 . And of the children (of Hebron) was Jerija (the first:) Amarja the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekamam the fourth. [This verse is here thus supplied from chap.23. verse.29. and chap.26.verse 31.]
\p
\v 24 . (Of) the children of Uzziel was Micha, of the children of Micha was Samir.
\p
\v 25 . The brother of Micha was Jissija, of the children of Jissija was Zacharja.
\p
\v 26 . The children of Merari [From henceforth he setteth down the rest of the sons of Levi, that were of the house of Merari] were Mahela and Musi: The children of Jaazija were, Beno. [oth. The son of Jaazija his to wit, Merari’s sons.]
\p
\v 27 . The children of Merari by Joazija were Beno, and Soam, and Zaccur, and Hibri.
\p
\v 28 . Of Maheli was Eleazar, and he had no children.
\p
\v 29 . Concerning Kis: The children of Kis were Jerahmeel.
\p
\v 30 . And the children of Musi were, Maheli, and Eder, and Jerimoth: These are the children of the Levites according to their Fatherly houses.
\p
\v 31 . And they cast lots beside [Or, over against, answerable to] their brethren the sons of Aaron [the meaning of these words is, that there were as many companies and courses of these Levites, as there were courses of Priests, that every course of Priests might have their own company or course of Levites, to minister unto them were four and twenty courses of Priests, so there were likewise four and twenty of these Levites, whereof the greatest part are mentioned in this chapter, and the rest in the former chapter v.8,9,10.] before the face of king David, and of Zadok, and of Ahimelech, and of the heads of the Fathers among the priests, and among the Levites: The head of the Fathers against his least brother. [that is, for the least brethren, as well as for the chiefest among the Fathers. Oth. Aboth, the head; holding it to be a proper name.]
\c 25
\s The Ordination of the singers out of the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, v.1.&c. distributed unto four and twenty orders, 21.
\p
\v 1 . And David, together with the chief of the host, [That is, the chief of the Levites: For in the law the Levites in regard of their multitudes employed in spiritual administration, were likewise called an host, Num.4.23. But understand such an host as were to heed the worship of God, and spiritual businesses: therefore in the wilderness they had their camp near the Tabernacle, Numb.chap.3. Now the Captains or heads of this spiritual host were the Priests, and among the common Levites the heads of the Fathers houses of Gerson, Kehat, and Merari, with the advice of whom, and of the Captains, David as being also a Prophet, made this Ecclesiastical order here mentioned] separated to the service, of the children of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophecy with Harps, with Lutes, and with Cymbals: And those that were numbered among them, were men fit for the work of their service [Hebr. and their number was men of the work for their service. (Men of the work) that is, men that are sit for the work.]
\p
\v 2 . Of the children of Asaph were, Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethanja, and Asarela, [He is called Jesurela, below v.14.] children of Asaph: At the hand [that is, according to the conduct, instruction, ordinance, &c.] of Asaph, who prophesied [that is, praised God by singing of Psalms and spiritual songs made by David, and other Prophets, playing them also upon Musical instruments. Thus is the word prophecying also taken, ver.3. &c. and 1 Sam.19.20. and elsewhere] at the kings hands. [the king made and endited the Psalms and spiritual songs, which the singers sung, who dealt herein as a Prophet. See above chap.23.on v.6.]
\p
\v 3 . Concerning Jeduthun: The children of Jeduthun were Gedalja, and Zeri, [He is called Jizri, v.11.] and Jesaja, Hasabja, and Mattithja, six, [understand withal Simei also from v.17. he must necessarily be joined with them, else there would be but five named here] at the hands of their Father Jeduthun, prophesying upon Harps, by thanking and praising the LORD.
\p
\v 4 . Concerning Heman: The children of Heman were Bukkija, Mattanja, Uzziel, [He is called Azzareel, v.18.] Sebuel, [he is called Sebael, v.20.] and Jerimoth, Hananja, Eliatha, Giddalti, and Romanti-Ezer, Josbekasa, Mallothi, Hothir, Mahazioth.
\p
\v 5 . All these were children of Heman the Kings Seer. [i.e. Prophet. See 1 Sam.9.9.] in the words of God [or, in the things of God] to lifting up the horn: [That is, according to the opinion of some, to sing the Psalms which contain the promises of God concerning the kingdom of David, and of Jesus Christ, whose power and glory are singnified by the horn] for God had given Heman fourteen sons [their names were mentioned v.4.] and three daughters.
\p
\v 6 . These were all of them placed at the hands of their Father, for the song of the house of the LORD, upon Cymbals, Lutes, and Harps, for the service of the house of God: AT the hands of the King, [See above v.2.] of Asaph, of Jeduthun, and of Heman.
\p
\v 7 . And the number of them with their brethren that were instructed in the song of the LORD, all (being) masters, [Heb. understanding ones, or, giving understanding (that is, teachers) who taught others [namely, their disciples or scholars) to sing and understand the psalms] was two hundred fourscore and eight [these two hundred eighty being added to the number of their disciples or scholars mentioned above chap 23.v.5. make up together four thousand.]
\p
\v 8 . And they cast lots for the guard, one against another, [To wit, to know what order they were to follow in the executing of their office] as well the small as the great, the master with the scholar. [Heb. so the small, as the great, as the teacher, so he that is taught. The meaning is, that the lot was cast between the four and twenty singing-masters, which are hereafter named, and each their scholars under them. In the casting of lots there will be no regard had to the greatness or smallness of the one or other singing-master, but they cast lots promiscuously one among another. Some think that this is to be understood of the smallness or greatness of the voices.]
\p
\v 9 . Now the first lot came forth for Asaph, [That is, Asaphs family] (namely) for Joseph; [this Joseph was for the house of Asaph: And although the number of those that were under Joseph, be not here expressed, yet it is credible, it is affirmed of all the rest, that they with their sons & brethren, that is, kinsmen, were twelve, that the same is likewise to be understood of Joseph] the second for Gedalja, he, and his brethren, and his sons, were twelve.
\p
\v 10 . The third for Zaccur, his sons and brethren; twelve.
\p
\v 11 . The fourth for Jizri, his sons, and his brethren; twelve.
\p
\v 12 . The fifth for Nethanja, his sons, and his brethren; twelve.
\p
\v 13 . The six for Bukkija, his sons, and his brethren; twelve.
\p
\v 14 . The seventh for Jesarela, his sons, and his brethren; twelve.
\p
\v 15 . The eight for Jesaja, his sons, and his brethren; twelve.
\p
\v 16 . The ninth for Mattanja, his sons, and his brethren; twelve.
\p
\v 17 . The tenth for Simei, his sons, and his brethren twelve.
\p
\v 18 . The eleventh for Asarel, his sons, and his brethren; twelve.
\p
\v 19 . The twelfth for Hasabja, his sons, and his brethren; twelve.
\p
\v 20 . The thirteenth for Subuel, his sons, and his brethren; twelve.
\p
\v 21 . The fourteenth for Mattithja, his sons, and his brethren; twelve.
\p
\v 22 . The fifteenth for Jeremoth, his sons, and his brethren; twelve.
\p
\v 23 . The sixteenth for Hananja, his sons, and his brethren; twelve.
\p
\v 24 . The seventeenth for Jasbakasa, his sons, and his brethren; twelve.
\p
\v 25 . The eighteenth for Hanani, his sons, and his brethren; twelve.
\p
\v 26 . The nineteenth for Mallothi, his sons, and his brethren; twelve.
\p
\v 27 . The twentieth for Elijatha, his sons, and his brethren; twelve.
\p
\v 28 . The one and twentieth for Hothir, his sons, and his brethren; twelve.
\p
\v 29 . The two and twentieth for Giddalti, his sons, and his brethren; twelve.
\p
\v 30 . The three and twentieth for Mahazioth, his sons, and his brethren; twelve.
\p
\v 31 . The four and twentieth for Romamthi-Ezer, his sons, and his brethren; twelve.
\c 26
\s The order and division of the door-keepers of the Temple, v.1. &c. and of the Treasurers that were over the treasures of the Temple, 0. As likewise of the Levitical Officers and Judges, 29.
\p
\v 1 . Concerning the divisions of the porters, [To wit, of the Temple. Here is to be noted, that there were three families appointed for the office of porters: as first, the family of Meselemja. Secondly, the family of Obed-Edom, v.4.11. Thirdly, the family of Hosa, v.10.] of the Korhites was Meselemja, [called Selemja, v.14.] the son of Kore, of the children of Asaph. [this was another Asaph, then that famous chief singers, of whom is spoken in the 25. Chapter.]
\p
\v 2 . Now Meselemja had children: Secharja was the first-born, [For first-born is often used (above chap.23.v.10,18,19, &c. the word head] Jediael the second, zebadja the third, Jathniel the fourth.
\p
\v 3 . Elam the fist, Johanan the six, Eljeoenai the seventh.
\p
\v 4 . Obed-Edom had also children: Semaja was the first-born, Jozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sachar the fourth, and Nethaneel the fist.
\p
\v 5 . Ammiel the six, Issaschur the seventh, Peullethai the eight, for God had blessed him. [To wit, Obed-Edom, to whom God gave children and grand-children. See below v.8. This phrase is also used, Gen.2.v.22, 18, &c.]
\p
\v 6 . Also unto Semaja his son were children born, ruling over the house of their Father: For they were valiant champions. [That is, mighty men, that were valiant and courageous in the execution of their office, to wit, in keeping their guard, and in removing all violence and disorder from the doors of the Temple.]
\p
\v 7 . The children of Semaja were Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, (and) Elzabad [Some make of Obed and Elzabad but one name: Others do here insert the word and, the there be four and twenty heads here, as there be in the other courses] his brethren valiant men: [Heb. children, or, sons of valour] Elihu, and Semachja.
\p
\v 8 . All these were of the children of Obed-Edom, they and their children, and their brethren, valiant men in strength for the service, there were threescore and two of Obed-Edom.
\p
\v 9 . Now Meselemja had children and brethren, valiant men, eighteen.
\p
\v 10 . And Hosa of the children of Merari, had sons: Simri was the head (although he was not the first-born, yet his Father made him an head.) [The Father might not give the birth right to this son of his, and exclude the first-born without some special and remarkeable cause, which it may be was given here. See the law, Deu.21.16,17.]
\p
\v 11 . Hilkija was the second, Tebalja the third, ZEcharja the fourth; all the children and brethren of Hosa were thirteen.
\p
\v 12 . Out of these were the divisions of the Porters among the heads of the men, for the wards against their brethren: [See chap.24.v.31.] to minister in the house of the LORD. [the meaning of the words of this verse is, that these porters or door-keepers were also divided into four and twenty courses, as the other Levites were, each in their function or administration, and that they likewise so came on, and went off in their wards by turns, as the others did, changing their courses every Sabbath day.]
\p
\v 13 . And they cast lots as well the small as the great, [Heb. as the small, so the great, as chap.25.v.8.] according to their fatherly houses, for every gate. [understand that they cast or drew lots, according as the gates of the Temple, or other places lay, where they were to keep guard: also according to the number of the persons that were to keep guard in every place. Heb. for gate and gate.]
\p
\v 14 . Now the lot East-ward [That is, of the gate that lay East-ward: and so in the sequel] fell upon Selemja: but for Zecharja his son, who was an understanding Counsellor, they cast lots, and his lots came forth North-ward.
\p
\v 15 . For Obed-Edom Southward, and for his children the house of the treasure-chambers. [Intimating that some of the children of Obed-Edom kept guard at the south-gate of the Temple, and some at the treasure-chambers. The words rendered here the house of the treasure-chambers, are in the Heb. the house of gatherings; that is, where the gifts that were given by the people toward the building and repairing of the Temple, were gathered and kept, as also the tithes, first-fruits, &c. See 2 Chron.25.v.24. But some conceive that this was an house or building near adjoining to the Temple, where the Teachers of the law, Prophets, and singing-masters kept their meetings and assemblies to discourse and commune together about the laws and commandments of the Lord. Others retain here the Hebrew word Asuppim, as being the name of a certain place.]
\p
\v 16 . For Suppim and Hosa [Understand the house of Hosa the son of Suppim of the family of Merari. Some are of opinion that Suppim and Hosa were brethren, that in the lot they were joined together under one head] westward, with the gate Schallecheth, by the ascending highway: [the meaning of these words is, that Suppim and Hosa had not only the guard at the West-gate, (which was called the hinder gate, because it stood behind the gate of the Sanctuary, where the ark of the covenant stood) but also at another gate that was hard by, near unto the ascent or gallery that Salomon had made, to go from the city of David into the Temple. See of this ascent,2 Kings 12.v.20. and 2 Chron.9.v.11.] ward over against ward. [that is, they were so ordered, that as soon as one went off the service of the house of the Lord, another came on. Or they kept watch each in his place over against one another: or they were like one another each in his ward.]
\p
\v 17 . East-ward were six Levites: North-ward four a day. South-ward four a day; But by the treasure-chambers two (and) two.
\p
\v 18 . At Parbar [Parbar is a Chaldee word, and signifieth an outermost part, or, a part that cometh outward] Westward there were four by the high way, two by Parbar.
\p
\v 19 . These are the divisions of the porters of the children of the Korhites, and of the children of Merari.
\p
\v 20 . Also of the Levites, Ahija was over the treasures of the house of God, and [Oth. That is, or, to wit, as the letter vau is taken, Judg.7.14. and 1 Sam.28.3, etc.] over the treasures of the hallowed things. [here is to be noted that there were divers treasures in the house of the Lord: For first, there was gathered that which was given toward the maintenance of the Priests and Levites, as there were the first fruits and the tithes, or the value thereof. Secondly, that which was hallowed or consecrated to the Lord, as freewill-offering, vows ransom money for the first-born, and the like, out of which were allowed the expences and charges toward the daily sacrifice, as also toward the offerings o the Sabbath, new moons, and annual feasts, etc. Thirdly, there was also money gathered for the building of the Temple, and maintaining of the same. See below ver.26,27,28.]
\p
\v 21 . Of the children of Ladan, [Otherwise called Libni] children of Ladan the Gersonite: of Ladan the Gersonite were heads of the Fathers, Jehieli.
\p
\v 22 . The children of Jehieli were Zetham, and Joel [Above chap.23. vers.8. Zetham and Joel are called children of Ladan, either because they were his grandchildren, or because they were his children indeed, and brethren of Jehieli, and that Zetham and Joel were here called children of Jehieli after the names of their Uncles] his brother: (these) were over the treasures of the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 23 Of the Amramites, of the Izharites, of the Hebronites, of the Uzzielites.
\p
\v 24 . And Sebuel the son [That is, posterity. See above chap.23.v.16.] of Gersom the son of Moseh, was chief over the treasures. [he might be called chief Accountant, or, President in the chamber of accounts.]
\p
\v 25 . But his brethren [That is, kinsmen] from Eliezer, [that is, that sprung from Eliezer. Eliezer was the second of Moses, whose posterity are here made keepers of the treasures] were (these:) Rehabja was his son, and Joram his son, and Zubri his son, and Selomith hisson.
\p
\v 26 . This Selomith and his brethren, [That is, kinsmen] were over all the treasures of the holy things, which King David had hallowed, together with the heads of the Fathers, the Rulers over thousand, and hundreds, and the chief of the host had hallowed, [that is, had presented in the temple for the service of God.]
\p
\v 27 . Of the wars, [That is, of the spoil gotten in war] and of the spoil had they hallowed it, to maintain the house of the LORD. [to wit, after the house being built, should in time have need of repairing.]
\p
\v 28 . Also all that Samuel the Seer, [See 1 Sam.9.9.] had hallowed, and Saul the son of Kis, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruja: all that (anyman) had hallowed, was under the hand of Selomith and his brethren.
\p
\v 29 . Of the Izharites, Chenanja, and his sons were for the outwork in Israel, for Officers and for Judges. [That is, for such businesses as were to be done without Jerusalem, understanding thereby, that they likewise executed the office of Judges and Officers in the land. For although the Levites were continued ordinary Churchminister: Yet some of them were likewise employed and made use of in civil affairs and administrations, not only in their own cities, that were given them of the tribes by the order and appointment of god, but also being called thereunto from other places: (as appeareth by these places, v.29,30,31,32. Also above ch.23.v.4. compared with 2 Chron.19.11.) for as much as Levi was likewise one of the tribes of Israel, and the laws and statutes concerning the Common-wealth of Israel were written in the book of the law of God, which especially was commended to the Levites. See 2 Chron.17.8,9, etc. Other conceive that the outward work of the Levites was this, that they throughout all the land gathered and provided that which was necessary for the building of the Temple, and for the worship off God. See 2 Chron.34.v.13. Neh.11.16.]
\p
\v 30 . Of the Hebronites was Asabja and his brethren, valiant men, a thousand and seven hundred, over the offices of Israel on this side Jordan West-ward: over the work of the LORD, and for the Kings service.
\p
\v 31 . Of the Hebronites Jorija was the head, of the Hebronites of his generations among the Fathers: In the fourteenth year of Davids reign [This was the last year of Davids reign, wherein he made the above recited order, before he made Salomon king in his stead, holding for that purpose a great assembly of the people, below chap.28.29.] there were sought and found among them valiant champions at Jaezer in Gilead. [this was a city in the land of Gilead, given to the Merarites for a dwelling-place, Jos.21.39.]
\p
\v 32 . And his [To wit, Jerijas] brethren [that is, kinsmen] were valiant men, [see above v.7.] two thousand and seven hundred heads of the Fathers: And king David set them over the Reubenites, and Gadites, and the half tribe of the Manassites, for all Matters of God, and the matters of the king. [compare verse 30.]

Now these are the children of Israel according to their number, the heads of the Fathers, and the Captains of the thousand, and of the hundreds, with their Officers, serving the king in all matters of the divisions [That is, of the orders, into which David had divided the host] coming on, and going off from month to month in all the months of the year. [understand, that according to the division made by David, the twelve Chieftains with their men were to keep their guards and their marchings forth for a month together, Changing their courses every month. And whatever businesses or difficulties occurred, where unto military strength was required, for that those were to be in readiness, whose month and turn it was. So that those things were as it were Legions, or, hands of the militia, or train-bands, which were to be always in readiness for the service of King and country] every division was four and twenty thousand.
\p
\v 2 . Over the first division in the first month was Jasabham [See of this Commander, 2 Sam.23.8. where he is called Joschebbasthebeth] the son of Zabdiel: And in his divisions there were four and twenty thousand.
\p
\v 3 . He was of the children of Perez, the head of all the Captains of the hosts in the first month. [oth. He was of the children of Perez, (and) he was the chief over all the Captains, etc.]
\p
\v 4 . And over the division in the second month was Dodai [Otherwise called Dodo, 2 Sam.23.9.] the Abohite and (over) his division was Mikloth also Leader: [oth. After that Mikloth became Commander over his division: To wit, when Dodai was dead: But others understand this thus, that Mikloth was Dodai’s Lieutenant] in his division there were likewise four and twenty thousand.
\p
\v 5 . The third Commander of the host in the third month was Benaja the son of Jojada the chief officer, [Heb. Cohen; which signifieth a person that executeth an honourable office, either in church or state] he was the head: In his division there were likewise four and twenty thousand.
\p
\v 6 . This Benaja was a champion of the thirty, [These thirty champions are expressed by name, 2 Sam.23.24, etc. and 1 Chron.11.26.] and over the thirty. And (over) his division was Ammizabad his son. [some understand this thus, that this Ammazabad was Chief Lleutenant of his Fathers Regiment: Who was also Commander over the Crethi and Plethi, 2 Sam.8.18.]
\p
\v 7 . The fourth [To wit, Commander: and so in the sequel] of the fourth month; was Asahel the brother of Joab, and after him [to wit, after his death, after that he was slain by Abner, 2 Sam.2.23.] Zebadja his son: In his division there were also four and twenty thousand.
\p
\v 8 .The fifth commander in the fifth month, was Samhath [He is called Samma, 2 Sam.23.15. and Sammoth 1 Chron.11.27.] the Izrahite: In his division there were also four and twenty thousand.
\p
\v 9 . The six, in the six month, was Iru the son of Ikkes the Tekoite: In his division there were also four and twenty thousand.
\p
\v 10 . The seventh, in the seventh month, was Helez, the Palonite [Otherwise called Paltite, 2 Sam.23.26.] of the children of Ephraim: In his division there were also four and twenty thousand.
\p
\v 11 . The eighth, in the eight month, was Sibbechai the Husathite, of the Zarhites: [These were the posterity of Zerah the son of Juda] In his division there were also four and twenty thousand.
\p
\v 12 . The ninth, in the ninth month, was Abidzer the Anethotite, of the Benjamites: in his division there were also four and twenty thousand.
\p
\v 13 . The tenth, in the tenth month, was Maharai the Methophathite, of the Zarhites: In his division there were also four and twenty thousand.
\p
\v 14 . The eleventh, in the eleventh month, was Benaja the Pirhathonite, of the children of Ephraim: in his division there were likewise four and twenty thousand.
\p
\v 15 . The twelfth, in the twelfth month, was Heldai [Otherwise called Heled, 1 Chron.11.30. and Hebeb, 2 Sam.23.29.] the Netophathite, of Othniel: In his division there were also four and twenty thousand.
\p
\v 16 . But over the tribes of Israel were (these): Over the Reubenites Eliezer the son of zichri was Leader: over the Simeonites was Sephatja the son of Maacha.
\p
\v 17 . Over the Levites was Hasabia the son of Kemuel, over the Aaronites [Hebr. over Aaron, that is, over the high Priests house, which ought to continue in Aarons family] was Zadok.
\p
\v 18 . Over Juda was Elihu, [Called Eliab, 1 Sam.16.6.] (one) of Davids brethren: over Issaschar was Homri the son of Michael.
\p
\v 19 . Over Zebulon was Ismaja the son of Obadja: over Naphathali was Jerimoth the son of Azriel.
\p
\v 20 . Over the children [That is, posterity] of Ephraim was Hosea the son of Azazia; over the half tribe of Manasseh was Joel the son of Pedaja.
\p
\v 21 . Over half Manasseh in Gilead, was Iddo the son Zacharja: over Benjamin was Jaasiel the son of Abner.
\p
\v 22 . Over Dan was Azarel the son of Jeroham: these [To wit, that were even now expressly named] were the Princes of the tribes of Israel. [Aser and Gad with the Chieftains are not named in this Register, why they are passed by or concealed, is uncertained.]
\p
\v 23 . But David took not the number of them that were twenty years old, [Heb. from the son of twenty years] and under; because the LORD had said, that he would multiply Israel as the stars of Heaven. [understand this thus, that David would not number these, that it might not appear that he doubteth of the promise of God made to Abraham, Gen.22.17. and 26.4. Some understand this thus, David would not take the number of the people after the time that he was chastised and punished of God for causing the people to be numbered by Joab.]
\p
\v 24 . Joab the son of Zeruja had begun to number, [To wit, all the Israelites that were above twenty years old, 2 Sam.24.] but he finished it not, [for he counted not Benjamin nor Levi, because he did this work of numbering the people grudgingly, and against his will. See 1 Chron.21.6.] because there came great wrath upon Israel for it: [meaning the burning wrath of God; that is, the hot siery pestilence, 2 Sam.24.13.] therefore the number is not brought into the account [Hebr. into the number] of the Chronicle of king David. [to wit, the full number was not brought in; for Joab took not the number of Levi and Benjamin, chap.21.6. Others understand this thus, that David being grieved for what he had done, would not have this to be set down in the public records; but God would have it to be recorded in the books of the holy Scripture.]
\p
\v 25 . And over the kings treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel. [Understand those treasures that were in the kings house, or within Jerusalem; as Jonathan was over the kings treasures and revenues, that were received and gathered without the said city] and over the treasures in the country, in the cities, and in the towers; [that is, castles, strong holds, fenced houses] was Jonathan the son of Uzzija.
\p
\v 26 . And over those that did the work of the field in the tillage of the ground, [Understand here those that did the kings husbandry, and tilled his ground] was Ezri the son of Chelub.
\p
\v 27 . And over the vineyards was Simei the Ramathite: [That is, over the vine-dressers, that were to look to, and dress the kings vineyards. And so was this mans office distinct from Zaddi’s] but over that which came of the vines, for the store-houses of wine, [that is, over the wine-cellars] wos Zadi the Siphmite.
\p
\v 28 . And over the olive-yards, and the Sycamore-trees that were in the low grounds was BaalHaman the Gederite; but Joas was over the treasures of the oil. [That is, over the oil that was stored up in cellars.]
\p
\v 29 . And over the oxen that fed in Saron, [See Cant.2.1.] was Sitrai the Saronite: But over the oxen in the low grounds, was Saphat the son of Adlai.
\p
\v 30 . And over the camels was Obil the Ismeelite: And over the she-asses was Jechdeja the Meronothite.
\p
\v 31 . And over the small cattle [As sheep ad goats] was Jaziz the Hagerite: All these were Rulers over the substance that king David had.
\p
\v 32 . And Jonathan Davids Uncle, [Some think that this Jonathan was Davids Nephew, the son of Samma, Davids brother, of whom we read, Sam.21.22. and so David should have been his Uncle] was counselor, an understanding man, he was also Scribe: [or Secretary] Now Jehiel the son of Hachmoni, was with the kings sons. [to wit, for to instruct and fashion them as their tutor in all good manners and learning.]
\p
\v 33 . And Achitophel was the kings Counsellor: And Husai the Archite was the kings friend.
\p
\v 34 . And after Achitophel was Jojada the son of Benaja, and Abjathar: But Joab was the General of the kings army.
\c 28
\s Davids last charge to the Princes, v.1.&c. and to Salomon, Concerning the keeping of all Gods commandments, and in particular the building of the Temple. 9. He giveth Salomon a pattern of the whole building, ad likewise of all the vessels thereunto appertaining, 14. A short repetition of Davids exhortation to Salomon, 20.
\p
\v 1 . Then David assembled at Jerusalem all the chief of Israel, the chief of the tribes, and the chief of the divisions ministering to the king, and the Commanders of thousands, and the Commanders of hundreds, and the Rulers of all the Kings substance and cattle, and of his sons, [Oth. And his sons] with the chamberlains, [see the annotate. On Gen.31.v.36.] and the champions , yea all (or every) valiant champion. [in this chapter the writer of this book returneth to the history, which he had begun above chap.22.]
\p
\v 2 . And King David stood upon his feet, [By his standing up he did signify the honor that he bare to the word of God, which he had received from God, ad intended to declared the same before the Congregation. Compare Judg.3.20.] and he said, hear me, my brethren and my people, I had in my heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, [to wit, the temple wherein the ark might safely rest, without being any more removed or carried from one place to another, as here to fore often happened. See 2 Sam.7.1.] and for the foot-stock of our God, [Thus is the Ark of the covenant called, for as much as the Lord did sit upon it between the Cherubims, 2 Sam.6.2. and gave answer] and I have made preparation for to build.
\p
\v 3 . But God said unto me, thou shalt not build an house unto my name: For thou art a man of war, and thou hast shed much blood. [Hebr. bloods.]
\p
\v 4 . Now the LORD the God of Israel chose me out of all my Fathers house, that I should be king over Israel for ever: [That is, my life-time, as long as I live: for that is the ever or eternity of men: But in respect of our LORD Jesus Christ the son of David, is it an everlasting kingdom, which shall never end, Luke 1.33. see 2 Sam.7.13.] for he hath chosen Juda [That is, the tribe of Juda] (to be) a leader, [see Gen.49.8. and 1 Chron.5.2.] and my Fathers house in the house of Juda: And among the sons of my Father he hath had pleasure in me, to make me King over Israel.
\p
\v 5 . And of all my sons (for the LORD hath given me many sons) he hath chosen Salomon my son, to sit upon the throne of the Kingdom of the LORD over Israel.
\p
\v 6 . And he said unto me, Salomon thy son, he shall build mine house, and my courts; For I have chosen him (to be) a son unto me, and I will be unto him a Fathers.
\p
\v 7 . And I will establish his Kingdom for ever: [See ver.4.] If he shall be strong to do my Commandments and my judgements, as at this day. [That is, as unto this day he hath been instructed, and hitherto, according to the good instruction, hath been carefully diligent in keeping my commandments.]
\p
\v 8 . Now then before the eyes of all Israel, the Congregation of the LORD, and before the ears of our God, keep and seek [For, seek and keep, that is, give diligence to seek and keep] all the commandments of the LORD your God, that ye may hereditarily possess that good land, and cause your children after you to inherited it for ever.
\p
\v 9 . And thou Salomon my son, know thou the God of thy Father, [that is, that God, that took in me pleasure (as v.4.) and whom I have faithfully served] and serve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing soul: For the LORD searcheth all hearts, and he understandeth all the imagination of the thoughts; [that is, all that men are able to think or imagine] if thou seek him, he will be found of thee: But if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.
\p
\v 10 . Take heed now, for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary: Be strong, and do it. [That is, perfect it, finish it.]
\p
\v 11 . And David gave unto Salomon his son a type of the porch, [See Exod.25.on vers.40.] with the housings thereof, and the treasures thereof, and the upper chambers thereof, and the inner chambers thereof, and the house of the expiatory-covering. [this was the covering that lay upon the ark of the covenant, upon which the Cherubims stood, and was as it were the throne or chair of God. But by the expiatory-coverled he understandeth the ark of the covenant it self, which was to be put into the most holy place of the Temple.]
\p
\v 12 . And a type of all that was with him [That is, in his mind] by the spirit, [To wit, by the holy Ghost, who revealed unto David, how all these things were to be made in the Temple, v.19. as God had formerly revealed unto Moses the pattern of the Tabernacle, and of all other things that he was to make besides, and shewed & declared unto him all things upon the mount. See Exod.31.3.] (namely) of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about; for the treasures of the house of God, and the treasures of the holy things. [to wit, to keep treasures in. Oth. Of the treasures, etc. meaning a type or pattern of the places, wherein the treasures were to be kept, or a pattern of the treasures themselves.]
\p
\v 13 . And of the divisions of the Priests and of the Levites, [See of these divisions above in chapters 24, 25,26.] ad of all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and of all the vessels of the service of the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 14 . (He gave) gold according to the weight of Gold for all the vessels of each service: [Hebr. of service, and of service; that is, as well of the service that was done in the sanctuary, as of that which was done in the court] (likewise silver) for all vessels of silver according to weight, for all the vessels of each service. [the vessels and instruments of gold were used in the temple, in the place which was called the holy: but the vessels or instruments of silver were used in the court of the Priests. Oth. Of gold according to the weight of gold etc. Meaning that here is prosecuted the type or pattern of all things.]
\p
\v 15 . And the weight for the golden candlesticks, and their golden Lamps, according to the weight of every Candlestick, [Heb. of the Candlestick, of the Candlestick. And so here below] and the Lamps thereof: Likewise for the silver Candlestick according to the weight of a Candlestick, and the Lamps thereof, according to the service of every Candlestick.
\p
\v 16 . Also (he gave) gold by weight for the Tables of ordering, [To wit, upon which the shew bread was set in order according to Gods command given by Moseh] for every table: and silver for the silver tables.
\p
\v 17 . And pure gold for the gold for the flesh-hooks, and the sprinkling-basins, [Wherein they received the blood of the sacrifice, and wherewith they sprinkled the altar in the sacrifices. See Exod.24.6.] and for the dishes: And for the golden cups, the weight for every cup: [Heb. for cup ad cup] likewise for silver cups, the weight for every cup.
\p
\v 18 . And for the altar of incense refined gold in weight: And gold for the type of the charet, [So he calleth the Cherubims, because the LORD by the special tokens of his presence is said to sit between the Cherubims. See 1 Sam.4.4. ad they are said to be his charet, Psa.18.11. Ezek.1.24,25,26. And chapter 10.13,16.] (to wit) of the Cherubims, that should spread out (their wings), and cover the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
\p
\v 19 . All this (said David) they [Or, be to wit, the LORD] gave me to understand in writing by the hand of the LORD, (to wit) all the works of this type. [Thus then David did not act here out of an absolute royal power, ordaining the service of God according to his own fancy and good liking, but he did this as a Prophet of God, 2 Chron.8.14. by the instinct and suggestion of the holy Ghost, as here v.12. appeareth, and also by the instigation and persuasion of Gad and Nathan, 2 Chap.29.25. Thus God also shewed a type or pattern unto Moses of all things that he should make, Exod.25.40. and 26.30. and Heb.8.5.]
\p
\v 20 . And David said unto Salomon his son, be strong, and of good courage, and do it, fear not, nor be dismayed: For the LORD God, my God, will be with thee, he will not leave thee, neither will he forsake thee, until thou shalt have finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 21 . And behold, there be all the divisions of the Priests and Levites for all the service of the house of God; and with thee (there) be for all (manner of) work, all manner of willing (men, endued) with wisdom for all kind of service, likewise the Princes, and all the people, (ready) for all thy commands. [or, words or, works.]
\c 29
\s David relateth before all the Congregation the great provision of all kind of materials that he had prepared and laid up for the building of the Temple, ver.1. &c. And he exhorteth them, both Princes, and people, to contribute willingly thereto. They contribute liberally, 6. For which David giveth God thanks, 10. And he prayeth unto the Lord for all the people, 18. And for the king, 19. The thanksgiving and offering of the people, 20. Salomon is anointed king, and Zadok high Priest, 22. The Lord maketh Salomon exceeding glorious and great, 25. How long David reigned, 26,27. He dieth, 28.
\p
\v 1 . More over king David said unto all the Congregation, [[See above chap.28.v.8.] God hath chosen Salomon my son alone [Heb. one; to wit, of all my sons. Therefore David caused him in his lifetime to be crowned King, and the other sons of David have pledged obedience to Salomon, vers.24.] a youth [Salomon had at that time marrieda wife, as may be gathered from his son Rehabeams age, 2 Chron.12.13. for he reigned fourty years, 2 Chron.9.30. and his son Rehabeam was 41. Years when he came to the Crown after the death of Salomon: whence it appeareth that Rehabeam was a year old when Salomon was crowned King. But David calleth him young and tender for just cause, because at that time (according to the opinion of some) he was but eighteen or nineteen years old, and had brethren that were elder then he] on the contrary this work [To wit, the building of the Temple, which Salomon was to perform] is great; For it is no palace for man, but for God the LORD.
\p
\v 2 . Now I have prepared with all my strength, for the house of my God, gold for gold, and silver for silver, and copper for copper, iron, and wood for wooden-(work:) Sardonix-stones, and filling (stones) ornament-stones, and embroidery, [oth. Stones of ornament and embroidery, or, for ornament and embroidery] and all manner of precious stones, and marble-stones in abundance.
\p
\v 3 . And moreover out of my delight toward the house of God, [That is, out of my affection to the house of my God] the special gold and silver that I have, [that is, of mine own jewels, and other costly things, which I have gathered and kept for this every end] I give over and above to the house of my God, besides all that I have prepared for the house of the Sanctuary.
\p
\v 4 . Three thousand talents of gold, [See Exod.chap.25.on v.39.] of the gold of Opphir; And seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses. [to wit, the gold to overlay the walls of the Temple, and the silver to overlay the walls of the other houses and chambers appertaining to the Temple.]
\p
\v 5 . Gold for the golden, and silver for the silver (vessels, and for every) work (to be made) by the hand of artificers: And who is there [To wit, among you] willing to fill his hand this day unto the LORD? [That is, to consecrate his service unto the LORD, and to offer a freewill-offering unto him. See Exod.32.29. Lev.8.33.]
\p
\v 6 . Then the chief of the Fathers, and the Princes of the tribes of Israel, and the Commanders of thousands, and of hundreds, and the Rulers of the kings works gave willingly.
\p
\v 7 . And they gave to the service of the house of God, [That is, to ward the building of the temple five thousand talents of gold, and ten thousand drams; [a dram weigheth as much as a French crown] and ten thousand talents of silver, and eighteen thousand talents of copper: [Heb. ten thousand, and eight thousand talents of copper] and an hundred thousand talents of iron.
\p
\v 8 . And they with whom stones [To wit, costly and precious stones] were found: gave them into the treasury of the house of the LORD, under the hand of Jehiel the Gersonite. [this man was the keeper General of all the treasures of the sanctuary, whom we might call the Receiver-General, but Selomith was placed over the treasures that were gathered for the building of the building of the Temple, 1 Chron.26.26.]
\p
\v 9 . And the people rejoiced at their giving willingly, for they gave with a perfect heart willingly unto the LORD: And King David also rejoiced with great joy.
\p
\v 10 . Therefore David praised the LORD before the eyes of all the Congregation; and David said; praised be thou LORD God of our Father Israel, from eternity to eternity.
\p
\v 11 . Thine, O LORD is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the Majesty, for all that is in the heaven, and on the Earth, (is thine:) thine O LORD, is the Kingdom, and thou hast exalted thy self (as) an head above all.
\p
\v 12 . And riches and honor are before thy face, and thou reignest over all (things), and in hand is power and might: it is also in thine hand to make all great, and to make all strong.
\p
\v 13 . Now then our God, we thank thee, and praise the name of thy glory. [Or, thy glorious name.]
\p
\v 14 . For who am I, and what is my people, that we should have obtained power to give willingly, as this is? [That is, all these things] for all is of thee, and we give it thee of thine (own) hand. [that is, as we first received this of thee, so we now give it to thee again.]
\p
\v 15 . For we are strangers and sojourners before thy face, as all our Fathers (were:) [This is Davids argument: Seeing men are but strangers and pilgrims here on Earth, who must assuredly depart from hence, Psa.39.13. and that we cannot keep our goods or estates after our death: therefore we cannot better bestow them then upon the service of God, who will graciously reward it unto all eternity] our days on earth are as a shadow, and there is no expectation. [intimating that there is nothing firm, sure, or stedfast in this life: It is all vanity and like a shadow, and no man can expect that he shall eschew death. Oth. Which (to wit, shadow) is not gathered.]
\p
\v 16 . LORD our God, all this abundance that we have prepared to build thee an house for name of thy holiness, that is of thine hand, and it is all thine.
\p
\v 17 . And know, my God, that thou triest the heart, and thou hast pleasure in uprightness. I have in the uprightness of mine heart given all these things willingly, and I have now with joy seen thy people that are found here, that they have carried themselves willing toward thee.
\p
\v 18 . O LORD, thou God of our Fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, keep this for ever, in the mind [Or, inclination, affection. Heb. frame] of the thoughts of the heart of thy people; and direct their heart unto thee.
\p
\v 19 . And gave unto Salomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all things, and to build this palace which I have prepared. [That is, for which I have gathered and made ready all this provision, yea for which I have bought the place it self, 1 Chron.21.25. and 2 Chron.3.1. and have made the model or draught of it.]
\p
\v 20 . After that David said unto all the Congregation, praise now the LORD your God: Then all the Congregation praised the LORD the God of their Fathers, and they bowed down the head, and bended themselves down before the LORD, and before the king. [To wit, before the Lord with religious worship, and before the King with civil reverence.]
\p
\v 21 . And they offered unto the LORD slay-offerings, they also offered unto the LORD burnt-offerings on the next morning of the day, a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with their drink-offerings: And slay-offering in abundance for all Israel.
\p
\v 22 . And they did eat and drink the same day before the face of the LORD with great joy: And they made Salomon the son of David king the second time, [This was another anointing then that whereof we read, 1 Kings 1.33. For that first anointing was done in hast, at which those of Jerusalem were only present, to hinder the seditious intent of Adonia: but this second anointing was performed even in Davids life-time, (as appeareth in the beginning of this verse) yea with greater solemnity, in the presence of the princes and Rulers of the people, yea also of the rest of Davids sons] unto the LORD [that is, to the service of the LORD, to the maintaining and defending the two tables of the law] (to be) Leader, and Zadok (to be) Priest. [to wit, to be high Priest; and Abjathar was put out, because he had also been in the sedition of Adonia, 1 Kings 1.7.]
\p
\v 23 . So Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD, [That is, the vicegerent, he kept the Lords place] as king in stead of David his Father, and he was prosperous: And all Israel hearkened to him.
\p
\v 24 . And all the Princes, and Champions, yea also all the sons of king David, gave the hand, that they would be under king Salomon. [That is, they acknowledged and accept of Salomon to be their king and Sovereign. Heb. gave the hand under king Salomon.]
\p
\v 25 . And the LORD magnified Salomon exceedingly before the eyes of all Israel? And he gave him a royal Majesty, [Heb. a Majesty of the kingdom, such as had not been on any king of Israel no Judge, nor Ruler among the Israelites] before him. [see 1 Kings 3.13. and 2 Chron.1.12.]
\p
\v 26 . Thus David the son of Isai reigned over all Israel.
\p
\v 27 . Now the days that he reigned over all Israel, are fourty years: [See 1 Kings 2.11.] he reigned seven years at Hebron, and be reigned three and thirty at Jerusalem. [see 2 Sam.5.5.]
\p
\v 28 . And he died in a good old age, [Heb. grayness. Or, hoariness, as Gen.25.8.] full of Days, riches and honor: and Salomon his son reigned in his stead.
\p
\v 29 . Now the acts of king David, first and last, behold, they are written in the history, [Heb. words, things] of Samuel the Seer, and in the histories [Heb.words, things] of Nathan the Prophet, and in the histories [Heb. word, things of Gad the Seer, [this may be understood of the two books of Samuel, the chief books whereof were written by the Prophets that are named here, to wit, by Samuel, Nathan, and Gad, who are called Seers here.]
\p
\v 30 . With all his kingdom, [That is with all the rule or government of his kingdom] and his might, and the times that passed over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the land. [that is, with that which in his time happened to him, to Israel, and to the kingdoms that lay round about.]
