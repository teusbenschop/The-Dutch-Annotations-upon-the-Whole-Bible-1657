\mt2 THE EPISTLE OF THE APOSTLE PAUL TO THE
\mt GALATIANS
\s THE ARGUMENT OF THIS EPISTLE
\p Seeing the Churches of Galatia, which were planted by the Apostle through the preaching of the Gospel, Acts 16.6. and chapter 18.23., &c. suffered themselves to be seduced from the purity of doctrine so some false Apostles, who taught that the Ceremonial Law and especially circumcision must still be observed; and moreover that a man is justified before God not only by faith, but also by the works of the Law: Therefore the Apostle with the brethren which were with him, thought it needful to reprove them for it by this Epistle, and to confirm them in the in the truth of the Gospel against such errors. To which end, after the superscription contained in the in the five first verses. chapter 1. He proves the divers reasons, that they ought not to suffer themselves to be led from the doctrine that he had received doctrine which he had preached unto them, forasmuch as there can no other Gospel be preached for salvation, and that he had received the same not from men, but from Christ himself out of heaven; which he proves by a relation of his first estate in Judaism, and of his wonderful conversion and calling: for which cause also he had spoken with none of the Apostles about it, but immediately departed to Arabia. Taestifieth that afterwards the chiefest Apostles, gave him the hand of fellowship, in token of unity in doctrine and ministry: that he himself also had reproved the Apostle Peter , when he durst not abide by the use of Christian liberty, because of certain Jews. chapter 1. And 2. Unto v. 15. Proves afterwards contrary to the doctrine of the false Apostles, by many powerful reasons and examples out of the Scripture, that a man is justified before God, not only by faith in Jesus Christ, and not by the works of the Law: neither of the Law of the Decalogue; nor of the ceremonial Law, which teacheth to be abolished in the new Testament: which a confutation of the principal objections of the false Apostles, from the 15. Verse of the 2. chapter To the end of the 4. chapter Yet that they must not abuse it unto carnal security. And further he exhorts them to laying aside of the works of the flesh, and bringing forth of the fruits of the Spirit. chapter 5. And chiefly of the works of love and liberality both to poor believers and to the ministers of the word. And afterwards he concludes with a serious warning of the false Apostles, whose covetousness and hypocrisies to this end he describes, and on the contrary he testifieth his uprightness chap.6.

\s 1 After the superscription of the Epistle, 3 the usual salutation, 4 and a thanksgiving to God, 6 the Apostle reproves the Churches of Galatia, that they were so soon turned away from the Apostolic doctrine, 7 whereas notwithstanding there can be no other doctrine for salvation, 8 although the Angel should preach the same, 10 and whereas he learned the doctrine which he preached unto them, not from men but from the Lord himself, 13 which he proves by his first state and zeal in Judaism, 15 and by his wonderful conversion and calling to the Apostles, 17 withal because he being called conferred not with other Apostles concerning the doctrine, but immediately journeyed towards Arabia, 18. And after three years of his ministry, first saw Peter and James only. 21. That afterwards he traveled again into Syria and Cilicia, and that he was not known but by reports unto the Churches in Judea.
\p
\v 1 . PAUL an Apostle [See of this word Luke 6.13.] (called) not of men [namely, who are mere men or nothing but men. This description the Apostle adds, to maintain his apostolic calling and authority against the slanders of the false Apostles, who said that he was not lawfully to the Apostleship. For there is a twofold lawful calling to the ministry of the word: one which is ordinary; which is indeed effected by God, but through men, therein following the order of God: And there is a calling which is effected without the ministry of men by God himself, or by the Lord Christ: such was the calling of the Prophets in the old Testament, and of the Apostles in the new Testament. This calling is extraordinary, and always accompanied with the gift of being infallible in teaching, John 16.13. 2 Pet. 1.21. That the Apostle Paul was called by such an extraordinary calling is clear described, Acts chapter 9. And 22.] Nor by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead,] [and thereby openly shewed, that he was the proper and true Son of God. See Acts 13.33. Rom. 1.4.]
\p
\v 2 . And all the brethren which are with me, [Namely, not only my fellow brethren in the ministry, but also all the rest of the faithful. This the Apostle adds, not so much to make his writing to be respected thereby, as by the agreement of the Church with him, the better to move the Churches of Galatia, to the laying aside of their errors] to the churches of Galatia: [Galatia was one of the greatest Provinces of Asia the less, bordering upon Phrygia, Pontus, Capadocia, and Pamphylia, was so called from a people, which being come out of Galatia, now called France, took in that Province and long inhabited the same. See Acts 16. 6. 1 Cor. 16.1. 2 Tim. 4.10. 1 Pet. 1.1.]
\p
\v 3 . Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ:
\p
\v 4 . Who gave [Namely, unto death. This the Apostle, adds, in the beginning, because this argument alone is sufficient to confute the doctrine of the false Apostles. For he should have done this in vain if a man could be justified by the works of the Law. See Gal. 2.21.] Himself [namely, willingly, Phil. 2.8.] for our sins, [namely, to expiate them by his death, 1 John1.7.] and chapter 2.2. So the expiation and remission of sins must be sought therein alone, and not in the works of the Law] that he might pluck us out of this present wicked world, [Gr. age, i.e. out of the sinful and miserable state wherein the whole world lyeth, 1 John 5.19.] according to the will of our God and Father. [that is, according to the eternal decree and pleasure, Acts 2 23. and chapter 4.28. Heb. 10.7,10. So then the Father is satisfied with this ransom of his Son.]
\p
\v 5 . To whom is glory unto eternity. [Gr. unto ages of ages, or unto eternities of eternities. Hebr.] Amen.
\p
\v 6 . I wonder [This wending was also accompanied with great displeasure and grief] that ye so soon [that is, in so short time, after that ye have received the Gospel from us: or since the seducers have taught you otherwise. Thereby he reproves their inconsistency] (turning) from him who called you in the grace of Christ, [namely, from God, who called you by our preaching, to save you by the grace of Christ, and not by the works of the Law. Or turning from Christ who called in grace] are brought over [namely, by those that seduce you: on whom he lays the greatest blame, because he had hope to them again into the right way, Gal. 5.ver.10.] unto another Gospel: [that is, unto another doctrine of salvation; which the seducers indeed call the Gospel, but is not the right Gospel, and differs far from that which we have preached unto you.]
\p
\v 7 . Whereas there is no other: [Gr. which is not another. Namely, then that or but that which we have preached unto you. See Acts 4.12.] but there are some [namely, whom from the sect of Pharisees having be taken themselves unto the Christian Religion, sought to mingle the Law with the Gospel, and the righteousness of works, with the righteousness of faith. See Acts 15.5.] Who trouble you, and would pervert the Gospel of Christ. [That is, falsified it, to make it vain or of none effect.]
\p
\v 8 . But although that even we, [That is, I, and the brethren that are with me. Or we Apostles] or an Angel out heaven [this is indeed impossible in its self, but the Apostle by putting this impossible condition, will more powerfully set forth the certainty of the curse, which shall come upon those who preach another Gospel. See the like, John 8.55. 1 Cor. 13.2.] should publish a Gospel unto you, besides that which we have published unto you, [that is, not only contrary to the same, but also that adds anything to it besides that which we have preached: which the false Apostles did, teaching that men are not justified by faith alone, but also by the works of the Law.] let him be accused. [Gr. Anathema, i.e. a cursing. See of this word, Rom. 9.3. 1 Cor. 16.22.]
\p
\v 9 . As we said before, [namely in the foregoing verse [so I say now also again [namely to show that this is not spoken by me out of hastiness] if anyone publish a gospel unto you besides that which ye have received [namely have heard and embraced through our preaching] let him be accused.
\p
\v 10 . For do I know preach men [Gr do I know advice men or God ? namely to hear or to believe for the Greek word which the apostle useth as also Acts 28.23 and 2 Corinthians 5.11signifies properly to move anyone with reason or to persuade him and here the sense is do I seek in my preaching to move ye that ye should adhere to me or any men ?he meaneth I do by no means do that]or God[ that is that ye should your trust in God in Christ which he would say I do in all my preaching or do I seek to please men ?by no means he would say and this it seems the false apostle sought to make the Galatians believe to render the apostleâ€™s doctrine suspected ]for if I yet [namely now being converted to Christ even as I did to Judaism when to please the high priest and the Jews I persecuted the church] pleased[that is sought only their favor in preaching ]men[namely who are strangers from Christ or who will have men preaching according to their minds 2 Timothy 4.3 otherwise the upright teachers may and must also so carry themselves in doctrine and life that they may please upright and Godly men in Christ 1 Corinthians 10.33]I were not a servant of Christ [that is a true upright and faithful servant for no man can serve two masters Matthew 6.24.]
\p
\v 11 . But I make known unto ye brethren that gospel which was published by me is not according to men [that is was not given and taught me by men or feigned by myself and depending upon the authority of any men as is declared in the following verse.]
\p
\v 12 . For neither received I nor learned the same from a man [the apostle will not hereby reject the instruction in the doctrine of the gospel which is ordinarily performed by men 2 Timothy 3.15 but meaneth that he has an apostle received not this doctrine in such an ordinary manner but through an extraordinary revelation and instruction of Christ himself see Acts 9.3, 1 Corinthians 15.8 and 2 Corinthians 12] but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 13 . For ye have heard my conversation which was formerly [namely before I was converted to the Christian Religion] in Judaism that I very exceedingly persecuted that church of God [this persecution of Paul is described Acts 7.58 and chapter 9.1 &c and 22.4.5] and wasted the same [that is as much as in me lay sought wholly to root out and destroy the same.]
\p
\v 14 . And that I increased in Judaism above many of my age [that is young men see Acts 7.58 that he expresseth that he might hot see out of self-conceitedness to set himself above the ancient teachers of the Jews ] in my generation [that is among the Jews]being abundantly zealous [Gr more abundantly a zealot namely with a zeal which is not accompanied with knowledge Romans 10.2, Philippians 3.5,6, 1 Timothy 1.13 hereby he also reproves the perverse zeal of the Jews in his own person ]for the institutions [Gr tradition namely not which are commanded and set down in the scriptures but those also which were instituted by men and delivered over by the parents to the children as from hand to Hand ]of my fathers [namely of which I made more account then of the doctrine of the prophets what institutions these were may be seen Matthew 5.21 c. chapter 15.2,3and chapter 23.3 &c Mark 7.5 &c1 Peter 1.18.]
\p
\v 15 . But when it pleased God who separated me [that is purposed and decreed to separate me from common heap of other men to call me in due time to be an apostle ]even from my mothers womb [Gr out of that is before I was born of my mother see the like Jeremiah 1.5]and called me by his grace [namely as the only cause why he did that and therefore without any worthiness and merits of mine foreseen in me as before also Gods good pleasure is made the cause thereof see Ephesians 1.5,6,9,11.]
\p
\v 16 . To reveal his son [namely Jesus Christ the true Messiah] in me [that is to me in my soul or by me to reveal that is to make known that I have acknowledged him for the son of God and the true Messiah and believed in him Matthew 16.17] that I should publish him by the gospel among the gentiles immediately [namely as soon as I was converted unto Christ ] I went not to consult [that is spake not nor treated with any man concerning the doctrine of the gospel to be better or largely instructed in the same ]with flesh and blood [that is with any men which consists of flesh and blood nor not with mine own natural reasons see the like phrase Matthew 16.17 Ephesians 6.12]
\p
\v 17 . And went not again [or went not up as also verse 18this seems to contradict that which Luke saith Acts 9.26But that which Luke saith there must be understood to have come pass after that Paul having been three years in Arabia was again come from thence unto Damascus. For Luke makes no mention there of Paulâ€™s journey into Arabia as he also omit divers other actions and journeys of Paul which Paul himself relates 2 Corinthians chapter 11 and 12]to Jerusalem unto them which Apostles before me [namely any one of the twelve who were called to the apostleship long before me ]but I went my way into Arabia a country lying to the south of the land of the Jews wherein mount Sinai was Galatians betwixt the red sea and the gulf of Persia ] and returned unto Damascus of this city see the annotations on Acts9.2.]
\p
\v 18 . Afterward I came after three years [namely during which I had been as well in Arabia as at Damascus] again to Jerusalem to visit Peter [the Greek word signifies to go see or to visit any man to her him and to speak and treat with him] and I abhorred with him fifteen days.
\p
\v 19 . And saw no other of the apostles save James [there were two among the apostles of this name see of both Matthew 10 verse 2,3 Acts 12.2,17and of this Acts 12.17 and 15.13] the Lords brother [that is cousin An Hebrew phrase see Genesis 14.14 Matthew 12.46,47 1 Corinthians 9.5 of him see Matthew 10.3 Mark 15.40]
\p
\v 20 . Now that which I write to you [namely concerning my receiving of the gospel from Christ himself without my calling or instruction of men ]behold I testify before God [a form of taking an oath with which the apostle thought it needful to confirm this because of the weightiness of the matter see Romans 9.1] that I lye not.
\p
\v 21 . Afterwards I came into the quarters of Syria and Cilicia [these are countries lying in Asia see of the same Matthew 4.24 Acts 15.23,41 and 18.18 and 27.5.]
\p
\v 22 . And I was unknown by face to the church of Judea [namely seeing I according to my calling preached the gospel not among the Jews there but amongst the Gentiles see verse 16 ]which are in Christ [that is who have received and profess the Christian doctrine.]
\p
\v 23 . But they had only heard man say he that [namely Paul these are the words of the foresaid churches which Paul relates] persecuted us [namely Christians] in former times now publisheth the faith [that is the doctrine of the gospel which men must believe to salvation see the like phrase 1 Timothy 1.19 compare with 2 Timothy 2. 18] which he formerly wasted [see verse 13.]
\p
\v 24 . And they glorified God in me [Gr for my sake that is for the grace which God had bestowed in me.]
\c 2
\s The apostle relate that he had treated with the chiefest of the apostles James ,Peter and John at Jerusalem concerning his doctrine and that they in all parts approved the same without taking away or adding anything thereunto 3. that he had defended Titus against the false brethren that he should not be circumcised 7 thus the apostles of a token of unity in the doctrine gave him and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship 9 with agreement that they should preach among the Gentiles 11 Testifies also that afterwards at Antioch he reproves the apostle Peter because he having formerly used the Christian liberty among the Gentiles omitted the same because of certain Jews and so by his example brought the Gentiles unto Judaism 15 afterwards he proveth that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of Christ 17. And that Christ is not thereby made a minister of sin 19 for as much as faith in Christ also reacheth and requireth the mortification of a sin and a new life and shews further that if righteousness were by the law Christ should have died in vain.
\p
\v 1 Afterwards fourteen years after [namely besides the three which he was in Arabia Galatians 1.18 being seventeen years after his conversion and 51 years after the birth of Christ ] I went up [so the scripture speaks when man travels towards Jerusalem because it lay on high upon hills as soon on the contrary they that came from Jerusalem are said to come or go down see Mark 3.22 Acts 18.22 ]again to Jerusalem [ the apostle after his conversion went divers time to Jerusalem first when he was come again out of Arabia after 3 years Acts 9.26 Galatians 1.18 afterwards with Barnabas bringing the collection to Jerusalem Acts 11.30 and 12.25and when he was sent by the church of Antioch with Barnabas to the Synod of Jerusalem Acts 15.2 again Acts 18.18 and finally because of his vow and to bring the collection thither when he was apprehended there Acts 21.15it seems that the apostle here speaketh of the journey when he was sent to the Synod which was held in the seventeenth year after his conversion] with Barnabas having also taken Titus with me [see of him Titus 1.3 him he seemeth to have taken with him being yet uncircumcised so to show in him before the false brethren the freedom from ceremonial law.]
\p
\v 2 . And I went up by a revelation [namely of God who by his spirit and in visions always revealed to Paul where he would make use of his service see Acts 13.2 and 16.7,10 and 18.9and 19.21 and 22.17 and 23.11] and propounded [ the Greek word signifies to relate any matter to one with mutual communication ]to them namely to the apostle and teachers which were at Jerusalem this was publicly before all [the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles and in particular to them [namely so to have the better opportunity to understand my doctrine from me and to testify their agreements with me ]who were in esteem [namely by reason of their gifts and repute in the church age or otherwise and consequently were in the fittest to judge thereof these are named verse 9] that I might not in anywise run that is fulfill the ministry of the gospel a similitude from those who contend running a race to winning the prize 2Timothy 4.7 ]or have run in vain [that is without producing any fruit among the Gentiles which should have so been if he had not hereby confuted and brought to naught the slanders of the false brethren.]
\p
\v 3 . But neither Titus who was with me being a Greek [that is born of Gentile parents and for this cause uncircumcised ]was necessitated [namely by the apostles which were at Jerusalem seeing they also understood that circumcision was abolished yet why nevertheless Paul caused Timothy to be circumcised see Acts 16.3]to be circumcised.
\p
\v 4 . And that [the apostle gives a reason why who would not let Titus be circumcised that the false brethren which held circumcision still necessary to salvation Acts 15.1 might be hardened in their error but Christian liberty be better known ]because of the crept in [ that is who had deceit and dissimulation on betaken them to the church of the faithful ]false brethren ]that is bearing indeed the name of the brethren and believers but really being enemies of the saving doctrine ]who were come in sideways [that is with feigned humility and profession privily slept into the church ] to espy[namely for evil privilege to observe if they could find any occasion to reproach us ]our liberty[namely from the ceremonial among which also was circumcision to take occasion from thence of reproaching us ]which we have in Jesus [that is obtained for us by Christ as that which was presented by the ceremonies is fulfilled in him and by him Colossians 2.17] that they might bring us unto bondage [that is that we forsaking the Christian liberty should subject ourselves to the yoke of ceremonies as necessary to salvation.]
\p
\v 5 . To whom we gave not place [a similitude taken from combatants or wrestlers who strongly resist their adversary and give not place see the truth of this saying Acts 15.1,2 &c]with subjection [that is that we should be subject to them or subject to ourselves to them I observing of the ceremonies ] no not for an hour [the apostle yielded to the weak Jews for a time in observing of the ceremonies to gain them 1 Corinthians 9.20,22 and by degrees to bring them to the knowledge of Christian liberty but they would not give place or yield to these false brethren for the least time that they might not harden them in their own errors stiffneckedness]that the truth of the gospel might continue with you [that is this we did not out of the stiffneckedness or desire of contention but to defend the purity of doctrine of the gospel against them and maintain them in the church especially of Galatia.]
\p
\v 6 . And of them who were esteemed to be some what [that is the other apostle who are justly in great esteem with the churches ]of what condition they were formerly[that is because what they were before they were called to be apostle or what advantage they had before I was called to be an apostle ]indifferent to me [that is it matters not much or I regard not that or that doffers from any doing or teaching ] God accepteth not the person of man [of this expression see Matthew 22.16 Acts 10.34 that is in matters of truth God respecteth not any outward advantage or esteem of those that teach the truth but only the matter itself ]for they that were esteemed conferred nothing upon me [namely as concerning the doctrine of the gospel that should have learned ought for them which the Lord Christ himself revealed not unto me .]
\p
\v 7 . But on the contrary [that is they did not reprehend nothing in my doctrine but also on the contrary acknowledge the same to be good and upright ]when they saw [that is knew understood as verse 9] that the gospel of the foreskin [that is of the Gentiles who are uncircumcised verse 8 see Romans 2.26 and 3.30 and 4.12namely to preach the same chiefly amongst them ]was committed unto me [namely by Christ himself and God the father as chapter 1 verse 1 ]even as to Peter of the circumcision [that is of the circumcised Jews to preach the same amongst them see Romans 3.30 and 15.8.]
\p
\v 8 . For [the apostle here sheweth whereby the apostle saw and knew that the gospel was committed unto him namely by the powerful working of God through his preaching for the conversion of the Gentiles] he that wrought powerfully in Peter [namely the Lord Christ who accompanied the ministry of Peter with the powerful operation of his spirit] unto the apostleship of the circumcision he wrought also powerfully in me [or by me that is by ministry] among the Gentiles [namely to their conversion.]
\p
\v 9 . And when James [see of him Galatians 1.19] and Cephas[that is Peter see of this name Matthew 16 verse 18 and John 1.43]and John [namely the son of Zebedee and brother of James the great who was beheaded by Herod Acts 12 see of him Matthew 4.21and 10.2 and 17.1] who were esteemed to pillars [namely as well of the society of the apostles as of the church because they by their ministry steadfastly defended and maintained the truth of the gospel and in especially were in great esteem in the church as an ornament of the same see 1.18 Revelation 3.12] knew the grace [namely of the apostleship Romans 1.5 or the operations and the fruits of grace or the gifts such as were speaking with strange tongue prophecy miracle and the like ]which was given unto me they gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of communion [namely for a sign and assurance that they acknowledged that they acknowledge that we had communion with them as well in the ministry of the apostleship as in the purity of the doctrine of the gospel ]that we [namely I and Barnabas ] should go to the Gentiles and they [namely Peter and the other two apostles ] unto the circumcision [that is to the circumcised Jews see verse 7 .]
\p
\v 10 . Only that we should remember the poor [namely to take care of the collection for them among the churches of the Gentiles] which I myself also diligent to do [this appears everywhere also in the epistle and especially Romans 15.27 1Corinthians 16.1 2 Corinthians 9.1.]
\p
\v 11 . And when Peter came to Antioch [see of this city Acts 11.19]I withstood him to he face [that is in the presence of him and of all his declared verse 14 see also 2 Corinthians 10.1]because he was to be reproved[ that is deserved to be reproved]
\p
\v 12 . For before some came from James [why James had sent these to Antioch is uncertain some think to cause the state of the church there to be taken notice of or to give notice of something to the apostle being there ]he did eat together [namely all kind of meat even that which was forbidden in the old testament following Christian liberty were he was assured by an heavenly vision Acts 10 so that he did well therein ]with the Gentiles [namely who wee converted to Christ and had never been subject to the yoke of the ceremonial law but when they wee come he withdrew him and separated himself[that is he would no more eat with the believing Gentiles thereby feigning as if he understood that eating of all kinds of meat was unlawful for Christians wherein he did very ill as appears in that which follows ]fearing them that is fearing that he should thereby give those Jews occasion to speak evil of him see the like Acts 11.2] that were of the circumcision [that is the Jews which were converted to the Christian religion and yet observed the difference of the meats according to the ceremonial law not yet being fully informed of abrogation thereof. ]
\p
\v 13 . And also the other Jews [namely who were become Christians and who had in some sort used Christian liberty] dissembled with him [the apostle calls this fact of Peter twice in this verse a dissembling which is when anyone doth or speaketh otherwise then he thinketh in his heart or mind which is lawful to do this these Jews did likewise being seduced by the example of Peter so that Barnabas [of him see Acts 11.22,30 and 13.1,2 and 15 .2] also was withal drawn away by their dissimulation.
\p
\v 14 . But when I saw that walked not aright [Gr set not their feet that is as it were halted went not directly on to come to the scope and main end of Christian doctrine 1 Kings 18.21 Hebrews 12.13] according to the truth of the gospel [that is according to the purity according to the true doctrine of the gospel concerning Christian liberty ] I said unto Peter in the presence of all [namely for as much as he sinned and gave offence openly and before all 1 Timothy 5.20]if thou who art a Jew livest after the manner of the Gentiles [namely hast eaten all kind of meat heretofore as the Christian converted among the Gentiles do also following Christian liberty verse 12] and not after the manner of the Jews why constraineth thou the Gentiles [namely by thy evil example which must necessarily move them to imitate it or because thou seemest to acknowledge them for no true Christian if they even as thou do not subject themselves to the ceremonial law ] to live after the Jewish manner ? [namely to observe the ceremonial law which the Jews did in the old testament and was still committed to the converted Jews who did not yet understand Christian liberty for a time as an indifferent thing for edification sake but as concerning those that were converted from among the Gentiles it was decreed in the Synod of Jerusalem that they should not be burdened with it see Acts 15.10,28.]
\p
\v 15 . We are[ or we Jews by nature and not sinners of the Gentiles knowing c we namely I and thou Peter also for the apostle relate here yet how he spake to Peter ]Jews by nature [that is by descent and birth Romans 2.17,28 and for this cause born under the ceremonial law ]and not sinners of the Gentiles [that is not of Gentiles offspring who wee idolaters and great sinners strangers from the covenant of God see Ephesians 2.11 the apostle who say forasmuch as we apostles who are Jews seek not our justification in the works of the law but in the faith of Christ much less must men teach or constrain the Gentiles to seek their righteousness in the observation of the law Romans 3.9.]
\p
\v 16 . Yet knowing [that is because we certainly know it ]that a man [who or how so holy he might be ]is not justified [ what it is to be justified see in the annotation on Romans 3.20] by the works of the law [namely of Moses as well moral as ceremonial but [or except as Matthew 12.4 1 Corinthians 7.17 Galatians 1.7 Revelations 21.27 that is only by faith as the following words clearly import that ] by the faith of Jesus Christ [that is when by a true and lively saith we receive the righteousness of Christ [that is when by a true and lively saith we receive the righteousness of Christ Romans 3.24,28 ]we have also believed in Jesus Christ [this is the cause why we apostles have received Christ by a true faith for had we been able to be justified by the law we should not have needed going to Christ ]that we might be justified by the faith of Christ and not by the works of the law that by the works of the law [this proof is taken out of the scripture of the old testament Psalms 143.2] no[ Gr shall not be justified all flesh that is no flesh an Hebrew phrase as Psalms 143.2 Romans 3.20 ]flesh [that is man see Genesis 6.12 Isaiah 40.6] shall be justified.
\p
\v 17 . But if we that seek to be justified in Christ [here now the apostle speaks further to the Galatians and answers an objection which they might cast forth against the former doctrine namely that the same makes man careless leads them to sin and that so Christ should harden a man in sin of this objection see also Romans 3.31 and chapter 6.1 ,2,3 ]are also found sinners ourselves [that is sin yet daily] in Christ then [that is will it not then follow from thence that Christ and c]a minister of sin?[that is this doctrine of a mans justification without the works of the law only by faith in Christ shall serve and give a man occasion to sin the more freely ] far be it [see the annotations on Roman 6.2]
\p
\v 18 . For if what I have broken down [namely by my earnest and continual admonition to flee from sin] I build the same up again [namely by a doctrine which should make such admonition of none effect and stir up man to sin] I make myself a transgressor [namely of Gods command and the laws of uprightness which ought to be in the faithful teacher.]
\p
\v 19 . For I [that is doctrine of the apostle doth not of itself stir men up to sin he proveth by his own example passing by the example of the others because it may happen that this doctrine indeed by some be abused thereunto yet that which he saith to himself is true also in true believers ] by the law [that is I have learned by the law that I am a great sinner according to the law subject to the curse and death and that the righteousness which the law requires is not in me and consequently that the law leaveth me in death] that I might live unto God. [That is, might lead a new and holy life, that is pleasing to God, according to his commandment: and for this cause not unto sin. See Rom. 6.11.]
\p
\v 20 . I am crucified with Christ: [How this is to be understood, See Rom. 6.6. where the same is said, and further expounded] And I live , [namely, now truly , a spiritual life] (yet) no more I, [namely, such as I was before my conversion and regeneration] but Christ liveth in me. [namely, by his holy spirit, by which he leads me in the ways of God, and makes me fruitful unto good works] and that which I now live in the flesh, [that is, in this my natural life which he distinguisheth from the spiritual the same I live by the faith of the Son of God, [that is, although I have mine infirmities in that same flesh, yet I believe and trust that the Son of God hath satisfied for the same by his death: who also quickens me by his Sprit] who loved me, and gave up himself for me. [Namely, unto death, Rom. 4.25.]
\p
\v 21 . I abolish not [Which is done, when men believe not that Christ is perfectly our righteousness] the grace of God. [namely, which is given me through Christ, wherefore he spake in the former verse] For if righteousness be by the Law, the Christ is dead in vain; [or for naught, i.e. without cause, reason, need, or fruit, John 15.25.]
\c 3
\s I The Apostle after a sharp reprehension of the Galatians, proves further, that a man is not justified by the works of the Law, but by faith in Christ, 2 forasmuch as they themselves had found that they had received the gifts of the Spirit, not by the Law, but by faith. 6 Proveth it also by the example of Abraham who is the Father of all believers, 10 and by certain clear testimonies of the Holy Scripture. 13 Testifieth that Christ hath delivered us from the curse of the Law, and procured us the blessing. 15. That by his doctrine the law is not made void, nor of none effect, neither is sheweth in us sin; 24 and as a School- master leads us to Christ. 25 Afterwards he teacheth how the Law of Moses is abrogated by Christ unto all believers, 28 without differences of Nations or qualities, and 29 seeing that they are all Abrahamâ€™s seed.
\p
\v 1 O Ye senseless Galatians [Or, ignorant, unwise. So he calls them, to shew that he holdeth that they did this, rather out of in-considerateness or imprudence, then out of wickedness. See the like, Luke 24.25. Whereby he therefore doth not contrary to the doctrine of Christ, Mat. 5.22. See also 1 Cor. 15.36.] Who hath bewitched you, [that is, so blinded the eyes of your understanding, that ye cannot see the right truth, as the Jugglers bewitch the outward eyes, that they think they see that which they see not. Therefore he compares these false teachers to Jugglers, and lays upon them the greatest blame of this seduction, who as deceivers by faith speeches and subtitles seduce the simply] that ye should not be obedient [that is, embrace and believe] to the truth: [namely, of the Gospel, that a man is justified before God by faith, whereof is spoken, chapter 2.v.5.14.] before whose eyes Jesus Christ was before portrayed [or, delineated, i.e. so clear held forth unto you by my preaching as if it were drawn or set out to life in a Table before you] being crucified among you? [That is, of whoâ€™s crucifying, together with the causes and fruits of the same, namely, that thereby we are delivered from the curse of the law and bondage of the ceremonies, I have so abundantly and clearly informed you, as if he himself had been crucified before your eyes.]
\p
\v 2 . This only [Namely, of many other things which might convince of error] would I learn of you, [that is, answer me to this matter only. Not that he did not know the same, but this he saith to shew that he will herein be content with their own saying] received ye the spirit [that is, the gifts of the Holy Ghost, as are the spirit of regeneration, of sanctification, an of adoption] by the works of the Law: by the preaching of Faith? [Gr. By the hearing, i.e. by the preaching of the doctrine of the Gospel. See Isa. 53.1. John 12.38. Rom. 10.16.]
\p
\v 3 . Are ye so senseless [Or without understanding, foolish] whereas ye have begun [that is, when ye were first converted unto Christ, to seek salvation by him] with the spirit, that is, with the grace and doctrine of faith, which the Holy Ghost worketh] do ye now finish with the flesh? [That is, with the works of the Law and with the ceremonies, which are outwardly done and seen, which the false Teachers taught the Galatians.]
\p
\v 4 . Have ye suffered so much [Namely, persecutions, reproaches and injuries, for the cause and doctrine of Christ] in vain? [That is, without fruit and recompense; which should come to pass if ye should again turn away from that doctrine] if but also in vain. [That is, fare is it that this should come to pass, hoping that this would not befall them. Or if did but stay only there, and that ye were not to expect other troubles yet for your back-sliding.]
\p
\v 5 Now he therefore that affordeth the Spirit [That is, those spiritual gifts. See v.2.] And worketh powers [that is, miracles. See 1 Cor. 12.10, 28.] Among you, (doth he that) by the works of the Law, or by the preaching of Faith? [See v.2.]
\p
\v 6 . Even as Abraham believed God, [See of this example, Gen. 15.6. Rom. 4.3 &c.] And this was accounted to him for righteousness.
\p
\v 7 . Ye understand then [Or understand ye then] that they are of Faith [that is, who seek their righteousness in Christ by faith] are Abrahams children, not according to flesh, but according to the promise. See John 8.39. Rom. 4.11. And chapter 9.v.6, 7, 8.] Gal. 3.29. As therefore the Father was justified, so also are the children justified, seeing there is but one way to be justified, namely, by faith in Christ. See Rom. 3.30.]
\p
\v 8 . And the Scripture [That is, the Holy Ghost speaking in the Holy Scripture] foreseeing [namely, Gen. 12.3.] that God would justify the Gentiles by Faith, before [namely, even in the old Testament also] published the Gospel [Gr. Fore evangelized] to Abraham (saying) in thee [that is, in the seed which is promised thee, and shall proceed from thee, which is Christ as is declared, v.16. see also Gen. 22.18.] shall all the Nations [that is, as well Gentiles as Jews] be blessed. [That is, be justified and saved.]
\p
\v 9 . So then they that are of Faith, are blessed with faithful Abraham. [That is, in such a manner as faithful Abraham was blessed or justified. See v.6, 7.]
\p
\v 10 . for as many as are of the works of the law, [That is, who seek their righteousness and salvation by the observation of the Law of Moses] they are under the curse? [Namely, because they do not perfectly keep the law, and therefore cannot obtain the blessing or justification by the law. For blessing and the curse are contrary one to another] for it is written, [namely, Deu. 27.26.] cursed is every one [the Apostle here followeth the Greek translation, seeing it very well expresseth the meaning of the original Greek text, although the words every one and all are not there expressed] that continueth not in all that which is written in the book of the Law, to do it. [Namely, perfectly in all parts, and in such wife as Gods commands. And from thence it appears, that by the works of the Law, here are understood, not only the works of the ceremonial Law, but also of the moral or ten commandments.]
\p
\v 11 . And that no man by the Law [Gr. In the Law. The Apostle useth this phrases, through the Law, by the Law, by the works of the Law, in the Law, in the same sense] is justified before God, is manifest: for the just shall live by Faith. [Or the just by Faith shall live. See Rom. 1.17.]
\p
\v 12 . But the Law is not of Faith: [For the Law promiseth life, not to them who will be justified by Faith, but who perfectly keep the Law: which he proveth by the promise which is made by the Law, Lev. 18.5. Ezek. 20.11.] but the man that doth these things [ or shall have done, namely perfectly, as v.10.] shall live [namely, eternally, and consequently be justified thereby, if he should perfectly in all things keep the Law; which nevertheless no man doth, nor can do, Rom. 3.9. etc.] by the same. [That is, by such perfect keeping of the Law.]
\p
\v 13 . Christ hath delivered us [Gr. redeemed us out of the curse: for this deliverance was affected by paying of a ransom for us, Mat. 20.28. 1 Tim. 2.6.] for the curse of the Law, [that is, from the punishment, temporal and eternal which the Law threatens to the transgressors, and which we have deserved by our transgressions] being become a curse [that is, took the wrath of God and the punishment of our sins upon him to bear the same; and thereby to satisfy Gods vindictive justice] for us. [That is, in our steed, our surety, Heb. 7.22.] For it is written [namely, Deu. 21.23.] cursed is every one that hangeth on the wood. [That is, hanged upon the cross. See Acts 5.30. 1 Pet. 2.24. Which is to be understood, not that they should all be damned all who were crucified (for the contrary appears by the example of the converted murderer, Luke 23.43.) but because God had appointed this kind of punishment as being the most cruel & reproachful, for a type of punishment which his Son must suffer to deliver us from the curse.]
\p
\v 14 . That the blessing of Abraham [That is, the grace of reconciliation and justification, as also the inheritance of eternal life, which was promised to Abraham and his seed, Gen. 12.3. and 22.18.] might come [that is, might flow down as out of fountain] unto the Gentiles, [or unto the Nations, as was promised to him, that in him all Nations should be blessed, Gen. 12.3.] in Christ Jesus, [that is, by Christ, as being blessed seed which was promised to Abraham, v.16.] (And) that we [as well Jews and Gentiles] might obtain the promise, not of the temporal but of eternal good things] by faith. [That is, by Christ received by a true faith.]
\p
\v 15 . Brethren, I speak according to man, [That is I will use an example taken from humane affairs. See Rom. 3.5. 1 Cor.9.8.] even a mans covenant [the Greek word Daitheke is sometimes particularly taken for a Testament, Heb. 9.17.] sometimes generally for any kind of covenant or contrary betwixt two parties. It may here be taken in both significations] that is confirmed, [namely, with mutual promises, oaths, subscriptions, seals, or the like ways usual amongst men] no man dissannnulleth, [that is, ought not, neither can disannul] nor doth (any man) added thereto [Gr. Ordaineth ought besides; namely, by taking away, adding, or alternating.]
\p
\v 16 . Now so are the promises [That is, so neither can any men disannul or alter the covenant that God hath made with Abraham and all believers. IN the which seeing the promises which God hath made therein on his side or not grounded on the keeping of the Law, but on Christ the promised seed of Abraham; therefore that must also always remain firm and unchanged, as is more at large declared in the following verse] spoken to Abraham and his seed. [See Gen. 22.18.] The word seed is sometimes taken for all the posterity, as Gen. 15.18. And 22.17. Sometimes for some one in special of the same, as Gen. 4.25. And 21.13. That it must here be taken in his second signification, the Apostle here proves, and teacheth also that this seed is Christ. See also Gen. 13.15. And 17.10.] He saith not, and to seeds, as of many, but as of one, and to thy seed: which is Christ. [See the proof hereof in the genealogy of Christ, Mat. 1.12, 16. and Luke 3.v.23,24. As Isaac also was a type Gen. 21.12. Rom.9.7. Heb.11.18.]
\p
\v 17 . And this I say [That is, I mean by the foregoing examples of humane covenants or testaments] the covenant [that is, that then much more the two covenant of God remains firm without alteration] that was before now confirmed by God [namely, with an oath, Gen. 12.2. and 15.18. and 17.4. and 22.17. Heb. 6.v.14, 15. etc. and with other outward signs and seals] on Christ, [namely, forasmuch as it was to be confirmed by the death of Christ as the Translator, Heb. 9.15. that Christ also must merit these spiritual blessings for us, by a perfect satisfaction for our sins, whereof the legal ceremonies were types: and that we cannot be partakers of the same but by faith in Christ] by the Law [seeing one might have objected against this, that therefore the Law was given it might have stood thus with the business of Gods covenant, but when the Law was given, that then the covenant of God was altered: therefore the Apostle here proves that this was also untrue] which came four hundred thirty years after, [that is, seeing the Law was given on mount Sinai so many years after. The beginning of these four hundred and thirty years must be reckoned from that time forward, when God commanded Abraham to depart out of his own country, Gen. 12.1. See hereof more at large, Exod. 12.v.40. Acts 7.6.] Made of no force [or in firm. Gr. The Law, &c. maketh the covenant, &c. of no force] that it should bring the promise to naught. [See ver.16.]
\p
\v 18 . For if the inheritance [Namely, of eternal life, wherefore the inheritance of the land of Canaan was a type] be of the Law [that is, be to be obtained by the perfect observation of the Law] it is no more of promises; [that is, by faith whereby the grace and blessing promised in Christ is received. For these two is repugnant one to another, and cannot stand together. See Rom. 11.6.] But God gave it graciously [that is, without any merit of his, Rom. 4.13, 16.] to Abraham [this is proved before, ver.6. etc. and so them also that all the children of Abraham receive the inheritance: seeing there is but one way to salvation] by promise. [Namely, received by a true faith.]
\p
\v 19 Whereunto then is the Law? [This was an objection of the false Teachers, that if the Law doth not justify a man, then it hath no use, and is given in vain.] It was put [or, ordained] thereunto, because of transgressions, [namely, to make then known, Rom. 3.20. and chapter 5.ver.20. and 7.7. and to convince thereof] until the seed [namely, the promised seed of Abraham which is Christ. See ver. 16.who is the end of the Law, Rom. 10.4.] should be come, to whom it was promised: [namely, the inheritance, as being the head of all those who shall be heirs; for from him, in him, and by him it is, that we all obtain the inheritance, and are coheirs with him, Rom. 8.ver.17.] and it [namely, the Law] was appointed [or, ordained] by Angels, [that is, by the ministry of Angels: which although it be not mentioned in the history of the giving of the Law, yet notwithstanding so it is, that this may be collected from other places, and was believed in the Church. See Acts 38.53. Heb.2.2.] in the hand (or, by the hand) by the ministry] of the mediator. [Whereby some understand Moses, whom God used as a messenger or interpreter of the book-man betwixt him and the people in the giving of the Law, Exod. 19.ver.21. Others understand Christ, by whom God brought the people of Israel out of Egypt through the wilderness, and spake unto Moses on Mount Sinai, Acts 7.38. 1 Tim. 2.5.]
\p
\v 20 . And a Mediator is not (a mediator) of one: [That is, of one party, but is always of two differing parties to unite them] but God is one. [That is, abides always the same, without being changed, not only in his essence, but also in his will, purpose and decree. Or is one party of two.]
\p
\v 21 . Is the Law against the promise of God? [This is a second objection, which the false Apostles might bring forth against that which the Apostle said even now. Namely, if the Law discovers and condemn transgressions, and the promise cover and forgive the same, that these seem to contradict one another] far be it; [That is, that doth by no means follow] for if there had been a Law given [namely, for such an end, that a man might be justified thereby . Or which were such that a man were able perfectly to keep it] which was able to make alive [that is, justify a man, and bring him to salvation] then verily righteousness should be by the Law. [That is, if that were so, then the Law should be contrary to the promise. But that is not so: and therefore here is no contrariety. See Rom. 8.3.]
\p
\v 22 . But [This is a proof that the law cannot alive or justify, because no man perfectly keeps the Law, but all men are thereby convinced of sin] the Scripture [that is, the Law written, and the Prophets as interpreted of the same] hath shut up all under sin, [a similitude taken from malefactors who are shut up in prison to be kept unto punishment. See the like, Rom, 11.32.] That the promise [that is, the promised blessing and inheritance] by the faith of Jesus Christ [that is, by faith in Christ, as by an instrument whereby the promised blessing is received] might be given [Namely, by God, of grace, for nothing] to believers. [Gr. To the believing, namely, in Christ: and not to the working: i.e. those that seek righteousness by the works of the Law, John 3.16. Rom. 3.22 and chapter 4.ver.4, 5.]
\p
\v 23 . But before faith came, [That is, before Christ who is the foundation of faith, which faith respecteth, and whereon it relyeth, came in the flesh. See ver. 19.] We were put in custody [the Greek word signifies such a keeping with shoulders and a guard in a strong place. The Apostle here again useth the same similitude as in the former verse, as appears by the following word. But the Apostle seems here also to have respect to this use of the Law that the served as it were therewith to seclude the Jews from other people, and as it were to keep them alone. See Deu. 4.7. Psalm 147.19. Eph. 2.14.] Under the Law, and were shut up until the faith, which should be revealed. [That is, until Christ, who was to be revealed as before?]
\p
\v 24 . So then the Law was our [Namely, the Jews, which were under the Law] Schoolmaster [Gr. Paedagogos, which signifies one that leads children to school, instructs and discipline them. Therefore he compares the Jews under the Law to the Children, and believing Christians to men grown, who have no more need of a School-master] unto Christ, [that is, to lead us unto Christ. Which the moral Law doth when it convinceth us of sin, and denounced the curse; and therefore sheweth us, that to be saved we must fly to Christ to refuge, who hath delivered us from sin, and from the curse, and the ceremonial Law, seeing the same did not only convince men of their sins, but were also types and represented by the same, as to be found only in Christ, Heb. 9.ver.10.11. etc.] That we might be justified by faith: [that is, by the merits of Christ, received of us by a true faith, and by God of Grace imputed to us.]
\p
\v 25 . But when faith is come, [That is, Christ whom faith respecteth, as ver.23.] we are no more under the School-master. [Forasmuch as the same hath now accomplished this service, and we are now come to the age of man, Eph. 4.13.]
\p
\v 26 . For ye [Namely, who have embraced the Gospel, as well Gentiles as Jews] are all children of God. [Gr. Sons, namely, full grown, who are no more subject to a School-master. For although the faithful of the old Testament under the Law, were also Gods children; yet nevertheless so it was, that as little children they were kept under a Schoolmaster, and therefore differed not from servants, Gal. 4.1.] by faith [See John 1.12.] in Christ Jesus. [That is, through Christ, who being the proper and only begotten Son of God had merited for us, that for his sake, of grace we are received for children, Eph. 1.5.]
\p
\v 27 . For as many of you [That is, all that are baptized: which must be understood of all those who do not only receive the outward baptism of water, but also the inward baptism of the spirit, 1 Pet. 3.21. as appears in Simon the sorcerer, Acts 8.ver.13.21. who indeed received the outward but not the inward baptism] as are baptized in Christ, [that is, into the name and into the faith of Christ] ye have put on Christ. [Namely, as a spiritual garment; wherewith our spiritual nakedness and shame is covered, and we are adorned as a with a wedding garment, Rom. 13.14.]
\p
\v 28 . Therein is neither Jew nor Greek; [That which he had said in general of all believers, that he expounds more at large, and testifieth that there is no difference amongst them any more, of what nation, condition or race so ever they be] therein is neither bond nor free: therein is no male or female. For ye are all one [that is, as one man, one as well as another, by Christ made heir of eternal life] in Christ Jesus. [not in the Commonwealth or family, where there is inequality, but as concerning the benefits of Christ.]
\p
\v 29 . And if ye [Namely, Galatians who before were Gentiles, and now believe in Christ] be Christâ€™s, then ye are Abrahams seed, [that is, Abrahams children as is said ver.7. of all which Christ is the head, as the promised seed of Abraham, ver.16, 19.] and heirs [namely, of eternal life, whereof Canaan was a type, Heb. 11.9.] according to the promise. [Namely, which is made to Abraham and his seed, and consequently not by the works of the Law. See ver.18.]
\c 4
\s 1. The apostle furthers explain that which he had said before of the Schoolmaster-ship of the Law, by a similitude taken from a child under age, which is yet under Tutors, 4 and testifieth that now by the coming of the Son of God in the flesh, we are freed from Tutorship and bondage of the Law. 6 So that we are now children of God, who being become of age May posses our inheritance our selves. 8 Reproves the Galatians that they, being converted from heathenish idolatry, again betook them selves to the bondage of the outward ceremonies. 12 Exhorts them to preserve in the zeal good inclination unto him, with which they had first received the Gospel, 17 warning them of the perverse zeal of the false Teachers. 19 Afterwards sweetens this reproof with a loving speech, wishing that he might be with them. 21 Proves further out of the Law itself, that we are no longer subject to the bondage of the same, nor can be justified by the Law, by applying to the types of the two sons of Abraham, namely, Isaac and Ishmael, and of their Mothers, Sara and Agar, 24. As also of the mount of Sinai and City of Jerusalem: whereby the two covenants are signified. 28 Teacheth that the inheritance with Isaac is to be obtained by the promise of the Gospel, although with persecution, 30 and that they who seek to be saved by the Law with Ishmael, shall be thrust off from inheritance.
\p
\v 1 But I say [That is, that which I said in chapter 3.ver.24.25. that the Law is our Schoolmaster, I now explain by another similitude, taken also from humane affairs. See the like 1 Cor. 5.6. 2 Cor. 9.6.] as long as the times the heir is a child, [That is, is yet an infant and under years] he differed nothing from a servant, [Namely, as concerning the present use of the inheritance, which he may as little touch use as a servant, seeing herein he is not yet his own, but is under others] although he be Lord of all. [The propriety of all goods of the inheritance belongeth unto him.]
\p
\v 2 . But he is under Tutors and Guardians, [That is, under the power and oversight of those who are appointed for the governing and taking of his goods. Of these words, see Mat. 20.8. Luke 12.42. and 16.1. 1 Cor. 4.1.] unto the tome fore-appointed of the Father. [that is, the none-aged hath its time appointed by Law, which Fathers also by their Testament may shorten or lengthen as they shall see god.]
\p
\v 3 . So we also [Namely, Jews, who are now members of the church of Christ] when we were children [namely, in the times of the Old Testament, before the coming of Christ] under the first principle of the world. [Gr. Elements, i.e. under the ceremonies which consist in outward and earthily things, and were as the first introduction and beginning of saving knowledge. See Colos. 2.8.]
\p
\v 4 . But when the fullness of time came [That is, the full-grown age of the Church, to be set free from his warship. Or when the time was fulfilled which God had determined to send his Son into this world] God sent forth his Son, [Namely, Jesus Christ, who was Gods Son from the everlasting, before he became man, Psa. 2.7. Prov. 8.24. Mic. 5.1. Acts 13.33.] made [Otherwise born] of a woman [that is, of the flesh and blood of the virgin Mary, Luke 1.31. and 2.7.] made under the Law; [that is, Christ subjected himself not only to the ceremonial Law, which he perfectly kept for sins, and took the curse thereof upon him, and delivered us from it, 2 Cor. 5.21.]
\p
\v 5 . That he might deliver [Gr. Redeem, namely, paying for them a full ransom for their sins. See Gal. 3.13.] them that were under the Law, [that is, who were under the yoke of the ceremonial Law, and also under the curse and rigorous obedience of the moral Law, whereof he also speaks in this fourth chapter, see ver. 21.] (and) that we might obtain the adoption of children. [Gr. Putting for sons. Therefore the Son of God must be sent to redeem us, that he might obtain, and graciously communicate the right of Son- ship, which he had by nature, unto all believers, not only sons but also daughters, 2 Cor. 6.18. See Eph. 1.5.]
\p
\v 6 . And forasmuch as ye [Namely, believing Galatians, who before were heathen] are children [namely, of God, made by the Son of God, and for his sake adopted for children by God. Who before were children of wrath, and Enemies of God. See Rom. 5.10. Eph. 2.1,2. And enjoy the right and liberty of Gods children, being set free out of the ward-ship of the Law, and freed from the curse of the same] God hath sent the spirit of his Son [that is, the Holy Ghost, which as a pledge in your hearts, assures you of this gracious adoption for children, and of the inheritance which belongs to children, 2 Cor. 1.22. and 5.5. Eph. 1.13. etc.] Unto your hearts, which eyeth [that is, by which we cry, Rom.8.15. i.e. which worketh in us that we boldly and with assurance cry unto God. See the like phrase, Rom. 8.26.] Abba, Father. [See the exposition hereof in the annotation on Rom.8.15.
\p
\v 7 . So then thou [Namely, who now believeth in Christ] art no more [namely, as before] a servant, [namely, standing under the ward-ship and bondage of the Law] but a Son: and if thou art a Son [Namely, of God, who now being come to thy years, art set free of the foresaid ward-ship] thou art also an heir of God [See of this conclusion, Rom. 8. 17.] through Christ. [Namely, who hath merited and procured this inheritance for us, and whose co-heirs we shall be, Rom. 8. 17.]
\p
\v 8 . But then when ye knew not God, [That is, when ye were yet in heathenism, and had no knowledge of the true God] ye served [namely, as slaves and servants of idols] them [that is, the idols] which by nature are no Gods. [That is, truly and essentially, but only according too opinion, by the feigning of men, Jerem. 10. 11.]
\p
\v 9 . And now when ye know God; [That is, the true God, who is God by nature and according to his essence] ye much rather [this the Apostle adds, to show that they have not this knowledge of themselves, by the quickness of their own understanding, but by the grace of God, by which he prevented them, and brought them to this knowledge] are known of God, [namely, for his, See Mat. 7. 23. 2 Tim. 2. 19. i.e. whom God of mere mercy hath vouchsafed to enlighten with the knowledge of himself. See also 1 Cor. 8. 3. and chapter 13. v. 12.] How turn ye [that is, do not turn yourselves] again [namely, from one bondage to another: from the bondage of idols to the bondage of ceremonies] unto the weak and poor first beginnings [or rudiments, that is, unto the ceremonies and doctrine of the Law, which have no power to justify you thereby. See Heb. 7. ver. 18, 19.] which ye will serve [that is, addict yourselves to the bondage of the same, namely, because ye will follow the doctrine of the false Apostles] again [namely, even as ye served idols before] from the beginning, [or from the top]
\p
\v 10 . Ye [Here the Apostle relates some kinds of the foresaid elements or first principles, concerning the observation of the Jewish feast days. See Rom. 14. 5.] Observe [namely, after the manner of the Jews, to do God service therewith, and to be justified thereby] days, [that is, Sabbaths, coming about once every week, Exod. 20. 8. Col. 2. 16. Namely so far forth as they were ceremonial and proper to the Jews] and months, [that is, feasts of new moons, Num. 28. 11.] And times, [that is, the great yearly feasts of the Passover, Pentecost and tabernacles, Exod. 23. 15, 16, & c.] and years, [that is, the seventh and also the fiftieth year, Exod. 23. 10. Lev. 25. 4. 6, 10.]
\p
\v 11 . I am in fear of you, lest in any wise I should have taken pains with you in vain. [That is, without fruit: lest all my labor and trouble which I have undergone to convert you to Christ, should be fruitless, and not attain its end, which is your salvation, which ye shall not be able to obtain; if ye would be justified by the Law.]
\p
\v 12 . Be ye as I, [Namely, who formerly have also been very zealous for the Law, but afterward knowing Christ aright, have cast off all those outward ceremonies and esteemed them as loss, Phil. 3. 7, 8.] for I also am as ye, [i.e. I was such in former times, being indeed as greatly zealous for Judaism ever ye could be, Gal. 1. 14, Others understand this of the good affection which Paul bare to them: and that he here exhorts them to bear him the like affection] brethren I beseech you: [that is, if I cannot prevail with you by reproof, be moved at lest by my friendly entreaty, to abide by the truth of the Gospel] ye have done me no injury, [that is, as concerning my person ye have given me no cause that I should out of passion or revenge so sharply reprove you. And thereby tacitly he would show that they did Christ wrong in this.]
\p
\v 13 . And ye know [that is, ye are so far from having done me wrong, that as ye know, when I preached the Gospel among you, ye showed me the greatest honor and love that men could do] that through infirmity of the flesh, [that is, in a low and mean estate, without outward luster. Or with many persecutions, reproaches, troubles, hatred and dangers outwardly coming upon me. See 1 Cor. 2. 3. and 2 Cor. 11. 30. and chapter 12. 9.] I published the gospel was first preached unto you by me, when ye were yet Gentiles. See Acts 16. 6. and chapter 28. 23.]
\p
\v 14 . And my temptation [Or trial, i.e. my tribulations, which before he called infirmity, whereby God would try my faith and fidelity] which (happened) in my flesh [that is, which was outwardly brought upon me] ye despised not [Gr. Esteemed not for naught .] nor abhorred, [Gr. Spewed-out, i.e. ye were not offended there at, or thereby ye were not turned away, from receiving the Gospel, or to despise or reject my doctrine] but ye received me as an Angel of God, [that is, as if I had been one of the Holy Angels and ministering Spirits; or as an Ambassador of God: for that the word Angel signifies also] (yea) as Christ Jesus. [That is, not as a Minister of Christ, but as if I had been the Lord himself. The Apostle would hereby show that it would be great shame for the Galatians, that they should so inconstantly forsake him, to whom before they had shown such honor and love, and fall to the false Apostles: that therefore they ought to persevere in the former.]
\p
\v 15 . What was then your counting blessed? [That is, how blessed did you then esteem yourselves. See of this word, Rom. 4. 9.] For I bear you witness, that if it were possible [namely, that men could do one any service by the digging out and giving of their eyes] ye would have digged out your eyes and given them to me, [that is, whatsoever is most lovely and most acceptable unto you, ye would not given me. See Mat. 5.29.]
\p
\v 16 . Am I then become your Enemy [Namely, as I am slandered by the false Apostle, or as men would think that this sharp reproof was given by me out of hatred or enmity] telling you the truth? [Namely, for your god and salvation: for this is a work, not of Enemies, but of Friends, See Prov. 27.6.]
\p
\v 17 . They [That is, the false Apostles, which seek to seduce you, shew indeed as if they had great zeal to bring you to salvation: or bare great affection unto you] are not rightly zealous for you, [that is, with no true but with feigned zeal or affection] but they will exclude [namely, that you should no more hear, follow or adhere to us. Others read include you, i.e. shut you, as it were, into a prison, and subject you to them] us, [namely, the true Apostle and Teachers] that ye might be zealous for them [that is, to follow and adhere to them with a zeal and great inclination.]
\p
\v 18 . But in good thing [That is, about a good matter: for there is a twofold zeal, one good, which is described here, and one perverse, which is exercised about an evil matter, which men think to be good, and therefore is mingled with ignorance. See Rom.10.2.] To be zealous always, [that is, with a zeal that always continues steadfast, ceaseth not] is good, and not only when I am present with you. [Namely, when ye were inflamed with such a zeal and affection towards me and my doctrine, ye ought to have continued therein, although I am not now with you.]
\p
\v 19 . My little children, [Namely, which I have brought forth by the Gospel, 1 Cor. 4.15.] whom I labor again to bring forth, [Gr. Of whom I am again in travel, or pain, i.e. who at first with much trouble labor converted you from heathenism unto Christ, and about I shall now again be constrained to bestow great labor & trouble to bring to a new from these errors] until Christ [that is, the saving knowledge of Christ] get a form in you. [That is, even as a mother so long bears a child until it hath gotten a perfect form, and then brings forth the same; so I will not cease to labor, until ye shall be confirmed in the true knowledge of Christ.]
\p
\v 20 . But I would that I were now present with you, [Namely, the batter to shew my love unto you, and to be able the more largely to inform you of all things, then can indeed be done by writing] and might change my voice [that is, suit my words and discourse according to the condition of every one, or of the matters, speaking now more mildly, then more sharply unto you] For I am in doubt about you. [that is, I know not how much I stand with you, whether I shall convince well or ill of you, or what end this your turning away will take, or how I shall best bring you to right again from the same.]
\p
\v 21 . Tell me [That is, answer me once to that which I shall propound unto you out of the Law it self] ye that will be under the Law, [that is, who seek to be justified by the works of the Law, and the observation of the ceremonies] do ye not hear the Law? [That is, will ye not submit to the Law, to receive that which is written in the Law and Books of Moses? Namely, that the Law it self excludes those from inheritance, that are servants of the Law, as is proved in the following verses. The word Law is here taken in a two-fold signification, as Rom. 3.21.]
\p
\v 22 . For it is written, [Namely, in the Law of Moses from the eleventh chapter of Genesis to the 22.] that Abraham had two sons, one [namely, Ishmael] by the bondmaid, [Or, she-slave, namely, Agar.] and one [namely, Isaac] by the (free-woman.) [Namely, Sara.]
\p
\v 23 . But he that was the bond-maid was born after the flesh: [That is, according to the power, working and course of nature. For Agar was yet young when she conceived her son, and Abraham yet fit to begot children] but he that was of the free- (woman) by promise. [Namely, born i.e. by a supernatural operation of God, which way promised Abraham by God, Gen. 18.10. For Sara was barren and now 90 years old, and Abraham an hundred, both unfit according to nature to get children, Gen. 17.17. Rom. 4.19.]
\p
\v 24 . Which are things that have another signification: [Gr. Allegoroumena, i.e. which are indeed a true history or event, but besides that, signify also somewhat else, as being type or representations of spiritual things: as also the brazen serpents, John 3.14. the marriage of Adam and Eve, Eph. 5.32. the Israelites passage through the Red Sea, 1 Cor. 10.1,2. the stood, 1 Pet. 3.20,21.] for these [namely, two women, Sara and Agar] are [that is, signify, betoken, represent, a Sacramental phrase. See Gen. 41.26,27. Mat. 26.26.] the two Covenants: [namely, the old, of the Law, wherein is promised that he that perfectly keeps the Law, shall thereby obtain salvation: and the new of the Gospel, wherein eternal life is promised to sinners that believe in Christ. See Jer. 31.31. etc. Heb. 8.8,9, 10.] The one [namely, the Covenant of the Law] from Mount Sinai, [that is, which hath its original from thence, where the same was by God through Moses propounded to the people, and received by the people] bringing forth unto bondage, [namely, bringing forth children which are under bondage. For the Law requires of men a perfect obedience, or for want thereof denounceth the curse unto them] which is Agar. [that is, which is represented by the bondmaid, Agar who being her self a she-slave was driven out of the house, and whose children do not inherit with the sons of the free-woman; Gen. 21.10. for they that are born of a she-slave, are slaves also, and not heirs.]
\p
\v 25 . For this (namely) Agar [That is, this Covenant which is represented by Agar. Or this word Agar] is Sina [that is, is also called Sina: for the mount which we call Sina, is as some think, by the Arabians called Agar, and from thence the Arabians are called Agarians, 1 Chronicles 5.10.19. Psalm 83.7. Or is a representation of Sina, and of the Covenant of the Law, that was given on mount Sina] a mountain in Arabia, [that is, lying in the wilderness of Arabia, whither Hagar fled with her son when she was driven out of Abrahams house, and there given him an Egyptian wife, Gen. 21.14,20,21.] and agreeth [namely, that Covenant, i.e. hath a likeness and unity] unto Jerusalem [that is, unto the Jewish Synagogue or Religion, which hath the command and its seat in Jerusalem] that now is, [namely, since the coming of Christ, by who all the ceremonies are fulfilled and abolished: and nevertheless holdeth that the observation of the ceremonies is still necessary to salvation] and is in bondage [or, for it is in bondage, i.e. it bears still the yoke of ceremonies, and seeks salvation thereby] with her children. [That is, with all those that adheres to this Religion, and seeks their salvation by the Covenant. And therefore it is justly compared to Agar and her son: and shall also as with her son, be thrust out from the inheritance.]
\p
\v 26 . But Jerusalem that is above, [That is, the true Christian Church and Religion, which seeketh its salvation not by the first Covenant of the Law, namely, by the works of the Law; but by the second of the Gospel, namely, by the merits of Christ, embraced by a true faith: which hath its original from heaven by the powerful calling of the Holy Ghost. See Heb. 12.22. Rev. 3.12. And 21.10.] That is free, [namely, from the bondage and curse of the Law, and is rightly compared to Sara and Isaac which were persons: wherefore it shall also inherit the inheritance of heaven] which is the mother [even as Sara was the mother of Isaac, who was his Fathers heir, because he was born of a free mother] of us all. [Namely, believers, as well Jews as Gentiles, who seeks their salvation in Christ alone.]
\p
\v 27 . For it is written, [namely, Isa. 54.1. The Apostle confirms this represented difference of the two Covenants, people, and Churches, of the Law and of the Gospel, by the testimony and prediction of the Prophet Isaiah, lest he should seem to have feigned this accommodation without the Scripture] rejoice thou barren [that is, thou Church of those that seek their salvation in Christ alone, who were few in the times of Christ: so that it seemed as if she had no children, which is also signified when the Prophet saith that she no travail and is solitary] who bearest not: break forth and cry thou hast no travail: for the children [that is, members of the same] of the solitary are many more [thereby is foretold the great multitude of those out of Judaism, and principally out of Gentilism, which shall betake themselves unto this Church, which came to pass after Christâ€™s Ascension] then of her that hath a husband. [That is, the Jewish Church or Synagogue, which boasted that she only was the Church and peculiar people of God, and had many adherents.]
\p
\v 28 . But we [Namely, who seek our salvation, not by the Law, but by faith in Christ] brethren, are children of the promise, [that is, whom the inheritance of eternal life is promised, and shall be partakers of the same] as Isaac was. [Gr. According to Isaac, i.e. according to the type of Isaac. Namely, like as Isaac, by virtue of promise of the Gospel, as free children of God be made partakers of heavenly inheritance.]
\p
\v 29 . But like as then [Namely, in Abrahams time] he that was born after the flesh, [namely, Ishmael, See ver. 23.] persecuted him [namely, with bitter mocking. See Gen. 21.9.] that (was born) after the spirit, [that is, Isaac, who was born by virtue of Gods promise, embraced by his parents with a true faith, which the spirit of God wrought in them] even so also now. [namely, are believers who seek their salvation in Christ alone, even as was Isaac, still persecuted by the Jewish Synagogue, who will be saved by the Law, whereof Ishmael was a type. Thereby he exhorts the faithful to patience and steadfastness.]
\p
\v 30 . But what saith the Scripture? [That is, mark well I pray that which the Holy Scripture yet further saith, in this history] cast out the bondmaid and her son: [By this casting out of Hagar and Ishmael out of the house of Abraham, was figured, that also all they that seek to be saved by the Covenant of the Law, shall be cast out of the house of God, and not obtain the inheritance of eternal life. But that they that are of the faith of Christ, shall abide therein, and be saved alone.] For the son of the bond-maid shall in no wise inherit, with the son of the free-(woman.)
\p
\v 31 . So then Brethren, we [Namely, who seek salvation in Christ, and not in the Law] are not children of the bond-maid, [namely, of Agar, i.e. of the Covenant of the Law, whereof Agar was a type: who shall not inherit but be cast out] but of the free. [Namely, of Sara, i.e. of the gracious covenant of the Gospel, whereof Sara was a type, who shall obtain the inheritance.]
\c 5
\s 1 The Apostle having declared and proved the freedom of Christians from the yoke of the Law, exhorts the Galatians to continue and preserve in that liberty 2 That otherwise Christ profits them not, 5 and that righteousness is not obtained but by faith working by love. 7 Testifieth that the opinion of the false Teachers is not of God, but as a leaven: and that they shall be punished by God: 11 that they also abused the Apostles name. 13 Teacheth that this liberty must be used with love of our neighbours, without strife 16. Exhorts them to overcome the lusts of the flesh by the power of the Spirit. 17 Therefore describes the combat of the flesh against the Spirit in the faithful, 19 relates the fruits of the flesh, 22 and of the Spirit, 24 shewing that there are the true Christians, who overcome the flesh through the Spirit.
\p
\v 1 Stand therefore [That is, continue steadfast without turning away. See 1 Cor. 16.13.] In the liberty, [namely, from the bondage of the Law, mentioned in the former chapters] with which Christ hath made us free, [namely, who hath freed us from the curse and constraints of the Law, and hath fulfilled and abolished all the legal ceremonies. See John 8.36.] And be not again [as ye were subject formerly to the bondage of Idols, and are freed from it, do not again undergo a new bondage of ceremonies. See Gal. 4.] Caught [that is, bound and fastened thereto as it were with cords and snares. A similitude taken from Oxen, on whose horns men bind fast the yoke to keep them under] with the yoke of bondage. [That is, the difficult and troublesome observation of the Ceremonies, which Peter, Acts 15.10. calls a yoke not to be born.]
\p
\v 2 . Behold, I Paul [Namely, whom am an Apostle of Jesus Christ, called thereunto, not of men nor by men, but by God. See Gal. 1.1. Therefore he opposes his Apostolic authority, to the esteem of the false Apostles] say unto you, that if ye suffer your selves to be circumcised [Gr. If ye be circumcised? Namely, with such an opinion that circumcision is yet necessary to salvation, and ye shall be justified thereby] Christ shall not be profitable unto you. [That is, that then you have no part in the righteousness, are not subject to the righteousness of God, Rom. 10.3. And he that holds circumcision necessary still, he thereby denies that Christ hath fulfilled that which was pre-figured thereby.]
\p
\v 3 . And I testify again to every men who suffers himself to be circumcised, [That is, who is circumcised, as before ver.2.] that he is a debtor [that is, that he thereby engageth and obligeth himself] to do the whole Law. [That is, to keep the Law perfectly in every thing, to be justified by the Law: seeing no man doth, or can do now, therefore all that seek their righteousness in the Law are subject to the curse, Deu. 27.26. Jam. 2.10.]
\p
\v 4 . Christ is become vain unto you [Gr. Ye are made vain, or brought to naught from Christ, i.e. although you would mingle Christâ€™s righteousness with the Law, that can not profit you, seeing such mingling is impossible, and the righteousness of Christ is brought to naught, if righteousness be by the Law, Gal. 2.21.] who (will) be justified [Gr. Are justified] by the Law, ye are fallen [that is, ye should fall, if ye would be justified by the Law. Or he speaketh this not in respect of true believers, who never totally nor finally fall from the grace of God, 1 Pet. 1.5. 1 John. 3.9. But in respect of hypocrites, who seemed to stand in the grace of God, and are said to fall from the same, when they are made known and manifest, that they never stood in the grace of God, 1 John 2.19.] from grace. [That is, from the savor of God, and consequently from all Gods benefits, which flow from hence, such as are effectual calling, faith, remission of sins, justification, sanctification and eternal life. For to be justified by works and by grace cannot stand together, Rom. 11.6.]
\p
\v 5 . For we [Namely, believers of the Jews, to whom the Law was given: How much more then ought ye who are Gentiles, and that had not have the Law, to seek righteousness also by Faith and not by the Law, Gal. 2.15, 16.] expect [that is, are confident that we have righteousness, and shall certainly obtain the fruit thereof, which we now hope for, Rom. 8.24. Tit. 2.13.] Through the Spirit [namely, of God which works this confidence in us] by faith, [namely, in Christ: whereby we receive the merits of Christ. And not by the works of the Law] the hope of righteousness.
\p
\v 6 . For in Christ, [That is, now in the Kingdome of Christ under the new Testament; to be a Christian] neither hath circumcision [that is, all the ceremonies and advantages which in the former times were given to the Jews] any virtue [namely, to justify] nor forsaking: [that is, to be circumcised, that neither furthers nor hinders salvation] See Rom. 3.30.] But faith [namely, hath only that virtue, as being an instrument whereby we receive and are made Partakers of the righteousness of Christ] working or being operative and active] by love, [that is, by shewing forth the works of love towards God and our neighbor. Whereby true Faith is distinguished from the outward profession of faith of hypocrites, which is dead faith, and cannot save. See Jam. 2.14. 20, 26. By this description he also answers the calumny of the false Teachers, who taught that the doctrine of justification by faith alone made men careless and ungodly.]
\p
\v 7 . Ye did run well, [Namely, in the race of true faith, i.e. adhering to the doctrine of justification and Christian liberty. A similitude taken from those who contend in the running of race. See 1 Cor. 9.24,26. Phil. 3.14.] who did hinder you [that is, stopped and as it were cut off your course, This he demands as admitting at their greatest unsteadfastness in the pure doctrine: and withal he lays the principal blame hereof on the seducers, to shew that he believed that they sinned out of weakness and not out of wickedness, and that so the better to gain them] not to be obedient [that is, not to receive, not to believe, and not to continue steadfastly therein] to the truth. [Namely, of mans justification of grace by faith, without works, Gal. 2.5.]
\p
\v 8 . This opinion [Gr. This making-believe, or persuasion, namely, of the false Apostles, who pervade you and seek to make you believe, that righteousness is also by the Law, and not only by Christ] is not of him that calleth you. [Namely, God or Christ. See Gal. 1.6.] And for this course not good, nor agreeable to the truth.]
\p
\v 9 . A little leaven sowreth the whole dough. [See of this similitude, 1 Cor. 5.6. By this leaven may be understood either the false doctrine it self, as Mat. 16.v.6.12. Or the men who promoted this doctrine, who although there were few, yet nevertheless did much hurt, to corrupt the whole Church in time, and therefore must the more be eschewed.]
\p
\v 10 . I am confident of you in the Lord, that ye will be of other opinion: [Namely, then I have taught you, and yet in this Epistle teach you] but he that troubleth you, [that is, disquiets your consciences with false and strange doctrine, and disturbs the peace of the Church] shall bear the judgment, [that is, be justly and certainly punished by God. A Hebrew phrase, see Mat. 23.24.] whosoever he be. [That is, who is guilty thereof, of what esteem so ever he may be.]
\p
\v 11 . But I brethren, if I yet [namely, as I urged it when I was yet a Pharisee, with such an opinion that I should be justified thereby] preach circumcision, [that is, teach that circumcision and the other ceremonies of the Law, are necessary to be observed to salvation, as the false Apostles backbite me] why am I yet persecuted? [that is, that this backbiting is true appears by the persecutions, the Jews daily lay upon me, for no other cause but because I teach that circumcision and other ceremonies are abolished by Christ] then is the offence of the cross [that is, the offence which the Jews take from the Christian doctrine, whereby is taught that Christ by his crucifying and death only, hath redeemed us from the curse, and procured salvation for us, 1 Cor. 1.23.] brought to naught. [That is, should cease.]
\p
\v 12 Oh! that they were even cut off, [Namely, from the church and company of the faithfull. This he wishes out of an Apolstolic zeal to the glory of God, and to the salvation of men : not out of a revengeful mind. Therefore this is not repugnant to Christ's command, Mat. 5.44, nor to his own doctrine, Rom. 12.14.] that disquiet you. [that is, trouble you, as verse 10.]
\p
\v 13 . For ye are called [Namely, by God, and by Christ. See ver.8. And Gal. 1.6.] unto liberty [see ver.1.] brethren: only (use) not liberty [before he exhorted them to continue steadfast in Christian liberty, here he exhorts them further to the right use of the same] for an occasion to the flesh: [that is, to abuse this liberty to the fulfilling of the lusts of the flesh, and for a cloak for sin, 1 Pet. 2.16.] but serve one another through love. [that is, although ye may be free from the bondage of the Law, yet nevertheless ye must shew to one another the service of love: for although ye are free from bondage of ceremonial Law, ye are not free from the Law of love, Rom. 13.8. 1 Pet. 2.17.]
\p
\v 14 . For the whole Law [Gr. All the Law, namely, of the second Table, wherein God prescribes us how we must carry ourselves towards our neighbor. See Rom. 13.8.] Is fulfilled [that is, briefly and summarily contained as one in chief point. See Lev. 19.18. Mat. 22.39. Rom. 13.8.] In one word, [that is, in one command, see Deu. 4.13.] (namely) in this, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy self.
\p
\v 15 . But if ye bite and devour one another, [that is, trouble and vex one another with contentions, reproaches, and divisions about this point of Christian liberty] look to it, that ye be not consumed one of another. [That is, that through your divisions your faith be not weakened, and the walfare, peace and quiet of the church be not broken.]
\p
\v 16 . And I say, [That is, this that I will say. See Gal. 3.17. and 4.1. He further declares here that which he had said, v.13. and shews that the means whereby the abuse of liberty may be avoided] walk by the spirit, [when the spirit and flesh in a man are opposed one to another; by the spirit is understood that part of the man, which is regenerated by the spirit: and by the flesh, the natural corruption, which yet cleaves to the regenerate, See Rom 8.1.] And fulfilled not [or, and ye shall not fulfill, shewing that what fruit shall follow from thence, when men walk according to the spirit. And so then this shall be the means to prevent the abuse of liberty] the concupiscence of the flesh. [That is, the evil thoughts, inclinations, motions and lusts of corrupt nature, which yet cleave to the regenerate.]
\p
\v 17 . For the flesh desired against the spirit, [That is, the evil lusts of the flesh retrieve against the good desires which the Holy Ghost raiseth up in the regenerate] and the spirit against the flesh: and these withstands one another, [that is, are contrary lusts] so that ye do not [that is, cannot always fulfill] that which ye would. [namely, according to the good lusts and desires which the Holy Ghost hath wrought in you: as also on the contrary, the lusting of the spirit hinder that ye do not fulfill the lusts of the flesh, Rom. 7.19. etc.]
\p
\v 18 . But if ye led by the spirit, [Namely, so that the spirit and the good desires which he works in you prevail in you, so that ye suffer your selves to be led thereby in the ways of God.] ye are not under the Law. [That is, not under the constraint of the Law, which ariseth from fear of the threatening of the Law, nor under the curse of the same, not under the yoke of the ceremonies. For the spirit which leads the regenerate, is not the spirit of bondage unto fear, but of the adoption for children, and of liberty, see Rom. 8.15. Gal. 4.6.]
\p
\v 19 . The works now of the flesh [That is, which the flesh or the corruption of our nature produceth; and wherein mans corrupt nature takes pleasure] are manifest: [that is, are sufficiently known, seeing man know by the light of nature, that they are evil, shameful and dishonorable. Or cannot remain hidden, how much so ever men seek to cover them] which are adultery, fornication, uncleanness, immodesty. [That is, lasciviousness, wantonness, petulancy.]
\p
\v 20 . Idolatry, poisoning, [Or, which craft] enmities, contentions grudges, [or, jealousies, when a man grugdeth that it goes with his neighbor, or seek his own advantage with the loss and damage of the neighbor] anger, quarrelling, discord, heresies,
\p
\v 21 . Envy, murther, drunkenness, gluttonies, [See Rom. 13.13. Eph. 5.18.] and the like: [that is added, because there are yet many more, and it would be too long to rehearse them all] of which I tell you before, [that is, not only instruct you as a teacher, but also as a Prophet certainly declare unto and warn you before hand] as I have also said before, [namely, 1 Cor. 6.9,10. Eph. 5.5.] That they that do such things, [that is, such and the like works of the flesh] shall not [namely, except they from their hearts repent from such sins] inherit [that is, obtain and posses: for this Kingdome is not obtained by merits, but by grace as an inheritance. See Mat. 19.29. and chapter 25.34. 1 Cor. 6.10.] The Kingdome of glory: or eternal salvation in heaven.]
\p
\v 22 . But the fruit of the spirit, [That is, the works which the spirit of God worketh in the regenerate; and by which regeneration is known] is love, joy, [namely, by the Holy Ghost, Rom. 14.17. arising from the assurance that we have peace with God] peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, [that is, faithfulness in promise, and the administration of ones office] meekness, moderation. [Or charity, abstaining from unlawful lusts.]
\p
\v 23 . Against such [That is, who exercise and shew froth these and the like virtues in their life] the Law is not. [namely, which shall condemn them, see ver.18.]
\p
\v 24 . But that are Christâ€™s, [That is, engrafted into Christ by a true faith, belong to him: who are true Christians] have crucified the flesh [that is, are not only bound to mortify their corrupt nature and not to let it reign, but also actually do this by the power of the spirit of Christ which they have received] with the motions and lusts. [namely, not the natural, but those that are contrary to the Law of God, which proceed from the corrupt nature of man, Rom. 1.24,26.]
\p
\v 25 . If we live by the spirit, [That is, are raised up by the Holy Ghost from the death of the sin unto a new life] let us walk by the spirit. [That is, in our life follow the leading of the Holy Ghost, and bring forth the foresaid fruits of the same, Rom. 8.5. etc.]
\p
\v 26 . Let us not be [The Apostle now further exhorts the Galatians to beware of special sins, and to pursue some special virtues. Whereof some do begin the sixth chapter from this verse] seekers of vain glory, [that is, that we should be ambitious, & seek to overtop others, or to bear sway over others] provoking one another, [Gr. Summoning, or challenging, namely, by despising, reproaches, reviling or the like] envying one another. [Namely, one anotherâ€™s virtues, estates, or conditions, which commonly proceeds from ambition, and is accompanied with the same.]
\c 6
\s 1 The Apostle further exhorts the Galatians to divers Christian virtues, namely, to meekness reproving of those who sin out of weakness, 2. To mutual forbearance, 3. to examination and lowly opinion of themselves, 6. to maintaining of their Teachers, 7. to take heed what they sow, 9. and to liberality towards the poor, especially those that are faithful. 11. Afterwards he concludes the Epistle, showing how he loves and esteems them, 12. and warning them of the false Apostles, whose ambition and hypocrisy he describes, 14. and opposeth his own example thereunto. 15. Teacheth briefly wherein true Christianity consists: and what the same hath to expect. 17. Admonisheth that no man be further troublesome unto him, 18. and endeth with the usual salutation.
\p
\v 1 Brethren if also a man were overtaken [Or prevented, surprised, namely, out of improvidence or weakness, not out of willful purpose] by [Gr. In] any mis-deed, [namely, whereby he hath offended you or others] ye that are spiritual [that is who are enlightened by God, and endued with fitness to be able to admonisheth others, See 1 Cor. 3.1.] bring such one to the right [namely, by good instruction and admonishing. The Greek word signifies properly to make whole, to perfect, to supply the want, or to restore anything, see Mat. 4.21.] with the spirit of meekness, [Gr. In the spirit] considering your selves, [that is, minding your own infirmities, how easily ye also might thereby be overtaken with the like sins that ye also be tempted. [that is, by the temptations of the Devil and the flesh be not brought to the like sins.]
\p
\v 2 . Bear [That is, help to bear, bear with, amend, and remove them with Christian moderation and compassion] one anotherâ€™s burden: [that is, infirmities, defects, which lie as an heavy burden upon men] and so fulfill [that is, satisfy, accomplish, observe] the law of Christ, [namely, of loving another, John 13.34,35. which although it be also written by Moses, Lev. 19.18. yet it is especially called the Law of Christ, because he mostly strictly enjoyed the Same to his Disciples, as well by exhortation as by his example, John 15.12. 1 John 3.16.]
\p
\v 3 . Foe if any one thinketh that he is any thing, [That is, thinketh that he is some great, holy, or special thing, esteemeth much of himself, and thinketh that he is better than his neighbor. From whence it commonly springs that men so severely reprove the failings of their neighbor] whereas he is nothing, [that is, whereas he hath nothing good of himself: and all that he hath, hath received of God, 1 Cor. 4.7. 2 Cor. 3.5.] he deceiveth himself in (his own) mind. [that is, foolishly makes himself believe that which is not so.]
\p
\v 4 . But let every one prove [That is, examine and look to, not according to his own pleasure, but according to the rule and touch-stone of Gods Law] his own work, [that is, his own actions and dealings: not so much the action of others] and then [namely, when he finds that his actions are agreeable to the Law of God] shall he have glorying [that is, shall be able to glory with a good conscience, not of his own worthiness or merits, Rom. 3.27. 1 Cor. 1.29,31. but that he walks uprightly before God according to his Law, 1 Cor. 9.15. 2 Cor. 1.12.] in himself only, that is, in his own good walking, and in his own conscience] and not in another. [That is, not comparing himself with others, whom he thinketh not to be as good as he, as the Pharisees did, Luke 18.11.]
\p
\v 5 . Foe every one shall bear his own burden, [That is, gives an account unto God of his own works and be judged according to his own actions.]
\p
\v 6 . And he that is instructed [The Greek catechumens signifies indeed one that is instructed in the first principles of Religion, but here is taken more largely for all kinds of hearers, who by the preaching of Gods word are instructed in the Christian Religion, of what state so ever they be] in the word [namely, of God] let him impart [that is, let him also give his part for the maintenance of the Teachers] of all good [Gr. In all goods, i.e. liberally that the Teachers may so much the better without hindrance bestow all their time in the administration of their office] to him that instructeth (him) [Gr. Catechizeth, as before.]
\p
\v 7 . Do not ere: [That is, do not vainly imagine and delude your selves, nor suffer your selves to be abused] God endures not to be mocked: [Gr. God is not mocked, namely, with vain pretences and evasions, which many use for not obeying Gods commands, seeing he doth not accepts evasions, neither let them go unpunished] for whatsoever a man soweth, [that is, hath bestowed as well upon the Teachers, wherefore is spoken before, as to the poor wherefore he speaks in that which follloweth. A similitude whereby the abundant fruit of communicativeness is set forth. As out of one grain that is, sown, oftentimes an hundred grow up and are gathered in again, Gen, 26.12. see of the same 2 Cor. 9.6.] that he shall also reap.
\p
\v 8 . For he that soweth in his own flesh, [that is, that bestoweth his goods only to live voluptuously thereof, or to gather treasures for himself, and doth not think of maintaining the ministers, and the poor] shall of the flesh [that is, of this abuse of his goods, which are bestowed only on his flesh] reap [that is, from thence he shall obtain recompense and fruit] corruption; [namely, temporal and eternal] but he that soweth in the Spirit [that is, he that bestoweth his goods about spiritual things, thereby to further Gods glory, and mens salvation, and to do good to the poor] shall of the spirit that is, forasmuch as he hath bestowed his goods about spiritual things] reap life everlasting. [that is, not only here in this life receive temporal blessings; but also hereafter eternal happiness, as a fruit of liberality, not of merit but of grace. See Mat. 25.v.34,35. &c.]
\p
\v 9 By doing good, [That is, shewing forth liberality] let us not grow slack, [the Greek signifieth by evil means to grow remiss in good: as many times it happens about the matter in hand; because the multitude of the poor is great, and almost among them oftentimes there are many unworthy and many unthankful persons; and because the time of recompense comes not presently] for in its due time [that is, although the time recompense be deferred, as there is time between sowing and reaping, yet nevertheless the same shall certainly come] we shall reap [see v.8.] if we grow not remis. [Gr. Be not dissolved, or loosened.]
\p
\v 10 . So then, while we have time [Namely, to sow, i.e. to do good to the poor: which must be done in the time of this life which is short and uncertain] let us do good [Gr. Work good, i.e. shew forth liberality] to all [namely, poor or other who have need of our help and assistance. See Luke 10.36,37.] but most of all to those of the household of Faith. [that is, to believing Christians, who together with us are members of the Church, which is the house of the living God, 1 Tim. 3.15. To these we are more obliged, and it would be unfitting that they that belong to one house should let one another suffer hunger and want.]
\p
\v 11 . See [Or ye see] how great an Epistle I have written to you [or with how many words, or writings] with mine own hand [that is, without causing it to be written by hand of another, as indeed he did, Rom. 16.22.] and only subscribed his name with salutation, 1 Cor. 16.21. Col. 4.18. Thereby he shews therefore how greatly he esteems the Galatians; and this he did that the false apostles should not say that it was not Paul's Epistle, and should bring forth another Epistle instead of it, as if it were written by him, as they indeed useth to do, 2 Thes. 2.2.]
\p
\v 12 . All those that will make a fair shew [Or be much respected. He understands here the false Apostles] according to the flesh [Gr. In the flesh, i.e. by the observing of the outward and corporal ceremonies] they constrain you to be circumcised, only that they might not be persecuted [namely, by the Jews, as we are daily most persecuted by them, because we teach that the Law of Moses is fulfilled and abrogated by Christ] because of the cross of Christ. [that is, for the doctrine of Christ, which is so called, because the sum and contents of the same is, the life is procured for us by the cross of Christ, 1 Cor. 2.2.]
\p
\v 13 . For they themselves also who are circumcised [Namely, and so strongly urge circumcision as yet necessary to salvation] keep not the Law: [namely, in the other points, which are also commanded in the Law, but lead an irregular and hypocritical life] but they will have you to be circumcised, that they might glory in your flesh. [that is, that they may get many adherents among you, and vainly thereof boast to the Jews.]
\p
\v 14 .But far be it from me that I should glory otherwise then in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. [That is, in the orthodox doctrine of Christ crucified for us, 1 Cor. 2.2.] by which [namely, cross of Christ. Or Christ crucified: the sense comes all in one] the world [that is, honor with men] is crucified to me, [that is, despised and rejected by me] and I unto the world [namely, while I for the doctrine of Christ am despised, persecuted, and cast off by the world, 1 Cor. 4.12.13.]
\p
\v 15 . For in Christ Jesus, [That is, in the Kingdome and church of Christ, or according to the doctrine of Christ. See Gal. 5.6.] neither hath circumcision any virtue, nor uncircumcision, [namely, by circumcision to obtain eternal life, or by uncurmcision to be hindred from obtaining the same] but a new creature, whereby is understood regeneration and renewing of a man by the Holy Ghost. See 2 Cor. 5.17.]
\p
\v 16 . And as many as shall walk according to this rule, [That is, according to this doctrine which I have propounded and declared in this Epistle, or mans justification before God, or Christian liberty, and of Christian conversation] upon them (shall be) [or be] peace, [that is, all manner of spiritual blessings, and especially reconciliation with God and assurance hereof in their minds by the Holy Ghost, Rom. 5.1.] and mercy namely, of God, which is the fountain from whence mans reconciliation and salvation flows] and upon the Israel of God. [that is, upon all true believers, who are true Israelites, and so acknowledged by God, which he adds to distinguish them from the Israelites according to the flesh. See Rom. 2.28,29. and 9.6. &c.]
\p
\v 17 . Henceforward let no man trouble me, [Namely, of these false Apostles, this he speaketh with an Apostolic authority to restrain their further willfulness] For I bear the makes of the Lord Jesus [namely, of the stripes, bands and wounds which I have received for the sake of Christ and his doctrine. Hereby he would shew that he feared no persecution, even as the false Apostles did. See 2 Cor. 11.23, etc.] in any body.
\p
\v 18 . The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [This is a salutation and wish, with which the apostle concludes his Epistles, as he testifueth himself, 2 Thes. 3.17. see also Rom. 16.24. 1Cor. 16.23 2 Cor. 13.13.] be with your spirit [that is, soul, mind] brethren. Amen
