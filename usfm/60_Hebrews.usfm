\mt2 THE EPISTLE OF THE APOSTLE PAUL TO THE
\mt HEBREWS
\p The Epistle of the Apostle Paul [Although some have doubted of the writer of this Epistle, and have ascribed it, or the translation of it out Hebrew, to Barnabas, some others to Luke or Clement, notwithstanding all ancient Greek writers, and also divers Latine, have constantly acknowledged this Epistle for Paul’s Epistle, as also almost all the superscriptions of the Greek Testaments, hold forth this title, and the Apostle Peter, 2 Pet. 3. 15. testifieth that the Apostle Paul had also according to his wisdom written to the Jews, unto whom he writes: which cannot with any probability be understood of any other Epistle then this. And it seems also by comparing Heb. 13. verse. 19. 23, with 2 Tim. 4. 16, 17. that he wrote this epistle to the Hebrews from Rome, when, after his first defense before the Emperor Nero, he had received hope of his releasment, and then thought shortly to come again unto Jerusalem, with Timothy to visit them, unto which visit this epistle seems to be a preparation.] to the Hebrews. [so the Apostle calls the Jews, because they were descended from Abraham, who is called an Hebrew Gen. 14. 13. even as they loved to be called by this name. See 2 Cor. 11. 22. Phil. 3. 5. wherefore also Paul here gives them the same. And some think that therefore Paul here useth the name of Hebrews, because he principally and in the first place writes to the Jews which dwelt at Jerusalem and there round about, who were especially called Hebrews, because they still used the Hebrew or Syriack tongue, opposed to those which dwelt among the Greeks, who are thus distinguished from each other Act. 6. 1. and 22. 2. Which some also think to be the cause why he hath not exprest his name in the beginning of the Epistle, and so be possessed with a prejudice, and not duly to weigh it, seeing they were made believe that Paul was an Enemy of the Law, as may be seen, Acts 21. 20, 21. which name nevertheless he sufficiently intimates in the end of the Epistle, when he makes mention of his imprisonment, and of Timothy, and the brethren of Italy, who daily come to visit him in his imprisonment at Rome.
\s THE ARGUMENT OF THIS EPISTLE
\p This epistle is a very excellent writing of the New Testament, wherein the excellence of the Person and of the Offices of Jesus Christ our Savior is described in a method usual with the Apostle Paul in almost all his epistles, and in a very divine stile unto the 19. verse of the 10. chapter From whence forward to the end of the epistle, several exhortations are propounded, serving for confirmation in the faith, and in a Christian conversation. As concerning the Person of Christ, thereof he treats in the two first chapters. In the first chapter he proves his true and eternal Godhead, with a declaration of his excellence above all Angels; in the second chapter he proves his true human nature which he assumed of the seed of Abraham for our Redemption. In the third and fourth chapters he speaks of his prophetical Office, and exalts that far above the office of the Prophet Moses, and shows that his doctrine is more worthy and powerful, and therefore must be taken heed to with greater carefulness. In the fifth chapter unto the end of the sixth chapter, serving to stir them up to attention and carefulness in holding fast this doctrine, he comes in the seventh chapter to declare the property of the kingly and priestly office of Christ, by continual comparison of Melchizedek and his offices unto the end of the chapter. In the eighth chapter he sets the excellence of the priestly office of Christ before our eyes, by comparing of the old covenant with the excellence of the new covenant, and finally from the beginning of the ninth chapter unto the nineteenth verse of the tenth chapter, he declares the properties and excellencies of the priestly office of Christ by a comparison with the office of the Priests of the old Testament, and especially with the office of the High-priest, aswell in his other administrations as in his yearly entrance in the holy of holies: and therewith concludes the handling of the first part of the Epistle. In the nineteenth verse of the tenth chapter he cometh to the second part of the Epistle and exhorts them in general to obedience and steadfastness in this propounded doctrine, notwithstanding their tribulations and his hands. Afterwards he treats of faith and the properties of faith through the whole eleventh chapter, and of the properties of Christian hope and patience in the twelfth chapter, and of several duties of love unto the twentieth verse of the thirteenth chapter, and from thence unto the end he concludes the epistle with an earnest prayer unto God for them, with a short exhortation and relation of Timothies releasment, and with the usual salutation.
\c 1
\s The Apostle testifieth that God indeed spoke formerly by the Prophets to the Fathers, but now unto us by his son. 2. Whose Deity, Majesty, and office he briefly describes. 4. Proves afterwards out of diver’s places of the old Testament that the glory of the son far excels the glory of the Angels. 8. That he hath a divine and eternal Throne, and that he is anointed above all his fellows. 10. Proves further that Heaven and earth were made by him, and shall have an end, but that he hath neither beginning nor end. 13. and that he only fitteth at the right hand of his Father, 14. but that all Angels are ministering spirits.
\p
\v 1 God [Namely, the Father, as appears by the name some which is exprest in the end of the verse] having in former times [namely, in the times of the old Testament] frequently [that is, at various seasons and opportunities Gr. In many parts] and variously [namely, by speeches, dreams, visions, apparitions, See Numb. 12. 6.] spoken to the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days [so the Apostle calls the time of the new Testament, because under the same there is no more alteration to be expected, but all things are to abide without adding or taking away, as was taught and ordained by Christ, until the last day. See also Joel 2. 28. Act 2. 17.] spoken unto us [namely, the Apostles, and other Hebrews, who have heard the word from his own mouth, and by whom the same is spread abroad throughout the whole world] by the Son: [Gr. In the Son, i.e. the proper and only begotten Son of the Father, manifested in the flesh, John 1. 14. For otherwise the Prophets were also children of God, and so are also all believers, Joh. 1. 12. 1 John 3. 1.]
\p
\v 2 . Whom he hath made heir of all things [this is right of being Lord and professor of all things the son of hath not only for that he created all things as the following word imports but he is also made of heir of all things for that he was chosen by the father from all eternity to be the mediator 1Peter 1.20 and was by him brought into the world when he caused him to assume the humane nature Luke 1.32 and 2.11 Hebrews 16 And finally when having accomplished the work of our redemption he exalted him unto his own right hand Ephesians 1.21,22 Philippians 2.9,10,11] by whom also he made the world [Gr the ages as Hebrews 11.3 that is the world with all that is therein John 1.3 Colossians 1.16which the apostolic adds to that which goeth before as the first reason why the father made an heir and Lord of all namely seeing he created all things by him whereupon the other reasons in the following verse follow taken from the glory of his person and equality with the father and from the preservation of all things.]
\p
\v 3 . Who being the splendor of his glory namely in whom the whole glory of the father that is his divine essence and divine properties perfectly are and as in an express image are set before our eyes which some understand as of Christ according to his humane nature in which by his doctrine , works and miracles are fully revealed unto us ,the wisdom, righteousness omnipotence and bottomless mercy of God as is also showed John 1.14,and 14.9,10,11 but considering that those titles are here given to the son of God as a creator and preserver of all things which belongs to him only according to his divine nature therefore these two titles must be understood of Christ forasmuch as he is the eternal son of God and a light from eternal light of one essence and glory with the father nevertheless distinguished from the subsistence of the father by whom the father executes his operations and shows his properties even as the sun by its light doth shine ] and the express image [or impression because of the person of the son perfectly represents the person of the father as an impression doth the seal wherefore he is also called the image of the invisible God Colossians 1.15] of his subsistence [Gr hypostacos that is subsistence or person whereby is understood the person off the father as he is distinct from the son and subsists himself and in himself and is as the original of the person of the son by eternal and ineffable generation see Proverbs 8.22 c Micah 5.1 John 1 verse 14.18] and ears all things [that is support or preserves causeth to subsist Colossians 1.17] by the word of his power [that is by his almighty will or command Psalms 33.9 ] after that he by himself accomplished the purification of our sins [this is a new reason why the son of God is made heir and Lord of all things namely because he accomplished the purification of our sins when now he hath assumed the flesh and offered up himself unblameable to his father through the eternal spirit and as our only high priest and therefore is set at the right hand of God as our everlasting King whereof in the fifth and the following chapters will be treated more at large ]set at the right hand of the majesty in the highest heavens [ the exposition hereof see on 1Corinthians 15.25 Ephesians 1.20 and elsewhere.]
\p
\v 4 . Being become so much more excellent then the angels as he hath inherited[ namely according to his divine nature by his eternal generation of the father with which the human nature is united in unity of person for Christ is but one son in which the se two natures subsists ]a more excellent name above them [Gr a more different or more divers name that is more worthy or more excellent see after chapter 8.6 which name is the name of the son as the following verse shows]
\p
\v 5 . For unto whom of the angels did he ever say thou art my son [namely my proper and natural son for otherwise the angels also are children of God in respect that they were created by God and after his own image and adopted to be children see Job 1.6 Psalms 89.7] today [ that is from eternities which is called today because in eternity there is neither beginning nor end but a duration which is always present others understand it in the time of which eternal generation was manifested in the world ] I have begotten thee ? [or born namely by eternal supernatural and comprehensible generation for he speaks of such a birth in which manner no angels nor man were brought forth but only the son wherefore he is also called the only begotten of the father Job.1.18 and the proper son of God Romans 8.32 this place is also applied to resurrection from the dead Acts 13.33 because then he was powerfully showed to be the son of God as Paul speaks Romans 1.4] and again I will be for a father to him and he shall be to me for a son ?[ these words are indeed uttered for Solomon as a type of Christ who should build a temple for Jerusalem but principally understood as Christ Jesus as thing signifies who alone built the spiritual temple that is the church of God and the Lord thereof as the apostle hereafter chapter 3,4,5,6 testifieth and who only hath a kingdom without end as the angel declares Luke 1.32,33]
\p
\v 6 . And when again he bringeth the first born into the world [namely in the 97 Psalms were there is a description of the coming of the Lord into the world to set up a kingdom which was fulfilled when Christ became men and dwelt amongst us full of grace and glory Job 1.14when also the multitude of the heavenly host worshipped him and magnified his name Luke 2.13 &c] he saith and let all the angels of God worship him.
\p
\v 7 . And unto the angels [or of the angels of Hebraism see Genesis 20.2 Isaiah 41.7] he saith indeed who maketh his angel spirit [that is as spirit or swiftly to obey him ] and he minister a flame of fire and lightning to execute his commands powerfully ]
\p
\v 8 . But unto the son he saith[ or of the son as Revelation 7]thy throne O God is to all eternity [these words in the 45 Psalm must be necessarily be understood of Christ the true bridegroom and king of his church for that the Jews they must be understood of Solomon is absurd for as much as Solomon is nowhere called God neither was his throne eternal but endured only forty years and his scepter nor the scepter of his successors was not always a scepter of righteousness seeing here were many faults and iniquities in the government of him and of his successors as the books of the king testify and it is not probable that the marriage of Solomon and the daughter of Pharaoh must continually be praised and sung in church of God as the superscription of Psalms imports which is so clear that the Jewish Rabbins themselves acknowledge that this Psalm must be understood of Messiahs but the authority of the apostle is here sufficient and beyond all contradictions by the throne is understood the glory and by the scepter the power of his government ]the scepter of the kingdom is the right scepter [that is a scepter of right or righteousness where no crookedness or injustice hath no place .]
\p
\v 9 . Thou hast loved hated iniquity therefore O God thy God [see the annotate on John 20.17] hath anointed thee [namely with the holy ghost which he hath received without measure in his humane nature John 3.34]with oil of gladness [so the gifts of the holy ghosts are called because they make the hearts of men cheerful and joyful in God and ready and willing to their calling Acts 10.38]above thy fellows [that is thy brethren or other children of God of whom Christ is the first born for all the members of Christ’s body that is of his church are partakers of one-self spirit with Christ yet so that the fullness of gifts is in Christ the head but in the other members according to the measure of the gifts of Christ see 1John1.16 Ephesians 4.7.]
\p
\v 10 . And [namely to or of the son of faith as verse 8 which words the apostle here testifieth that they are spoken of son of God as also the scope of the Psalm shows seeing there speaks of the restoration of the kingdom of God and of the enlarging of the same among the Gentiles both which were done by Christ Psalms 102.14 &c]thou Lord in the beginning [namely of a creation of all things as Genesis 1.1 John 1.1 ]hast founded the earth and heavens are works of thy hands.
\p
\v 11 . The same shall perish but thou ablest always [namely from everlasting without change as it is also testified of Christ Revelations 1.8 and 22.13 see also Hebrews 13.8] and they all shall wax old, even as a garment.
\p
\v 12 . And as a covering shall thou roll them together [namely that is put about somewhat to covet and preserve something against rain,wind and heat which when it is used enough is wont to be rolled up and to be laid aside ]they shalt be changed [see 2 Peter 3.10] but thou art the same and thy years shall not cease.
\p
\v 13 . And unto which of the angels did he ever say sit at my right hand [see hereof verse 3 and the annotate on 1Corinthians 15 verse 24, 25] until I shall have thine enemies a foot of thy feet?
\p
\v 14 . Are they not all ministering spirits [or serviceable that is which are always at Gods service or stand ready before him minister see Isaiah 6.2 Ezekiel 10.1,8 Daniel 7.10 Zachariah 1.8 &c Revelations 5.15cwhich are sent forth for ministry [namely by God and by Jesus Christ himself Revelations 1.1 &c here is none therefore of angels expected which are not sent forth by God for the service of the faithful as some think] for the sake of those who shall inherit salvation.
\c 2
\s From the doctrine of the excellence of the person of Christ propounded in the former chapter the apostle here draws a caution that then we must be careful to take good heed to his word 5 afterwards proceeds and shows first the meanness and afterwards the dignity of the man-hood of Christ by a place out of the eight Psalm 8 And applies it to Christ 11 proves out of yet other places of the old testament that he is partaker of one and the same nature and affection with us 16 and not with the angels 17 and that for the end that he might be a faithful and merciful high priest for us.
\p
\v 1 Therefore [that is forasmuch as we have now proved how excellent the person of Christ is of whom we speak ]we must the more attend to that which is heard by us lest at anytime we run out [ this is by some understood of the word which we have heard and we must take care that the same in us do not run out or leak through as is wont to come to pass in forgetful hearers by others it is understood of the persons themselves who are laid to run out when like water that runs out they perish or are lost out see 2 Samuel 14.14 Psalms 58.8.]
\p
\v 2 . For if the word spoken by angels [whereby are understood all the revelations which God in the old testament made to the prophets by the angels especially also the giving of the law which was indeed given by God himself nevertheless by the ministry of the angels as Stephen testifies Acts 7.53 and Paul Galatians 3.19]was firm and every transgression and disobedience received just recompense [Gr just recompense of reward namely of punishment which therefore came upon them see some examples thereof 1Corinthians 10.5 &c]
\p
\v 3 . How shall we escape [namely the just recompense of punishment ]if we regard not so great salvation whereby is understood the gospel which is also called a ministry of those spirit and of life whereas the law is killing letter whereof see the exposition on 2 Corinthians 3.6,7]which being begun to be published [Gr having taken to be spoken ] by the Lord [namely Jesus Christ when the days of his flesh he preached amongst us as a minister of circumcision ]was confirmed to us [that is more and more strengthened ]by them that heard him [from hence some would conclude that Paul wrote not this epistle forasmuch as he heard the gospel and was called to be an apostle not by men but by Christ himself 2 Corinthians 12.4 &c Galatians 1.1 and 2.6 but this is a very weak argument seeing the apostle by a figurative manner of speaking often includes themselves in exhortation although they do not properly concern them as is done several times in these three foregoing verses see also a notable example 1Corinthians 10.8,9 1Peter 4.3 moreover although Paul learned the doctrine of the gospel from none but Christ nevertheless he was confirmed therein by Ananias acts 9.17 and by mutual treating with the other apostle as the other apostles also by discoursing with him as he himself testifies at large Galatians 2.2 &c]
\p
\v 4 . God moreover testifying together with them [namely with the apostle and evangelists who published the gospel unto us see Mark 16.20] by signs and wonders and manifold mighty works and dispensation of the holy ghost according to his will.
\p
\v 5 . For he hath not subjected to his Angels [after the end of the inserted exhortation the apostle comes again to the declaration of the doctrine as these words cohere with the end of the foregoing chapter where he had said that God the father had subjected all things under the feet of Christ and so proceeds to the declaration of the humiliation and exaltations of manhood of Christ ]the world to come [that is of whose coming or the state the prophets spoke so much as whereof David speaks in the place alleged Psalms 110. which world is called to come in respect of God’s promises in the old testament and of the rectifying of all things which by Christ sitting at right hand of his father was begun through the whole world and the last day shall finished ] of which we speak.
\p
\v 6 . But one testified somewhere [namely who is sufficiently known to wit the prophet David in the 8. Psalm]saying what is man[this place Psalms 8.5 some think is here only by some accommodation of the words of David interrupted of Christ although they be spoken by David in another sense as that is often done by many writers and whereof there are examples Romans 10 verse 5,18 for that which is spoken of one thing or person may also truly be spoken of another by way of comparison much more then may this be done inspiration of the holy ghost but seeing the apostle brings in this place also as spoken of Christ 1Corinthians 15.27 Ephesians 1.22 and there also here takes a proof out of the same of that which he would teach concerning Christ therefore it must be necessarily be uttered by David also for that end for which the apostle quotes it for albeit that David in the first respect seemeth there to speak of man and his dignity in general above other creatures not withstanding by seeing the first man by his disobedience immediately lost this dignity and for that cause hath no more right thereunto by nature wherefore also many creatures have withdrawn themselves from his obedience yea are become enemies to him therefore the prophets looked higher namely unto Christ and the restitution of man unto Christ who hath received a complete authority and power over all creatures great and small even over angels in heaven and all the beast on earth Ephesians 1.20,2122 Philippians 2.9,10 whereof the angels themselves ministered unto him when he walked here unto the flesh and the fishes in the sea and other beasts were subject unto him as an absolute Lord even as example show and occur everywhere in the gospel see Matthew 8.31 and chapter 21 verse 2 Luke 5.6 John 21.6 of which dignity also all that believe in Christ are now again made partakers 1 Corinthians 3.22 Ephesians 2.6 &c] that thou remembers him ? [this word remembers as also the following visistest or observest respect as well Christ’s state of humiliation from whence he was exalted as the miserable state of man whereunto he fell by sin wherein God with his merciful eyes as it were looked upon him and graciously proposed to bring him into a better estate as this phrase everywhere imports thus much see Genesis 8.1 and chapter 21.1 Ezekiel 16.4&c] or the son of man that thou visitest him ?
\p
\v 7 . Thou madest him a little lesser [or a little while as verse 9 also for the word signifies both and this is by the apostle interpreted of believers as especially of Christ their head because they are here indeed a little or a little while after lesser then the angels even as Christ also was in the state of humiliation in the eyes of men, but by Christ they shall be like the angels in the world to come Matthew 22.30 and the Christ their head even according to the humanity after his ascension was exalted far above all angels as the scripture testifies everywhere ]then the angels with glory and honor hast thou crowned him and thou set him over the works of thine hands.
\p
\v 8 . All things hast thou subjected under his feet for that he had subjected all things to him he hath left nothing [no not the angels themselves then ]that is not subject unto him but now we see not yet that all things are subject unto him but now wee see not yet that all things re subject unto him [by these words of the apostle proves that this place must first and chiefly be understood of Christ seeing in no other man in the world hath yet been fulfilled in all things.]
\p
\v 9 . But we see Jesus crowned with glory and honor[that is we know and believe out of Gods words and have experienced it in the governing of his church that now in Jesus this was all fulfilled and that therefore it shall be fulfilled in his members also in due time according to their measure as is expressed in the following verse [who was become a little lesser then the angels by reason of the suffering of death [that is because he must suffer death or by suffering of death see Luke 24.26 ]that he by grace of God should taste death [that is suffer as Christ himself compares his suffering to a cup Matthew 16.28 Mark 9.1 Luke 9.27 john 8.52]for all [namely his members or brethren whom he should make partakers of his glory as John 10.11 Romans 8.33,34 &c.]
\p
\v 10 . For it is become him [namely God the father as Romans 11.36] for whom all things are and by whom all things are that he bringing many children [Gr sons of whom Christ is called the first born to whose image the other must be confirmed Romans 8.29] to glory [that is to the communion of the glory of his son whereof he had spoken in the former verse] should consecrate [Gr teleiosai which properly signifies to perfect sometimes consecrate or inaugurate which signification may here be applied to Christ although the word consecrate is here retained because Christ thus expounds this word of himself John 17.19 and the following verse also imports this and by this word consecrate is here understood that the father ordained that Christ by his obedience even unto the death of the cross should enter into his glory and make us also fit for him ]the chief leader[that is author or cause as hereafter chapter 5.9 and Acts 3.15 he nameth him ]of their salvation by suffering
\p
\v 11 . For both he hath sanctifieth and they that are sanctified [this rule is taken from the manner of consecrating in the old testament where the high priest and the others whom he consecrated were of one and the same nature and original where also the first fruits were of one nature and original with the whole mass which was consecrated thereby see Romans 11.16 Hebrews 5.1]are all of one [the Greek word benos that is one may either signify one father or one masse and nature but considering that the angels have one common father and the believers namely God and the apostle would here prove that Christ hath a communion with believers which he hath not with the angels the word one must here of necessary be understood of unity in nature even as the first fruits and the whole masse were of one nature ]for which causeth he [namely the son of God or the leader of their salvation ]is not ashamed [that is disdained not namely although he be incomparable more worthy then they are] to call them brethren.
\p
\v 12 . Saying [namely in the 22 Psalm which Psalm is a continual history of Christ suffering as it was therefore always sung before the morning sacrifice according to the superscription of the Psalm for a declaration of the thing signified by his suffering and therefore they are more places rehearsed by the evangelist when they treat of the suffering of Christ out of this Psalm then out of the old testament ]I will publish thy name unto the my brethren in the midst of the church will sing praise unto thee.
\p
\v 13 . And again I will put my trust in him [by this place taken out of Psalm 18.3 the apostle proves that Christ is partaker of one kind of affection of the mind and consequently of one kind of nature with believers ]and again behold I and the children [this place is taken out of Isaiah 8.18 where Christ the true Emmanuel speaketh to the prophet and comforts him in his suffering by his own example nd that of gods children who were always subject to the like troubles as that whole chapter from the eight verse and so forward is a prophecy of Christ which God hath given me [namely out of the world to sanctify myself for them see John 17.6 &c.]
\p
\v 14 . forasmuch as the children [namely whereof Isaiah speaketh in true believers who are born of God and members of Christ ]are partakers of the flesh and blood[that is consists of flesh and blood or are partakers of the frail humane nature as 1 Corinthians 15.50 ] he also in like manner became partaker of the same [ that is assumed the same into unity of his person as he speaks afterwards verse 16 and Philippians 2.7] that by death his power or tyranny over the children of God ]him who had the power of death [namely by sin whereunto he had brought men and under which he still detained because of which sin man subjected to a cursed death see Romans 5.12 and 1Corinthians 15.56]that is the Divel [namely with all his angels as Christ speaks Matthew 25.41 for under this prince al that are under him are comprehended .]
\p
\v 15 . And might deliver all things who through fear of death [that is of a eternal or cursed death which fear necessarily seizeth upon all sinful men until they be assured of their redemption see Luke 1.74] al their long were subject to bondage as he speaks Romans 8.15 ]
\p
\v 16 . For verily he assumeth not the angels [that is the scripture no where saith that he should assume the angels but the seed of Abraham Genesis 12.3and 22.18and this actually appeared also in his becoming a man ]but he assumeth the seed of Abraham [that is the human nature of the seed of Abraham for that some expound the word assume by help it is absurd seeing the good angels have no need to deliverance forasmuch as they have not sinned .]
\p
\v 17 . Wherefore he must in all things [namely excepting sin as the apostle adds Hebrews 4.15] be like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the things which were to be done by God [namely to reconcile man unto God ] to expiate the sins of the people.
\p
\v 18 . For that he himself suffered being tempted [namely in the state of humiliation with all manner of suffering and trouble ] he can be helpful to those that are tempted [namely the better seeing he hath also had experienced of the same and therefore is affected with a greater compassion towards them.]
\c 3
\s The apostle goes unto the offices of Christ especially the priestly office between both speaking of his kingly office and beginneth from the prophetical office teaching that they must be obedient unto the word 2 compares Christ with Moses and declareth the he is so much greater than Moses as the builder of the house is greater than the house 5. And as the son of the house is greater than the servant7 strengthens his exhortation with a like exhortation of David to the Israelites out of the 95 Psalm 12 and warns the Hebrews that they are not also harden with their hearts 14 but continue steadfast in the faith 15 interpreteth the recited place of the Psalm and applies it to the Hebrew 17. and warns them not to follow the example of their disobedience if they be not partakers of their punishments.
\p
\v 1 For this cause [namely seeing we have understood that Christ is true God and is made partaker of one nature with us as is proved in the former chapters ]holy brethren who are partakers of the heavenly calling [that is which is from heaven Philippians 3.14 and exhorteth and bringeth us unto heavenly things 2Thesallonians 2.14 and so he distinguisheth the believing Jews from the unbelieving and stiff-necked ] observe[ so that ye continue obedient unto him the Greek word signifieth an offering with great attention ] the apostle [that is ambassador of the father to reveal us the counsel of God concerning our salvation see John 20.21] and high priest[namely to reconcile us unto God of which office he will treat more at large in the fifth and the following chapters ] of our profession [that is of the doctrine of the gospel whereof we make profession ] Christ Jesus
\p
\v 2 . Who is faithful to him that appointed him [Gr that made him namely an apostle prophet and high priest see 1 Samuel 12.6 Acts 2.36] even as Moses also was in his whole house [that is his church which is called the house of god because he dwells in the same by his word grace and spirit see Matthew 18.20 1Timothy 3.15]
\p
\v 3 . for this man [namely Christ the apostle and high priest of our profession ]was counted worthy of so much greater glory then Moses as he built [or furnished prepared ]the house hath greater honor then the house [ namely that is built by him namely his church whereof Moses was a member ]
\p
\v 4 . For every house is built by some man but he hath built all this [that is accomplished what belongeth to the welfare of his church ]is God [ from whence then necessarily followeth that Christ is also the true God who built all this as he hath testifieth in the third verse ]
\p
\v 5 . And Moses indeed was faithful in his whole house as a servant for testifying [or for a testimony this the apostle saith of the predictions and ceremonies of the old testament which were propounded by Moses and the prophets and afterwards by Christ and more largely expounded as Moses himself testifieth Deuteronomy 18.15] of the things which afterwards should be spoken .
\p
\v 6 . But Christ as the son [that is as the proper son and heir for otherwise Moses was a son of God by faith ] over his own house whose house are[that is church or of his household as verse 2] if we do but hold hast courage [that is faith and confidence in Christ whereby we have a bold access unto God as an unto our father see afterwards chapter 10.22 and Romans 8.15 &c] and the glory of hope [that is hope whereby we dare to boast of Gods favor and our future glory Romans 5.2,3.] unto the end.
\p
\v 7 Therefore as the holy ghost saith [namely by the mouth of the prophet David as is added Acts 1.16 see also 2 Samuel 23.2 and 2 Peter 1.21] today if ye hear [or will hear whereby the prophet sheweth that he doth not understand this of his voice who spoke then of yet another voice namely of the Messiah who afterwards should yet speak unto them ] his voice [namely Gods or Messiahs voice whereby God should also speak unto them Hebrews 1.1.]
\p
\v 8 . Harden not your hearts [men are said to harden their hearts when they take not the Lords voice to heart or let it not enter into the hearts to believe and obey it see zach7.11 &c] as it came to pass in the provocation [that is in the time of provocation when the Israelites by their rebellion provoked God which was done divers times of forty years but especially Exodus 17.7 Numbers 20.17]in the day of temptation when they tempted me in the wilderness and the apostle propounds this example unto them because they always boasted of their forefathers ] in the wilderness:
\p
\v 9 . Where your fathers tempted me [man is said to tempt God when he willfully calls Gods promises or power into question or despised the ordinary means of Gods government and desired extraordinary as the Israelites here did & the Pharisees tempt Christ Matthew 16.1]they proved me [ some take this for an explication of the former word tempt but is by others taken in good part for having sufficient proof or experience of Gods power and good will in delivering them and feeding them all that foregoing as the following words also imports the sense ] and saw my works for forty years .
\p
\v 10 . Therefore I was wrath with that generation and said they always ere either the heart [that is turn away from me a erring men and from the obedience which they owe me] and they have not known [that is not laid to heart or not sought to hold them in their knowledge duly to acknowledge and observe them] my ways [that is my commandments which I have given them and my benefits which I have done them.]
\p
\v 11 . So then I swear in my wrath if they shall enter [a form of taking an oath usual with the Hebrews see mark 8.12 that is that they shall not enter ] into my rest [so the Canaan is here called because it was an end of wanderings of the Israelites in the wilderness & is here with all propounded as a type of the rest to come after this life in eternal life as Paul in the following chapter will further declare ]
\p
\v 12 Take heed brethren [so he here calls the Hebrews who made profession of Christ and exhorts them now in particular to take heed that they did not follow the greater part of the stiff-necked Jews as many of their fathers had done in the wilderness and therefore were excluded out of the rest of the land of Canaan ] lest at any time there be in any of you a wicked unbelieving heart [Gr a wicked heart of unbelief that is that under a show of being a Christian nevertheless is unbelieving and consequently easily to be brought to apostasy from his profession see Matthew 13 verse 20,21] to turn away from the living God
\p
\v 13 . But exhorts one another everyday [namely to steadfastness and increasing in faith it may also be translated exhort yourself but the following words lest any one of you seem to require the first translation as this Greek word heautous is also taken Ephesians 4.32 Colossians 3.16 1Thessalonians 5.13] whilst it is called today [that is whilst the Lord gives you time and opportunity for it and called you thereunto which calling we must take heed to for otherwise the Lord by his justice often times sends a power of error upon men who obey not the gospel for a punishment of their unthankful ness see 2Thessalonians 2.11,12] lest anyone of you of you should be hardened the seduction of sin .
\p
\v 14 . For we are become partakers of Christ [or Christ’s partners namely his heavenly inheritance Romans 8.17 1Peter 1.3,4] if so he e retain from the beginning of this firm ground [Gr hypostaseous that is subsistence so he calleth faith and firm confidence in Christ because the same confirms Gods promises to us and causeth them to subsist in us the like signification of this word see 2 Corinthians 9.4 and chapter 11.17 and hereafter chapter 11 verse 1 although the same word before chapter 1.3 be taken in another sense ]even unto the end.
\p
\v 15 . While it is said [namely unto you also by the spirit of Christ and his messengers as in former time it was said by Moses to your fathers ] today if ye hear his voice harden not your heart as was done in the provocation
\p
\v 16 . For some when they had heard the same provoked him yet not all went out of Egypt by Moses [namely as Joshua Caleb many Levites and others which the apostle adds to show that God always kept his remnant among the people and therefore will also preserve he like among them not withstanding the hardening of many.]
\p
\v 17 Now to whom he was wroth forty years was is not with those that had sinned ?[ that is had murmured against God and were become backsliders from him ] whose bodies [Gr members not that all that died in the wilderness were thereupon necessarily excluded out of heaven for Aaron and Moses died there also but they that died therein without amendment and sorrow after that they had tempted God were of exclusion out of the promised land was but a type ]fell in wilderness?
\p
\v 18 . And to whom did he wear that they should not enter into the rest but to them who had been disobedient?
\p
\v 19 . And we see that they were not able to enter by reason of their unbelief [that is because they trusted not in Gods promises but murmured against him without repentance.]
\c 4
\s 1. The Apostle proceeds in the exhortation unto obedience of the Gospel, and warns them by foregoing example of the Israelites, who because of their unbelief, entered not into the rest of God. 4. Proveth that the place in the 95. Psalm cannot be understood of the rest of the seventh day. 6. Nor of the rest in the land of Canaan. 9. But of another rest which was signified by the foregoing. 12. Strengthens his exhortation by a description of the piercing force of Gods word. 13. And of Christ’s omniscience. 14. And forasmuch as Christ is the son of God, and a great and faithful high Priest. 16. Therefore he exhorts them that with firm confidence they should betake themselves to him for refuge.
\p
\v 1 Let us therefore fear, [That is, with carefulness observe it, See Phil. 2. 12. which is not repugnant to a firm confidence in Christ, as appears ver. 16] lest at any time the promise of entering into his rest being left behind, [that is, being yet left remaining unto us. Others take the word leave behind for forsake or not take heed to: but the first Translation agrees as well with the following verse] any of you should seem to have fallen short behind, [that is, not to have come to the end or goal which was set before him: a similitude taken from the Israelites in the wilderness, who had indeed left Egypt to travel towards the land Canaan, but were hindered by their unbelief that they came not thereunto. Or to be repelled from it, that we must go without it.]
\p
\v 2 . For unto us also was the Gospel published, even as unto them, [Namely, in the times of Moses and David, of whom he had spoken before. From whence it appears that salvation was imparted to no man in the old Testament, but by the doctrine of the Gospel. See also Joh. 8. 56. Act. 15. 10, 11. Heb. 11.] but the word of preaching, [Gr. Of hearing, i.e. of preaching whereby the hearing of the word cometh, as Isa. 53. 1. Rom. 10. 16.] brought them no profit, seeing it was not mixed with faith [that is, joined, accompanied, as things which men mix are joined one with another] in them which heard it.
\p
\v 3 . For we that believe have entrance into the rest, [Namely, whereof David speaketh Psal. 95. and the Apostle afterwards ver. 9. 10.] even as he said, [namely, not in express terms, but by a necessary consequence. For if God swears that unbelievers shall not enter into God’s rest, then on the contrary he promiseth that believers shall enter in] So then I swear in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: [See before chapter 3. 11.] Although [Or, whereas, notwithstanding : and the Apostle would thereby prove, that elsewhere in the scripture a two-fold rest is indeed spoken of, namely of the Sabbath day, and of the land of Canaan, but that David in the 95. Psa. Speaks not properly of either of these two, but of another rest which was signified by these two, and stood yet open to believers. The reason whereby the Apostle proves that is, because God’s rest on the Sabbath after the creation of all things was so long, namely about three thousand years past, and that the Israelites long before, namely about four hundred years, were by Joshua brought into the rest whereunto believers were yet daily invited, as he proves by the word to day, and which therefore was yet reserved and kept open of them, as he concludes in the 9. vers.] (his) works were accomplished [Gr. Were made or done. For in six days God created heaven and earth, and rested from it on the seventh day] from the foundation of the world.
\p
\v 4 . For he spoke somewhere [Namely, Gen. 2. 2. Exod. 20. 11.] of the seventh day God rested [that is, ceased from producing new sorts of creatures. For God is not wearied nor tired, Isa. 40. 28. therefore he needs no such rest against it] from all his works [namely, which he had purposed to create. For from the preservation of all things, and restitution of that which decayeth therein, God never resteth, Psal. 104. 13. & c. Joh. 5. 17. Acts 17. 25. & c.]
\p
\v 5 . And in this (place) again, [Namely, the 95. Psalm, which is spoken of in that which goes before] if they shall enter into my rest.
\p
\v 6 . Seeing then it remaineth [Namely, by a necessary consequence, as is noted on the third verse,] that some do enter into that (rest) and they to whom the Gospel was first published, [namely, by Moses in the wilderness, as is noted on the second verse] entered not in by reason of disobedience:
\p
\v 7 . He setteth again a certain day, [Namely, God the Holy Ghost, as is expressed, chapter 3. 7.] (namely) today, saying by David [Gr. In David: i.e. in the Psalms of David, or by David, as this word in is also taken, Rom. 9. 25.] so long time after [namely, that the Israelites were delivered out of Egypt, and come into the land of Canaan] (like as it is said) Today if ye hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
\p
\v 8 . For if Jesus [That is, Joshua the son of Nun, who brought the children of Israel into the land of Canaan was also a place of rest for the Israelites, yet their chief good consisted not in it, but it was only a shadow of this last and spiritual rest, and therefore they must also give diligence by faith to come thereunto] he had not afterward spoken of another day.
\p
\v 9 . There remaineth therefore a rest [Gr. Sabbatism, i.e. rest, namely, besides the rest of the land of Canaan, and of the Seventh day, which is Spiritual and eternal rest, which is signified hereby, and which he describes in the following verse] for the people of God: [that is, for true believers, which are the true Israelites and children of the promise.]
\p
\v 10 . For he [By the word he is understood every one of the faithful, who are said to enter into God’s rest, when they here rest from the fulfilling of the works of the flesh, and hereafter shall fully rest from all their labour, Rev. 14. 13. of which rest the Sabbath is here also considered as a Sacramental sign and figure] that is entered into his rest, he himself also hath rested from his works, even as God did from his own.
\p
\v 11 . Let us then give diligence to enter into that rest, [Namely, by a Steadfast faith, as the following words import] lest any man fall in that same example [That is, be an example of disobedience, as our Fathers were in the wilderness. Others take the word fall for perish] of unbelief. [or disobedience.]
\p
\v 12 . For the word of God [Some understand this of Christ, who is called the word of God, Joh. 1. 1. Rev. 19. 13. and the whole description which followeth also agrees well therewith. But seeing Paul in his other writings doth not call the person of Christ by this name, it may here be more fitly taken for the word of the Gospel, the power whereof is elsewhere also described. See Rom. 1. 16. 2 Cor. 3. 8, 9. 1 Pet. 1. 23, 25] is lively and powerful, [namely, by the operation of the holy Ghost, who thereby manifests this life and power in our hearts ] and sharper than any two edged sword [Gr above every two edged sword that hath two mouths and bites or cuts on two sides as sharp sword is said to go forth of Christ mouth Revelations 19.15 see also Isaiah 11.4 and Ephesians 6.17 whereby by a similitude is given to understand that by Gods words on one side breaks the heart by conviction of sins and punishments which man hath deserved and on the other sides purifieth the heart and kills sinful lusts that we may live from henceforward unto Christ see the example Acts 2.37,38] and goeth through unto the dividing of the soul and of the spirit [that is unto most inward motions of the will and of the understanding of man see also 1Thessalonians 5.23] and of the joints and of the marrow that is of that which seems there to be most secret in man as are the marrow and the joining together of the members ] and is a judger of thoughts and of the reasoning of the heart because men being informed and admonished by Gods words excused or accuseth himself before Gods judge and therefore humbles himself before God or else is encouraged to the throne of his grace see 1 Corinthians 14.24,25]
\p
\v 13 . and there is no creature invisible before him [namely God verse 12 with whom we have to do as the same member exprest so then here he ariseth from the word of God unto God himself who is a knower and judger of all and it is a new reason why we must give good heed to his word seeing this word hath such power over our souls from him that knoweth and judgeth all things ]but all things are necked and opened [the Greek word signifieth to open the neck or throat that we may see the parts or inward members which are in the breast as the priest were wont to open the breast of the beast which were offered from the neck and downward to see if all parts therein were clean ]before the eyes of him with whom we have to do [or to whom we must give an account or unto whom we speak namely in our prayers Gr of whom we have the word or speak namely in our discourse.]
\p
\v 14 . Seeing then e have a high great priest [here the apostle concludes the treating of Christ prophetical office and goes forward to his priestly and kingly office even as he presently ascribes a throne to him also and compares him to Melchizedek and calleth him a great high priest of the old testament which were but the shadows of Christ priestly office as shall be more likely declared in the five following chapters] who is gone through [namely even into the third heaven which is the throne of God and the glorious habitation of the angels and spirits which was signified by the holy of holies as is declared chapter 9.24 see also 2Corithians 5.8 and chapter 12.1,4] the heavens [namely which are visible ]namely Jesus the son of God let us hold fast this profession [that is by a true faith constantly profess the doctrine this so great an high priest not withstanding all troubles and persecutions which might come upon us thereby ]
\p
\v 15 . For we have not an High priest who cannot have compassion of our infirmities but who was tempted in all things [namely not only man is subjected unto in this life but also even in this life but also even to the troubles and punishments which by sin were added thereunto sin itself excepted which was to be done away by obedience, holiness, and righteousness ]even as we [Gr according to the similitude ] yet without sin.
\p
\v 16 Let us therefore with boldness go unto the throne of grace [namely which God hath now erected in Christ and the apostle seems here to have respected to the mercy seat which was upon the Ark of the covenant whereby the tables off the law which required exactest obedience or punishment in the first covenant were covered as Christ also is called Romans 3.25 ] that we may obtain mercy and find grace to be helper [Gr for timely help or for help at the fit time ] at the fit time [namely when it is a furtherance or necessary to our salvation.]
\c 5
\s The apostle having declared the prophetical office of Christ proceeds in declaring of his priestly office and reherseth the properties which are necessary in an high priest 4 even as he must be lawfully called thereunto 5 testifieth that Christ was by his father called thereunto after the order of Mechilzedeck 7 and that he in the days of his flesh offered prayers and supplications 9 and so became a cause of our salvation and an high priest 1 of which mystery of Mechelzedeck seeing he would treat more at large be stirs up their hearts thereunto 12 for as much as many of them were yet much inexperienced and had more need of milk as children and then meat as strong men grown.
\p
\v 1 For every high priest [namely as they were who lawful priest of posterity of Aaron for Paul wrote this epistle while this temple stood and alludes to the manner of doing which was then yet sufficiently known ]taken out of men is appointed for men [that is for man sake for their benefit and service to reconcile men to God or to procure some benefits from God ] in the things which are to be done with God that he should offer gifts and sacrifices for sins [by this first fort are understood the offering which were offered as fruit and such like things by the seconds offerings of cattle and beast which slain at the altar and so offered ]
\p
\v 2 . Who can have due compassion [or moderate that is due measure the Greek word Metriopathein properly signifies to have compassion in measure or according to measure that is as much as is needful to help him that hath need of it ]on the ignorant and the erring [that is sinners an Hebrew phrase and by the first is understood the sin which is committed out with ignorance or weakness of the understanding by the second the sin whereunto a man falls by reason he seduceth or gives away to himself and not without his own will proceed to sin although they be error with it when the understanding is darkened by the lust James 1.14,15 against both God ordained sacrifices of expiation see Levit chapter 4,5,6 but not for the willful sin against the holy ghost see Hebrews 10.26,27] for as much as he himself is compassed with infirmity [that is with sin as the following verse shows wherein Christ was unlike to the other high priest seeing indeed that he himself is like tempted in all manner yet without sin see Hebrews 4.15 and chapter 7.26,27]
\p
\v 3 And for the same infirmity sake must he [Gr he ought ]as for the people so also for himself [see hereof Leviticus 4.3 and 9.7 and 16.6 when once a year he went into the holy of holies and offered first for his two sins afterwards for the sins of people and when he himself had committed any scandalous sin ]offer for sins.
\p
\v 4 . And o ma assumeth this honor [namely to be high priest he speaketh of them that were lawful priests ]to himself [namely without a foregoing call] but he that is called of God in like manner as Aaron.
\p
\v 5 . So also Christ glorified not himself to be the high priest but he that spoke unto him [that is God his father namely exalted him hereunto] thou art my son today I have begotten thee [some think that by these words is only described the person off the father who exalted the son into priestly office that the proof therefore followeth only in the sixth verse following others understands that arguments are always contained in this first verse that the father lawfully made him an high priest first in the words which follow therein the Psalm desire of me c forasmuch as this is the proper work for a priest to pray for the people as also in the word my son forasmuch as the first born son before the institution of the Levitical priesthood ordinarily administered the priesthood in the families after the death of their fathers see Genesis 25.31and chiefly in the words begotten by me this day whereby although the eternal generation of the son by father be especially understood Hebrews 1.5 yet they are also fitly applied by Paul to the manifestation of the same which was made in time principally by his resurrection from the dead Acts 13.33 which is a clear demonstration that he was lawfully made a mediator by the father and consequently also an high priest. ]
\p
\v 6 . As he also saith in the another place [namely in the 110 Psalm which Christ also interprets of the Messiah Matthew 22.44,45] thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedeck [that is after the manner and similitude of Melchizedeck as is declared chapter 7.15]
\p
\v 7 . Who in the days of his flesh [that is when he had assumed our frail nature therein walked and suffered among us although he have our nature in heaven also yet notwithstanding he had put off the infirmities thereof ]having offered [that is proposed to his father and having offered up his life for us into the hands of his father] prayers and supplications unto him who could deliver him from death unto strong crying and tears [the apostle hath here respect indeed unto the whole humiliation of Christ but principally unto the anguish and extreme distress of Christ in the garden when he sweat drops of blood and to his strong crying on the cross when he cried my God ,my God why hast thou forsaken me/] and being heard out of his fear [Gr Eulabeiase which word often signifieth fear as may be seen Acts 23.10 and is the same which Mark chapter 14.33 calls thambos and ademonian that is amazement and great anguish which was in Christ humane nature that is from the foresight and the fore test of the hellish torments which Christ should suffer in his soul for us on the cross nevertheless without sin considering that he always continued firm in faith and in all these things perfectly subjected himself to the will of his father out of which fear and terror he is here said to have been heard because by his prayer he was strengthened and assured that by the power of divine nature he should overcome all and also bring the devil and death itself under his feet others translate because this godliness sake as this word Eulabeia also signifieth but the Greek particle apo that is from out of can not suffer this interpretation ]
\p
\v 8 . Although he were the son he were not withstanding he learned obedience [that is experienced what is in such distress obediently to submit himself in all tings in the will of his father ] by that which he suffered
\p
\v 9 . And being sanctified [or being become perfect namely on the cross the eternal spirit speaks hereafter chapter 9.144 or being perfectly consecrated for all these signification hath this Greek word teleiotheis in it ] to al that are obedient to him [ that is who believe in him and consequently also company this faith with other parts of obedience as the scripture everywhere also calls faith obedience as the ground of all true obedience see John 3.36] he became a cause of eternal salvation.
\p
\v 10 . And was by Gods name [or by God sir-name that is made or ordained by God for to whom God giveth the name to them he also giveth the thing itself ] an high priest after the order of Melchizedeck ]
\p
\v 11 . Of whom[namely Melchizedeck or of which namely thing]we have many thing [Gr speech] and difficult to be declared to say seeing such ye are become [in these words the apostle gives a reason of that which he had spoken that the things he had purposed to write were difficult to be declared namely not so much in respect of the thing itself as in respect of their dullness wherefore he hereby stirs them up to take notice ] dull to hear [or flow in hearing of hearing ]
\p
\v 12 . For whereas ye ought to be teachers by reason of the time [or in respect of time namely that ye have been exercised in the doctrine of Christ ] ye have need again to be taught which are the first principles [Gr the elements or alphabet of the beginning that is the first grounds and foundations of Christians doctrine which he will rehearse in the following chapter otherwise the ceremonies of the old testament whereunto the Hebrews easily fell relapsed and which they always hankered after are also called the first beginnings of the world an d weak elements Galatians 4.9 Colossians 2.8 because god by tem as an alphabet had led them to the spiritual doctrine of salvation from which the Hebrews must now go forward unto the thing signified thereby and increase therein more and more ]of the words of God and ye are become as those that have need of milk [the same similitude the apostle useth also 1Corinthians 3.2 to cause them to understand their dullness and ignorance in the things of the masteries of the gospel as the following verse declares [and not strong meat [Gr food.]
\p
\v 13 . For everyone that is partaker of milk he is inexperienced [that is not sufficiently instructed in the doctrine of the gospel wherein the true righteousness which withstands in Gods judgment and is required of us and is revealed ] in the words of righteousness for he is a child [that is a child namely in knowledge see 1Corinthians 14.20 Ephesians 4.14]
\p
\v 14 . But strong meat [that is even the necked and deepest mysteries and points of doctrine of Gods words opposed partly to the first principle of the doctrine partly to the ceremonies whereunto the Jews like children always relapsed ] is for them that are perfect [that is that are full grown as 1 Corinthians 2.6 and 14.20 Ephesians 4.13]who through custom [that is by habit which a man gets by much practicing in any art of other thing ]have their senses for their exercised[or have exercised sense the Greek word signifies the instruments by which the sense do their work and are exercised as eyes, ears, tongue &c whereby the inward instrument of the instruments are understood as reason understanding will and c which being enlightened and renewed by the power of the spirit must also by the exercise of Gods words be daily more strengthened to be able to reject that which is evil and false and to be able to embrace that which is good and truth ] for discerning for both of good and evil.
\c 6
\s The apostle testifies that he will go forward to perfection and not treat now of the first principles of Christian doctrine the chief points whereof he briefly rehearseth 3 but that no withstanding upon another opportunity he will also do this 4 seeing it is impossible that they shall fall from thence after that they have tested the gifts of the spirits should again be renewed unto repentance 7 declares this by a similitude of fruitful and barren grounds 9 testifies that by the fruits of their love he hath a better opinion of them 11 but that he speaks this to stir them up to diligence and to more firm hope in Gods promises. 13. Seeing God hath not only made them by words also by oath confirmed them to Abraham and his seed 16 which oath is an end of all contention amongst men much more then with God who can not lie 19 wherefore we must fasten our hope in heaven as an anchor of the soul 20 where Christ our high priest entered for us.
\p
\v 1 Therefore leaving the beginning of the doctrine of Christ [Gr the word of the beginning of Christ and which is as it were the catechizing of children and novices chapter 5.12] let us go forward unto perfection [that is go forward unto the perfect knowledge of the doctrine of Christ Ephesians 4.13 ] not lying again the foundation [or first ground whereof six articles are here rehearsed ] of repentance from dead works the end whereof is death Romans 6.23 the knowledge whereof cometh especially by the law Romans 3.20] and of faith in God [namely the father son and holy ghost sum whereof is contained in the twelve articles of the faith ]
\p
\v 2 . Of doctrine of baptism and of sacraments whereby faith and repentance is strengthened in us the word baptism he put it in plural number not because there is more than one baptism Ephesians 4.5 but either to signify the outward and inward baptism 1Peter 3.21 or because in the primitive church those of full age who were converted to Christ and had now for a while been instructed in the Christians religion were oftentimes baptized in a considerable number together so that seemeth many baptism to be performed in one day ] and of laying on of hands [that is of the gifts of the holy ghost which in the primitive church wee wont to be imparted to believers in general by impositions of hands Acts 8.16,17 and especially in the institution of ministers of the church 1Timothy 4.14] and of the resurrection of the dead [of which article they which were admitted unto the communion of the church of Christ must especially give an account not only because the gentiles scoffed at it Acts 17.32 but also the seduces among the Jews Matthew 22.23 and many heretic among the Christians denied the same 2Timothy 2.28] and of eternal judgment [namely of the quick and of the dead of unbelievers to eternal death and of believers of eternal life these are therefore the six chief points of the principle or foundation of the Christian religion which were propounded by questions and answers to beginners which also for the most parts are contained for the catechisms ]
\p
\v 3 . And this will we also do [namely the laying of the first foundation of Christian religion which Paul now indeed passeth by because he by because he would also bring them to more perfect knowledge of other points of doctrine but nevertheless promiseth to handle the same upon other opportunities if God should permit it as he doth elsewhere also in his epistles others understand this of the declaring more perfect doctrine which he is now about to propound ]if God permit .
\p
\v 4 . For it is impossible [namely in respect of Gods judgment upon such unthankful man according to the declaration which Christ himself hath made of them who sin against the holy ghost Matthew 12.31,32 even as the following verse also show that here as also hereafter chapter 10 verse 26 that sin is spoken of wherefore the apostle John 1 Job 5.16 commands that one should not pay for such see the like phrase John 12.39,40] them which were once enlightened [namely in the understanding by the preaching of the gospel ] and have tested the heavenly gifts [that is faith which is here said that they tested not that ever they received the same it its true being but because they felt a small beginning and likeness or show thereof as the word taste is also opposed to letting down the meat Matthew 27.34 which tasting Christ in the similitude of a sower Matthew 13.20,21 calleth a receiving of the word with joy which not withstanding hath no root that is no true confidence in Christ neither yields any suitable fruits in perseverance seeing it fell on stony ground that is into a heart that was not duly before God nor prepared and that this also is the meaning here appears from the 7 verse following and elsewhere were these are compared to the ground that drinketh not the rain for that cause instead of good herbs bring forth thorns and thistle] and wee made partakers of the holy ghost which in the primitive church God imparted to the disciples see hereof 2 Corinthians chapter 12.14]
\p
\v 5 . And they have tasted the good word of God [that is the promises of the gospel whereof these had also received some taste as is said of the word of John the Baptist in some Jews John 5.35 that they would for short time rejoice in this light ]and the power of the age or world to come [this may fitly be understood of the power of eternal life whereof these man were also some small taste sometimes by reason that they receive this word by joy and for a while rejoice in the promise of the same as was showed before verse 4 and the word taste is agrees well herewith all]
\p
\v 6 . and falling away [or falling whereby are not understood all kinds of sins whereunto true believers also sometimes fall as David ,Peter &c who afterwards come to repentance but to a total falling or apostasy from the Christian religion and done willfully as is exprest chapter 10.26 and is joined with blaspheming of the same contrary to the testimony of the holy ghost in their conscience as Christ testifieth Matthew 12.31 ] them I say [this refers to the foregoing word impossible verse 4 it is impossible then to renew them again which impossibility is not only to be understood to the teachers who should labor in vain to renew them or bring them to repentance but also in respect of God truth itself who hath once passed this just judgment against them and is not mutable and will not be mocked Galatians 6.7 yea even in respect of Christ merit which these man willfully deny and reject as it followeth wherefore also chapter 10.26 it is said that there remaineth no more sacrifice for the sins of such ]to renew again to repentance [this word again hath a repentance [this word again hath a reference to the state from whence they are fallen which state was a beginning of renovation if they had continued and proceeded therein unto which very estate they can not be brought again others take these words renew again simply for the renewed as the Greek word palin that is again by an improper manner of speaking called pleonasmus is often times redundant see an example John 4.54 and chapter 13.12 Acts 18.2 and is added only to confirm the thing the more strongly ]as who again crucify themselves the son of God and put him openly to shame [in these word is given one reason more why such apostates can be renewed unto repentance namely because they to themselves that is as much s in them lies cast new reproach on Christ whom the father hath given for a propitiation for our sins even as the Jews and Gentiles had once before outwardly done to Christ and contrary to their conscience make him a spectacle or put him to shame before all the world and their own destruction which God will not leave unrevenged as this word paradigmatizein also signifies Matthew 1.19 for which word the word the word blasphemy is used Mar.3.29]
\p
\v 7 . For the earth [by this similitude the apostle shows the iniquity of this heavy judgment of God upon such men seeing like used to be amongst men upon such earth ]which drinketh in the rain oftentimes coming upon it and bringeth forth fit herbs for them by whom it is also tilled that receiveth blessings from God or is partaker of the blessing from God that is by God made more and more fit to bring more fruits.]
\p
\v 8 . But that which beareth thorns and thistles is to be rejected and nigh unto cursing[that is to be wholly forsaken and as a cursed thing to be given up to burning ]whose end is for burning.
\p
\v 9 . But beloved we assure ourselves better things of you [by this word the apostle mollifies the former threatening and declares it that which follows why he set before them the grievous punishment of the apostates namely not that he held them to be such to be such but warn them and to exhort them to hold fast to the doctrine of the gospel and Gods promises ]and joined with salvation [or cleaving to salvation ] although we thus speak [that is pronounce such heavy judgment against apostates.]
\p
\v 10 . For God is not unjust [That is, unfaithful or unsteadfast in the performance of his promises: even as Gods truth and constancy in the same, is every where also called the righteousness of God. See Psal. 143. 1. 1 Joh. 1. 9.] that he should forget [that is, that he should not perfect the same in you even unto the end, according unto his promise, Phil. 1. 6. and should not graciously reward it hereafter] your work, [namely, of true faith, which he hath already wrought in you, Phil. 1. 29.] and the labour of love, which ye have showed to his name, [or in his name, i.e. not only out of any human affection towards the poor and afflicted, but because they suffered for the name of God, and for the profession of Christ, which is property of true faith and true love, which Christ leaveth not unrewarded. See Matth. 10. 41, 42. and 25. 40. Mar. 9. 41.] as who have ministered to the Saints, and (shall) do minister.
\p
\v 11 . But we desire that every one of you show the same diligence unto the full assurance of hope [For as hope of salvation proceeds from faith; so the same hope is also strengthened more and more by the true fruits of faith. See 2 Pet. 1. 10.] even unto the end. [namely of your life: for he that remaineth constant unto the end, he shall be saved, Mat. 10. 22.]
\p
\v 12 . That ye be not slothful, but be ministers of them, who by faith and long suffering [That is, patient expectation of the fulfilling of Gods promise, as he proves afterwards by the example of Abraham and all believers] inherit the promises. [that is, now enjoy the promised inheritance in heaven.]
\p
\v 13 . For when God [The Apostle proves by the example of Abraham the Father of all believers, that which in the former verse he had testified of all believing Forefathers] made promise to Abraham, [namely, Gen. 22. 16. when Abraham had offered his son, in which promise all corporal and spiritual promises are contained. Namely of the promised seed, and of the multiplying of his seed, as the Father of all believers: whereof see further exposition, Rom. 4. 16. Gal. 3. 14. & c.] seeing he had none that was greater to swear by, he swore by himself,
\p
\v 14 . Saying, truly [This word indeed is not in the Hebrew Text, but is herewith rehearsed by Paul out of the Greek translation, seeing it is comprehended in the sense itself. Others hold that the particle ki, which is in the Hebrew Text, sometimes signifies truly also, Job 8. 6. Pro. 30. 2.] blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee. [that is, very abundantly, and continually bless, and greatly multiply thee.]
\p
\v 15 . And so having waited with long suffering [Gr. Having been long suffering] he obtained the promise, [that is, that which God had promised, as verse 12.]
\p
\v 16 . For men indeed swear by a greater (than themselves are) [Namely, by God. Oathes are condemned in God’s word. See Deut. 6. 13. Jer. 4. 2. and chapter 5. 2. The reason is, because God only knows the hearts of men, and is able to punish all men how great soever they be, if they swear falsely] and an oath, [that is, a lawful and due oath, of men against whom nothing can be said] for confirmation [namely, of the promises which are made to any man. For seeing there are two kinds of Oaths, one concerning things which are come to pass, to arrest the truth thereof, and one concerning that which is promised, to assure others of the future observation, Paul here speaks chiefly of the latter kind of oaths] is to them an end of all contradiction.
\p
\v 17 . Wherein God willing more abundantly to show to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed himself with an oath, [Or mediated by an oath, i.e. used the means of an oath.]
\p
\v 18 . That by two immutable things [That is, his promise and his oath, which are both unchangeable] in which it is impossible that God should lie, we might have a strong consolation, (namely we) who have taken refuge, to hold fast the proposed hope. [that is, the patient expectation of the fulfilling of the promises by faith apprehended by us, Rom. 8. ver. 24, 25. So that the word hope is here taken in a proper signification.]
\p
\v 19 . Which we have [Namely, which hope we believers have, & c.] as an anchor of the soul [that is, whereby the soul holds fast unto Gods promises, against all commotions and storms of the world: as a Ship by its anchor in the Sea against all tempests] which is sure and firm, and entereth into the innermost of the vail, [that is, heaven, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God, and intercedeth for us: which was signified by the entrance of the High Priest into the holy of Holies, as hereafter is declared, Chapter 9. 24.]
\p
\v 20 . Where the forerunner [Namely, who is entered thereunto for us, to prepare a place for us, Joh. 4. 2, 3.] for us, is entered, (namely) Jesus, being become an high Priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek. [This the Apostle adds, that so he may return to the declaration of the Royal Priesthood of Christ, which he had broken off, chapter 5. 11, & c. and resumes it again in the following chapter.]
\c 7
\s 1. The Apostle first relates the history of Melchizedek. 2. With some other properties more wherein he was like the son of God. 4. Prefers him above Abraham, because Abraham, and consequently Levi also gave him Tithes, and that he blessed Abraham. 11. Proveth that perfection was not in the Priest of Levi, seeing according to David’s prediction, another Priest must arise after the order of Melchizedek. 14. Namely, our Lord, who is not of the Tribe of Levi, but of the Tribe of Judah. 16. Whose Law should not be weak nor changeable, but unchangeable and perfect. 20. Whose Priesthood therefore was also confirmed with an oath. 23. And endureth always, because he liveth always. 25. And therefore also can perfectly save his. 26. From all which he concludes the glory and dignity of our High Priest. 27. And the perfection of his sacrifice once made.
\p
\v 1 For this Melchizedek [The Apostle relates this history of Melchizedek out of Gen. 14. 18. & c. as afterward also out of Psal. 110. in which places only of the old Testament mention is made of him. Some think that this was Sem the son of Noah, the forefather of Abraham, which Sem then lived still, as appears by comparing his age with this time when this happened to Abraham, in whose family without doubt the true knowledge and worship of God remained. But to this is repugnant that he is afterward said to have been without Father, without Mother, and without Genealogy, ver. 3.] was King of Salem [Almost all ancient Teachers think, that this Salem was the City, which afterward was called Jerusalem : although Jerome with some others hold, that this was Salem about Jordan whereof mention is made, Joh. 3. 23. about which City there were certain plain fields, whereof is spoken Gen. 14. 17. and Hierome testifies that in his time the remainders of Melchizedeks palace were still showed in this Salem by Jordan] a Priest of the most high God, [that is, of the true God possessor of heaven and earth, as Melchizedek speaketh, Gen. 14. 19. by which title he distinguisheth him from the Priests of the false gods, wherewith the world was already filled; which even some of Abrahams Ancestors themselves served beyond Euphrates, Josh. 24. 14.] who went to meet Abraham as he returned from smiling of the Kings, and blessed him: [namely, as a Priest of the most High, and with Priestly authority, as the argument which Paul draws from hence verse. 7. also importeth.]
\p
\v 2 . To whom also Abraham imparted the tithe of all: [This was also an act of Abraham to Melchizedek as a Priest. Of other Priestly actings Paul speaks not any where here, who notwithstanding here considers all things, wherein in the Priesthood of Melchizedek excelled the Priesthood of Levi. Therefore the offering of bread and wine is ill added hereunto by some, whereof here is no mention made. But Gen. 14. 18. is spoken not of offering, but of bringing forth bread and wine as of a kingly present, serving for this purpose, to refresh with meat and drink Abrahams company, who were wearied with the bat tell; as Josephus also thus relates this Antiq. Lib. 1. cap. 11.] who [namely Melchizedek as a figure and type of a Christ, of whom the Apostle so notes the properties, as well of his names, as of other qualities, that withal he shows them to be truly fulfilled in Christ the Son of God] is first interpreted King of righteousness [so Christ is called according to the type of Melchizedek, not only because he himself is righteous; but also because he is become the true righteousness before God for us, 1 Cor. 1. 30. 2 Cor. 5. 21.] and afterward also was King of Salem, which is a King of peace: [wherein he was also a type of Christ, who hath procured eternal peace with God for us, Rom. 5. 1.]
\p
\v 3 . Without Father, without Mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life: [This that follow is spoken of Melchizedek as a type of Christ, because in the relation of the history, Gen. 14. and Psal. 110. no mention is made of any of these, but because he is brought in as a man (as we may say) fallen out of heaven, and without beginning and end; which is in truth fulfilled in Christ. For he is without Father in respect of his human nature, and without Mother and genealogy in respect of his divine nature: as also without beginning and end of life] but being become like unto the Son of God [from hence it appears that Melchizedek was not the Son of God himself, who showed himself to Abraham in human shape, as some have also thought; but that he only bare a type and similitude of the Son of God] abideth a Priest for ever.
\p
\v 4 . Consider now [From henceforth unto the 11 ver. The Apostle extols Melchixedek above Abraham, and from the 11. ver. Forwards he exalts the Priesthood of Christ above the Priesthood of the Levites, and proves that this as being imperfect must have an end, but Christ’s Priesthood should endure always] how great this (man) was to whom even Abraham the Patriarch gave tithe of the spoil.
\p
\v 5 . And they of the children of Levi that receive the Priesthood, have indeed command [Namely, from God. See the Law thereof Num. 18. 24. etc.] to take tithe of the people [Gr. To tithe the people] according to the Law, that is, of their brethren, [that is, the other Israelites, who were also descended from Abraham] although they come forth of the loins of Abraham.
\p
\v 6 . But he who hath not (his) genealogy from them, [Namely, from the Levites] he took tithe of Abraham, [Gr. Tithed Abraham] and him that had the promise, [namely, Abraham the Patriarch, who had the promise that in his seed all generations should be blessed, Gen. 12. 3. and 22. 18.] he [namely, Melchizedek, Gen. 14. 19.] blessed.
\p
\v 7 . Now without any [Gr. All] contradiction, the less is blessed of the greater [He speaketh here of a solemn and Priestly blessing, whereby anyone blesseth another as a Priest and Ambassador of God, as here Melchizedek did Abraham. For otherwise also one that is less, may indeed bless one that is greater, or pray for him.]
\p
\v 8 . And here indeed the men who dye take tithes, [That is, the Priests who are taken away by death, and make room for other successors] but there he (taketh them) of whom it is witnessed that he liveth. [this some understand of Melchizedek, because in the history, Gen. 14. no mention is made of his death, nor of any one that followed him in his Priesthood upon earth. See ver. 3. & 16. but this may also be taken out of Psal. 110. where it is said, Thou art a Priest for ever, which is understood of Christ, who liveth always, and took tithe of Abraham in the person of Melchizedek. See ver. 16.]
\p
\v 9 . And, so to speak [Or, to speak in one word] even Levi, who taketh tithes, gave tithes by Abraham: [or in Abraham, as this Greek word dia sometimes signifies. See Rom. 4. 11. and this exposition is confirmed also by the following verse.]
\p
\v 10 . For he was yet in the loins of his Father [Namely, Levi. For although Christ also sprung from the loins of David, and consequently of Abraham also, notwithstanding that was only according to his human nature, and done in an extraordinary manner, which therefore freed him from this subjection, as also from sin, whereby all sinned in Adam, Rom. 5. 12.] when Melchizedek went to meet him.
\p
\v 11 . Now then if perfection [Or sanctification: namely, not only the outward according to the flesh, but also the inward according to the spirit, and which stands before God: under which is contained also the true reconciliation with God. See chapter 10. ver. 14.] were by the Levitical Priesthood: (for under the same [or together with, i.e. with the institution of that Priesthood. Others translate it of or concerning the same; namely Levitical Priesthood, the people of Israel received the Law by Moses, i.e. God by Moses obliged the people of Israel to the Law of the Levitical Priesthood, & its whole Ministry, so that the people in their sanctification, were to use only the Ministry and conduct of this Priesthood] the people received the Law) [some understand this only of the Law of the Priestly administration, and of the Ceremonies, which were bound to the Levitical Priesthood, as also afterward, ver. 12. Others take it more largely for whole Law of Moses, as well Moral as Ceremonial, because God instituted the Priesthood among the Levites, that they might be keepers, interpreters and Ministers of this Law. See Hagg. 2. 12. Mal. 2. 6, 7.] what need was there yet that another Priest after the order of Melchizedek should arise [as God by David in the 110. Psalm testifies with an oath] and should not be said to be after the order of Aaron?
\p
\v 12 . For the Priesthood being changed, there is also of necessity a change made of the Law. [Some take this also only of the Law of the Priesthood in the tribe of Levi with the Ceremonies, as was noted in the former verse. Others take it for the whole Law of Moses, because the Levitical Priesthood and its Ministry with the whole Law, were by Gods Ordinance so joined one to another, and so involved one with the other, that the one could not be changed without the other, seeing this Priesthood of Levi, or Aaron, contained a great part of that Law, as in almost all the institutions of the Law may be seen. And this sense the 18. and 19. verses seem to confirm.]
\p
\v 13 . For he of whom these things are spoken [Namely, in the 110. Psalm] belongeth to another tribe [Gr. Was partaker of another tribe. Namely, of the tribe of Judah, as Jacob had foretold, Gen. 49. 10. that the Silo or Messias must come forth out of the tribe of Judah : which that it was fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ, was known unto all Christians, unto whom Paul here writeth, as is declared in the following verses] of which no man gave himself to the altar. [namely, lawfully. For when King Osias of the tribe of Judah would attempt this, he was by God punished with leprosy for it, 2 Chro. 26. 18.]
\p
\v 14 . For it is manifest that our Lord sprung out Judah: of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning the Priesthood. [That is, concerning the administration of the Priesthood. For otherwise the Kings were also to take care that the Priests rightly administered their office, as may be seen in David, Solomon, Hezekiah, Josias and others.]
\p
\v 15 . And (this) is yet much more manifest, if there arise another Priest after the likeness of Melchizedek, [hereby the Apostle expounds that which heretofore he called the order of Melchizedek.]
\p
\v 16 . Who became not (this) after the Law of the carnal command, [That is, by the Law of the ceremonial commandments, which consisted in outward and carnal or transitory purifications, and sanctifications, as there were concerning the garments of the Priests, anointing, watching, sacrifices, 7 c. whereby they were consecrated unto their Ministry, and which reached only to the body, and the outward state of man. But it is here to be observed that the Apostle speaks of these ceremonies according to the common opinion of the Jews, who sought sanctification in these outward things: whereas they ought to have looked upon them only as types and shadows of Christ, as is taught in the following chapters] but according to the power [that is, by the power of God, and anointing of the holy Ghost, which should perpetually remain upon him, and make him an everlasting Priest, who should always live to intercede for us, and also to apply unto us the virtue of his sacrifice unto an incorruptible life. [Gr. Indissoluble]
\p
\v 17 . For he testifieth, thou art a Priest for ever, [That is, without Christs Priesthoods being subject to any alteration. For although some ceremonies of the old Testament are also said to be instituted for ever, as is said of circumcision, Gen. 17. 30. of the Passover, Exod. 12. 14. of the Sabbath Exod. 31. 16, of the Sacrifices Num. 18. 19. notwithstanding that cannot be understood of the ceremonies considered in themselves, but only in respect of the thing signified by them in Christ, and unto the time of the coming of Christ, by whom the ceremonies were to be abolished, as the Apostle here, and the Scripture every where else testifieth] after the order of Melchizedek.
\p
\v 18 . For a disannulling [Or setting off] of the foregoing commandment is made, because of the weakness and unprofitableness of the same [Namely, to be purified thereby according to the Spirit, as the Jews sought their holiness and perfection in the use thereof: although these ceremonies served the true Israelites, thereby to be brought to Christ, and his sanctification, which was a great profit, but ended with the coming of Christ.]
\p
\v 19 . For the Law [Namely, of ceremonies, whereof he here properly speaks. No nor the Moral Law itself, because it was impotent thereunto by flesh, as Paul testifieth, Rom. 8. 3.] perfected nothing , but the introduction of a better hope [or bringing in of a better hope. Namely, perfects all things, whereby is understood the power of the new Covenant, and of the Priesthood of Christ, which is called a better hope, because it powerfully accomplisheth the true sanctification in us. Others translate it, but was a manuduction unto a better hope, namely, the Law itself, which is therefore also called a conductor unto Christ, Gal. 3. 24. But the proper signification of the Greek word epeisagoge requires rather the first sense, seeing it imports a bringing in or carrying on of any matters, beyond what was before] by which we approach unto God. [for by Christ and his Priesthood we have an open access unto God himself, Rom. 5. 2.]
\p
\v 20 . And forasmuch as it (was) not (done) without an oath [Namely, that Christ is become an eternal Priest ] (for they indeed [namely, the Levitical Priests] were made Priests without an oath:
\p
\v 21 . But he [Namely, Christ] with an oath, by him who said unto him, the Lord hath sworn, and it will not repent him, Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.)
\p
\v 22 . Of so much a better Covenant [Or for so much Jesus became surety of a better. Namely, seeing it is confirmed by an unchangeable, and powerful save us, as is declared in that which follows] is Jesus become surety. [that is, Mediator as he is also called, Heb. 8. 6. and 9. 15. and 12. 24.]
\p
\v 23 . And they indeed were made many Priests, because they were hindered by death to continue always:
\p
\v 24 . But this man because he remaineth for ever, hath an untransitory Priesthood. [The Greek word aparabaton signifieth properly, that which passeth not over to any other man, as the Levitical Priesthood was to pass over to the eternal Priest after the order of Melchizedek, and therefore the first to perish, and this to abide for ever. Or that passeth not over from him to another successor, as the Levitical Priesthood did.]
\p
\v 25 . Wherefore also he is able perfectly to save [Or to the full, even unto the full end, so that out of him no part of salvation is to be sought or found, either in ourselves or in any other] them who go unto God through him, [namely, by a true and lively faith. See chapter 10. ver. 19 & c.] seeing he always liveth [namely, in heaven, in his glory, at the right hand of his Father, there always fulfilling the other part of his Office of High Priest, intercession] to intercede for them. [See the exposition hereof, Rom. 8. 34. and hereafter chapter 9. 24.]
\p
\v 26 . For such an high Priest became us, holy, innocent, undefiled, separate from sinners, and become higher then the heavens. [That is, exalted above all visible heavens into the throne of his Father, unto the highest glory, Eph. 4. 10. Revel. 3. 21.]
\p
\v 27 . To whom it was not needful everyday [That is, often, or upon all appointed days. See also Heb. 9. 7.] as to the high Priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, afterward (for the sins) of the people: for that he did once [Namely, offer for the sins of the people; for he himself had no sin of his own to offer for as is testified in the foregoing verse] when he offered up himself.
\p
\v 28 . For the Law [Namely, given by Moses] maketh men that have infirmity high Priests: but the word of the oath [namely, declared by David Psal. 110. after that the Law was given some hundreds of years before, which the Apostle adds, to show that the last institution makes void the former] which (followed) after the Law (maketh) the son, who is hallowed [or perfected, consecrated, as divers times before. See chapter 2. 10.] for ever more.
\c 8
\s The Apostle relates from that which is now proved what an excellent high Priest we have. 3. And also what kind of offering we must not be like that of the other Priests, who administered the type here upon earth, but that the same must be in heaven according to the heavenly representation. 6. Cometh afterwards to the describing of the excellence of the new Covenant whereof he is Mediator. 8. And rehearseth out of Jerem. 31 the institution and promises of the same. 13. And from hence concludes that the old is done away.
\p
\v 1 Now the capital sum [Or the head point among, or in the things, i.e. the principal : for the Greek word kephalaion signifies both] of the things whereof we speak, is, (that) we have such an high Priest, who is set at the right (hand) of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens: [that is, at the right hand of God who is set on the throne of his Majesty, or glory, in the third or highest heaven. See before chapter 1. 3. Act. 3. 21.]
\p
\v 2 . A Minister of the Sanctuary [Gr. Of the Holies: whereby the heaven is understood, whereof the holy of Holies was a type, as afterward chapter 9 ver. 8. 12. which is here distinguished from the first part of the Tabernacle, into which the Priests went every day, but the high Priest went but once a year into the Sanctuary, or holy of Holies, as is further declared in the beginning of the following chapter] and of the true [the word true is here opposed to the shadows, as Joh. 1. 17.] Tabernacle [as by the holy of Holies heaven is represented, Heb. 9. 24. so by this Tabernacle is understood the human nature of Christ, which is also compared thereunto Joh. 1. 14. and 2. 19. Heb. 9. 11. and in which the fullness of the Godhead dwelleth bodily, as in its Temple or Tabernacle, Col. 2. 9. which was conceived by the power of the Ghost, and was set up by no man, and by the offering up and blood whereof, Christ went into the holy of Holies: which well agrees with following verse. Whereof Christ may also be said to be said to be a Minister, because he sanctified the same human nature of his for a meet sacrifice, therein to expiate he sins of his people, and to accomplish the work of our salvation. See Joh. 17. 19. and hereafter chapter 9. 11. where this is thus declared at large] which the large] which the Lord set up, and no man.
\p
\v 3 . For every high Priest [This word for gives a reason why he said in the former verse that Christ is a Minister of the true Tabernacle of his body. Namely, because as an high Priest he also must have somewhat to offer] is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it was necessary that this man also bad somewhat [namely, himself or his own body, as heretofore, chapter 7. 27. and hereafter, chapter 9. 14. is expressed] to offer.
\p
\v 4 . For if he were on earth, he should not be a Priest, [Namely, because he had now fulfilled all things on earth, that were to be done by him on earth, as Priest. Therefore he should have finished his Ministry: but he must yet fulfill the true holy of Holies] while there are Priests, which offer gifts according to the Law. [That is, duly, and legally. And in these words is also a reason contained, why Christ should now be no Priest on earth, namely, who should legally and according to the ordinance of God administer the Priesthood here, because the Law maketh no Priest, but of the tribe of Levi, and no sacrifices but of ceremonial gifts, whereof Christ was made no Minister, but a Minister of that which was represented hereby, as the following verse also imports.]
\p
\v 5 . Who minister to the type and the shadow of heavenly things [That is, of the things, which must also be administered and fulfilled by Christ in heaven, and which are necessary for us for an entrance into heaven] even as Moses was admonished by a divine oracle, when he was to perfect the Tabernacle. For see, saith he, that thou make all things, according to the representation [or prescript, mould, pattern, example, according to which men do or build any thing] which was showed thee [namely, in vision, either on the mount, or much rather in heaven opened, as afterward, chapter 9. 23. is declared: for Moses being in the mount saw this pattern in heaven itself] on the mount. [Or in the mount i.e. on the mount, namely, Horeb.]
\p
\v 6 . And now hath he [Namely, the Lord Jesus Christ] gotten so much the more excellent Ministry, as he is also Mediator of a better Covenant [namely, then the Covenant of the Law and the ceremonies was] which was confirmed [Gr. Was legitimated] in better promises. [namely, which hereafter ver. 10. 11, 12. are expressed.]
\p
\v 7 . For if that first (covenant) had been blameless, [That is, there had been nothing wanting in it, wherein nothing more could be required. For that which is perfect is not to give place to any other thing of the like condition. For the Law of Moses, whereof the ceremonies are here considered as an appendix, was indeed perfect in itself if any man had perfectly observed the same, but by reason of the impotency of the corrupt nature of man, which the Law could not take away, it could bring no man to salvation, Rom. 8. 3. Gal. 3. 21. Therefore God would make this new Covenant with man through Christ, in the room of the first, that defect of the first might hereby be amended: of which new Covenant the ceremonies were also shadows and types, Col. 2. 17. as shall be showed in the following chapter, and of which the ancient Fathers had indeed also received the promises, Gal. 3. 17. etc. but the fullness thereof was revealed unto us by Christ, as the Apostle shows in that which follows out of Jerem. 31.] there should no place have been sought for the second.
\p
\v 8 . For blaming [Or showing them the defect, or complaining of them, i.e. showing the weakness which through their corruption was in the covenant, and complaining of it] (them) [namely, the Israelites: or the same, namely, Covenant] he saith unto them, Behold the days come [namely, in the times of the Messiah] saith the Lord, and I will set up [Gr. Consummate. See the annotate. On ver. 10] a new covenant, [or Testament ] over the house of Israel, and over the house of Judah: [hereby are also understood all the elect of the Gentiles, as may be seen every where in the Prophets, who should by faith be ingraffed into this Olive tree. See Rom. 11. 17, 25, 26. Gal. 4. 26, etc]
\p
\v 9 . Not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers [Namely, by Moses in the wilderness] in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt: for they abode not in that my Covenant, and I regarded them not, [or I esteemed them not: In the Prophet it is, should I have remained in marriage with them or as a Lord? Which hath one sense with these words but the apostle would retain the Greek translation because there was no difference in matter ] saith the Lord.
\p
\v 10 . For this is the covenant that I will make [that is fully reveal and spread abroad throughout the whole world for the promise of this covenant was not made by void of the law of Moses Gal.3.17 but was first fulfilled fully revealed and set up in its perfection by Christ ] with the house of Israel after those days saith the Lord I will give my laws into their understanding [that is not only in tables of stones and rarchments see 2Cor.3.3 &c] and in their hearts I will inscribe them and I will be unto them for a God and they shall be to me for a people.
\p
\v 11 . And they shall not teach everyone his neighbor [namely by words or by writings only as was done in the legal covenant and they shall be taught of God namely by his spirit as Christ speaketh John 6.45,65 who not withstanding preached the gospel unto them also with his own mouth and exhorted them unto the knowledge of God this therefore is not absolutely or altogether denied but by comparison with manner in the instruction of the old testament as such phrases divers time occur see examples therefore John 5verse 30 1Thessalonians 4.9] and everyone his brother saying know the Lord for they shall all know me [namely who shall have learned of God as Christ testifies in the place fore mentioned John 6.45 for that here is spoken only for the saving knowledge and of true faith appears from the following verse seeing sins are forgiven to no man in the new covenant by they by true faith Romans 3.30 some understand this of the state of the life to come where they shall be no more need of outward instruction when we shall see him face to face 1corinthians 13.12 1 John 3.2 but from the whole scope of the apostle appears that these promises concern all the elect believers of the new testament even in this life ] from the little among them unto the great among them.
\p
\v 12 . For I will be gracious to their iniquities and their sins and their transgressions I will in no wise remember anymore[namely to punish them therefore God in the new covenant retaineth no more punishment in when he hath once given sin as some urge although he yet sometimes out of fatherly love chastiseth his for their good see Hebrews 12.6,7]
\p
\v 13 . When he saith [thus far the words of the prophets are rehearsed now the apostle speaketh again Gr in saying ] a new covenant he hath made the first old [or caused to wax old that is declared to be old ] now that which is made old and waxed old in nigh to vanishing [that is taking away so that it is removed and used no more.]
\c 9
\s The apostle further to show the excellence of priesthood above the Levitical describe the forms of the outward tabernacle and of that which was therein 6 together with the ministry of priest in the same 8. declareth that these were only shadows and types as also the purification which were made therein 13 but that Christ and his sacrifice and entrance into the true sanctuary hath fulfilled all this and brought to pass an eternal redemption 15 testifieth that by his death the new testament is confirmed 16 even as the death of the testator confirms all testaments 18 that therefore in the old testament also all things wee sprinkled with blood there was no remission 23 but that the heavenly things must be purified by better sacrifices 24 that that therefore Christ is gone into heaven there to appear before God to us 25. after that he had once offered up himself upon earth 27 and that he shall come upon heaven to deliver them that wait for him.
\p
\v 1 Therefore also the first covenant [many Greek office have first Tabernacle. But the last verse of the former chapter of this chapter it appears that it is better read here the first covenant ]had indeed judgments [or institutions that is manners of doing according to which the worship of God was to be regulated in which the ceremonial justification consisted] of Gods worship and the worldly sanctuary that is that is earthly and made of corruptible as all things in the world are whereof see Exodus chapter 45.26,36,57 and is here opposed to the heavenly and corruptible which was signified hereby as the apostle will declare hereafter ] sanctuary [so the building is called which by Gods ordinance was consecrated to Gods worship in the old testament in whose place afterwards came the temple of Solomon but Paul describes here not the temple but the Tabernacle because that was first build by Moses according to the pattern showed by God on the mount and Solomon afterwards made the temple according to this Tabernacle yet so as that he added some other things thereunto.]
\p
\v 2 . For the Tabernacle was prepared namely the first [that is the first part of the Tabernacle for the court of the people and of the priest wherein the assemblies and the sacrifices were performed the apostle here passeth by and declares only the things which were in the covered Tabernacle or tent and the rites which were used therein whereof the first part was called the holy place the other part the holy of holies ] in which was the candlestick [this candlestick table and show bread were in the first part of the Tabernacle Exodus 25.23 &c] and the table and the show bread [Gr the setting forth of bread ] which is called the holy place.
\p
\v 3 . But behind the second veil[ this was the vail that separated the holy place from the holy of holies and is called the second in respect of the first veil which covered the entrance into the holy place in the Tabernacle see Exodus 26.36 For in the temple this was separated with the walls from the courts in which therefore there was but one veil which rent when Christ died on the cross Luke 23.45] was the Tabernacle [that is the part of the Tabernacle for both these parts were under one roof ] called the holy holies .
\p
\v 4 . Having a golden censer [Gr thymiaterion whereby some understand the altar of incense itself which stood in the holy place into which the priest went every day to burn incense thereon as is also showed verse 6 and may be seen Exodus 30.6 which as it stood close by the holy of holies therefore they think that it is here said that the holy of holies had it but manner of speaking would be very improper seeing it stands here expressly that the holy of holies which was behind the second vail had this thymiaterion as also the ark of the covenant therefore it is more fitly taken for the censer wherewith the high priest went once a year into the holy of holies to burn incense which therefore also was kept into the holy of holies as Josephus witnesseth lib 2contra Appion and although Moses makes no mention thereof expressly yet the same may be gathered also from Levi.16.12] and the ark of the covenant covered over all about with gold in which [ some think that these words in which refer to the word Tabernacle whereof is spoken in the third verse because 1 Kings 8.9 and 2 Corinthians 5.10 it expressly said that in the ark of the covenant nothing was contained but the two tables of the law but others understand it of the ark itself in or about which the golden pot with manna and Aaron rod were in the time of the Tabernacle as may be seen Exodus 16.33,34 and Numbers 17 verse 10 although in the times when the temple of Solomon was built they were no more in or about it either because they were perished or because they were brought somewhere into another part of the Temple of the temple as also the authentic book of the Law whereof mentioned is made Deuteronomy 21.36 2 Corinthians 34.14] was the golden pot wherein was the manna and Aarons staff which had budded and the tables of the covenant .
\p
\v 5 . And above all this ark were the Cherubims of glory [these were two shape angels with their heads bowed one towards the other and touching one another with their wings as may be seen Exodus 25.18 from between which God gave answer unto Moses from the upper part of the mercy seat as it testified Numbers 7.89] which shadowed the propitiatory [or mercy seat which was the covering of the ark were with the two stone tables were covered and was a type of Christ who covered the law because he subjected himself to the law for us and delivered us from the curse of the law even as Christ is therefore called by the name of propitiation Romans 3.25 and the Angels are said to be desirous to behold these mysteries 1Peter 1.12] of which things we shall not now speak in particular.
\p
\v 6 . Now these things now being that prepared the priest indeed went into the first Tabernacle [that is into the first part of the Tabernacle called the holy place as verse 2] always [ that is everyone in his daily course as may be seen Luke 1.8,9] to accomplish the service of God:
\p
\v 7 . But into the second Tabernacle [that is into the second part namely the holy of holies as before ] went the high priest once a year [namely on the tenth day of the seventh month Thisri on the solemn day of fasting and of the atonement of all the people see Leviticus 16.29 &c] not without blood [ namely of the sacrifice of the atonement which was slain and offered without the Tabernacle on the great altar in the court the blood whereof after the kindling of the incense in the foresaid censor was brought by the priest into the holy of holies before the ark and mercy seat and the mercy seat was sprinkled therewith seven times after that it was covered with the incense as with a cloud as may be seen Leviticus 16.11 &c which shadow and type the apostle goes to declare from point to point in that which follow ] which he offered himself for the misdeeds of the people [Gr ignorance or incogitances whereby are understood not only the sins which properly are done out of ignorance but also all sorts of sins as sufficiently appears by the place Leviticus 16.16 whereunto Paul here hath respect and heretofore chapter 7 verse 27 and divers places and the sins are so called also because all sins except the sin against the holy ghost are always joined with some error of the understanding by the deceit of Satan.]
\p
\v 8 . Whereby the holy ghost [namely who was the institutor of all the worships and therefore one true eternal God with the father and the son and yet a distinct person ]signifies this that the way of the sanctuary [that is of the holy of holies or of heavens as hereafter verse 12 and 24 is declared ]was not made manifest [that is was not yet so clearly and perfectly made known as was afterwards when Christ in his first coming accomplished the things signified hereby even as 1John 3.2 it is said that it is not first manifested or made manifest or made manifest what we shall be namely after Christ’s second coming although not withstanding even he also were in some sort informed thereof but not so clearly and perfectly as it shall be fulfilled in us ] as long as the first Tabernacle was yet standing[that is as long as the church under the old testament was instructed only by these ceremonies and the rites of the first Tabernacle and consequently also of the first temple without the gospels being propounded to them in its necked ness and full cleanness as was done after the fulfilling for whereas some interpret this thus as if the faithful of the old testament had no access unto heaven before Christ was ascended up to heaven it is contrary to the example of Elias 2Kings 2.11 and of Lazarus Luke 16.22 compared with Matthew 8.11 and of the murtherer on the cross Luke 23.43 compared with 2 Corinthians 12 verse 2,3,4 and with the hope of the believing fathers Hebrews 11.16 and is also contrary to Christ’s promises Matthew 5.10,11,12 which were made before the resurrection ]
\p
\v 9 . Which was a representation [Gr parable that is a similitude which signifies somewhat else ]for that present time in which were offered gift and sacrifices which could not sanctify [or could not perfect namely considered in themselves or by their own power otherwise in their right use they could serve to direct the faithful fathers unto Christ by whose sacrifice the conscience should be purged as hereafter verse 14 is declared ]him who performed the service [Gr Him that served that is him that was exercising the worship of God ]according to the conscience.
\p
\v 10 . Consisting only in meats and drinks and divers washings [Gr baptisms] and justifications of the flesh [that is outward institutions which justified or hallowed a man only according to the outward or bodily state see verse 13] imposed[ namely as a yoke which the fathers themselves were not able to bear and is taken away by Christ Acts 15.10] until the time of reformation [Gr testifying that is in which it it shall be brought to right namely until the time of the new testament whereof Jeremy had spoken in which the thing signified should be fulfilled these ceremonies taken away and other shorter worship instituted whereby the holy ghost should work more powerfully 2 Corinthians 3]
\p
\v 11 . But Christ the high priest of good things come [that is of all the spiritual benefits which were procured by sacrifice of Christ on the cross and by his entrance into heaven such as forgiveness of sins generation the spirit of adoption and eternal salvation which is being figured in the old testament were procured by Christ in new ] being come [namely in the flesh and into the world ] by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle [hereby is understood the humane nature of Christ in which the fullness of Godhead dwelleth as in a temple or Tabernacle John 1.14 and chapter 2.19 as is also showed chapter 8.2 And Christ is said by the tabernacle of the flesh to have entered into heaven because by the spiritual power and worthiness of his sacrifice performed for us the access into heaven was opened for him and a name was given him above all names Philippians 2.8,9 with which exposition agrees that which he said hereafter chapter 10.20 of the place through his vale that is the flesh of Christ for Christ is gone before us to prepare a place for us John 14.2 he would say therefore that even as Christ by himself and by his own blood is entered into the sanctuary we also must come thereunto by the same way] not made hands that is not of this creation or of this creation ]
\p
\v 12 . Neither by the blood of goats and calves [for both these sorts of beasts were sacrificed when the high priest was to enter into the holy of holies Leviticus 16.11,15 with the blood of both which he also went in the holy of holies verse 18 ] but by his own blood once entered into the sanctuary having accomplished an eternal[ that is always enduring and of eternal virtues as chapter 10.14]redemption[Gr having found a ransoming that is deliverance which is procured by ransom.]
\p
\v 13 . For if the blood of the bulls and goats and the asres of the young cow [this was yet another ceremony whereby the unclean according to the law in the old testament were purified which also had respect unto Christ and the sprinkling of the blood whereof see Numbers 19 verse 2&c] sprinkling the unclean [namely according to the law by touching of any dead or bones or graves Numbers 19 verse 16 Gr who were made common ]sanctifieth them unto the party of the flesh that is to be clean outwardly according to the law and that they might have access to the assemblies and the other outward worship of the old testament.]
\p
\v 14 . How much more shall the blood of Christ who by the eternal spirit [that is by the eternal Godhead from whence the virtues and dignity of the sacrifice of Christ proceeded as is also showed Acts 20.28 and as the eternal Godhead of Christ is also called a spirit Romans 1.4 1 Timothy 3.16 1Peter 3.18] offered up himself unblameable unto God purge your conscience [that is your souls understanding ,will and affection of which the conscience have the feeling also to know that which is freely given us of God 1Corinthians 2.12 others read our conscience ] from dead works [that is sins see chapter 6.1 ] to save the living God?
\p
\v 15 . And therefore he is mediator of the new testament [ the Hebrew word herith which Jeremy useth chapter 31 signifies in general any kind of covenant and contract whether the same be made between two parties or by one party only as testament use to be whereof example may be read Genesis 6.18 and 9.9 Job 31.1 now the covenant is a testament the apostle sets down as certain because it comes from God side alone even as the pace Jeremiah 31 rehearsed in he former chapter sufficiently shows and because all types wherefore shows this which were sprinkled and sealed with the blood of the slain sacrifice ]that death being come between for expiation [Gr ransoming ] of transgression which were under the first testament [that is which were committed and remained unexpiated in the times of the old testament but were passed by and forgiven by God for sacrifice and satisfaction of Christ which was to be performed afterwards see Acts 15.1 Romans 3.25,26] they that are called [namely with an effectual calling unto faith as Abraham and his spiritual seeds were Romans 4.16]might receive the promise of eternal inheritance [that is the promised eternal inheritance see hereafter chapter 11 verse 8,9,10.]
\p
\v 16 . For whence a testament is there it is necessary that the death of the testator intervene [Gr be brought namely before it be firm as the following verse declares.]
\p
\v 17 . for a testament is firm in the dead seeing it hath no force when the testator liveth.
\p
\v 18 . Wherefore also the first [namely covenant made by Moses ]was not consecrated ]that is publicly instituted solemnized and declared to be firm and valid ]without blood [namely of the breast that were slaughtered or killed which had their aim at the death of their mediator of the new testament for seeing the transgression of the law deserved death and God by his grace according to the tenor of the new testament would absolve the transgressor from it so that his justice should also be satisfied therefore Christ the mediator interposed and as a surety Hebrews 7.22 took upon him the making of the satisfaction and afterwards by his death paid the debt of our transgression and also procured for them the eternal inheritance which belonged unto him as the son of God.]
\p
\v 19 . For when all the commandments [this relation of Paul is taken out of exodus 24.3 & c only that apostle adds here to water purple wool and hyssops out of Leviticus 14.6 and Numbers 19.6 were these things were used in the like sprinklings ]according to the law were uttered by Moses unto all people he took the blood of calves and goats [whereof mention is made often in other places ]with water and purple wool and hyssop sprinkling both the book itself [this is not indeed expressly said Exodus 24 but nevertheless may sufficiently be collected from Moses his relation there] and al the people [that is the twelve pillars which Moses erected there to represent the twelve tribes of Israel and that before and in the presence of all people see the annotate on Exodus 24.8]
\p
\v 20 . Saying this is the blood of the testament [that is a sign and seal of the covenant or testament for it was the blood of calves and goats which was used for the sanction or confirmation of this covenant A sacramental phrase as Luke 22.19 1 Corinthians 11.24,25] which God hath commandeth unto you [that is hath made with you according to or concerning all these words or commandments as is expressed Exodus 24.8]
\p
\v 21 . And he sprinkling also like manner the tabernacle [this is taken out of divers other places of the law especially out of Exodus 29.12 Leviticus 16.14 &c] and all he vessels of the ministry with the blood.
\p
\v 22 . And all things almost [that is added because some purification of the law were made only with water which also aimed the sacrifice of Christ seeing in his death there flowed out blood and water see John 19.34 and 1John 5.6]are purified by the blood according to the law and without shedding of the blood there is no remission
\p
\v 23 . It was therefore necessary [namely according to Gods unchangeable command and ordinance see afterwards chapter 10 verse 9.10] that indeed the types [or representation figures ] of the things which are in the heaven should be purified [that is separated from common use and made fit to have religious communion therewith] by these things but he heavenly things themselves [ that is the entrance into heaven itself and the spiritual gifts which are needful of us to come thereunto and which were signified by these outward purifications see Ephesians 1.3 Colossians 3.1 ,2] by better sacrifices then these [that is by he sacrifice of Christ which is better and of greater dignity and it is here put in plural number although it be but one and once offered because it contains in it self the virtue of all typical sacrifices and things signified thereby.]
\p
\v 24 . For Christ is not entered into the sanctuary that is made with hands which is an antitype of the true [namely sanctuary that is of heaven which was figured by this other as followeth ] but into heaven itself now to appear before the face of God for us [namely with his victorious sacrifice which here upon earth he had unblameable offered up to his father for a satisfaction for all the sins of his faithful ones and with an everlasting desire that might always be applied to us for our salvation see Romans 8.34 1Timothy 2.5 and 1John2.1 .]
\p
\v 25 . nor yet that he should offer up himself as the high priest enters into the sanctuary every year with strange blood [or another that is with blood of slain beast which are of another nature then himself ]
\p
\v 26 . Otherwise he must often had suffered [namely if he must often have offered up himself considering that his sacrifice was considered by suffering and with suffering and could not be accomplished without suffering ]from the foundation of the world [that is since men began to sin but in respect of his sacrifice of Christ ]but now once in the summation of ages [that is in fullness of time in which God had appointed thereunto see Galatians 4.4 ]he manifested to do away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
\p
\v 27 . And even as [Gr for as much as ]it is appointed unto men once to die [namely by Gods ordnance after that man sinned Romans 5.12 For that some man died not as Enoch and Elias and that some died twice and did that were miraculously raised up into this life was a special privilege and exception from this general rule ] and afterwards the judgment [namely of each one in particular immediately after death and of all in general hereafter at the last day .]
\p
\v 28 . So also Christ being once offered to take away the sins of many [namely of all his elect and faithful ones to take upon him or hear the sins of many ]shall the second time be seen without sin [that is without hearing anymore the imputations and punishments our sins but in glory to judge all things ] by those that look for him [namely by faith and hope see 2 Timothy 4.8] unto salvation.
\c 10
\s The apostle also declares that the law had but a shadow of all good things to come, and by its manifold and yearly sacrifices was not able to perfect anything 5. And that therefore David testifieth in the fortieth Psalm that Christ should come into the world to do the will of God 10. and the only sacrifice of his body to perfect us forever 15 the same he proves again by the contents of the new covenant Jeremiah 31 in which the perfect taking away of sins is promised 18. and concludes therefore that there is no more need of any sacrifice for sin 19 afterwards he cometh to the other part of the epistle namely to exhortations unto their duty and first he exhorts the Hebrews to go unto God with a confident faith by the way which Christ hath consecrated for us 23 afterwards he exhorts them to steadfastness in the profession of this hope and to unwavering love 25 and to the keeping of their assembling together 26 to this ends sets before their eyes on the one side the fearful judgment of God which apostates are to expect 32 And on the other side their former patience and compassion on the afflicted even on his own hands also 36 together with the promises which those that are constant shall receive 37 both which he proveth by a place out of Habakkuk 2.4 which he rehearseth and applieth .
\p
\v 1 For the law [namely of the ceremonies under the old testament ] having a shadow [ that is a rude draught as painters use first rudely to make out or delineate with certain lines and shadows a pictures which they intend afterwards to perfect ] of good things to come [that is of spiritual and heavenly things which should be procured and imparted to us in the new testament that is of Christ himself and his benefits ]not the image itself of the things [some hereby understand the perfect way of the outwards worship of God which god should institute by Christ in the new testament as a shadow or first draught from the perfect image of anything even as they also therefore called the first principles or elements and alphabets of the world Galatians 4.3,9 but seeing the apostle nowhere in this and in the former chapter maketh any oppositions between the outward worship of God of the old and of the new testament but only between the shadows of the old testament and Christ himself with the sacrifices and benefits which he hath procured for us therefore others by these words the image itself more fully understand the thing signified itself or the pattern according to which these shadows were held forth even as we are said to be created after Gods image or likeness which sense the word adjoined the image itself of the things also required that is the things themselves in their full propotion or shape even as they ought or should be ]can never with the same sacrifices [that is of one sort or of one and the same condition and nature ]which they offer up every year continually [Gr in continuance or perpetuity that is without omission as long as this priest hood and law was to endure ]sanctify[ or perfect namely according to the conscience by taking away of sin and the guilt of sin as is declared heretofore chapter 9 verse 9]them who go thereunto [or go unto God namely with their sacrifices ]
\p
\v 2 . Otherwise they should have ceased to be offered [others read should they not otherwise have ceased ? by way of interrogation but the sense comes all to one ]because they that used the service should have no conscience more of sin or should have no accusation of conscience for sin and should no more acknowledge themselves guilty of any guilty of sin seeing they should at once be purged or delivered from it ] having been once purged.
\p
\v 3 . But now in the same there is made every year again remembrance of sin [namely not only of the sins which were done that year but of al the sins that were committed before see Leviticus 16.21]
\p
\v 4 . For it is impossible that the blood of the bulls and goats should take away sin [namely by its own worth and virtue forasmuch as that is but a corporal and transitory things whereas sin is a spiritual evil and hath its place chiefly in the soul which is immortal ]
\p
\v 5 . Therefore [namely Christ the high priest of good things to come in whose name David speaketh in this Psalm and of whose coming he prophesieth as Paul here testifieth and the thing itself shows ] coming into the world [namely when he assumed the human nature and united it with one person with himself as heretofore chapter 1.6 and chapter 9.11 ] he saith sacrifice an offering that wouldest not [namely to accept it for an expiation and satisfaction as the Jews imagined otherwise God willed it also for the faithful the old testament as types sacramental signs which directed them to the future satisfaction of the sacrifice of Christ itself should now be accomplished when as these shadows must cease as is proved in this and other places ] but thou hast prepared me a body [the Hebrew text Psalm 40.7 saith thou hast bored through mine ear but the apostle here follows the Greek translation as almost everywhere in this epistle seeing the same sense is contained in both for the words thou hast bored through mine ears signified that Christ now becoming man gives up himself to be a wiling servant of his father to obey him unto the death of the cross and it is a similitude taken from the servant of the Hebrews who after that they have served their master six year would not depart out of their masters service the seventh year but they would abide in it continually until death for a testimony whereof their ear was bored through on the post of the doors as may be seen Exodus 21.6 even so then also God the father is here said to have prepared Christ body because Christ having received of his father the human nature out of the flesh and blood of the virgin Mary by the power of the Holy Ghost here gives up the same unto the service of his father to serve him willingly in all things even unto te death to a sacrifice of expiation for our sins it is therefore as much as he should say thou hath given me a body that is willing and ready in thy service even unto death]
\p
\v 6 . Burnt offerings and offerings for sins pleased thee not.
\p
\v 7 . Then spoke I behold I come in the beginning of the book[Gr in the head or in the roll of the book namely of thy law was wont with the ancient to be written on the roll as maps are with us and the Jews still with them in their synagogue now they are many places in the book of the law which testfieth of the coming of Christ yea even in the beginning of the book when God promised the seed of the woman which should tread upon Satan head genesis 3.15] it is written of me to do thy will o God [that is to be obedient to thee unto the death of the cross for the reconciliation of all believers .]
\p
\v 8 . When he said before sacrifices and offering and burnt offering and offering for sin and wouldst not neither did they please thee which are offered according to the law.
\p
\v 9 . Then said he Lo I come to do thy will o God he taketh away the first [namely all sorts of propitiatory offerings which were used in the old testament ] to settle the second [namely his obedience unto the will of the father .]
\p
\v 10 . In which will as Romans 5.19] we are sanctified [that is have all that is needful to our perfect sanctification namely forgiveness of sins renovation of he spirit and eternal salvation ] by offering of the body of Jesus Christ once performed [that is which will of God consisteth therein also that Christ should give up his body on the cross for a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins Philippians 2.8]
\p
\v 11 . And every priest stood indeed everyday ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifice [that is of the same sort and nature ] which are never able to take away sins
\p
\v 12 . But this man having offered [namely on the wood of the cross ] one sacrifice for sin is forever [this word forever is by some joined to the word having offered but the first conjoining is fittest ]set down on right hand of God :
\p
\v 13 . Henceforward expecting [that is his kingly and priestly office even as he now administers it is a mediator persevering so long and continually attending to the execution of the same until his mediation and his fathers power all the enemies of our salvation and at the last death also shall be abolished when he shall lay down this form of governing and with the father and the holy ghost remain all in all see 1Corinthians 15.24&c ]until his enemies be made a footstool of his feet.
\p
\v 14 . For by one offering he hath perfected forever those that are sanctified [those by his word and spirit believe in him and are regenerated and hereby is made a definition of those who are perfected by Christ sacrifice for although his sacrifice in itself is sufficient for all men nevertheless it perfect no man but those that are sanctified by him ]
\p
\v 15 And the Holy Ghost [namely in his word and especially in the form of the new covenant which he hath made with us Jeremiah 31 From whence appears then that the Holy Ghost is true God and distinct person in divine essence]also witnesseth it to us [namely that which he said in the former verse for although in the new testament Jeremiah 31 there is no mention made of sacrifice nevertheless seeing the perfect remission of sins is there promised and the apostle hath proved hitherto that the death of the testator must come between that the new testament might be firm and he had proved this also out of the fortieth Psalm therefore he concludes beyond all contradiction that this must be accomplished to the new covenant by this one sacrifice thus then the apostle here teacheth us to compare the scripture with itself to make the conclusions in matters of faith ]
\p
\v 16 . For after that he had said before this is the covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord [that is thus saith the Lord which words may here be taken for Paul’s words although the like are also in the prophet otherwise they would want some what in the beginning of the following verse to fill up Paul’s conclusion namely thus saith he or the like which some copies also has set before the 17 verse because they took these words saith the Lord for the words of the prophet ]I will give my laws into heir hearts and I will inscribe them in their understandings:
\p
\v 17 . And their sins their unrighteousness I will in no wise remember any more.
\p
\v 18 . Now where forgiveness of the same is there is no more sacrifice for sin [namely of expiation but only spiritual sacrifices of thankfulness which are required of us in the new testament see Romans 12.1 Hebrews 13.5 1 Peter 2.5]
\p
\v 19 . Seeing therefore brethren [here the apostle begins the second part of the epistle namely the exhortation to the duties of believers and exhorts them in the remaining part of the chapter to boldness in faith and steadfastness in profession and to patience in tribulation ]we have boldness to enter into the sanctuary [Gr into the entrance of the sanctuary that is by hope prayers and faith to go directly unto God in heaven Romans 5.2 Ephesians 3.12] by the blood of Jesus .
\p
\v 20 . By a new the Greek word properly signifies that is newly slain which he refers to the sacrifice of Christ which was newly slain and remain all waves in full force ] and living [that is quickening as Job 6.57 for Christ death is our life ]way [so he calls Christ offered for us because through him and his merits we have access unto God see John 14.6 ]which he hath consecrated for us [or newly prepared or set forth see chapter 9 verse 18]through the veil but this is through the flesh [that is his human nature by which his divine nature was covered as the ark of covenant and of mercy seat with all the holy of holies was by veil ]
\p
\v 21 . And seeing we have great priest over the house of God [that is the whole of God see before chapter 3.6]
\p
\v 22 . Let us approach with a true heart [that is an unfeigned upright mind ]in full assurance of faith in our heart [that is our souls or thought and will and affection ]being purified [Gr sprinkled that is purified and freed from an evil Conscience that is by sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ see before chapter 9.14]from an evil conscience and the body[that is our outward actions or works which are done by the body ]being washed with pure water [that is by the operation of the spirit of Christ which is everywhere set forth by pure water see Ezek. 36.25 1John 5.6]
\p
\v 23 . Let us hold fast [that is steadfastly retain, without turning from it or seduced from it ] the unwavering profession of hope [namely which is in us 1Peter 3.15] for he that hath promised it is faithful [namely in performing of hat he hath promised ]
\p
\v 24 . And let us heed one another [or observe one another ]for stirring up of over and good works.
\p
\v 25 . And let us not neglect our mutual coming together [namely in the Christian assemblies which are kept for the hearing of Gods words oblique prayers and use of the holy sacraments see Acts 2.42 and 20.7 1Corinthians 11.20&c] as some are wont [namely they that shall away from the truth either for fear of the Jews or else through negligence or out of great opinion of themselves or for other causes grow remiss herein see Matthew 18.20] but exhorts one another and that so much the rather as ye see that the day draws nigh.
\p
\v 26 . For if we sin willingly, [That is, willfully fall away from this faith, which the Apostle hath here described, as hereafter in the 29 verse this sin is more largely declared, which the Apostle also heretofore cha. 6.] vers. 6. called a falling away. He speaketh not here than of every kind of sin or falling away, but of that sin which Christ calleth the sin or blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, Mat 12. 32. and of the sin unto death, whereof John speaketh. 1 Joh. 5. 16. as appears by the following properties which are rehearsed hereafter] after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no sacrifice for sin any more: [Namely, seeing such persons willfully reject and despise the only sacrifice of the New Testament, namely, the Lord Jesus and his merit. And the Apostle Paul seemeth also here to allude to the place, Numb. 15 30, 31. where, even according to the Law itself, no sacrifice of expiation was permitted for those who sinned with a high hand, and reproached the Lord, but must without mercy be rooted out of the people.]
\p
\v 27 . But a fearful expectation of Judgement and heat of fire, which shall devour the adversaries: [That is, the enemies of God’s truth and persecutors of the same.]
\p
\v 28 . If any man made void the Law of Moses [That is, rejected, forsook, denied, apostatized from it, as is declared Deut. 13. 5, 6, 7. For although there were more willful sins, which were punished with death; nevertheless the Apostle especially respects this sin of willful Apostasy, as the Greek word athetein i.e. abrogate, or make void, and comparing of the following verse imports] he died without mercy under two or three witnesses:
\p
\v 29 . Of how much heavier punishment think ye shall he be accounted worthy, who hath trampled upon [That is, willfully despised and rejected. For that which a man tramples upon, they use with much contempt and rejection] the Son of God, and hath esteemed the blood of the Testament [that is, the blood of Jesus Christ, by which the New Testament is confirmed. Mat. 26. 28.] unclean, [Gr. Common: i.e. prophane, unholy, as Mar. 7. 2. Act. 10. 14. For that which a man rejects or denies, that he accounts unclean or unholy in matters of Religion] whereby he was sanctified, [namely, outwardly in regard of his former profession or confession, concerning the hearing of God’s word, use of the holy sacraments, and separation from other common men, namely Jews and Gentiles. Although such a person was not partaker of true regeneration as John testifieth, 1 Joh. 2. 19. and as such still nevertheless 2 Pet. 2. 22. are called dogs and swine, although they were washed from their outward filth and had left the impurity of idolatry, and other unholiness] and hath reproached the spirit of grace? [that is, the holy Ghost, which began to work in them some taste of God’s grace, for which they also rejoiced for a while. See hereof more at large chapter 6. 5.]
\p
\v 30 . For we know him who hath said [Namely, Deut. 32. vers. 35. 36. where the Lord promiseth that he will revenge his people upon their enemies, and judge, i.e. right and defend them against all prosecutors and oppressors. And here it is to be observed, that the Apostle alters and amends the words of the Greek interpreters, according to the Hebrew Text.] Vengeance is mine, I will recompense saith the Lord. And again, the Lord shall judge his people.
\p
\v 31 . It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. [Namely, when he taketh vengeance upon his enemies. Otherwise it is better to fall into the hands of God than of men, when he graciously chastiseth his own, 2 Sam. 24. 14. ]
\p
\v 32 . But remember the former days, in which after ye were illuminated [Namely, when ye became believers, and by Baptism were ingraffed into the Church of Christ. How much more than, he would say, much ye be steadfast, and armed against all tribulation, now after that ye have long professed Christ and served him] ye underwent much combat of suffering:
\p
\v 33 . Partly, when by reproaches and afflictions ye became a spectacle: [This may be taken either properly, seeing the Christians were oftentimes cast before beasts in the public shows. 1 Cor. 15 32. or by a similitude, because they were publicly in the Synagogues and Judgement halls, shamefully made spectacle, and evil entreated, as Christ foretells Luke 12. 11. and chapter 21. 12. and Paul speaketh concerning himself and other Apostles. 1 Cor. 4. 9.] and partly when ye had communion [that is, had compassion, and afforded brotherly assistance] with them that were so used.
\p
\v 34 . For ye had compassion upon my hands, [Namely, when I was fallen upon, and apprehended at Jerusalem and was necessitated to appeal unto Cesar to escape the violence of the Jews: when doubtless the believing Jews had great compassion on Paul, and afforded him all help. See Act. 21. 33.] and received with Joy [namely according to the exhortation and promise of Christ. Mat. 5. 11, 12. and according to the example of the Apostles. Act. 5. 41. See also 1 Thess. 2. 14.] the spoiling of your goods, knowing that ye have in yourselves [that is, in the hope which is in you] a better and abiding substance in the heavens.
\p
\v 35 . Cast not away therefore your boldness, [That is, your bold concession, springing from the boldness of faith, and hope in God, as is exprest heretofore vers. 23. Or your confidence] which hath a great recompense of reward : [namely of grace, and for Christ’s sake. See Rom. 11. 35. Col. 3. 24. Heb. 13. 21.]
\p
\v 36 . For ye have need of patience: [That is, steadfastness and patient expectation of the fulfilling of Gods promise, as the proof which the Apostle here relates out of the place of Habakuk, imports] that ye having done the will of God, may carry away the promise: [That is, the thing promised or inheritance. See Gal. 3. 22.]
\p
\v 37 . For, yet a very little (while) [Namely, there remaineth. These words are taken out of Hab. 2. 3. Hag. 2. 7. which the Apostle bringeth not word for word, but relateth the sense of them, and applies them to his purpose] (and) he [namely, the Messias, Christ] who is to come, shall come and not tarry.
\p
\v 38 . But the just shall live by faith: [See further of this translation on Rom. 1. 17.] and if (any one) withdraw, [namely, from this faith and patient expectation, by apostasy, and denial of Christ and his truth,] my soul hath no pleasure in him.
\p
\v 39 . But we are not [Hereby the Apostle mollifies the former threatening, namely that he hath not such an opinion of them, although he speaketh thus, as he also did heretofore in the like warning, chapter 6. vers. 9] of them that withdraw themselves, [Gr. Of the withdrawing] unto destruction, but of them that believe [Gr. Of faith] unto preservation [Gr. Obtaining, purchasing] of the soul: [that is, of the salvation of the soul: as Christ speaketh also Mat. 10. 39.]
\c 11
\s 1. The better to move the Hebrews to steadfastness in the faith, he describes faith to them, with its properties and operation. 4. And to that end produceth the examples of the faith of the ancient fathers of the old Testament, and first of all Abel. 5. And of Enoch. 7. and of Noah. 8. Afterward of Abraham. 11. And of Sarah. 13. Who with their seed received indeed the promises of the land of Canaan, but the fulfilling of them they obtained not upon earth, but in heaven, 17. Further he rehearseth the example of the faith of Abraham, in offering of his son Isaac. 20. And of Isaac in blessing of his son Jacob. 21. And of Jacob in blessing of the sons of Joseph. 22. And of Joseph on his death-bed . 23. Afterward of the parents of Moses. 24. And of Moses himself, in despising of his honour and ease in Pharaohs Court. 17. And in departing out of Egypt, keeping of the Passover, and going through the Red Sea. 30. Afterward of Joshua and of Rachah, in the taking of Jericho. 32. And withal of the Judges and Kings, who performed great things by faith. 35. Afterward of certain women, who endured great difficulties thereby. 39. Concludes that all these died in faith, although they obtained not the thing promised without us.
\p
\v 1 Now faith is a firm ground [Or a firm confidence, i.e. that causeth to subsist, or stand firm, and as it were present, the things which are promised by God in Christ, and which therefore are expected by hope which is not done only by an assent to God’s promises in our understanding, but also by a trusting to the same in our will. See Rom. 4. 18, etc. and above chapter 3. 14. Gr. Hypostasis, i.e. subsistence, of which word, see also 2 Cor. 9. 4. and 11. 17.] of things which are hoped, (and) an argument [or conviction: For faith respecting Gods revelation and promise, convinceth and assureth the heart of man more strongly of the truth of a thing, than any other argument brought forth from natural reason] of things which are not seen. [That is, even which are not comprehended by us, by natural sense or reason; Or which are not present before our deed believed also, as Christ speaketh to Thomas, Joh. 20. 29. notwithstanding this is not properly divine faith, which is wrought in us by the Holy Ghost, which looks only at God’s promise or revelation, whether the things be now past, present or to come: as will appear by the examples which Paul produceth.]
\p
\v 2 . For by the same the Ancients [Namely, Forefathers, from whom we are descended, and whose examples we must imitate] obtained testimony. [Namely, that they pleased God, as is expressed, ver. 5.]
\p
\v 3 . By faith we understand that the world [Gr. The ages, as chapter 1. ver. 2.] was prepared [That is, created, and brought into such order and form, as now we see it] by the word of God, [That is, by the powerful command of God. See Gen. 1. Psalms 33. 6.] so that the things which we see, were not made of things which are seen. [or, were made not visible, or seen things, i.e. out of nothing: whereunto no Philosopher by natural reason was able to attain.]
\p
\v 4 . By faith Abel offered to God a greater sacrifice then Cain, [some take this word greater for of greater price, because Abel made his offering of his fattest beasts, and Cain but of some flight fruits. But the same word is here as fitly taken for more worthy, and more acceptable to God, which the Apostle testifieth that it was done by the faith of Abel: namely, because Abel in this offering looked to that seed of the woman, which should tread upon the Serpents head, i.e. unto Christ, who by his death should destroy the Devil, Heb. 2. 14.] by which [namely, faith] he obtained witness that he was righteous. [this is not in so many words indeed, Gen. 4. 4. but the Apostle concludes the same out of that which is there expressed, that God respected him and his sacrifice, which title of righteousness Christ also therefore gives to Abel, Mat. 23. 35.] seeing God gave testimony of his gifts, [namely, by Moses, Gen. 4. 4. or by an extraordinary sign from heaven concerning his sacrifice, as was done concerning Aaron’s sacrifice, Lev. 9. 24. concerning Elias’s, 1 Kin. 18. 38. Davids, 1 Chronicles 21. 26. Solomons, 2 Chron. 7. 1. by sending of fire from heaven: which is therefore probable, because Cain seeing the same, was kindled with wrath and envy towards his brother] and by the same (faith) he speaketh still, [namely, not only by his good example in Gods word, but also by his blood, which after his death cried unto God for vengeance. See Gen. 4. 10. Heb. 12. 24.] since he is dead.
\p
\v 5 . But faith Enoch was taken away [Gr. Translated, Namely, from earth into heaven, as is expressed concerning Elias, 2 Kin. 2. 1.] that he should not see death, [that is, suffer or feel: as this word see is also taken, Psal. 16. 10. Joh. 8. 51. From whence it appears that his body put off immortality in this taking up into heaven, and was into an immortal and glorified body, as may be read concerning Elias, Luk. 9. 30. and of all believers at the last day, 1 Cor. 15, 51. and Thes. 4. 15.] and he was not found, because that God had taken him away: for before his taking away he had testimony that he pleased God. [This indeed the Text saith not, Gen. 5. 22. but the Apostle concludes this from that which is there exprest, that he continually walked before God.]
\p
\v 6 . For without faith it is impossible to please (God) [Or it is impossible that he pleased God, namely, to eternal salvation. The reason is, because no man can so please God without Christ, Joh. 14. 6. Act. 12. 4.] for he that cometh to God [that is, he that steadfastly walketh before God, as Moses speaketh of Enoch, Gen. 5. 22, 24. Or he that serveth God, and seeketh to enjoy his favour] must believe that he is, [namely, not only an essential being, but also such a one as he hath revealed himself in his word, not accordingly to the Law, but according to the Gospel, which the faith whereof Paul here speaketh properly respecteth, Rom. 1. ver. 16. 17.] and is a rewarded [ or reward-giver, recompenser, i.e. performer of his promises in rewarding of them which seek him. For this reward cannot be hoped for but by a promise going before, which faith looketh at. Which here must necessarily be, not a promise of the Law, but of the Gospel, forasmuch as no man can be partaker of the promise of the eternal inheritance by the Law. See Gal. 3. 18.] of them that seek him. [namely, by the way revealed in the Gospel, Joh. 17. 3.]
\p
\v 7 . By faith Noah, being admonished by a divine oracle of the things which were not as seen, [That is, which were not yet present. Namely of the flood, and of his preservation of the Ark (and) being afraid [namely, with a reverential and filial fear of God’s threatening against the world, and of God’s promises unto him] prepared the Ark for the preservation of his household: by which (Ark) he condemned the world [namely, by his example, in the presence of all, as Matth. 12. 41, 42.] and became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith: [that is, partaker or possessor, not only of his life whereof the ungodly Cham was also partaker, but also of eternal life, which is obtained only by the righteousness of faith, Rom. 4. 13. etc.]
\p
\v 8 . By faith Abraham being called [Namely, out of Ur in Chaldea. See Act. 7. 2. & c.] was obedient, to go forth unto the place [that is, to the land of Canaan, although this was not yet made known to him at his first calling. See Gen. 12. 1.] which he should receive for inheritance: and he went forth not knowing he should come.
\p
\v 9 . By faith he was an inhabitant in the land of promise as in a strange land and dwells in tabernacle [namely as strangers and travelers used to do that they might be able to make them up again and carry them to other places as with us tents are wont to be used for this purpose ] with Isaac and Jacob who were co-heirs of the same promise [namely of the future possession of the land of Canaan and consequently also of eternal life .]
\p
\v 10 . For the expected city [that is heaven or the heavenly Jerusalem whereby the land of Canaan afterwards Jerusalem also were but shadows ]which hath foundations [namely which are firm and unmovable and the apostle opposeth this to the tabernacle which had no foundation see hereafter chapter 13.14 Revelations 3.12 and 21.2 &c] whose artificer [that is delineator or order according to art as used to be done before men proceed to build of cities ] and builder is God.
\p
\v 11 . By faith Sarah herself received power to give seed [Gr for casting or laying a foundation of seed which is not understood of Abraham only from whom Sarah received seed but also of Sarah herself who is in conception of the power of faith gave her own seed thereunto that as is done in all natural conception see also Levit. 12.2 ] and beyond the time of her age [namely seeing she was now ninety years old and besides that barren see Gen.161.1 Romans 4.19] she brought forth for as much as she esteemed him faithfully who had promised it [for although Sarah laughed at it in the beginning yet nevertheless afterwards she held fast to the promise.]
\p
\v 12 . Therefore also from one and that one dead [namely not only in respect of Sarah ,but also of himself as Paul declares Rom.4.19 that Abraham therefore after the death of Sarah got divers children more by Ketura must be ascribed to the new youth which he received by this new promise ]were born so many in multitudes as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the sea shores [Gr lip] which is innumerable.
\p
\v 13 . These all died in faith not having obtained the promises [that is the thing that was divers time promised them of the propriety of the land of Canaan and the seed wherein all generations of the earth should be blessed ] but saw the same afar off and believed and embraced them and confessed that they were guests and strangers upon earth [ as is exprestly testified by Jacob when he stood before Pharaoh Gen. 47.9 & of others before and after him Genesis 15.13 and 28.4 Psalms 39.13]
\p
\v 14 . For they that say such things [namely that they are strangers and guests upon earth ]show clearly that they seek a country [namely that is out of this world in heaven as is declared in verse 16.]
\p
\v 15 . And if they had been mindful of that country from which they had gone forth [namely hereupon earth as was the land of Mesopotamia and Chaldea from whence Abraham and his family was gone forth they might have time to return.
\p
\v 16 . But now are they disastrous of a better that is of the heavenly therefore God is now ashamed of them [that is disdaineth not ]to be called their God [namely even after their death as he is everywhere called their God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob see Exodus 3.6 from whence Christ himself concludes that therefore these were not children of God only while they lived upon earth but that their bodies should also rise again seeing God is not a God of the dead but of a living Matthew 22.31,32] for he had prepared them a city [namely which had foundation in heaven wherein God himself revealed his glory and should receive them as true citizens Philippians 3.20]
\p
\v 17 . By faith Abraham when he was tempted [that is was tried or was required by God to give a firm evidence of his obedience Genesis 22.] offered Isaac [that is was ready to offer him and was busied in offering him] and he that hath received the promises offered his only begotten [so Isaac was called because he only was born of free women and Ishmael of the bond women was no true heir.]
\p
\v 18 . Unto whom [or of whom as the Greek word pros may also be so taken chapter 1 verse 7,8] it was said in Isaac shall the seed he called thee reasoning [ that is concluding or considering with himself by faith which stood fast on Gods promises ]that God was able to raise him even from the dead.
\p
\v 19 . From whence also by similitude got him again [this the apostle adds because he was already to be account him dead whom God commanded to be slain out which state as a state of death he afterwards received him again when God hindered him from this.]
\p
\v 20 . By faith Isaac blessed his sons Jacob and Esau concerning things to come [that is in his blessing so divided the land of Canaan and parts adjacent and so subjected to Esau posterity as if they had already had the full possession therefore .]
\p
\v 21 . By faith Jacob dying [that is being near unto death on his death bed] blessed each one of sons of Joseph and worshipped [namely of his staff as is some perversely think but on his staff the god of his fathers and the angels that is the son of God who had stood by him until that time and delivered him from many troubles as may be seen Genesis 48.3,15] leaning on the top of his staff [the Hebrew text Genesis 47.31 saith on the head or head-end of the bed but the Greek translators for Mittah that is bed red Mitteh that is rod or staff which the translators the apostle here follows seeing both may be true for by comparing Genesis 48.31 with Genesis 48.2 it appears that Jacob when he blessed the sons of Joseph and afterwards also his son and sat on his bed and by reason of his weakness rested upon a staff seeing his legs hung from the bed which after the blessing he plucked in again Genesis 49.3]
\p
\v 22 . By faith Joseph dying made mention of he going out of the children of Israel [that is testified that God would fulfill his promise of delivering the children of Israel out of Egypt see Genesis 50.24 &c ] and gave command concerning his bones [that is of taking of bones with hem into the land of Canaan not out of superstitions or to have his bones worshipped there which was never done but hereby to testify the communion which he had with the brethren in the promise of God and his hope of fulfilling of the same even after his death and to confirm their posterity therein ]
\p
\v 23 . By faith Moses when he was hidden for three months of his parents[ Gr father that is parents namely Am ram and Jochebed Exodus 6.19 who by the fairness of the child were moved to expect some special thing from him which the apostle here ascribes to their faith in Gods Josephus the historian testfies Antiq lib. 2 chapter 5 tat is was made known to the father of Moses by a divine revelation that is son should deliver them out of Egypt ]for as much as they saw that the son was fair and they feared not the kings commandment [namely so that they would not kill the child according to the kings commandment although there was weakness in their faith when nevertheless after they laid it as a foundling by the river yet with hope that some one would find it and bring it up as came to pass faith then although it will be joined with weakness is here accounted for a true faith .]
\p
\v 24 . By faith when Moses being now become great [namely being now forty years old as Stephen testifies Acts 7.23 ] refused to be called a son of Pharaohs daughter [for he had adopted him for a son Exodus 2.10 Acts 7.21 ]
\p
\v 25 . Choosing rather to be ill-entreated with the people of God then for a time to have the enjoyment of a sin [that is the delights and accommodations of Pharaohs court which he cold not enjoy without sinning against God .]
\p
\v 26 . Esteeming the reproach of Christ that is which he must suffer for the expectation of Christ and after the example of Christ see the like 2 Corinthians 1.5 Colossians for Moses also saw Christ day & rejoiced therein as is said of Abraham John 8.56 ] to be greater riches then treasure in Egypt for he respected the recompense of the rewards [namely which should be eternal and unperishing in heaven 1Peter 1 verse 4,5,6 to which believers also may have respect as to a reward not which God oweth them or which they do merit but which god their father promiseth of grace that he will give unto them as unto his children see Matthew 5 verse 10.11,12,13.]
\p
\v 27 . By faith he forsook Egypt [namely with the whole people of Israel not withstanding the Kings threatening see Exodus 10.29.] not fearing the wrath of the king for he kept himself fast [namely to Gods commandments without turning from it by fear or he was courageous steadfast ] as seeing [ namely by faith ] the invisible [ namely Gods see Psalms 56.21 and 118.6 Romans 8.31.]
\p
\v 28 . By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood [Gr powering on namely on the threshold and posts of the doors of Israelites Exodus 12.21 &c ] thus the destroyer of the first born should not touch them [that is not harm or hurt them.]
\p
\v 29 . By faith they went through the red sea [namely Moses, Aaron and other Israelites for although some among them had no true faith as the apostles testifieth before chapter 3.18 yet they were also many true believers with him see chapter 3.16 to whom here respect is properly ad] as through the dry land which the Egyptians also trying [whereof the Egyptians having made proof ] were drowned .
\p
\v 30 . By faith [namely of Joshua and other upright Israelites as in the former verse ] the walls of Jericho fell when they have been compassed about [namely by the army of the Israelites with sounds of trumpets Joshua 6.20] for seven days.
\p
\v 31 . By faith Rehab the harlot [the Hebrew word Zonah signifieth the hostess and the spies went into the house to lodge Joshua2.1 but seeing the apostle here as also James in his epistle chapter 2.25 calleth her an harlot it seems that he made profession of both as was usual among the gentile there being also mention made by her husband Joshua 2.18 but afterwards being converted unto god she became an example of faith and uprightness and among the Israelites married with Solomon the father of Boaz one of the forefathers of David and consequently of Christ also see Matthew 1.5] perished not with the disobedient [that is the other abstinent and the impenitent men within Jericho ] when she had received the spies with peace [that is courteously and being helpful t them in all things ]
\p
\v 32 . and what shall I yet say more / for the time will fail me should I relate of Gideon and Barak and Samson and Japheth and David and Samuel and the prophets [namely which were among the people of Israel among David and Samuel .]
\p
\v 33 . Who through faith overcame kingdoms [namely as Joshua one and thirty kings and David overcame all that lay around about the land of Canaan ]practiced righteousness [namely not in leading a righteous life but also in exercising of oblique justice as many godly judges and kings did ] obtained the promises [that is fulfilling of the promises that were made unto them as there was the possessing of the land of Canaan and of some special benefits as to Sarah Anna and c and also in general forgiveness of sins adoption to children and inheritance of eternal life see before verse 16 Acts 15.11 ] stepped the mouths of Lions [namely as Sampson Judges 14.6 David 1Samuel 17.34 and Daniel 6.22.]
\p
\v 34 . Quenched the powers of fire [namely as Daniels companion see Daniel 3.25] escaped the edge of the sword namely as David the sword of Saul 1Samuel 20 Elias the sword of Ahab 1 Kings 19 Elizeus the sword of Syrian 2Kings 6.] out of the weakness got abilities [namely as Job, Job 42 David Psalms 6 Hezekiah Isaish 38] became strong in war [namely as many judges and kings ]put to flight armies of strangers [namely as Jonathan 1Samuel 14]
\p
\v 35 . Women [as the widow of Serepta by Elias 1 Kings 17 and Shumamitish woman 2Kings 4by Elizeus [got their dead again from resurrection[that is after they were raised up from the dead by the prophets ]and others were wracked [namely as the head of the drum to be afterwards beaten with the starves and tortured to death as the Greek word imports and the apostle here hath respect to the example of Eleazar and such like torturing under the Tyrant Antiochus whereof may be read 2Miccha 6.18 &c ] not accepting the offer deliverance [namely which was offered by he servant of the Antiochus if he would but do contrary to the law of God as they desired ]that they might obtain a better resurrection [namely hereafter at the last day Daniel 12.2]
\p
\v 36 . And others underwent the trials of mocking [namely as Micah 1 kings 22 Amos Jeremy &c ] and scourges and also hands and imprisonment .
\p
\v 37 . Were stoned [as Zacharias the sons of Jojada 2ccorinthians 24] sawed in peace [as the ancient Jewish Histories testify of Isaiah under Tyranny of Manasse from whence it appears the apostle relate histories not only out of divine histories but also out of their histories known by Hebrew as is also noted on the 35 verse] tempted [namely by grievous threatennings and tortures ]put to death by the sword [Gr by the death of the sword as many in the time of Manasse 2Kings 21.16 and under Tyrants ]walked [Gr went about namely wandering here and there ]in sheep skins and in goats skins [as is testified of Elias 2Kings 1.8 and was the habit of the prophets in general as may be seen Zach 13.4]being forsaken ill treated and forsaken:
\p
\v 38 . Of whom the world was not worthy [worldly men accounted such believers of the off-scouring of the world but on the contrary the apostle testifies that the worldly was not worthy of them and that therefore God sustained them as out of the society of the world as David long wandered in the wilderness 1Samuel chapter 22 .23 ,24 and Elias under Ahab 1 Kings 19 and those hundred prophets which were hidden in caves 1 Kings 18 as also many others whereof histories make mention ] they wandered in wilderness and on mountains and in cave and in holes of the earth.
\p
\v 39 . And these all [namely of whom mention is made in this chapter ] having had testimony by faith obtained not the promise [hat is the thing promised namely Christ manifested in the flesh with the fulfilling of the shadow of the testament and state of church and promised under him throughout the whole world see Luke 10.23 ,24]
\p
\v 40 . Seeing God had provided some what better concerning us [namely that all should be accomplished in our time ] that they [ or so tat they without us ] without us should not be made perfect [some understand this of their salvation in heaven but this is contrary to what which is noted on the example of Enoch verse5 and contrary to that which is spoken of their hope heretofore verse 16 and contrary to the promise of Christ Matthew 5.12 and other places of scripture also contrary to the time in which Paul wrote this when as Christ was now long ago ascended into heaven and therefore the forefathers also even according to their opinion were brought into heaven therefore this is understood of Christ coming in heaven in the flesh and the perfecting of the state of the church under the new testament the new should not have been necessary and they should have had their perfection from another cause then we without us therefore may fitly be taken for by another cause then we.]
\c 12
\s From the examples of the former chapter the apostle exhorts the Hebrew to constancy in the Christians hope and the patience in affliction 2 to this end proposeth Christ example unto them who through suffering entered his glory 5 also the example of all true children who were not without chastisement 12 afterwards exhorts them to quickening of the for their sluggishness 14 and with all to peace and holiness 15 warns thou against apostasy and against whoredom and prophaneness by the example of Esau 18 to that end also sets before their eyes the dignity of the assembly of earth and of heaven whereunto they are come with an opposition of the terribleness of all things in the giving of the law 25 Warns them again of apostasy by a place taken out of Haggai 2.7,28 and exhorts them to hold fast to the grace of God by propounding the punishment which shall come upon apostasy.
\p
\v 1 Therefore also seeing we have so great a cloud of witnesses as are rehearsed in the former chapter who have steadfastly and patiently persevered in faith and hope ] lying round about us [so the apostle speaketh because even as the cloud that hangeth round about us in the ayre is always seen by us where so ever we turn ourselves in Gods word we find these examples before our eyes ] let us lay aside every burden [namely of worldly care encumbrance and voluptuousness as Christ also exhorts his Luke 21.34 ] and the sin [he understands here especially the sin of concupiscence which easily ariseth in us of itself out of the reminders of corrupt nature or by the occasions which outwardly happen &c brings forth impediments to us in our Christian course which we must withstand and cast from us see Romans 8.1,13] which easily compasseth us [ Gr which easily stands about us ] and let us with patient run or by the patience run for when the race is long and they are difficulties on the way there is need of patience in running that we might not faint ] the race [ or the strife of running for the Greek word agon signifieth both and the holy scripture elsewhere also compares the state and the life of a Christians to a running of a prize or a strife in running 1Corinthians 9.24 2Timothy 4.7] which is set before us .
\p
\v 2 . Looking unto the chief leader and finisher of faith Jesus [namely before all for although we also do well looking unto the foregoing witness nevertheless we must before all herein cast our eyes upon Christ who is the leader unto faith and the perfecta of the same]who for the joy[that is instead of the joy namely the use whereof he might have retained if he had not humbled himself for our sake and chosen the cross Philippians 2.6 others translate it for the joy namely unto which suffering he should not only come himself but also bring the faithful Luke 24.26 1 Peter 1.11 ] which was set before him endured the cross and despised the shame [namely which was cast upon him by sinners both in life and death as is declared in the following verse ] and is set at the right hand of the throne of God [namely afterwards when he had steadfastly and patiently overcome this for an example unto us all of an happy issue .]
\p
\v 3 . For take notice of this man [namely Jesus who is great and glorious that we cannot be compared to him ]who endured such a contradiction [hereby is understood all contempt reproach and infamy which was cast upon Christ even unto shameful death of the cross] of sinners [that is of ungodly and unrighteous man who was able to have strike down with one word as this word is also taken Psalms 1.1 Job 9.25,31] against him that ye do not languish [or grow remiss] and faint in your souls [that is in the constant hope and patience of your soul ]
\p
\v 4 . Ye have not yet resisted unto blood [that is to the utmost or even unto death ]striving against sin [some take the word sin here for sinners as is exprest verse3 others of sin itself which is in us whereof he spoke verse1 which we must lay aside with grievous conflicts even by chastisement and affliction themselves as is declared verse 10,11 ]
\p
\v 5 . And ye have forgotten [or and have ye forgotten by way of question ] the exhortation [namely of wisdom Proverbs 3.11 ,12] which speaketh unto ye as unto children my son sleight not the chastisement of the Lord [the Greek word paidea signifies property a chastisement which is given unto children for their amendment] neither feint thou when thou art rebuked of him [or gain said chastised with words.]
\p
\v 6 . For whom the Lord loveth the chasteneth and he scourgeth every son whom he received [that is acknowledge and hold for his son .]
\p
\v 7 . If ye endure chastisement [namely patiently or willingly as before ]God carrieth himself towards ye as the sons [that is this is a certain sign to ye that ye are true children and that God sends them to ye as a father for the ungodly also are indeed punished by God but as by a judge and oftentimes speak blasphemies against the God of heaven in these punishments see Revelations 16.10,11 or fall into despair as Saul Judas ] fro what son is there whom the father chastineth not?
\p
\v 8 . But ye be with chastisement of which all are made partakers [namely true and right children ] then ye are bastards [namely whom the father oftentimes put far from them and for whom many time they take no right care because they are not their right heirs ] and not sons .
\p
\v 9 . Furthermore we had indeed the fathers of the flesh [that is our bodies as the opposition of the father of the spirit requires ]chastiser and we reverenced them shall we not then much rather be subject to the spirit is also taken hereafter verse 23 And God is peculiarly called a father of spirits because our souls are immediately created by him in our bodies see hereof also Numbers 16.22 and 27.16 Ecclesiastes 12.7 Zac.12.1 ] and live?
\p
\v 10 . For they indeed chastised us for a short time [Gr for new days that is in years of our youths ]as it seemed good unto them but he chastised us for our profits that we might be partakers of his holiness [for by mortifying of sins and by the exercising of patience we increase more and more in holiness wherefore chastisements are means and instruments.]
\p
\v 11 . And all chastisement when it is presented seemeth to be no matter of joy but of grief but afterwards it yields from its peaceable fruits of righteousness [that is of righteousness which brings our conscience peace and joy instead of the grief which is chastisement procured us namely seeing we are thereby assured that we are true children ]to them who are exercised by the same [namely with patience and sufferance as before .]
\p
\v 12 . Therefore raise up again the slow hands and feeble knees [namely to run with joy in the race unto the end and is the conclusion of the exhortation propounded in the first verse .]
\p
\v 13 . And make right paths for your feet[ or steps with your feet ]that which is lame may be wrenched [that is turn not more and more out of the way or out of joint the apostle proceeds in the similitude begun of running in the right path even unto the end and that without turning away to one side or the other for many among the Jews converted to Christianity looked always about towards Judaism and went not straight forward see Acts 15.1 Galatians 2.14] but (that) much rather it may be healed.
\p
\v 14 . Follow after peace with all [Namely, as much as is possible, and as much as in you is, always keeping a good conscience and peace with God. See Rom. 12. 18.] and sanctification, without which [namely, sanctification, as the Greek word necessarily imports, although it be true also of both. See Matth. 5. 8, 9. Joh. 13. 35.] no man shall see the Lord. [namely, in the life to come. See 1 Cor. 6. 9.]
\p
\v 15 . Looking to it lest any one stay behind [That is abide behind, turn away] from the grace of God: lest any root of bitterness [ so the Apostle especially calls seducers, and those who seek to bring others to apostasy, having respect to the like exhortation of Moses, Deut. 29. 18. because the end of such is trouble and bitterness in soul] springing upwards make disturbance, [namely, in your Congregation] and by the same many be made impure. [that is, defiled also and brought to apostasy.]
\p
\v 16 . Lest any one be a fornicatour, or an unholy one, [That is, profane, who looketh not after any holy or divine things] as Esau, who for one mess of meat, gave away his right of first-born. [namely, which not only gave advantage in the fan ily above the other brethren, but was also a type of all spiritual advantage in the house of God, as is showed hereafter, ver., 23.]
\p
\v 17 . For ye know that afterward also when he would inherit the blessing he was rejected, [Or thrust away, Namely, by his Father Isaac, in respect of his first and spiritual blessing, which Jacob had now carried away] for he found no place of sorrow [namely, with his Father Isaac, so that Isaac should have sorrowed for blessing of Jacob: for this sorrow was that which Esau sought with tears, as may be seen, Gen. 27. 36.] although he sought the same with tears. [namely, the blessing. Or the same, namely, sorrow of his Father. For that Esau sought no sorrow of his own misdeed appears from thence, that presently after he sought after Jacobs life.]
\p
\v 18 . For ye are not come [This depends upon the foregoing exhortation to peace, sanctification, & c, because the Israelites when they were to hear the Law, Exod. 20. must sanctify themselves, wash their clothes and abstain from their wives three days before. See Exo. 19. 10, & c. Must they do this then when they heard God pronounce the Law, how much more must ye purify yourselves according to the Spirit, now ye come to the assembly of the new Testament, to hear the voice of Christ] to the mount that may be touched, [that is, the visible mountain. Namely, Sinai or Horeh: of which, see Exod. 19. 17. & c. and 20. 18. Deut. 5. 2.] and the burning fire, and blackness, and darkness, and tempest:
\p
\v 19 . And unto the sound of the trumpet, and the voice of words [That is, of the ten words or commandments: for thereupon followed this desire of the people, Exod. 20. 19. and Deut. 5. 25.] which they that heard it, besought that the word might not be propounded to them any more.
\p
\v 20 . (For they could not bear [That is, endure, without being astonished and afraid at it] that which was commanded, if even a beast [ that is, not only any man, but even any beast, Exod. 19. 13.] touched the mountain, it shall be stoned, or shot through with an arrow.
\p
\v 21 . And Moses, These words of Moses are not found indeed, Exod. 19. but the Apostle inferred them from that which is there spoken, ver. 19. of the speech of Moses unto God in this dread. Or he hath it out of some Historical Traditions, as that which he saith of Jannes and Jambers, 2 Tim. 3. 8. Or by a special Revelation, as Moses had the whole order of the work of creation] so terrible was the sight, said, I am greatly afraid and trembling.)
\p
\v 22 . But ye are come unto the mount Sion [That is, unto the universal Church, or the true congregation of Jesus Christ, whereof the mount Sion was a type. See Psalm 2. 6. Isa. 2. 3. and 49. 14. etc. which immediately after is also called the City of God, and the heavenly Jerusalem, because it is set up, especially governed, and glorified by God out of heaven. See Revel. 3. 12. and 21. 27. See also Zach. 2. 7, & c.] and the City of the living God, unto the heavenly Jerusalem, and the many thousands of Angels, [namely, who are also Ministers of Christ, and fellow servants of believers, as the Angel speaketh, Rev. 19. 10 and 22. 9.]
\p
\v 23 . To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, [that is, of the elect, who by the special grace of God have received many heavenly privileges above other men] who are written in the heavens, [Namely, in the book of life. See Luk. 10. 20. Phil. 4. 3. Rev. 13. 8.] and to God the Judge over all, and the spirits [that is, the souls of those who possess perfect holiness and salvation in heaven. See 1 Cor. 13. 10. although they expect yet another perfection with their bodies at the last day, 2 Tim. 4. 8.] of perfected [Or sanctified] just ones.
\p
\v 24 . And unto the Mediator of the New Testament Jesus, [Namely, opposed to Moses, who was but a type of the true Mediator Jesus Christ] and the blood of sprinkling, [namely, wherewith the new Testament is confirmed, and our consciences are purified. See cha. 9. 11, & c.] that speaketh better things than Abel: [that is, then the blood of Abel, which cried for vengeance before God, Gen. 4. 10. whereas the blood of Christ cries for reconciliation and peace with God.]
\p
\v 25 . Take heed that ye reject not him that speaketh: [Namely, Christ, who speaketh by his Spirit and word] for if they escaped not [namely, the wrath or judgement of God] who rejected him, that gave divine answers on earth [namely Moses. For the Apostle continually sets before their eyes the example of the Israelites in the wilderness, their rebellion against Moses, and the judgements following thereupon] much more (shall) not we (escape) if we return away from who (is) from the heavens. [namely, Jesus Christ the Son of God, who came down from heaven, Joh. 3. 13. and is the Lord from heaven at the right hand of his Father, continually speaketh unto us by his Spirit and Ministers.]
\p
\v 26 . Whose voice [Namely Jesus Christ: For he was that Angel of God’s face that spoke to Moses, Exod. 3. ver. 2. 4. & c. and by whom also the Law was given, Act. 7. 38.] then moved the earth [namely, in giving of the Law: whereof see Exod. 19.] but now he hath [namely, the same Jesus Christ, as the eternal Son of God, and Mediator betwixt God and men. For the whole contexture of the words requires this interpretation] declared [namely, by the prophet Haggai ch. 2. 7. where he prophesieth of the coming of Christ, and of the calling of the Gentiles] saying, yet once more I will more not only the earth but so heaven. [namely, partly by great wonders and miracles in heaven and earth, as happened in the coming of Christ, and at the time of his suffering and of his resurrection: but especially by the powerful preaching of the Gospel, and the Idolatry of the Gentiles was abolished, and the spiritual worship of God set up every where: which caused a great commotion and alteration, not only upon earth, but also in heaven, seeing even the Angels wonder at it, and are desirous to look thereunto, Ephes. 3. 10. 1 Pet. 1. 12.]
\p
\v 27 . And this (word) yet once more shows the changing of the moveable things, [That is, of the mutable, as the first Tabernacle and the worship of God thereunto belonging were] at which were made [namely, with men’s hand, of perishing matter] that the things which are not moveable [that is, the spiritual things which were signified thereby, and accomplished in the new Testament. Unto which also belongeth the new heaven and earth, of which Isaiah prophesieth, chapter 65. 17. & c.] might remain. [namely, unchangeable in the Church of God.]
\p
\v 28 . Therefore, seeing we receive an unmoveable kingdom, [Namely, which begins in us here, and shall be perfected hereafter] let us hold (fast) the grace [namely, which we have already received] by which we may serve God acceptably [namely, not by Ceremonial and outward things, but in Spiritual, which always please God in Christ. See Rom. 12. 1. and 14. 17, 18. Heb, 13. 21, & c.] with reverence and piety. [or, shamefulness and fear.]
\p
\v 29 . For our God is a consuming fire. [That is, as a consuming fire. Namely, towards them that are disobedient or Apostates. See Deut. 4. 24. Heb. 10. 31.]
\c 13
\s 1. The Apostle exhorts them to brotherly love. 2. To hospitality. 3. To remembrance of those that are in prison. 4. Declares that marriage is honourable among all. 5. Warns them of covetousness, and exhorts them to contentment. 7. And propounds to them the example of their Guides. 9. Warns them also of strange doctrine, and in particular of difference of meats. 10. For that end sets before their eyes a type in the propitiatory sacrifices, of which no man might eat. 15. Exhorts them to sacrifices of thankfulness, especially to confession of the name of God, and liberality. 17. And to obedience unto their guides. 19. Exhorts them to pray unto God for him, for his release. 20. And prayeth God to perfect them in all good works. 21. Concludes the Epistle with a new exhortation. 23. And promiseth that he will speedily see them again with Timothy, and sets down certain salutations from one side to the other.
\p
\v 1 Let brotherly love continue. [That is, persevere, even as ye have well begun therein. See chapter 6. 10.]
\p
\v 2 . Forget not hospitality, [Namely, towards strangers and banished Christians, who were oftentimes constrained to forsake their country, and knew not where to turn in. See also, Rom. 12. 13. 1 Pet. 4. 9. which virtue is especially commended to Pastors, 1 Tim. 3. 2. Tit. 1. 8.] for hereby some have unawares entertained Angels. [namely, even as Abraham, Gen. 18. 1. and Lot, Gen. 19. 1.]
\p
\v 3 . Remember the prisoners, as if ye also were prisoners: (and) those that are ill-intreated, as if you yourselves also were (ill-entreated) in the body. [Namely, so ill handled, or ill at ease as those. Or, as who yourselves also are in the body, i.e. in this corporal life, which is subject to many afflictions. Others understand it of the body of Christ, i.e. of his Church, in this sense, is who are also in the body, i.e. members of the same body. See 1 Cor. 12. ver. 25, 26.]
\p
\v 4 . Marriage (is) honourable among all [Gr. In all, i.e. in all things, or among all persons. For both ways it may be taken: in all things, namely, which the married estate according to God’s institution brings with it and requires. Or among all persons, Namely, of what State and calling soever they be ; so they do this lawfully and in the Lord, Lev. 18. 1 Cor. 7. 39. Others translate it, let marriage be honourable, so that the Apostle should here give the married a rule, according to which they ought to carry themselves. But the particle but which followeth suffers not this interpretation. The Apostle therefore here opposeth this exhortation to the abuse of many men, who ran into fornication, or by divorce into adultery, to avoid the burdens and inconveniences of marriages and also against some false teachers who in the times of the apostles and also afterwards rejected the married estate as dishonorable and defiled of whom the apostle adminisheth Timothy 4.3 ]and the bed undefiled but whoremongers and adulterers God shall judge.
\p
\v 5 . Let your walking [or your manners that is your conversations and dealing among men ] be with covetousness and be satisfied with that which is present [namely that the Lord affords you by your labor and in your calling without seeking after greater riches by unlawful ways or too great distraction see Matthew 6.31, &c 1Timothy 6.6 ] for he [namely God to Joshua Josh.1.5 and therefore in his person to all believers ]hath said I will not leave thee neither will I forsake thee .
\p
\v 6 . So that we dare boldly say [namely with David by faith Psalms 118.6] the Lord is the helper to me and I can not fear what man can do to me.
\p
\v 7 . Remember your guides [or leaders as verse 17 he speaketh especially of the apostles and other faithful teachers who had sealed their doctrine with their blood without regarding any worldly recompense but looked only to the eternal and heavenly as the following words show he would therefore always that they should remember their guides ,doctrine ,steadfastness in faith and patience in suffering but not that they should give them any religious honor ]who have spoken to you the word of God and imitate the faith beholding the issue of their conversation.
\p
\v 8 . Jesus Christ is yesterday and today the same and forever [that is as he was their helper in all trouble and even as they put their trust in him even as their doctrine held Jesus Christ only for the firm foundation of salvation even so he was always the same and shall so abide forever as being oneself same God and oneself same mediator as well in the old an din the new testament see 1 Corinthians 3.11 Ephesians 2.20 Revelation 1.8and 22.13]
\p
\v 9 . Be not carried about [that is therefore be not for it is a conclusion drawn from the exhortation of the two foregoing verses ]with divers and strange doctrines for it is good that the heart be strengthened by grace [that is by the thing itself which was signified by the ceremonies of the old testament both by the ceremonial shadows whereof he rehearseth one sort namely the difference of meats and comprehending the rest under it see the like signification of the word grace John 1.17 Acts 15.10,11] not by meats by which they got no profits [namely for the soul and considered in themselves for the kingdom of heaven is neither drink or meat but righteousness and peace and joy for the holy ghost Romans 14.17] who walked therein.
\p
\v 10 . We have an altar [whereby is understood no altar of stone or outward altar for then the apostle must have said that we have or must have many altars namely in all temples or corners of the temple but he speaketh of a spiritual altar namely Christ Jesus himself who through the eternal spirit offered up himself unblameable Hebrews 9.14 therefore as Christ’s flesh is the sacrifice even as the altar used to sanctify the offering according to the testimony of Christ Matthew 23.19 And Christ is also called our altar because on him we must offer up our prayers and thanksgiving unto God see Revelations 6.9 and 8.3] of which they have no power to eat [that is they have no power to have spiritual communion as Paul declares 1Corinthians 10.16 ]who save the Tabernacle [that is who will still have the communion in the ceremonies of the old testament to seek the part of their salvation therein see Galatians 5.2]
\p
\v 11 . For what beasts blood or sin [that is for an offering for sin ]is carried into the sanctuary [that is in the holy of holies on the day of atonement which was the tenth day of the seventh month Leviticus 23.27] by the high priest the bodies of the same [namely slain beasts ]were burnt[namely by Gods command whereof see Leviticus 16.7] without the camp [namely of the Israelites in the wilderness from whence the apostle as a type concludes that the believers who have communion in the blood of Christ and his merit must have their communion in external worship with that carnal Israel or Jerusalem now after that our high priest hath accomplished his sacrifice without it and eternal into the true holy of holies with his blood ]
\p
\v 12 . Therefore Jesus also [that is the second conclusion of the apostle from the fore going type of the burning of the bodies of the beasts without the camp namely that Christ without the guests of the city of Jerusalem in which all he ceremonies of the old testament were exercised must suffer the fire of Gods wrath to reconcile us unto God ]hat he might sanctify the people [namely the spiritual Israel and the children of promise which the angel calls the people of Christ Matthew 1,21 and Christ his sheep John 10.15,16 and those that the father hath given him John 17.9 &c.] by his own blood suffered without the gate.
\p
\v 13 . Let us therefore go forth [namely by a true faith without binding ourselves anymore to any other ceremonies ]unto him [namely only] without the camp [namely in which all the ceremonies of Israelites the priest were administered and used ]hearing his reproach [this is adjoined for two reasons first because without the camp as also afterwards without the city of Jerusalem was the place where male factors as from thence forth unworthy of the society of men used to be brought forth to be put to death as may be seen Leviticus 24.14 Joshua 7.24 Acts 7.58 moreover also because the Jews encountered it a great reproach to have no communion in the ceremonies of the law see Acts 10 verse 14 ,15,28 Galatians 2.12,13 Paul therefore exhorts them that notwithstanding all reproach and persecution of the Jews and also of the world for this cause they shall betake themselves unto Christ alone and his sacrifice and continue steadfastly therein .]
\p
\v 14 . For we have here continuing city [that is no firm city which hath firm foundations or were make it our work to continue long and to seek our happiness ]but we seek that to come[ that is which hath firm foundation and is eternal to heaven see below chapter 11.10 ,16]
\p
\v 15 . Let us therefore by him [namely Jesus Christ that is relying by faith upon him and his merit and intercession see 1 Peter 2.5and 1John 2.1 ]always offer up to god a sacrifice of praise that is the fruit of the lips [that is not as the Israelites of the firstlings of the fruits of the earth but the fruits of our lips which Hosea chapter 14.3 calls the calves of the lips that is thanksgiving for the benefits procured ]which confess his name[that is thank and praise as Matthew11.25 Romans 14.11]
\p
\v 16 . And forget not liberality and communicativeness for in such sacrifices [namely of thankfulness of Christ alone in the sacrifice of our reconciliation with God as the apostle hath divers time testified see before Hebrews 29.25,26,27,28 and 10.14,18] God taketh pleasure [namely in Christ Jesus as is exprest hereafter verse 21 as therefore the obedience of a child although it merits not the of his father and of a subject to his magistrate nevertheless is acceptable also our bounty is well pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ although we can not merit for it before him see Luke 17.10 Romans 11.35]
\p
\v 17 . Be obedient [namely in all things that they command you out of Gods word according to Gods word as is exprest Ezekiel 3.2 otherwise Christ commands his disciples also shall take heed of the leaven that is evil doctrine of the Pharisees Matthew 16.6,12] to your guides [that is pastors and teachers as before verse 7 whereby is exprestly not the dignity of the office of the teachers but also their duty as also in the following words that they watch for their souls see Ezekiel 3.18] and be subject to them for they watch for your souls as who shall give account [ namely if anyone perish by their negligence or ill example see Ezekiel 3.28 1Timothy 4.16 ]that they may do that with joy and not fighting [namely for the unthankfulnes or he stiffneckedness of the people ]for that is not profitable for you.
\p
\v 18 . Pray for us, for we trust that we have a good conscience [Namely in all our doing and teaching :especially as concerning the of the ceremonies ,of which he had spoken a little before ,and unto which the Jews could hardly give way .See the like,Act.23.1. 1Corinthians4.4.2 ,2Corinthians 1.12] as who in all things [or amongst all as verse 4] would walk honestly [that is uprightly according to Gods will and command as is declared 2Corithians 1.12]
\p
\v 19 . And I entreat you the more to do this that I may the sooner be restored unto you[as the apostle not only here but also elsewhere testifieth this his hope that he shall be delivered out of his hands see Philippians 2.24 Philemon verse 22]
\p
\v 20 . Now the God of peace [with this prayer the apostle according to his custome concludes the epistle and calls God a God of peace as also Romans 15.33 and 16.20 2 Corinthians 13.11 in respect of he gospel of peace whereby peace with God and men is published unto us as actually imparted see Luke 2.14 Romans 5.1 Ephesians 2.14 ,15] who hath brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep [namely Jesus Christ as it is followeth whom the apostle so calleth not only because he redeemed his sheep in a special manner but also because he is a pastor of all pastors See John 10.11 &c 1Peter 5.4] by the blood [that is by which the new and consequently also enduring testament is confirmed Hebrews 9.12 and these words in the blood or by the blood may be joined either to the words great shepherd of the sheep so that he is therefore great and good shepherd because he hath to ever reconciled his sheep by his blood or else to the words hath brought again from the dead because he having confirmed the everlasting testament by his blood according to the prediction of his prophets could no longer be detained as Peter testifies Acts 2.24&c ]of the everlasting testament [that is which is never changed as he first was changed and consequently is of an ever enduring virtue ]namely our Lord Jesus Christ :
\p
\v 21 . He perfect you [or prepare you make ye fit in all good works that is finish in
\p ye that which may yet be wanting as the Greek word properly imports ]in the very good work that ye may do his will working in ye [Gr making in ye namely by his holy spirit see Philippians 2.13]that which is well pleasing before him by Jesus Christ to whom be glory [namely to Jesus Christ this praise is never given to any in Gods word but to the true eternal God ] to eternity [Gr unto ages of ages ]Amen.
\p
\v 22 But I beseech ye brethren hear the word of this exhortation which occur in the epistle especially chapter 6 and 10 ]for I have written unto ye briefly [that is said not in respect of other epistles but in respect of the abundance and difficulties of the matter which the apostle here briefly handles .]
\p
\v 23 . know ye that our brother Timothy is released [from hence it seems that Timothy had been imprisoned somewhere in Asia as some also concludes from 1Timothy 6.12 although Luke makes no mention therefore in the Acts of the apostle seeing he goes no further in his histories then unto the imprisonment of Paul in Rome ]with whom if he come speedily I will see ye [from hence some conclude that Paul was now free from his imprisonment when he wrote this epistle as this is also gathered by many from 2Timothy 4.17 ,18 and many ancient teachers write that after his first enlargement at Rome he made one journey more into Syria and other places but these words may also be understood of good hope which he then had of his enlargement whereof is spoken before in the verse 9.]
\p
\v 24 . Salute all your guides [that is pastors teachers as heretofore verse 7.17] and all saints [that is believing Christians as may be seen everywhere in the titles of Paul’s epistle ]they that are of Italy [that is not only of Rome but they that oftentimes visited him out of all Italy see Acts 28.30,31]salute ye .
\p
\v 25 . Grace [namely of Jesus Christ as the apostle adds in other of his epistle ] be with ye all Amen.
\cls The epistle to the Hebrew was written from Italy and sent by Timothy [this post script is not sure here neither as was also noted divers time in other epistles for how this epistle be sent by Timothy whereas it is said verse 23 that Timothy was not yet to come unto him and that as soon as Timothy should became unto him he would come unto them.]
