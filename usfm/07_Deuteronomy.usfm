\mt DEUTERONOMIE
\s The argument of this book
\p This book is by a word borrowed from the Greek language, called DEUTERONOMIUM, that is, second, or repeated law. Because Moses here briefly repeats the laws of God, which are written and recorded in the foregoing books, and whets them faithfully upon the people, and not tediously, with a most fervent and special zeal, and with a multitude of most strong and holy motives or arguments. So that this book may rightly be termed in a special manner an Epitonie, or short Abridgement of the Law. This Moses did in the two last months of the fortieth year after the departure of the children of Israel out of Egypt, in the fields of the Moabites, when he had now brought Israel to the borders of the land of Canaan, and all those rebellious Israelites, according to the threats and oath of God, were perished in the wilderness; that he might fully instruct the people that were grown up in the wilderness (a part whereof were to abide on this side Jordan, and the greatest part to be brought by Joshua into the land of promise), a little before his death concerning their duty, knowing that he should die shortly, and not pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan.
\p First then, he sets before the eyes of the people, the great and manifold mercies, which God had shown to them, these forty years together, as likewise the judgement that befell the rebellious ones: To prepare them for diligent attention and obedience to the Divine Commandments, chapter 1, 2, 3. Secondly, he repeats and declares not only the moral law of the Ten Commandments, but also the ceremonial laws, concerning the outward worship of God, as also the judicial or civil laws, and military ordinances, together with the office of the rulers and the judges, here and there inserting certain new laws, and very earnest exhortation and protestations, with a very remarkable prophecy concerning the Head of all prophets, our Lord Jesus Christ. All this he by many ways confirms with promises of Gods abundant blessing if they should cleave to him and obey him, and with threatening of his heavy curse, if they should depart from him, and break his covenant, to the 31st chapter. Lastly, he puts Joshua in his stead, delivers the book of the Law to the priest and the Levites, and gives them a charge, to lay it in the Most Holy Place, and at set times to read it before the people. He likewise pens and teaches the children of srael a most glorious prophethical song, foretelling then what should befall them unto the coming of Christ, and the calling of the Gentiles. He blesses the twelve tribes. And having viewed the land of promise from mount Nebo, he dies there, and is buried by God, and bewailed by the people. And Joshua succeedes in his room.
\c 1
\s Where and when Moseh repeated the law of God verse 1 &c. a brief relation with that which happened in Israel from the time they departed from Horeb until they came to Kades-Barnea as Gods command to depart with a promise annexed 6 the ordaining of judges and officers 9 their journey through the wilderness and coming to Kades-Barnea 19 the sending out the returning and report of the spies 22 the rebellion and murmuring of the people 26 Gods wrath and sentence against the disobedient 34 who going contrary to Gods command are smitten by the Ammorites and complaining to God are not heard 41.
\p
\v 1 These are the words which Moseh spake unto all Israel [others those are or were the words &c. meaning that these two first verses are a conclusion of the acts and words that are related in the foregoing books ] on this side Jordan for he went not over it but died in the land of Moabites see below chapter 34.5] in the wilderness on the plain [understand the fields or the even plain land of the Moabites see below verse 5 and chapter 34.8 item Numbers 22.1 ] over against Suph [ some understand here by Suph the red sea wherein Pharaoh and his host drowned lying against by Egypt whether Israel had mind to return back again others the dead sea lying at the south end of the Moabites land west wards or the country lying by one of these two seas compare Numbers 21.14 Suph signifieth rush or weed sea weed sea grass ] between Param and between Tophel and Laban and Hazeroth and Dizahab [of Paran see Genesis 14 on verse 6 Numbers 10.12 and 13.1 &c. of Hazeroth Numbers 13.1 and 33.17,18 some conceive that here are described the uttermost confines of the Moabites country south-wards North-wards and east-wards Tophel, Laban and Dizahab are nowhere else mentioned in the scripture so that there be divers opinion concerning them.]
\p
\v 2 . They are eleven days journeyed from Horeb [of Mount Horeb see Exodus3.1 an d33.6 &c. some conceive Horeb and Sinai to be two mountains lying close together as also some maps do shew see the like below chapter 34 on verse 1] by the way of Mount Seir [that is which goeth to mount Seir or mount of the Edomites although the mount reaching from Horeb maybe likewise so called ] unto Kades-Barnea [that is going directly from Horeb to Kades-Barnea by the way of Mount Seir or Edom called also as it seemeth the mount of Amorites below verse 7 by the words of Moses intimateth that the Israelites were fain to spend a long time about the travelling a little way in your journeying from Egypt to kades –Barnea they spent about two years time see on verse 6from thence to the field of Moab eight and thirty years below chapter 2.14 because god being provoked to anger made them go back again until the rebellious one perished in the wilderness see Numbers 14.33 ,34 &c. of Kades-Barnea see Genesis 16 on verse 14.]
\p
\v 3 . And it came to pass in the fourtieth year [after the departure of the Israelites out of Egypt not long before Moseh his death Numbers 33.38] in the eleventh month [namely Sebat Zachariah 1.7 answering to part of January and to part of February when the beginning of the year being taken from the first month of the Ecclesiastical year called Abib or Nisan see Exodus 12.2 and 13.4 Nehemiah 2.1 Esther 3.7 ] on the first day of the month that Moseh spake to the children of Israel according to all the Lord hath given him in charge unto them [ that is had commanded him to tell them .]
\p
\v 4 . After he had smitten Sihom the King of the Amorites [Heb. Of the Amorites as elsewhere often see of the people Genesis 10 on verse 16 of these two passages as also of Basan and Astharoth and Edrei [Astharoth and Edrei dwelt at Astharoh at Edrei [Astharoth and Edrei were two cities in Basan afterwards given to the Reubenites for a possession lying on the East side of Jordan by the mountains Astharoth on the north of Syria Edrei on the south end of Basan see Genesis 14.5 where it is called Astharoth Kanaim and Joshua 13.31 the idols of the Philistines and the Zidonians were also called Astharoth see judges 2. On verse 13.]
\p
\v 5 . On this side Jordan in the land of Moab [that is of the Moabites as often] Moseh began [or Moseh deisreth it seemeth good unto him] to expound this law [that is he repeated further declared and inculcated or wetted upon the people of the laws that he had propounded in the three former books this exposition beginneth properly below chapter 4after Moseh had related certain passages to move the Israelites to attention and obedience] saying.
\p
\v 6 . The Lord our God spake unto us at Horeb saying ye have tarried long enough by this mount [to wit about a year for they came to Sanai and Horeb in the beginning of the third month after their going forth out of Egypt Exodus 19.1,2 and departed thence in second year at the twentieth day of the second month Numbers 10.11 Hebrews it is much for you to continue and dwell &c.]
\p
\v 7 . Turn you and depart and go into the mount of the Amorites [Heb. Amorites which mount beginneth at the mountains Horeb and Sinai and reacheth thence north-wards unto Kades-Barnea by the borders of Syria and Canaan as maps do shew] and unto all their neighbors [Heb. & unto his neighbors that is near adjoining places] in the pain on the mountain and on the low ground and in the south and at the haven of the sea the land of Canaan and Lebanon unto the great river [this hath respect unto the borders of the land promise towards the south west north and east compare Numbers 34 and the annotate there on verse 2 but not withstanding this command the rebellious ones should by no means enter into the land below verse 35 mount Lebanon is often mentioned in the scriptures lying on the north borders of Canaan ] the river Phrath [that is Euphrates see thereof genesis 2 on verse 14 and 15 on verse 18.]
\p
\v 8 . Behold I have given that land before your face [that is I have laid it open before you that ye may possession of it &c. or thus it is said concerning the inhabitants of the land that God gave them before the face of Israel that is as the scripture also speaketh into their hand to smite them see below chapter 2.31 ,33 and elsewhere often ] go into it and possess that land hereditarily which the Lord swear unto your father Abraham and Isaac and Jacob that he would give it to them and their seed after the.
\p
\v 9 . And I spake unto you at that time [to wit according to Jethro’s counsel exodus 18.19] saying I shall not be able to bear you myself alone [that is the burthen of your affairs which happen among you would be too heavy for me alone to bear.]
\p
\v 10 . The Lord your God hath multiplied you and behold ye is this day as the stars of heaven in multitude [according to the promise Genesis 15.5.]
\p
\v 11 . The lord the God of your fathers add to you as ye are now a thousand times more and bless ye according as he hath spoken unto ye.
\p
\v 12 . How should I alone bear your toil or trouble which should put me to and so in the sequel ] and your burden and your controversies ?[Heb. Strife or contentions that is your causes or suits which ye may commence one against another which bring before me to receive my verdict and judgment upon them.]
\p
\v 13 . Take [Heb. Give] ye wise man and understanding and expert [others known] to your tribes that I may make them your heads that is ruler’s judges.]
\p
\v 14 . Then ye answered me and said this word [or this thing] which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.
\p
\v 15 . So I took the heads of your tribes wise and expert men and made them head over you rulers of thousand and rulers of hundreds and rulers of fifties rulers of tens and officers for your tribes.
\p
\v 16 . And I charged your judges at that time saying hear the differences between your brethren and judge rightly between the men and between his brother [or hearing the differences between your brethren judge rightly &c.] and the stranger of him [viz. that is or converseth with or among them .]
\p
\v 17 . Ye shall not know the face in the judgment [that is ye shall not wrest the judgments according to any outwards respect or quality of those that should appear before the judgment seat see the like phrase Leviticus 19.15and below chapter 10.17 2 Chronicles 19.6,7 Job 13.8 James2.1, 9] ye shall hear the small [that is the mean poor despised one] as well as great [that is the rich mighty and honorable Heb. As the small as the great so that small so the great that is the least as well as the greatest ] ye shall not be afraid of any mans face for the judgment that is God [that is it is ordained of god and it is executed in his name and by command from him according to the laws prescribed by him ] but the matter which shall not be too heavy [ or hard for you] that is more difficult than ye shall be able to decide] ye shall cause to come to me and ye shall bear it.
\p
\v 18 . So I command ye at that time so the things which ye shall do.
\p
\v 19 . Then he departed from Horeb and walked through all that great and terrible wilderness which ye saw on the way of mountain of Amorites as the Lord out God had commanded us and we came to Kades-Barnea.
\p
\v 20 . Then I said unto ye then I come unto the mountain of the Amorites which the Lord our God will give unto us.
\p
\v 21 . Behold the Lord thy God hath given that land before thy face [see above verse 8] go up possess it hereditarily according to the lord the God of thy fathers hath spoken unto thee fear not neither be dismayed.
\p
\v 22 . Then ye all came near unto me and said let us send men before our face who may spy us out of the land and bring us word again [Heb. Bring us word again or answer] what way shall we go up to it and unto the cities we shall come.
\p
\v 23 . Now this thing was good in mine eyes [that is pleased me therefore Moses presented it also before the Lord who gave him a command concerning it Numbers 13.3] so I took twelve men of you and men of every tribe.
\p
\v 24 . Who turned themselves and went up to the mountain and came unto the valley of Eschol [the brook Socok as some maps do shew was next to the valley of Escol or valley of grapes issuing out of the mountain of Judah compare Numbers 13.25 and Judges 16 on verse 4 the Hebrew word signifieth sometimes a valley and sometimes a brook because brook do often run through the valley therefore others have the word brooks in the place instead of valley this word Escol signifieth a branch of grapes or a grape this place was called by the Israelites the valley of grapes because this kind of fruit that grew there in the great abundance was exceeding fair and big a sample whereof was cut down carried and brought by the spies when they returned back see Numbers 13.25] and spied out the same.
\p
\v 25 . And they took of the fruits of he land in their hand [to wit grapes pomegranates and figs see Numbers 13.24] and brought it down unto us and brought us word again and said the land which the Lord out God will give us is good.
\p
\v 26 . But ye would not go up but ye were rebellious to the mouth [that is against the command] of the Lord your God.
\p
\v 27 . And you murmured in your tents and said because the Lord hateth us he hath brought us forth out of the land Egypt [others through hatred of the lord against us he hath &c. that is because he hated us ] to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us.
\p
\v 28 . Wither should we go up? or our brethren have made our heart melt [that is disheartened discouraged made us afraid it’s a similitude taken from wax which melted by the fire or by the heat of the sun so the heart growth faint and weak through fear of danger and mischief so Joshua .9,24 and 5.1 Jeremiah 49.23] saying it is a people greater and taller than we [more in number and stronger in power ] the cities are great and fenced up in heaven [that is exceeding strong and firm others strengthened mounting up into heaven see Genesis 11.4 ] we have also seen the children of Enekims [that is of the Giants so called from one Enak see Numbers 13 verse 22and Judges 1.10,20 ]there.
\p
\v 29 . Then I said unto ye dread not neither be afraid of them.
\p
\v 30 . The Lord your God who walketh before your face he shall fight ye according to all that he did among ye inn Egypt before your eyes.
\p
\v 31 . And in the wilderness where thou hast seen [others and that which thou hast seen in the wilderness] that the Lord thy God hath carried thee as a man doth carry his son[compare exodus 19.4 Numbers 11,12 and below chapter 32.10,11 Psalms 91.12 Isaiah 46.3,4] on all the way ye walked until ye came to this place.
\p
\v 32 . But by this word [others this thing that is all that ye saw and heard moved ye not [ye believed not on the Lord your God [ye trusted not in him that he would perform his promises.]
\p
\v 33 . Who walked on the way before your face to look out the place for you where ye might camp in the fire by night to shew ye the way that ye should go in [others to cause ye to see on the way &c.] and in the cloud by day.
\p
\v 34 . Now when the Lord heard the vice of your words he was very wroth and swear saying:
\p
\v 35 . If any of these man of evil generation shall see that good land which I swear to give unto your fathers [an imperfect speech used often in swearing see Genesis 14 on verse 23 some understand withal then let me be no God or let me not live]
\p
\v 36 . Save Caleb the son of Jephunne [together with Joshua the son of Nun see below verse 38 and Numbers 14.6, 30] he shall see it and to him I will give the land [meaning a part of the land] that he had trodden upon [Caleb and Joshua had been along with the spies Numbers 14.6] and to his children because he persevered to follow the LORD [Heb. Because he fulfilled to fulfill to go after the Lord that is so constantly obeyed and followed the LORD in this thing see 14.24 and 32.11, 12.]
\p
\v 37 . Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes [for Moses was so vexed and angry by the unbelief and murmuring of the people that he transgressed against the LORD see the history Numbers 2.10 ,11,12] saying thou shalt no go thither [see Numbers 20.12 and 27.14 below chapter 3.25 and 4.21 and 34.4 ]
\p
\v 38 . Joshua the son of Nun who standeth before thy face [that is who is continually with and about thee to minister unto thee who waited upon thee compare 1 Kings 1.2 Daniel 1.5, 19] he shall go in thither strengthen him for he shall cause Israel to inherit it [that is he shall not only come to the land of Canaan but also be placed by thy room after thy deceased therefore instruct exhorts encourage and strengthen him to sit and prepare him for that great and eighty employment.]
\p
\v 39 . And your little infants whom ye said they shall be a prey and your children whom this day they know neither good nor evil [a phrase frequently used in scripture to describe infancy or childhood see the like phrase Isaiah 7.15 Jonah 4.11] they shall go in thither and unto them will I give I give it and hey shall possess it hereditarily.
\p
\v 40 . You on the contrary turn you and take your journey towards the wilderness by the way of reed sea [that is the sea of rushes commonly called the red sea which by the strong hand of God they had before passed through and were gone so far in their journey towards the land of promise.]
\p
\v 41 . Then ye answered and said unto me we have sinned against the Lord we will march and fight up against all the LORD our God hath commanded us now when ye girded on every man his warlike furniture [or weapons of war] and were willing [or were ready prepared for it others emboldened yourselves or presumptuously advanced] to go up to the mount [see above on verse 2.]
\p
\v 42 . Then the Lord said unto me say unto them go up not up neither to fight for I am not in the midst of you [viz. with my grace and usual assistance compare below chapter 23.14] lest ye be smitten before the face of your enemies.
\p
\v 43 . But when I spake unto you ye hearkened not unto me but where rebellious against the mouth of he LORD and dealt proudly [as if you were able to vanquish your enemies by your own strength without the hand and help of God.] and marched up into the mount.
\p
\v 44 . Then the Amorites which dwealt on the mountain marched forth to meet you [Heb. The Amorites that dwealt on the mountain marched forth &c.] And pursued you according as the Bees do [who being irritated provoked to fly in swarms from all sides after him that comes to disturb them and sting and chase him most bitterly see Psalms 118 vesre1 2] and they dashed you in pieces in Seir unto Horma.
\p
\v 45 . Now when ye returned and wept before the face of the Lord then the Lord hearkened not your voice neither inclined his ears unto you.
\p
\v 46 . So ye abode in Kades many days according to the day that ye abode there that is as the days do shew which ye know ye did abide there.]
\c 2
\s Their marching up from Kades-Barnea verse 1 7c. how they were to demean themselves in their march against the Edomites 4 Moabites 9 and Amorites 19 in the mean while is related how long this march lasted and the destruction of the disobedient 14 lastly how the Israelites vanquished Sihon the king of the Amorites and took possession of his land,24.
\p
\v 1 Then we turned and took our journey towards the wilderness by the way of the reed-sea[that is back again towards the red-sea which they passed over when they came out of Egypt] as the Lord had spoken unto me and compassed mount Seir many days[some maps do place next unto mount Seir or the mount of the Edomites in which they properly dwelt lying along the southern borders of Canaan yet another mountain extending from the reed-sea to the mount that properly the mount Edom and called likewise mount Seir and the mountain of the Amorites because they went along the same unto the Edomites and unto the Amorites by the which the Israelites going back again towards the red-sea made a long journey until God commanded then to turn northwards along by the land of the Edomites and so on towards the land of the Moabites the reader may be pleased to compare verse 3,4,8.]
\p
\v 2 . Then the LORD spake unto me saying:
\p
\v 3 . Yea have compassed this mountain enough [Heb. It hath been much or sufficient for you to go about &c.] Turn you northwards [of the reed-sea which lay in the south back again toward the land of Edom and Moab to pass by both them.]
\p
\v 4 . And command the people saying ye shall march through by the border of your brethren the children of Esau [the Amalekites were also indeed Edomites or descended from Esau Genesis 36.12 but were excluded by God a special ordinance see Exodus 17.24 and below chapter 25,17] that dwell in Seir they will indeed be afraid of you [to wit remembering the wrong that their forefather Esau formerly did unto his brother Jacob or Israel your forefather or they shall be afraid of your power and the help of God that is with you see Numbers 22.3] but ye shall take good heed unto yourselves.
\p
\v 5 . Meddle not with them [ to wit in the battle that ye should go to war with them as below verse 9 and 24 that now afterwards the contrary appeared the Edomites Amorites and Moabites were the cause of it by their enmity and hatred against the Israelites see 1samuel 14.47 2 Samuel 8.14 1 Kings 11.15,16 2kings 8.21 2 Chronicles 20.2 ,10,11 Psalms 83.7,8,9 7c. compare 2 Samuel 8 on verse 2] for I will not give ye for their land even not to the treading of the foot sole [that is so much as the sole of the foot may tread on that is not so much as a foot breadeth] for I have given mount Seir unto Esau for an inheritance [ see Genesis 36.8]
\p
\v 6 . Ye shall buy meat [which besides the heavenly manna ye may desire] of them for money that ye may eat and ye shall buy water of them for money that ye may drink.
\p
\v 7 . For the LORD God hath blessed thee in all the work of thine hand he knoweth the walking through this great wilderness [that is he hath taken care for thee in all this journeying and marching of thine that nothing might be wanting unto thee see this signification of the word knowing Psalms 1.6 and 31.8 Nahum 1.7 and elsewhere] these forty years the ORD thy God hath been with thee [see Genesis 21 on verse 22] nothing hath been lacking to thee.
\p
\v 8 . Now when we had passed by from our brethren the children of Esau that dwelt in Seir from the way of the plain from Elath from Ezeon-Geber [Elath and Ezeon-geber are placed by some close by the reed-sea ] so we turned and passed through the way of the wilderness of Moab.
\p
\v 9 . Then the LORD spake unto me distress not unto me Moab neither mingle thyself with them in the battle for I will not give thee any inheritance of their land because I have given Ar [the metropolis or chief city of the Moabites see Numbers 21.28]unto the children of Lot for an inheritance.
\p
\v 10 . The Emims [see Genesis 14 on verse 5 so called as conceived because they were dreadful and terrible] dwealt there in times past a great numerous and tall people like Enakims [ see above chapter 1.28 and Numbers 13.23.]
\p
\v 11 . These were also accounted Giants [Heb. Rephaim see Genesis 14. On verse 5] as the Enakims and the Moabites called thou Emims.
\p
\v 12 . The Horites [see Genesis 14 on verse 6 and 36.20] also dwealt in Seir before time but the children of Esau drave them out of the possession and destroyed them from their face and dwealt in their stead according as Israel had done unto the land of his inheritance [understand here the lands of Sihon and Og which were already taken by the children of Israel then when Moseh spake or wrote this] which the LORD gave unto them.
\p
\v 13 . Now get ye up and pass over the brook Zered [see Numbers 21.12] so we passed over the brook Zered.
\p
\v 14 . Now the days that we waked from Kades-Barnea until we have passed over the brok Zered were eight and thirty years until al the generation f men of war [that were numbered by Gods appointment being twenty years ld and upward see Numbers 1.3] were consumed out of the midst of the host as the LORD had sworn unto them [see above chapter 1.35 and Numbers 14.21 &c.]
\p
\v 15 . So the hand of the LORD was against them to smite them from the midst of the host until they were consumed.
\p
\v 16 . And it came to pass when the men of Warre were consumed dying away from the middest of the host.
\p
\v 17 . That the LORD spake unto me saying:
\p
\v 18 . Thou shalt pass over at Ar [ see above verse 9] the border of Moab this day .
\p
\v 19 . And thou shalt draw nigh over against the children of Amon distress them not nor mingle thyself with them [see above on verse 5] for I will give thee any inheritance of the land of the children of Ammon for I have given it to the children of Lot for an inheritance.
\p
\v 20 . This was also accounted a land of Giants dwelt therein in the former time and the Ammonites called the them Zamzummims [that is abominable varlets, rogue, thieves, robbers of everyone is afraid.]
\p
\v 21 . A great and numerous and tall people as Enakim and the LORD destroyed them before their face so that they drove them out of the possession and dwelt in their stead.
\p
\v 22 . As he [namely the LORD] did to the children of Esau that dwell in Seir before whose face he destroyed the Horites and they drove them out of possession and dwelt in their stead until this day.
\p
\v 23 . Also the Caphtorims [see Genesis 10 on verse 14] which came forth out of Caphtor destroyed the Avites that dwealt in Hazerim unto Gaza [that is which dwelt times past in the Philistines land see Joshua 13.3 and 2Kings 17.24,31 of Gaza see Genesis 10 on verse 19] and dwelt in their stead.
\p
\v 24 . Get ye up take your journey and pass over the brook Arnon behold I have given Sihon the king of Hesbon the Amorite and his land into thine hand begin to inherit [Heb. Begin inherit] and mingle thyself with them in battle.
\p
\v 25 . This day I will begin to put the dread and thy fear [that is wherewith they shall dread and be afraid of thee so below chapter 11.25] upon the face of the nations under the heaven they that shall hear thy report they shall tremble and be in anguish from thy face.
\p
\v 26 . Then I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kademoth unto Sihon the king of Hesbon with words of peace [that is offering him terms of peace which they refusing to accept of where the cause of their destruction see Exodus 20.10] saying:
\p
\v 27 . Let me pass through thy land I will only pass along by the way [or pass along steadily straight on without turning on either side or giving out of the road way as the following words also declare Heb. In the way in the way] I will neither turn aside to the right hand nor to the left.
\p
\v 28 . Sell me meat for money that I may eat and give me water for money that I may drink only let me pass through on my feet [that is on foot as we commonly say see the same phrase Numbers 20.19 Judges 4.15,17 2 Samuel 15.17 &c.]
\p
\v 29 . As the children of Esau which dwelt in Seir and the Moabites which dwealt in Ar did unto me [that which is affirmed here of the former of these nations to wit the Edomites must be understood of the selling of the bread and water that is meat and drink unto the Israelites for they denied them passage through their country Numbers 20.18 Judges 11.17 the Moabites they indeed met not Israel with bread and water see below chapter 23.4 but yet possible have sold the same unto them at least might not have driven them away from their borders ] until I pass over the Jordan unto the land which the Lord our God shall give us.
\p
\v 30 . But Sihon the king of Hesbon would not let us pass through him [that is through his land] for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit [see Exodus 4 on verse 21] and made his heart obstinate that he might deliver into thine hand as it is at this day.
\p
\v 31 . And the LORD said unto behold I have begun to give unto Sihon and his land before thy face [see above chapter 1 on verse 8] begin then to inherit for to possess his land hereditarily.
\p
\v 32 . And Sihon came forth to meet us he and his people to the battle at Jahaz.
\p
\v 33 . And the Lord our God gave him before our face and we smote him and his sons and all his people.
\p
\v 34 . And we took all his cities at that time and we banned all the cities men and women and little children [that is we destroyed and rooted them out at once so is this word banning also taken below chapter 3.6 and chapter7.2 and elsewhere this banning was to be done to all that continued obstinate in enmity and idolatry compare below chapter and Joshua 6.17,18,21 and 9.18,19 1 Kings 20.42 &c.] we left none to remain.
\p
\v 35 . Only the cattle we took for a prey for ourselves and spoil of the cities which we took.
\p
\v 36 . From Aroer which is by the bank [Heb. Lip] of the brook Arnon, and the city which is by the brook even unto Gilead, there was no city that was too high for us [Or, no city that would defend itself against us]; the Lord our God gave all that before our face.
\p
\v 37 Saving to the land of the children of Ammon thou drew not near; nor (to) all the country of the brook Jabbok nor to the cities of the mountain [Heb. Unto all the sides of the brook Jabbok and unto the cities &c.] nor to anything that the LORD our God had forbidden us [Heb. Commanded us that is forbidden us see of this use of word of commanding Leviticus 4 on verse 23 although those words might be likewise here thus translated whereof the LORD had commanded us to wit that we should not come nigh them.]
\c 3
\s How Og the other king of the Amorite was vanquished by Israel and his land taken verse 1&c. which as likewise the kingdom of Sihon Moseh gave unto the Reubenites Gadites and the half tribe of Manasseh 12 Joshua is confirmed to be Moseh his successor 21 How Moseh entreating that he might enter into the land of Canaan is denied by God 23 and how the land was shewed him upon a mountain 27, 28.
\p
\v 1 Then we turned and marched up the way of Basan marched forth to meet us he and all his people to the battle by Edrei [see Numbers 21.33 and Deuteronomy 29.7.]
\p
\v 2 . Then the LORD said unto me fear him not for I have given him and all his people and his land into thine hand and thou shalt do unto him according as thou hast done unto Sihon the king of the Amorites that dwealt at Heshbon [see Numbers 21.34.]
\p
\v 3 . And the LORD our God delivered also Og king of Basan and all his people into our hand so that we smote him until we left him none to remain [Heb. No ruminants or that remained.]
\p
\v 4 . And we took all his cities at that time there was no city which took not from them therefore cities all the region [Heb. Cord or rope line as also below verse 13because in those times land were wont to be measured and dived by the line or cord ] of Argob the kingdom of Og in Basan.
\p
\v 5 . All those cities were fenced with high walls and gates and bars [Heb. Wall city and bar] besides very many enwalled cities [others cities of country-men that is country-towns.]
\p
\v 6 . And we banned them [see above chapter 2.34] as we had done unto Sihon the king of Heshbon banning all the cities man women and little children.
\p
\v 7 . But all the cattle and the spoil of those cities we took for a prey to ourselves.
\p
\v 8 . So we took at that time the land of the land of the two kings of he Amorites that were n this side [to wit the east-side ] Jordan from the brook Arnon [in the south ] unto mount Hermon [in the north Heb. Chermon.]
\p
\v 9 . The Zidonians called Hermon [called also Sion see below chapter 4.48 Judges 3 on verse 3 1Chronicle 5.23] Sirion [Heb. Schirion but the Amorites call it Senir [Heb. Schenir that is as some conceive snow hill because this hill in regard of the great height of it was always full of snow as the Alpes are.]
\p
\v 10 . All the cities of the plain and all the Gilead and Basan unto Salcha and Edrei cities of the kingdom of the Og in Basan.
\p
\v 11 . For Og the king of Basan only remained of the remnants of the Giants [this serveth to magnify the power of God which he manifested in destroying this Giant and all his people ] behold his bedstead being a bedstead of iron is it not at Rabba of the children of Amon?[this Rabba was the metropolis or chief city of the Ammonites see 2 Samuel 12.26 the meaning is that the bedstead was of a certain there still ]nine ells r cubits [see Genesis 6 n verse 15] was the length thereof and four ells the breadth thereof after the elbow or cubits of a man.
\p
\v 12 . Now this same land which we took in possession at that time from Aroer unto the brook Arnon and the half of mount Gilead with the cities thereof I gave unto the Reubenites and Gadites.
\p
\v 13 . And the rest of the Gilead as also Basan the kingdom of Og gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh all the region of Argob throughout all Basan that same was called the land of giants.
\p
\v 14 . Jair the son of Manasseh [see Numbers 32 on verse 41] go all the country of Argob unto the border of the Gesurites and Machathites [Heb. Geschuri that is the Geschurites Gesar and Maacha lay both on the north borders of Canaan see 2 Samuel 3 on verse 3 and 10.6] and he called them after his own name Basan Havvot Jair [Heb. Chavvot &c. that is Jair,s town villages and Jair’s farms see Numbers 32.41] unto this day [meaning they are so called they have kept this name so elsewhere often.]
\p
\v 15 . And I gave Gilead [meaning a part of Gilead by comparing verse 12 and 13 herewith it seemeth that this properly hath the name Gilead and the portion of the Reubenites and Gadites the half Gilead verse 13 and Jair’s part or portion Havvoth-Jair verse 14 as likewise maps have it so compare likewise 2 Kings 10.33] unto Machir [this Machir was the son of Manasseh Genesis 50.23.]
\p
\v 16 . But unto the Reubenites and Gadites I gave from Gilead unto the brook Arnon the midst of the brook and the border [that is between the brook &c.] and unto the brook Jabbok the border of the children of Amon.
\p
\v 17 . Besides the plain and the Jordan together with the border from Cinneroth [see Numbers 34.11 Joshua 12.3 afterwards called the sea of Genesareth Luke 5 &c. unto the sea of the plain the salt sea [see Genesis 14 on verse 3] under Asdoth–pisga east-wards [others beneath the descent of the hill east-wards according to some maps the city of Asdoth-pisga lieth between the high mountain Pisga and mount Pehor see also Joshua 12.30 and 13.20.]
\p
\v 18 . Moreover I commanded you at that time saying the LORD your God hath given you this land to inherit it all that then that are warlike men pass over armed before the face of your brethren the children of Israel [this precept concerned the Reubenites, Gadites and the half tribe of Manasseh.
\p
\v 19 . Excepting your wives and your little one and your cattle I know that ye have many cattle which shall abide in your cities which I have given.
\p
\v 20 . Until the Lord give rest unto your brethren as well as unto ye that they also may inherit the land which the LORD your God shall give them on the other side of Jordan then shall ye return everyone to his inheritance which I have given ye.
\p
\v 21 . Also I commanded Joshua at that time saying thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings Sihon and king Og] so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.
\p
\v 22 . Fear them not for the LORD your God he fighteth for you.
\p
\v 23 . Also I besought the LORD at that time saying:
\p
\v 24 . Lord, LORD [in the Hebrew the letter of the word Jehovah are found but with the points of the word Elohim as also elsewhere] thou hast begun to shew unto thy servant [that is unto me whom am thy servant] thy greatness [see above chapter 11.2] and thy strong hand [or thine hand that is strong] for what God is there in heaven or on earth that can do according to thy workers and according to thy powers.
\p
\v 25 . I pray thee let me go over and see that good land that is on the other side of Jordan that good [that is goodly fair and fruitful] mountain and Libanon [others to wit Libanon.]
\p
\v 26 . But the LORD was very angry with me for your sakes [see above chapter 1.37] and hearkened not unto me but the Lord said unto me let it suffice thee [or thou hast enough compare herewith 2 Corinthians 12.89] speak no more [Heb. Add not or go not on to speak] unto me of this matter.
\p
\v 27 . Go up to the top [Heb. Head ] of Pisga and lift up thy eyes towards the west and towards the west and towards and towards the north and towards the east and towards the south and look thin eyes [to wit towards the land of Canaan ] for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
\p
\v 28 . Charge them Joshua and confirm him [that is instruct and inform him all things that are required for the executing of his office according to my direction] and strengthen him [that is encourage him and make hearty and valiant against all occurrent difficulties] for he shall go over before the face of this people and shall cause them to inherit that land which thou shalt see.
\p
\v 29 . So we abode in this valley over against Beth-Poer [others the house of Poer some maps have here a city called Beth-Poer lying at the foot of an hill of the like name close by Pisga and Nebo.]
\c 4
\s Exhortations to the keeping of Gods commandment without altering them in any wise verse 1 &c. with proposal both of the judgments inflicted upon the disobedient 3 and a blessing and promise of the obedient 4 a relation of the giving of the law 19 a large earnest prohibition of all kind of idolatry by images and similitude with the sore threatening and comfortable promises 15 a relation of Gods special mercies bestowed upon Israel which ought to move them to obedience 32 the appointing of three cities of refugee of this side of Jordan 41 a preface concerning the ensuing repetition of the laws of God 44.
\p
\v 1 Now then Israel hearkened unto the statutes and unto the judgments which I teach you to do that ye may live and go in and inherit that land which the Lord god our father giveth ye.
\p
\v 2 . Ye shall not add unto this word which I command ye neither diminish there from that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command ye.
\p
\v 3 . Your eyes have seen what God did for Baal-Poer [that is for the idolatry committed by Baal Poer others against because of with] for all or every man that followed Baal- Poer the LORD your God have destroyed from the midst of you.
\p
\v 4 . Ye on the contrary do call unto the LORD your God ye are all alive this day.
\p
\v 5 . Behold I have taught ye the statutes and judgments according as the LORD my God commanded me that ye might do so in the midst of the land wither ye go to inherit it.
\p
\v 6 . Keep them then and do them then for that shall be your wisdom and your understanding before the eyes of the nations which shall hear all these statutes and say this same great people alone is a wise and understanding people [that is ye shall hold this to be true wisdom and understanding and make public profession thereof among the nations round about whereby I will also work effectually that they shall hold ye alone to be truly wise and understanding people others surely or certainly this great people I &c.]
\p
\v 7 . For what great people are there to whom the Gods are so nigh [that is so manifesting divine gracious presence with all manner of blessings and especially with most wonderful ready and powerful help in distress and difficulties] as the LORD our God is as oft as we call upon him? [In all our calling unto him that is as oft as we call upon him or in all things that we call upon him for.]
\p
\v 8 . And that great people is there that hath statutes and judgments as righteous as all this law which I give before your face [others set before you] this day.
\p
\v 9 . Only take heed to thy soul well [Heb. greatly and so verse 15 &c.] lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen and lest they depart from thine heart all the days of thy life and thou shalt make them known to thy children’s children.
\p
\v 10 . On the day when thou stoodest before the face of the LORD thy God at Horeb [this must in general be understood of all people of Israel for those that stood at mount Horeb were now all dead above chapter 2.14,15,16 however it is probable that some of those that were alive at present that were very young at that time spoke likewise with their fathers at mount Horeb.] when the Lord said unto me gather me these people together and I will make them hear my word which they shall learn to fear me all days that they shall live upon the earth and shall teach them their children.
\p
\v 11 . And he came near and stood beneath the mountain and now the mountain burnt with fire unto the midst of heaven [Heb. Unto the heart of heaven that is in the midst of the air so in the heart of the sea Exodus 15.8 Proverbs 23.34 and 30.19 so in the heart of the oak 2 Samuel 18.14 in the heart of the earth Matthew 12.40] there was darkness clouds and thick darkness.
\p
\v 12 . So the LORD spake unto ye in the midst of the fire ye heard the voice of the words but ye saw no similitude [to wit whereby God might be presented ] saving the voice [but ye only heard a voice.]
\p
\v 13 . Then he declared unto ye his covenant which h commanded ye to do the ten words [that is commandments] and wrote them upon two tables of stones.
\p
\v 14 . Also the LORD commanded me at that time to teach ye statutes and the judgments that ye might do them in that land wither to go out to inherit it.
\p
\v 15 . Take ye then good heed of your souls [that is for the good of your souls take great care of your souls compare Joshua 23.11 Jeremiah 17.21 Malachi 2.15,16.] For ye saws no similitude on the day when the LORD spake unto ye in Horeb out of the midst of fire.
\p
\v 16 . Lest ye corrupt yourselves [others corrupt it ] and make ye some carved thing the likeness of any image [to wit for a religious use for this concerneth not the civil necessary and moderate use of pictures statutes maps coins &c. neither also the ornament of the tabernacle which God himself commanded] the shape of male or female.
\p
\v 17 . The shape of any beast that is on the earth the shape of any winged fowl that flieth through heaven [that is through or in the air.]
\p
\v 18 . The shape of anything that creepeth on the earth the shape of any fish that is in the water under the earth.
\p
\v 19 . Lest thou also lift thine eyes unto heaven and behold the sun and the moon and the stars and all the hosts of heaven and be driven to bow down thyself before them which the LORD thy God hath delivered unto all nations under the whole heaven [ that is because they are not God but gods creatures which he created for the common use and service of man.]
\p
\v 20 . But the Lord hath taken ye and brought ye forth out of the iron furnace out of Egypt [understand a melting furnace kettle wherein iron is melted see 1 Kings 8.51 Egypt is compared to such a furnace in regard of affliction and misery that Israel had sustained and suffered there] that ye might be unto him a people of inheritance [see Exodus 19.5 Titus 2.14] as it is this day.
\p
\v 21 . Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes [see above chapter 1 verse 37] and he swear that I should not go over the Jordan and that I should not enter into that good land which the LORD thy God shall give thee for an inheritance.
\p
\v 22 . For I must die in this land I must go over the Jordan but ye shall go over and inherit that good land.
\p
\v 23 . Take good heed unto yourselves lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord your God which he made with you [se Genesis 15 on verse 17, 18] that ye should make ye a carved [or graven] image the likeness of anything which the Lord thy God hath forbidden thee [Heb. Hath commanded &c. of the use of this word see Leviticus 4 on verse 2 and above chapter 3.36.]
\p
\v 24 . For the LORD thy God is consuming fire [God is compared to fire in regard of his hatred and dreadful anger against sin and sinner whom he followeth and consumeth all combustible matter on every side see below chapter 9.3 and 32.22 Psalms 21.10 and 78.21 Isaiah 33.14&c. Jeremiah 14.4 Hebrews 12.29] a jealous God [who is jealous is always acknowledged and honored as God and suffereth none to partake with him in honor Psalms 42.8 and 48.11 behaving himself strong and zealous against all that concerneth his honor and hateth as a n enemy whatsoever opposeth it.]
\p
\v 25 . Now when thou shalt have begotten children and children’s children and shall be grown old [that is shalt have lived long] in the land and shall corrupt yourselves to make a carved image the likeness of any thing [see above verse 16,17,18,19 and Exodus 20 on verse 4] and do that which is evil in the eyes of the Lord thy God [that is that is pleaseth and misliketh him] to provoke him to anger.
\p
\v 26 . I call heaven and earth to witness against ye [that is all heavenly and earthly creature to witness against ye this is a phrase whereby the brute creatures are brought n against men by reason of his stupidity and senselessness to accuse and convince him by natural reasons which he ought to mind in contemplating and using those creatures of is stifneckedness an unthankfulness towards the almighty and gracious God see below chapter 30.19 and 31.8 and compare below chapter 32.1 Isaiah 1.11 Micah 6.2] this day that ye shall so assuredly perish [Heb. Perishing perish] from off that land whereunto ye go over the Jordan to inherit ye shall not prolong your days in it but shall utterly be destroyed [Heb. Being destroyed be destroyed.]
\p
\v 27 . And the LORD shall scatter ye among the nations and ye shall be left a small people [Heb. Men of number that is that are soon numbered see Genesis 34.30.] among the heathen wither the LORD shall lead you.
\p
\v 28 . And there ye shall serve gods which are the work of men’s hands wood and stone which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell.
\p
\v 29 . Then thou shalt seek from thence the LORD thy God and find him when thou shalt seek him with all thine heart and with all thy souls [see below chapter 6 on verse 5.]
\p
\v 30 . When then thou shalt be in distress a these things shall hit thee [Heb. All these words or things shall find thee see the like phrase below chapter 31.17 and 1Samuel 23.17 understand the foresaid miseries see above verse 26.27] in the last days then thou shalt turn to the LORD thy God [this verse as likewise the former seemeth to be prophesy of conversion of the Jews compare below chapter 30 verse 1,2,3 &c. Hosiah 13.5 others turn to the LORD thy God &c. and then in the following verse he will not forsake thee &c. others even unto the LORD thy God see hereof Joel 2 on verse 12] and be obedient to his voice.
\p
\v 31 . For the Lord thy God is merciful God he will not forsake thee nor destroy neither will forget the covenant for thy fathers [that is mad with thy fathers as the following words do shew] which he swear unto them.
\p
\v 32 . For now asked former days which were before thee from that day that God created men upon earth from the one end of heaven unto the other end of heaven [ that is in all the world that lieth under heaven from one end of the world unto the other so below chapter 30.4 Matthew 24.31 Mark 13.7] whether such a great thing hath been done or heard as this?
\p
\v 33 . Whether people hath heard the voice of God speaking out of the midst of fire according as thou hast heard and remained alive?
\p
\v 34 . Or whether god hath assayed to go to take him a people out of the midst of a people by temptation [whereby Pharaoh whether he would let Israel go and Israel whether they would trust in their God see of the word trusting Genesis 22 on verse 1] by token and by wonders and by battle [both against Pharaoh whom God drown and destroyed with all his host in the red-sea and against Sihon and Og the king of the Amorites] and by a strong hand and by a stretched out arm and by great terrors [which first came upon the Egyptian and after that nations see Exodus 23.27 and above chapter 2.25 and below chapter 34.12 others terribleness that is terrible acts ]according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes.
\p
\v 35 . Unto thee it was shewed that thou mightiest know that the LORD is the God [that is that alone is true God as the following words declare] there is none save he alone [or excepting he alone besides him alone.]
\p
\v 36 . Out of heaven [that is out of air] he made thee to hear his voice for to instruct thee and upon earth [that s upon Mount Sinai] he made thee to set his great fire and thou heardst his words out of the mist of fire.
\p
\v 37 . And because he loved thy fathers and had chosen their seed after them [Heb. His seed after him that is everyone seed after him] therefore he brought the forth before his face [others with his face that is in a special manner manifesting his presence by the pillar of the cloud and pillar of fire and having ye always in his sight to guide and conduct ye everywhere compare Exodus 13.21 and 14.19, 20] by his great power out of Egypt:
\p
\v 38 . To drive out nations that were greater and mightier then thou art out of possession before thy face to bring thee in that he might give thee their land for an inheritance as it is this day.
\p
\v 39 . Thou shalt then know this day and ponder in thine heart [that is be mindful of seriously consider lay to heart] that the LORD is that God in heaven above and on earth beneath there I none else.
\p
\v 40 . And thou shalt keep his statutes and commandments which I command thee this day that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee that thou mayest prolong thy days in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee forever[ understand with condition of obedience compare above verse 26,27 Heb. All the days which words may also be added in the beginning of this verse keep his statutes and his commandments all day to wit of thy life always.]
\p
\v 41 . Then Moseh severed three cities on this side Jordan [according to Gods command Numbers 35.14] towards the sun rising.
\p
\v 42 . That is slayer might fly thither who slayeth his neighbor unwittingly whom he hated not from yesterday [that is heretofore in time past] that he might fly into one of these cities and continue alive.
\p
\v 43 . Bezer [see Genesis 6 on verse 12] in the wilderness in the plain land for the Reubenites [Heb. For the Reubenites so in the sequel] and Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites and golan in Basan for the Manassites.
\p
\v 44 . Now this is the law which Moseh set before the children of Israel.
\p
\v 45 . These [ to wit which are mentioned in the following chapter are the testimonies [meaning God’s holy doctrine testifying of his essence will and works see below chapter 6.17 and Psalms 19.8 &c.] and statutes and judgments which Moseh spake unto the children of Israel when they were come fort out of Egypt.
\p
\v 46 . On this side Jordan in the valley over against Beth-Poer [see above on chapter 3 verse 29] in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites who dwelt at Hesbon whom Moseh and the children of Israel smote when they were come fort out of Egypt.
\p
\v 47 . And had taken his land in possession besides the land of Og king of Basan two kings of Amorites were on this side Jordan towards the sunrise.
\p
\v 48 . From Aroer which is by the bank [Heb. Lip see Genesis 41 on verse 3] the brook Arnon unto Mount Sion [see above chapter 3.9] which is Hermon.
\p
\v 49 . And all the plain on the Jordan on eastwards unto the sea of the plain [understand the Dead Sea or salt-sea see Genesis 14 on verse 3] under Asdoth Pisga [see above chapter 3 on verse 17.]
\c 5
\s A repetition of ten commandments of God with a preface thereunto verse 1 &c. of the terror and peoples request that they might not hear gods voice so any more but God spake unto them by Moseh 22 the Lord conteseth thereunto 30 Exhortation to obedience 32.
\p
\v 1 And Moseh called all Israel and said unto them hear Israel the statutes and judgments which I speak before your ears this day that ye may keep them and observe to do them.
\p
\v 2 . The LORD our God made a covenant with us [see Genesis 15 on verse 18 so above chapter 4.23] at Horeb [see above chapter 1 on verse 2.]
\p
\v 3 . The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers [to wit as it was revealed to the Israelites with all its circumstances and particulars law and had by the grace of God ordered their religion and worship of god according unto it by fathers here is meant Abraham Isaac Jacob and other Godly Patriarchs who were all of them dead when God revealed this whole law unto Israel in the wilderness upon mount Sinai or Horeb some understand this of the fathers that perished in the wilderness had broken the covenant of God and had made themselves altogether unworthy of it] but with us we are all here alive this day.
\p
\v 4 . The Lord talked with ye face to face [that is very familiarly as when one friend talketh with another mouth to mouth very freely its spoken in respect with God after the manner of men see Exodus 33.11 Numbers 12.8 and below chapter 34.10 compare also Numbers 14.14] on the mount out of the midst of fire.
\p
\v 5 . I stood between the LORD and between ye at that time to make known unto ye the word of the Lord so ye were afraid of the fire and went not up into the mount saying:
\p
\v 6 . I am the Lord thy God brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage [Heb. Out of the house of the servants and bondmen and so constantly compare this repetition of the law the first publishing of it Exodus 20.2&c. and see below verse 12.]
\p
\v 7 . Thou shalt have none other gods before my face.
\p
\v 8 . Thou shalt not make thee any carved image nor any like of that which is in heaven above or that which is on the earth beneath or that which is in water under the earth.
\p
\v 9 . Thou shalt not bow down thyself before them nor serve them for I the LORD thy God I am jealous God [see above chapter 4 on verse 24] who visit the offence [or iniquity] of the fathers upon the children and upon the third and upon the forth member [Heb. Upon the third and upon the forth ] of them that hate me:
\p
\v 10 . And shew mercy [or exercise shew bounty kindness favor] unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.
\p
\v 11 . Thou shalt not use [Heb. Take to wit into thy mouth as Psalms 50.16 or take up] the name of the LORD thy God vainly [others falsely] for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who useth his name vainly.
\p
\v 12 . Keep the Sabbath day to hallow it according as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee [these words as also some other in verse 14,15,16 Moseh added here by way of exposition over above the words that are recorded Exodus 20 as likewise be here omitted which are recorded in Exodus.]
\p
\v 13 . Six days thou shalt labor and do all thy work.
\p
\v 14 . But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the LORD thy God then thou shalt do not work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter nor thy men-servant nor thy exe nor thy ass nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is in thy gates that is men-servants and thy maid servants may rest according as thou.
\p
\v 15 . For thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence by a strong hand and by a stretched out arm therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath day.
\p
\v 16 . Honor thy father and mother according as the LORD thy God commanded thee that thy days may be prolonged [others that they may be prolonged thy days they to wit father and mother by prayer or blessing] and that it may go well with thee in the land which the LORD thy God shall give thee.
\p
\v 17 . Thou shalt not kill.
\p
\v 18 . Neither shalt thy commit adultery.
\p
\v 19 . Neither shalt thou steal.
\p
\v 20 . Neither shalt thou speak [others answer witness] false witness against thy neighbor.
\p
\v 21 . Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbors wife neither shalt thy covet thy neighbors house [Exodus 20.17 the neighbors house is put before wife to shew that this is but one commandment] nor his field nor his men servant nor his maid servant nor his oxe nor his ass nor anything that is thy neighbor’s.
\p
\v 22 . These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly on the mountain on the midst of the fire of the cloud and of the thick darkness with a great voice added nothing thereto [that is he spake no more unto all the people but he delivered the other law statutes unto Moseh in private] and he wrote them upon two tables of stones and delivered them unto me.
\p
\v 23 . And it came to pass when he heard that voice out of the midst of darkness and the mountain did burn with fire then ye came unto me all the heads of your tribes and you’re eldest.
\p
\v 24 . and I said behold the LORD our God hath caused us to see his glory and his greatness and we have heard his voice out of the midst of fire we have seen this day that God doth talk with man and that he [to wit man] remaineth alive.
\p
\v 25 . But now why should we die?[ intimating that it was a great miracle that they remained alive but would not willingly undergo that danger again compare Genesis 16 on verse 13 and Judges 6 on verse 22] for his great fire will consume us if we should go on to hear the voice of the LORD our God any longer then we should die.
\p
\v 26 . For who is there for all flesh? [That is that man is there see Genesis 6 on verse 12] that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of fire as we have and hath continued alive? [See above chapter 4 on verse 33 Judges 13.22.]
\p
\v 27 . Go thou now and hear the LORD our God shall say and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee and we will hear it and do it.
\p
\v 28 . Now when the LORD heard the voice of your words when ye spake unto me then the LORD said unto me I have heard the voice of the words of these people which they have spoken unto thee which it is all good that they have spoken [Heb. They have done well or made good all that they have spoken.]
\p
\v 29 . Oh that they had such a heart to fear me and keep all my commandments at all days or times [Heb. Who shall give that they may have this heart of theirs &c. its an human kind of wish that is here as elsewhere often used of God to shew that such an heart is acceptable unto him as men are wont to long or wish for things that are pleasing and acceptable unto them otherwise God is almighty doing whatsoever he will and not subject to any such passion or affection compare Judges 9.29 2 Samuel 18.33 Job 6.8 and 11.5 &c.] That it might go well with them and with their children forever.
\p
\v 30 . Go and say unto them return unto your rests.
\p
\v 31 . But thou stand here by me that I may speak unto thee all the commandments and the statutes and the judgments [concerning these three immediately following each other according to the opinion of the most interpreters first of them signifieth the moral law the second the ceremonial law and the third he judicial laws] which thou shalt teach them that they may do them in the land which I shall give them to inherit it.
\p
\v 32 . Observe then to do according as the LORD your God hath commanded you turn not aside to the right hand or to the left [that is in no wise by no means as below chapter 28.14.]
\p

\p

Galatians 5.6 James 2.18 and 1Corinthians 6.20 Philippians 1.11 some understand here by righteousness and evidence and outward manifestation of righteousness which have by faith when we shall observe to do all thee commandments before the face of the LORD our God according as he hath commanded us.

\p
\v 2 . And the LORD thy God shall have given before thy face that thou shouldst smite them and thou shalt utterly ban them [Heb. Banning ban see above chapter 2 on verse 34.] thou shalt make no covenant with them nor be merciful unto them.
\p
\v 3 . Neither shalt thou join affinity with them thou shalt not give thy daughter[ in the Hebrew this and some other following words are put in the singular number having respect to every of these nations sons and daughters for thy sons.
\p
\v 4 . For they will cause thy sons to depart from me that they should serve other Gods and the anger of the LORD will kindle against ye and destroy ye utterly.

But thus shall ye do unto them ye shall cast down their altars and break in pieces their images reared up [others statutes or pillar images] and ye shall cut down their grooves [understand idolatrous groves which they had planted for idolatrous use see below chapter 12.3] and burn their carved images with fire.
\p
\v 6 . For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God [that is a people separated by God from all nations and set apart for him that he might bless thee according to the tenor f the promises of the covenant is holy in his commandments according to thy covenant promises see below chapter 28.9 1Peter 2.9] the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be peculiar people unto himself out of all nations upon the earth.
\p
\v 7 . The Lord hath no desire towards ye neither did chose ye for your multitude above all other nations for ye wee the fewest of all nations.
\p
\v 8 . But because the LORD loved ye [Heb. Or out of by reason of the LORD’s love towards ye and that he might keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers the LORD hath brought ye forth with a strong hand and had redeemed ye out of the house of bondage from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
\p
\v 9 . Thou shalt then know the LORD thy God he is god thy faithful God [that is who is true in his words and assuredly perfometh his promises see Isaiah 49.7 1Corinthians 1.9 and 10.13 2 Corinthians 1.18 1Thessalonians 5.24 2 Thessalonians 3.3 2Timothy 2.13 Hebrews 11.11 1John 1.9] who keepeth covenant and mercy with them tat love him and keep hois commandments to a thousand generations.
\p
\v 10 . And he recompenseth every one of them that hate him in his face [that is in their presence before their eyes as we say or in public without dreading their worldly greatness power or pride even so that they must needs discern and feel the LORD punishing against them] to destroy him he will not be slack to him that hateth him he will recompense him in his face.
\p
\v 11 . Keep the commandment and the statutes and the judgments which I command the day to do them.
\p
\v 12 . So it shall come to pass because ye shall hear these judgments and keep and do them that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and mercy which he swear unto thy fathers.
\p
\v 13 . And he will love thee and bless thee and cause thee to multiply and he will bless the fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy lamb thy corn and thy new wine and thine oil the propagation [or increase that is the fruit] of thine kine and the flock of thine small cattle in the land which he swear unto thy fathers to give thee.

\v 15 . And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness and he will lay none of the evil disease of the Egyptian which thou knowest [which thou hast seen upon the Egyptians compare below chapter 20.60] upon thee but will them upon all them that hate thee.
\p
\v 16 . Thou shalt then consume all these nations which the LORD thy God shall give thee [the word rendered here consume is in the Hebrew properly eat, eat up and so consequently consume destroy them without favoring or sparing as meat or food is not spared much less the prey of the beast compare below chapter 31.17] thine eyes shall not spare them neither shalt thou serve their God for that would be a snare unto thee [see Exodus 23.33 and 34,12 Judges 2.3.]
\p
\v 17 . If thou should say in thine heart [that is if thou should think with thy self so below chapter 8.17 and 9.4 &c.] these nations are greater than I how should I be able to drive them out of possession?
\p
\v 18 . be not afraid of them remember continually [Heb. Remembering remember] what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh and unto all the Egyptians.
\p
\v 19 . The great temptation [see above chapter 4 on verse 34]which thine eyes saw and the tokens and the wonders and the strong hand and the stretched out arm whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out so shall the LORD thy God do unto all thy nations of whose face thou art afraid.
\p
\v 20 . Moreover the LORD thy God will also send Hornets among them [see Exodus 23.28] until they perish that are left and are hid from thy face [ that is that hid themselves and perhaps they have escaped thine hand.]
\p
\v 21 . Be not afraid of their face for the LORD thy God is in he midst of thee [ to wit with presence and aid] a great and terrible God.
\p
\v 22 . And the LORD thy God will cast out [or pull out or root out or cast down destroy.] these nations before thy face by little and little [Heb. A little a little that is very easily one after another] thou mayst not [or shall not be able] consume them quickly lest the wild beasts of the field multiply against thee [or upon thee.]
\p
\v 23 . And the LORD shall give them before thy face and he shall terrify them with great terror [or amaze them with great amazement ] until they be destroyed.
\p
\v 24 . He also deliver their kings into thine hands that thou mayst destroy their name from under heaven no man shall be able to stand before thy face until thou shalt have destroyed them.
\p
\v 25 . The carved images of their Gods ye shall burn with fire thou shalt not desire the silver and gold that is on them nor take it for thyself lest thou be snared thereby for that is an abomination unto the LORD thy God.
\p
\v 26 . Thou shalt not then bring abomination into thine house that thou shouldst be a ban [that is banned see hereof a notable example Joshua 7.11, 21, 24, 25, 26] as that is [to wit the banned thing or substance] thou shalt utterly detest it and utterly abhor it [Heb. Detesting detest and abhorring abhor.] for it is a ban [that is devoted or given up to destruction because it reserved for idolatrous use.]

\s An exhortation of obedience by relating many great mercies of God shewed to Israel verse 1 &c. likewise by a description of the beauty and fruitfulness of the land of the promise with admonition to beware of pride and forgetfulness of God and his mercies to as likewise threatening of sore and heavy judgments if they should do otherwise 19.
\p
\v 1 All the commandments which I command thee this day [Heb. All the commandments which I &c. or every commandment] ye shall observe to do that ye may live and multiply and go in and inherit the Land which the LORD swear unto your fathers.
\p
\v 2 . And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led these forty years in the wilderness that he might humble thee to tempest thee [spoken of God after the manner of men see Genesis 22 on verse 1] to know what was in thine heart [that thou thyself and others might know that is that it might be made to appear &c. so below chapter 13.3 Judges 3.4 2 Chronicles 32.31] whether thou wouldst keep his commandments or not.
\p
\v 3 . And he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manna which thou knowest not neither had thy father known that he might take it known unto thee that man liveth not by bread alone but that man liveth by all or every thing that proceedeth or cometh forth ] out of the mouth of the LORD [ Heb. Of by or through all proceedings or issuing forth from the LORD’s mouth that is by all that God is pleased to ordain and bless for that end and purpose not only in an ordinary way but also from above and beyond the common rule yeah without means where so ever is pleased him.]
\p
\v 4 . Thy remnant waxed not old upon thee neither did thy foot swell [the Hebrew word signifieth properly the swelling up puffing up rising of dough by means of leaven mixed with it as if Moseh should say that that their feet were not hurt or gauled at all by the cumbersomeness and trouble of all their marching and travelling] these forty years.
\p
\v 5 . acknowledge then in thine heart that the LORD thy God chasteneth thee according as a man chasteneth his son [ with such kind of love in such a manner and for such an end as a gracious father chasteneth his son see Proverbs 3.11,12 Hebrews 12.5,6,7,8,9,10&c.]
\p
\v 6 . And keep the commandments of the LORD thy God to walk in his ways [see Genesis 18on verse 19] and fear him [or walking in his ways and fearing him.]
\p
\v 7 . For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into the good land a land of water brooks fountain depths that flow forth [or issue forth spring forth] in valleys and in hills [Heb. In valleys and in hills.]
\p
\v 8 . A land of wheat and barley and vines and fig-trees and pomegranates and a land of olive trees abounding with oil [Heb. Olive trees of oil] and of honey.
\p
\v 9 . A land wherein thou shalt eat bread [see Genesis 3 on verse 19] without scarceness wherein nothing shall be wanting unto thee a land whose stones are iron [that is iron is found or in among the stones or where the stones are iron] and out of whose hills thou mayst dig copper.
\p
\v 10 . When then thou shalt have eaten and be satisfied then thou shalt [others thou shalt eat and satisfied and &c.] praise [Heb. Bless the LORD thy God for that good land which he shall have given thee.
\p
\v 11 . Beware that thou forget the LORD thy God that thou shouldst not keep his commandments and his judgments and his statutes [of the meaning of these three words commandments judgments statutes see above chapter 5 on verse 31] which I command thee this day.
\p
\v 12 . Lest peradventure when thou shalt have eaten and be satisfied and shalt have built good house inhabit them.
\p
\v 13 . And thy oxen and thine sheep shall be increased ye all that thou hast shall be increased.
\p
\v 14 . And thy heart be lifted up that thou forget the LORD thy God brought forth thee out of the land of Egypt and out of the house of bondage.
\p
\v 15 . Who led thee in the great and terrible wilderness where were fiery serpents and scorpions and drought where there was no water who brought the forth water out of the flinty rock [Heb of the flint that is flienty stony rock see Exodus 17.6 Numbers 20.11 Psalms 78.15 and 114.8.]
\p
\v 16 . Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna [see Exodus 16.14, 15] which your fathers had not known to humble thee] see above verse 2, 3 and to tempt thee [se above verse 2] that he might do well unto thee at last [Heb. In thine utmost in thine last hinmost that is afterwards.]
\p
\v 17 . And thou say in thine heart [see above chapter 7.17] this must be joined with the beginning of verse 12and 14] my power and strength of mine hand had gotten me this wealth [see Psalms 73 on verse 12.]
\p
\v 18 . But thus halt remember the LORD thy God that is he that giveth power to get wealth that he might establish his covenant which he swear unto thy fathers as it is at this day.
\p
\v 19 . But if it happened that thou altogether forget [Heb. Forgetting forget] the LORD thy God and follow others gods and serve them and bow thyself before them then I testify against ye this day that ye shall surely perish [Heb. Perishing shall perish.]
\p
\v 20 . As the heathen whom the LORD destroyed before your face so shall ye perish because would not be obedient unto the voice of the LORD your God.

\s
\p Faithful warnings of Israel and having subdued their enemies and being brought into the land of promise they should in no wise conceive that God had done it for their righteousness sake but to punish the wickedness of the inhabitants to perform his gracious covenant promises unto Israel verse 1 &c. which Moses proveth by a long large recital of Israel’s rebellion and abominable sins committed at Horeb 7 at Tabbera Massa Kcibroth-Taava 22 as also at Kades-Barnea 23 whereunto Moses subjoined how exceedingly he was vexed and tormented by reason of their sins and what intercessions he was fain to make to appease Gods wrath. 25.
\p
\v 1 Hear Israel thou shalt pass over the Jordan this day [that is soon shortly within over a short while] that thou mayst go in to inherit nations that are greater and stronger than thyself [that is the land of the nation that are &c. for those nations are to be destroyed according to Gods command] cities that are great and fenced up to heaven [see above chapter 1 on verse 28.]
\p
\v 2 . A great and tall people children of Enakim [as above chapter 1 on verse 28 and 2.10, 11] whom thou knowest and whom thou hast heard saying who can stand before the children of Enak? [A common proverb at that time when those giants flourished.]
\p
\v 3 . Thou shalt them know this day that the LORD thy God is he who goes over before thy face and consuming fire [see above chapter 4 on verse 24] he shall destroy them and he shall cast them down before thy face and thy shalt drive them out of possession and thou shalt drive them out of possession and shall destroy them quickly according to the LORD hath spoken unto thee.
\p
\v 4 . Now when the LORD thy God shall have cast them out before thy face then speak not in thine heart [see above chapter 7 on verse 17 ] saying for my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to inherit this land for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out of possession before thy face.
\p
\v 5 . Not for thy righteousness nor for the uprightness of thine heart thou doest go in to inherit their land [for as if the LORD should say thou hast no righteousness of thine own but rather the contrary see verse 6,7 &c. a like phrase unto this an apostle useth Titus 3.5 and elsewhere often in relating the causes of mans salvation that is of our deliverance and possession of the heavenly Canaan when he saith not by works of the righteousness which we have done &c. ] but for the wickedness of these nations the Lord thy God doth drive them out of possession before thy face and to ratify the word which the LORD thy God swear unto thy fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob.
\p
\v 6 . Know then that the LORD thy God doth give thee this good land to inherit it for thy righteousness for thou art a stiff-necked people [see Exodus 32.9]
\p
\v 7 . Remember forget not that thou didst greatly provoke the LORD thy God to anger in the wilderness from that day that thou comest forth from Egypt until ye came unto this place ye have been rebellious against the Lord.
\p
\v 8 . For [ this ensuing relation serveth for proof of the 5 and 6 verse where Moses affirmed that God would not bring them in the land of Canaan for their own righteousness ] at Horeb ye provoked the Lord to wrath so that he was angry with ye to destroy ye.
\p
\v 9 . When I was gone up into the mount to receive the table of stone the tables of the covenant [that is upon which the ten commandments were written which contained the covenant of Gods law so verse 10 &c.] which the Lord had made [see genesis 15 on verse 18] with ye then I abode on the mountain forty days and forty nights I did neither eat bread nor drink water [that is I took no sustenance neither drink nor meat so verse 18 and 1 Kings 13.8,9,13 Kings 6.22.]
\p
\v 10 . and the Lord gave me two tables of stones written with the finger of God that is with the fingers see the spiritual meaning hereof 2 Corinthians 3.3 7 and compare Jeremiah 31.33] and on them [to wit as written] according to all the works which the Lord had spoken with you on the mount of the midst of fire in the day of assemble [when Israel stood below at the foot of the mountain to hear Gods commandments.]
\p
\v 11 . So it came to pass at the end of forty day and forty nights when the Lord gave me two tables’ o stones and tables of the covenant.
\p
\v 12 . That is the Lord said to me arise so quickly down hence for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted it [or have corrupted themselves see exodus 32.7] they are quickly turned aside out o the way [see Genesis 18 on verse 19which I have commanded them and they have made them an molten image.
\p
\v 13 . Moreover the Lord spake unto me saying I have seen these people and behold it is a stiff-necked people see Exodus 32.9 and 33.3 and 34.9 below chapter 10.16 and 31.7 2Kings 17.14.]
\p
\v 14 . Let me alone [as if the Lord should say trouble say trouble me no more in the interceding for the stiff-necked people see Moses intercession Exodus 32.11,12 &c. and 34.9 and below verse 26 &c.] that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven and I will make thee a mightier and greater nation then this is.
\p
\v 15 . Then I turned and came down from the mount now the mount burned with fire and the two tables of the covenant were both in mine hands.
\p
\v 16 . And I looked and behold ye had sinned against the LORD your God ye had made ye a molten calf ye had turned aside quickly out the way which the Lord had commanded ye.
\p
\v 17 . Then I took hold of the two tables of stones and cast them out of both mines hands and break them before your eyes.
\p
\v 18 . And I cast me down before the face of the Lord as at the first [I did again as I had done before] forty days and forty nights I did neither eat bread nor drink water for all sin which ye had sinned doing that which is evil in the eyes of the Lord [that is that which displeased him] to provoke him anger.
\p
\v 19 . For I was afraid because of the anger indignation wherewith the Lord was exceeding angry against you to destroy you but the Lord hearkened unto me at that time also.
\p
\v 20 . Also the Lord was exceeding angry against you to destroy him but I prayed for Aaron also at that same time.
\p
\v 21 . But I took your sin [ that is as the following words shew the molten calf wherewith ye had committed the abominable sin of idolatry compare Isaiah 27.9 Hosiah 10.8 Amos 8.14] the calf ye had made and burnt it with fire grinding it very small until it was thinned to dust and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that runneth down from the mount [to loath and detest this abomination in the highest measure and to drown all remembrance thereof in the deep see hereof further Exodus 32 on verse 20 and compare 2 Kings 23 on verse 12.]
\p
\v 22 . Also ye angered the Lord exceedingly at Thabera [that is burning why this place was called see Numbers 11.2, 3] and at Massa [that is temptation see exodus 17.7 and Kibroth-Taava that is graves of lust see Numbers 11.34.]
\p
\v 23 . furthermore when the Lord sent ye out of the Kades-Barnea saying go up an dinherit that land which I have given ye then ye were rebellious against the mouth [that is the command ] of the Lord your God and believed him not [see above chapter 1 on verse 32] and were not obedient unto his voice.
\p
\v 24 . Ye were rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew ye [that is converse with you and had dealing with ye according to my calling.]
\p
\v 25 . And I cast me down before the face of the Lord those forty days and forty nights wherein I cast me down because the Lord had said that he would destroy ye.
\p
\v 26 . And I prayed unto the Lord and said Lord, LORD destroys not thy people and thine inheritance which thou hast redeemed by thy greatness [that is majesty and great power see below chapter 11.2] which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt by a strong hand.
\p
\v 27 . Remember thy servant Abraham Isaac and Jacob [that is remembering thy covenant which thou hast made with them] look not unto the stubbornness of these people nor to their wickedness to their sin.
\p
\v 28 . Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say [Heb. Lest they say the land whence &c. that is lest the inhabitants of the land whence &c. say namely the Egyptians as exodus 32.22] because the Lord was not able to bring them into the land whereof he had spoken unto them he had brought them out to slay them in the wilderness [compare above chapter 1.27.]
\p
\v 29 . Yet they were thy people and thine inheritance which thou broughtest out by the great power and by thy stretched out arm.
\c 10
\s A relation of making two other tables of the law and the writing of the ten commandments in them as also of the chest or ark wherein they were laid up by Moseh verse 1 &c. the doth of Aaron and the setting apart of the tribes of Levi for the service of the Lord 6moseh is tarrying on the mount 10 a glorious exhortation unto Israel to fear God obey him and love their neighbor especially the stranger as also to labor for knowledge of the true God with divers arguments and motive thereunto 12.
\p
\v 1 At that time [when the Lords wrath was now appeased by the intercession which is related in the end of the former chapter ] the Lord said unto me into this mount after that thou shalt make thee a chest [or ark this may be understood of as chest wherein Moseh was to lay the table until that such time that the ark of the covenant Exodus 5.21 should be made of the ark of the covenant itself which God here commanded to be afterwards made] of wood.
\p
\v 2 . And I will write upon these tables the words which were on the first table which thou breakest and thou shalt lay them in that chest.
\p
\v 3 . So I made a sittim-wood [see Exodus 22 on verse 5] and bewed two tables of stone like unto the first and went to the mount and the two tables were in mine hand.
\p
\v 4 . Then he [namely the LORD ] wrote upon the table according to the first writing the ten words [that s the ten commandments ] which the LORD had spoken unto ye in the mount out of the midst of fire in the day of assembly [as above chapter 9.10] and the LORD gave them unto me.
\p
\v 5 . Then I turned myself and came down from the mountains and laid the tables in the chest which I had made and there they are [or were] according as the Lord commanded me.
\p
\v 6 . And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth Bere-Jaakana and Moseia [or from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan and Moseia [or from Beeroth that two journeys are joined together albeit they first journeyed from Mosereth and then next from Bere-Jaakan see Numbers 33.31, 32 but it may be there was a place hard by mount Hor wherein Aaron died that was called Moser or Mosera between the journey from Bere-Jaakan and Aarons death upon mount Hor are Numbers 33 sundry journeys and camping recorded see there the same and thirty chapter of Numbers so that this Beeroth Bere-Jaakan mentioned here in this place was perhaps another place then Beereth jakan simply so called which the attentive reader may take into consideration] thee Aaron died and was buried there and Eleazar his son executed the priest office in his stead.
\p
\v 7 . From thence they journeyed to Gudgod [called Hor-Gid-god Numbers 33] and from Gudgod to Jothath a land water brooks.

\p
\v 15 . Only the Lord had delight in thy fathers to love them and he chose their seed after them you out of all nations as it is this day [Moseh doth intimate that there was no cause of the election of Israel and of their fathers but the meer good will and pleasure and free grace of God for all his creatures and regard of his creation were equally nigh unto him he stood not in need of any and it was free for him to leave Israel and their fathers in their sinful state and condition as well as others nations and chuse and shew mercies to whom and to what people he pleased compare Exodus 33.19 and above chapter 9.4,5,6 &c. Joshua 24.2,3 Matthew 11.26 Acts 13.17 and 14.16 Romans 9.15 and 11.35 Ephesians 1.5,9,11 &c.]

\v 22 . Thy fathers went down into Egypt [of Egypt see Genesis 12 on verse 10] with the three score and ten souls [that there were no more then three scores and ten persons] now the Lord thy god hath made thee as the stars of heaven in multitude [see genesis 13 on verse 16 and 15.5.]

\v 1 Therefore thou shalt love the Lord thy God and thou halt keep his charge [Heb. Thou salt keep his keeping that is that which hath given thee in charge to keep see genesis 26 on verse 5] and his statutes and his judgments and his commandments see above chapter 5 on verse 31] all thy days or times [Heb. All the days to wit of thy life as after see chapter 12.1,19 and 10.9 and 17.19 &c.]
\p
\v 2 And I know this day that I speak not with your children that know it not seen the instruction of the Lord your God [that is all that God had done at that time unto his people to instruct which is related in the sequel] his greatness [that is his majesty and great divine power shining and appearing in his works as the following words declare so above chapter 3.24 and 9.27] his strong and his stretched out arm.

\p
\v 5 . And what he did for you in the wilderness until ye came to this place.
\p
\v 6 . Moreover what he did unto Dathan and unto Abiram the son of Eliab the son of Reuben how the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up with heir household [Heb. Houses] and their tents ye all that subsisted [see Genesis 7on verse 4] that concerned them [Heb. That was their feet that is in their service power or possession or that concerned and attended them compare exodus 11.8] in the midst of all Israel.
\p
\v 7 . For eyes are they that have seen all his great works of the Lord which he hath done [Moseh intimateth that it was special mercy of God that all these wonders were done in their lifetime add before their eyes compare above chapter 5.3.]
\p
\v 8 . Keep then all commandments which I command thee this day [Heb. all or every commandment which I &c. so below verse 22] that ye may be strong and go in and inherit the land whether ye go over to inherit it.
\p
\v 9 . And ye may prolong your days in the land which the Lord swear unto your father to give unto them and to their seed a land flowing with milk and honey [see exodus 3 on verse 8.]
\p
\v 10 . For the land whether thou goest to inherit it, it id not as the land of Egypt from whence ye came out which thou sowedst with thy seed and waterdst with thy going [Heb. With thy foot that is with thy service and labor being lain with labor and pain to bring or carry water into it to moisten it other according to thine own good liking or as it seemed good unto thee ] as a garden of herbs.
\p
\v 11 . But the land whither go over to inherit is a land of mountains of the valleys it drinketh water by the rain of heaven [without men’s labor of pain.]

Seeketh seeketh after or enquireth after its spoken of God after the manner of men for men do use to seek and after that which they bear a special affection to compare job 3.4 Isaiah 62.12] the eyes of the Lord thy god are continually upon it from the beginning of the year unto the end of the year.
\p
\v 13 . And it shall come to pass when ye shall hearken diligently [Heb. Hearken shall hearken] unto my commandments which I command ye this day to love the Lord your God and to serve with all your heart and with all your soul.
\p
\v 14 . Then I will give ye the rain [Here Moses bringeth god himself in speaking thus ] of your land [that is which your land shall require] in due season the early rain [which God gave after the ground tilled and sold to make the seed spring up out of the earth] and the latter rain [which fell a little before harvest to make the fruit heavy and to ripen them see Jeremiah 5.24Hosiah 6.3 Joel 2.24 James 5.7] that thou mayest gather in thy corn and thy new wine and thy oil.
\p
\v 15 . And I will give herb upon thy field for thy beasts and thou shalt and be satisfied.
\p
\v 16 . Take heed to yourselves that your heart not be deceived that ye may turn aside and serve other Gods and bow yourselves before them.
\p
\v 17 . The Lord’s wrath kindle against ye and he shut up the heaven [a kind of phrase whereby the way of similitude is expressed the divine providence ruling and governing in the air serving for the removal and with holding of rain see 1 Kings 8.39 2 Chronicles 6.26 and 7.13] that there be no rain and the ground yield not her increase and ye suddenly perish from the good land which the lord giveth ye.
\p
\v 18 . Lay then these my words in your heart and in your soul and bind them for a toke upon your hand that they may be as frontless before your eyes [see Exodus 13.9 and above chapter 6 on verse 8.]
\p
\v 19 . And teach them your children speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house and thou goest on the way and when thou liest down and when thou riseth up.
\p
\v 20 . And write them upon the posts of thine house and at thy gates.
\p
\v 21 . That your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land which the Lord swear unto fathers to give them as the days of the heaven upon thy earth [that is as long as the world stands will continue with his people in his blessings compare Psalms 89.37,38 Matthew 28.20 others thy and thy children days shall be many as the days of heaven are many.
\p
\v 22 . For if ye diligently keep [Heb. Keep keeping] all these commandments which I command ye to do them loving the Lord your God walking in all his ways and cleaving unto him.

\p
\v 24 . All [or every ] place whereon the sole of the foot tradeth [compare above chapter 2.5 Joshua 1.3 and 14.9] shall be you’re your from the wilderness and Libanon from the river the river Euphrates unto the hindmost sea [that is which liest in the west the east or the sun rising is called the foremost part and the suns setting the hindmost part compare below chapter 34.2 Joshua and 13.5 Joel 2.20] shall your border be [compare Genesis 10 on verse 19 and 15 on verse 18 Exodus 23.31 Numbers 34 and chapter 1.7 Joshua 1.4.]

Give compare below chapter 13.1 and 1 Kings 13.5] the blessing [which is received below chapter 28 that is thou shalt give in charge that the blessing be pronounced or uttered see the fulfilling hereof Joshua 8.33, 34] upon mount Gerisim and the curse [which is recorded below chapter 27 and 28] upon mount Ebal.

\s When and how they where to keep the year of release verse 1 7c. a strict charge to provide for the poor in Israel with a promise of Gods blessing in so doing 7 of releasing man and maidservants among the Hebrews that were sold likewise how they were to be dealt withal if they if they desired to abide with servitudes 12 of consecrating the first born of the cattle 19.
\p
\v 1 At the end of the seven years [that is in the last year of the seven years for the seventh year was ever and anon a year of release compare Exodus 21.2 Jeremiah 34.14 so elsewhere years and days are said to be accomplished and fulfilled when they first begin or run on see Deuteronomy 14.28 Joshua 3.2 Jeremiah 25.12 Luke 2.21 Acts 2.1 ] thou shalt make [that is keep] a release [or omission neglect the Hebrew word signifieth both and both were to be done in the seventh year they were to neglect debts or least wise not to demand or to call them in and to release men and maid-servants and not to till the ground.]
\p
\v 2 . Now this is the thing [Heb. The word that is the law or manner compare below chapter 19.4] of the release that every creditor [Heb. All or every master or Lord of demanding or calling in or of the loan of his hand that is everyone that hath right and power to demand a debt of a debtor and to seize on him or on his estate ] that shall have lent his neighbor ought should release it he shall not demand it of his neighbor or of his brother [or of every creditor shall release that which was lent of his hand which he might have exacted of his neighbor ] because they have proclaimed a release unto the Lord [that is to the honor of God who so appointed and ordained it others a neglect or release of the Lord that is which is which was commanded or appointed by the Lord or when they have proclaimed a release unto the Lord.]
\p
\v 3 . Thou shalt demand it of the stranger but what thou hast with thy brother [that is thou hast lent or trusted him] thine hand shall release.
\p
\v 4 . Only because there shall be no beggar [on necessitous person] among ye [others save whom there shall be no poor among ye] that is if the debtor be rich and ability to pay compare the three following verses] for the Lord shall abundantly bless thee [Heb. Blessing bless thee others when the Lord shall &c.] in the land which the Lord thy God shall give thee for an inheritance to possess it hereditarily.
\p
\v 5 . Only if thou shalt diligently obey [Heb. Obeying obey] the voice of the Lord thy that thou observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day.
\p
\v 6 . For [others when ] the Lord thy god shall bless thee according as he hath spoken unto thee then thou shalt lent unto many nations but thou shalt not borrow and thou shalt not reign over many nations but they shall not reign over thee.
\p
\v 7 . When they shall be a poor man among ye one of thy brethren [Heb. Out of or one of thy brethren] in one of thy gates in of thy land which the Lord thy God shall give thee then thou shalt not stiffen thy heart nor shut thine hand against thy brother that is poor.
\p
\v 8 . But thou shalt liberally open [Heb. Opening open] thine hand unto him and shalt richly lend [Heb. Lending lend] him sufficient for his want which is wanting to him [Heb. The sufficiency of his want.]
\p
\v 9 . take heed unto thy self that there be not in thine heart a word [or matter ] of Belial [of this word see above chapter 13 on verse 13] to say the seventh year the year of release is at hand so that thine eye be evil against thy brother that is poor[that is surly6] unkind unfriendly that thou give him a dogged look and cast an evil and envious eye upon him compare below chapter 28.54 Proverbs 22 on verse 9and Matthew 20.15] and that thou give him nothing and he cry unto the Lord against thee and it be sin in thee [which be inquired into and punished by God in thee.]
\p
\v 10 . Thou shalt liberally give [Heb giving give ] unto him and thine heart shall not be evil when thou givest unto him [that is it shall not grieve thee thou shalt give unto him with no averse unwilling mind but cheerfully Romans 12.8,2 2 Corinthians 9.7] for because this thing the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all thy works and in all thou puttest thine hand unto [Heb. In all stretched forth or in all putting forth of thine hand see above chapter 12.7.]
\p
\v 11 . For the poor shall not cease out of the midst of the land [that is there shall be always poor in the land or with thee as Matthew 26.11 Job 12.8] therefore I command thee saying thou shalt liberally open [Heb. Opening open ] thine unto thine brother to thy distress and thy poor in thy land that is unto him that dwelleth by thee and whose poverty is known unto thee to whom as to thy brother thou art especially bound as both the foregoing and the following words do plainly shew.]
\p
\v 12 . when thy brother an Hebrew man [see Genesis 10 on verse 21] or an Hebrew woman shall be sold unto thee [see exodus 22 on verse 3] then he shall serve thee six years [others and he shall have served thee six years unless the year off jubilee falling in one of the six had made him free] but in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee.
\p
\v 13 . And when thou lettest him go free from thee then thou not let him go empty away.
\p
\v 14 . Thou shalt lay upon him richly out of the flock an doubt of thy threshing flour and out of thine wine press [Heb. Putting about the neck put about the neck &c. the Hebrew word signifieth to put a collar about his neck to compass the neck about as with a cord or the chain Moseh intimateth hereby that there were to furnish him liberally with all things needful that he may go away rejoicing] of that wherein the Lord thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.
\p
\v 15 . And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land o Egypt and that the Lord thy God redeemed thee therefore I command thee this day to day.
\p
\v 16 . But it shall come to pass when he shall say unto thee I will not go away from thee because he loveth thee and thine house because he is well with thee [that is because he fareth well by thee.]
\p
\v 17 . Then shalt take an owl and prick it into its ears and into his door [see hereof Exodus 21.5, 6] and he shall be thy bondman forever [Heb. And he shall thy bond man for eternity that is all his lifetime so exodus 21.6 compare exodus 19.9 1Samuel 1.22 &c. Psalms 73 on verse 12 others understand this until the year of jubilee] and thou shalt do so likewise unto the maidservant.
\p
\v 18 . It shall not be heard in thine eyes [that is it shall not seem or appear hard unto thee ] when thou lettest him go free from thee ] when thou letterset him go free from thee for he hath served thee six years as an hired servant of double wages [that is he hath done as a double hired servant or he hath worth to thee as much as a double hired servant for he had not the liberty to deny thee his service to give it over or to do it slowly as hirelings or day laborers sometimes do but he was fain to serve thee to thy content six years complete some do gather out of Isaiah 16.14 that hirelings might hire themselves for no longer time then for three years] so the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all that thou shalt do.
\p
\v 19 . All the first born that shall be born among thy oxen and among thy sheep being a male thou shalt hallow [compare Genesis 2 on verse 3 Leviticus 8 on verse 10] unto the Lord thy God thou shalt not labor with thy first born of thine ox nor shear the first born of thy sheep.
\p
\v 20 . Thou shalt eat them before the face of the Lord thy god year by year in the place which the lord shall choose you and thine house [that is household.]
\p
\v 21 . But when there shall be any blemish whether lame or blind or any evil blemish then thou shalt not offer it unto the Lord thy God.
\p
\v 22 . Thou shalt eat it within thy gates the unclean and the clean together as a Roe and as a hart [see above chapter 12 on verse 15.]
\p
\v 23 . Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water [see above chapter 12 on verse 23, 24, 25.]

\p
\v 4 . And the eldest of that city shall bring down the young cow into the rough valley which is neither tilled nor sown and they shall cut off his young cows neck there in the valley [these circumstances as some conceive serve to shadow out the heinousness of the sin of the murder and to deter men from it.]

Make her nails that ft fashion prepare them in this sense is the Hebrew word likewise found 2 Samuel 19.24 all these ceremonies mentioned in this and the following verses as shaving the head paring or cleansing the nails putting off her former heathenish garments bewailing her parents &c. were a token of putting off and forsaking the former heathenish idolatrous being of embracing the true religion of being incorporated or embodied into the people of God compare Psalms 45.11 some conceive that these things tended to make a man loath and abhor such king of match as this was and therefore translates the words rendered here pairing the nails to let the nails grow.]

\p
\v 27 . Therefore the anger of the Lord was kindled against this land to bring upon it the entire curse that is written in this book.
\p
\v 28 . and the Lord plucked them forth out of their land in anger and in wrath and in great indignation and he cast the away into another land as it is this day [ these words as also the former pertain to the answer that was then to be given to the nations upon their question.]
\p
\v 29 . the secret things are for the Lord our god but he revealed things are for us and for our children for over that we may do all the words of this law [Moseh having spoken and being yet to speak of many great and also future things in this verse restraineth the curiosity and nicety of searching further into things that are hidden in the counsel of God and chargeth the people to abide and continue within the bounds of God revealed word to search it out to believe it and to live according to it.]

Have given before thy face as above chapter 11.26 and below verse 15, 19] then thou shalt take them again to thine heart [Heb. Cause them to return or to into thine heart compare above chapter 4.29,30 &c. there ye have a like prophesy as is set here and in the following words others thou shalt have taken them again to thine heart] among all the nations whither the Lord thy God hath driven thee.
\p

\p
\v 6 . And the Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart of thy seed [that is he will enlighten thee by the power of his spirit purge and make thee fit for his service compare above chapter 10 on verse 16 where God commanded them to do that which he here promiseth to work in them that they shall be able to do it see also above chapter 29.4 so that the covenant of grace established in Christ is related here ] to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul that thou mayst live [Heb. Forty life’s sake.]

\p
\v 9 . And the Lord thy God will make thee to abound in all the work of thine hand in the fruit of thine womb and in the fruit of thy beasts and in the fruit of thy land for good for the Lord will return to rejoice over thee for good [ that is will again rejoice to do thee good as Jeremiah 32.41] according as he had rejoiced over thy fathers.
\p
\v 10 .When thou shalt be obedient unto the voice of the Lord thy God keeping his commandments and his statutes which are written in the book of the law when thou shalt turn unto the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul.
\p
\v 11 . For this same commandment which I command thee this day it is not hidden from thee [others too high too wonderful for thee see Deuteronomy 17.8 Proverbs 30.18 Jeremiah 32.17 compare Romans 10.6,7,8 where the apostle applieth this text to the doctrine and grace of the gospel without which a man can not understand the commandments of god might much less live acceptable to God according to them compare above chapter 29.4 with the annotate there ] neither is it far off.
\p
\v 12 . It is not in heaven that thou shouldst say who shall go up for us to heaven to fetch it to us [Heb. To take it to us that is to take it and bring it unto us see genesis 12 on verse 15 and so in the following verse ] and to cause us to hear it that we may do it.
\p
\v 13 . Neither it is beyond the sea that thou shouldst say who shall go over the sea for us to fetch it for us and to cause us to hear it that we may do it?
\p
\v 14 . For this word is very nigh unto thee in thine mouth and in thine heart that thou mayst do it [as if Moses had said thou hast not excuse to plead ignorance forthy self seeing this word is fully declared unto thee and thou hast it daily in thine mouth and understandeth sufficiently what the Lord requireth of thee compare below chapter 31 on verse 19 whereunto these words do further agree Romans 10.8.]
\p
\v 15 . Behold I have set before thee this day life and good and death and evil [life with all manner of blessings of thou art obedient as the following verse declare.]
\p
\v 16 . For I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments [see above chapter 5 on verse 31] that thou mayst live and multiply and the Lord thy god may bless thee in the land whither thou goest to inherit it.
\p
\v 17 . But if thine heart shall turn away and thou will not hear and thou shalt be driven to bow thyself before other gods and to serve them.
\p
\v 18 . Then I denounce unto this day that ye shall surely perish[Heb. Perishing perish] ye shall not prolong your days upon the land wither thou goest over the Jordan to enter into it to possess it hereditarily.
\p
\v 19 . I take heaven and earth to witness against ye this day [see above chapter 4 on verse 26] I have set before ye [ Heb. Given before your face ] life and death blessing and cursing chose the life that thou mayst live thou and thy seed.
\p
\v 20 . Loving the Lord thy God being obedient to his voice and cleaving unto him for he is thy life and the length of thy days [that is that giveth thee life maintaineth and prolongeth it compare acts 17.25, 28] that thou mayst abide in the land which the Lord swear unto thy fathers to Abraham to Isaac to Jacob to give them.
\c 31
\s Moseh telleth the people that he shall soon die not come into the land of Canaan promising that God will bring them into it by Joshua and by him subdue their enemies verse 1 &c. he encouraged and comforteth Joshua 7 writteth and delivereth this book of the law unto the priest levites and eldest with a charge to read it seven years before all the people 9 God putteth Joshua into 14 and foretelleth unto Moseh and Joshua the disobedience and backsliding of the people together with the future judgments 16 enjoineth Moseh to a song of admonition 19 Moseh chargeth the Levites to lay up this book of the law besides the ark of the covenant 24commandeth all people to assemble together tohear the song 28.
\p
\v 1 After that Moseh went and spake these words unto all Israel.
\p
\v 2 . And said unto them I am hundred and twenty years old [Heb. A son of hundred and twenty years] this day I shall not be able anymore to go out and come in [that is to execute mine office among ye as I have done heretofore see Numbers 27.16,17 and compare above chapter 28.6] besides the Lord hath said unto me thou shalt not go over this Jordan [see Numbers 27.12 and above chapter 3.26.]
\p
\v 3 . The Lord thy God he will go over before thy face he will destroy these nations from before thy face ye may hereditarily possess them [to wit the nations that is their land as above chapter 9.1 and elsewhere] Joshua he shall go over before thy face according as the Lord hath spoken.
\p
\v 4 . And the Lord do unto them according as he did unto Sihon and to Og king of the Amorites and to their land whom he destroyed [see numbers 21.24,33.]
\p
\v 5 . Now when the Lord shall have given them up before your face [ see above chapter 1 on verse 8] then ye shall do unto them according to all or every commandment which I command ye [that is thou shalt utterly ban them see above chapter 7.1,2.]
\p
\v 6 . Be strong and of good courage fear not nor be afraid of their face for it is the Lord thy God that doth go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee [this promise is applied to all believers Hebrews 13.5.]
\p
\v 7 . And Moseh called unto Joshua and said unto him before the eyes of all Israel be strong and of good courage for thou shalt go in with these people into the Land which the Lord swear unto their fathers to give them and thou shalt cause to inherit it.
\p
\v 8 . Now the Lord is he that goeth before thy face he will be with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee fear not neither be dismayed.
\p
\v 9 . And Moseh wrote this law and delivered it unto the priest the sons of Levi [compare above chapter 17.18] which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord [compare below verse 25 and Numbers 4 on verse 15.] and unto all the eldest of Israel.
\p
\v 10 . And Moseh commanded them saying at the end of seven years at the set time of the year of release [see above chapter 15.1&c.] at the feast of the leaf huts [see above chapter16.13&c. Leviticus 23.34 &c.]
\p
\v 11 . When all Israel shall come to appear before the faceoff the Lord thy God in the place which he shall have chosen thou [to wit the priest with the priest and Levites &c. that stands by] shall proclaim this law before all Israel before their ears [see an example Nehemiah 8.1, 5, 7, 8.]
\p
\v 12 . Gather the people together [or gathering &c. the meaning is that this was to be done at the end of every seven years ]men and women and the children and thy strangers that are within thygates [ that is city dwelling places ] that they may hear and that they may learn and fear the Lord your and observe to do all the words of this law.
\p
\v 13 . and thattheir children that they have not known it [or have not experienced it there thereof or been acquainted therewith that is have not seen all wonders and miracles as ye have seen them ] may hear and learn to fear tehLord your God all the days that ye live in the land whither ye are going over Jordan to inherit it.
\p
\v 14 . And the Lord said unto Moseh behold thy days are come nigh for to die [ that is thy dying day is come ] call Joshua and present yourself in the tent of congregation that I may give him a charge so Moseh went and Joshua and they presented themselves in the tent of the congregation.
\p
\v 15 . Then the Lord appeared in the tents in the pillar of cloud [out of which God was wont to walk with Moseh see Exodus 33.9 Psalms 99.7] and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tent.
\p
\v 16 . And the Lord said unto Moseh behold thou shalt sleep [or lie down to wit to sleep is called a sleep because the bodies is at rest until the time of awaking or raising up Psalms 13.4 and 76.6 Daniel 12.2 Joshua 11.11 1Thessalonians 4.13,14,15 2Peter 3.4] with thy fathers and these people will go up a whorting after the Gods [see Exodus 34 on verse 15 and Leviticus 20 on verse 5] of the strangers of the land [Heb. Of that land that is of the Canaanites that were estranged from god and his people serving strange Gods.]Whither they go in the midst thereof [meaning the land of the strange Canaanitish inhabitants thereof] and they will forsake me and make void my covenant which I have made with them [to wit the people and so in the sequel continually although the singular and plural number be intermixed together.]
\p
\v 17 . Then mine anger shall kindle against them at that day and I will forsake them and hide my face from them [ that is withdraw my blessing and help whereby I was wont to manifest my gracious presence from them and so in the following verse ]that they may be for meat [Heb. For to eat that is may be torn and devoured by enemies as by wild beasts compare above chapter 7 on verse 16 Ezechiah 34.5,8,10 and 35.12.] and many evils [ that is mischief miseries afflictions and so in the sequel ] and distress shall hit them [to wit the people as above and in the sequel ] that they shall saying that day have not these evil hit [Heb. Found and so verse 11] me because our God is not in the midst of us? [ as above chapter 1.42.]
\p
\v 18 . I will then altogether hide [Heb. Hiding hide] my face in that day for all the veil which they shall have done for they have turned unto other gods.
\p
\v 19 . And now write this song [which is recorded in the following chapter which is put by God into the form of a song that the people might the better learn and remember it ] for ye and teach it the children of Israel put it in their mouth [that is cause them to understand it aright to get it by heart and to be able to sing it and so to have it daily in their mouths compare Exodus 4.15 2 Samuel 14.3 &c.] that this song may be witness against the children of Israel[that is may be a memorial of all my faithful admonitions and may convince them to the justness of my punishments when they shall be rebellious.]
\p
\v 20 . For I will bring in this people into the land which I swore unto their fathers flowing with milk and honey and they shall eat and be satisfied and wax fat then will they turn unto other gods and serve them and they will provoke and disannul my covenant.
\p
\v 21 . And it shall come to pass when many evils and distress shall hit them [to wit the people as above and below ] then shall this song answer as a witness before their face for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouth of their seed because I know their imagination [the imagination of their heart see Genesis 6.5]which they make this day before I bring them into the land which I swear [to give them.]
\p
\v 22 . Moseh then wrote this song the same day then he taught it to the children of Israel.
\p
\v 23 . And he [to wit the LORD] gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge and said be strong and of good courage [compare Joshua 1.6] for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land that I swore unto them I will be with thee.
\p
\v 24 . And it came to pass when Moseh had made an end of writing the words of this law [this is to be understood not only of the tables of the ten commandments and of this song but also of the whole exposition of the law as it is contained in these books of Moses] in a book until they were finished.
\p
\v 25 . Then Moseh commanded the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord saying.
\p
\v 26 . Take this book of Law and put it at the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God [that is in the holy of holies to signify the dignity and divinity of this book the two tables of the covenant lay in the ark and this book that the ark might not be opened lay without at the side of the ark this book was found in heydays of the king Josiah 2Kings 22.8] that it may be there against witness against thee [ not only the Levites but also all that people.]
\p
\v 27 . For I know thy rebellion and thine hard neck [ compare Isaiah 48.8] behold while I am yet alive with ye this day ye have been rebellious against the Lord [see above chapter 9.7,23,24] how much more after my death?
\p
\v 28 . Gather unto me all the eldest of your tribes and all the officers that I may speak these words before their ears and take heaven and earth to record against them.
\p
\v 29 . For I know that after my death ye will surely corrupt [Heb. Corrupting will corrupt] yourselves and turn aside from the way which I have commanded ye then this evil [meaning the evil of punishment or all manner of plagues that are mentioned above [shall meet thee in the last of the days when thou shalt have done that which is evil in the latter days [meaning te evil of sin] in the eyes of the Lord to provoke him to anger by the work of thine hands.
\p
\v 30 . Then Moseh spake before ears of the congregation of Israel the words of this song until they were finished.
\c 32
\s The divine song wherein both God himself and his exceeding great mercies to Israel are exalted verse 1 to 5 and verse 7 to 15 an don the contrary their abominable thankfulness most vehemently rebuked 5,6,15 &c. Gods wrath and future judgments propounded 19 yet without sparing the idolatrous abomination of these people enemies 31 whereupon God then again comforteth his people promising to be avenged on his and their idolatrous enemies to reconcile his church unto himself to hear it and to enlarge and extend it among the Heathen 36 Moseh having uttered this song exhorted them to mind Gods words for their own good 44 and receiveth the same day a charge to view the land of Canaan upon a mount and to die the there 48.
\p
\v 1 Incline thine ears thou heaven [such kind of speech directed to the unreasonable creatures tended to Israel conviction and disgrace compare above chapter 4 on verse 26] and I will speak and let the earth hear ] the sayings of my mouth.
\p
\v 2 . Let my doctrine drop [or my doctrine shall drop ] as the rain let my speech flow as a dew as a small rain upon the grass plants and as drops [or thick rain great showers ]upon the herb [that is I will propound a doctrine shall be as useful and wholesome for men as the dew and the rain is the grass or herb compare Ezechiah 21.2 Amos 7.16 Micah 2.6&c.]
\p
\v 3 . For I will proclaim [Heb. Cry call that is publicly declare proclaim others call upon] the name of the Lord render greatness unto the Lord our God [that is ascribe unto him the majesty and great power which he hath and exalted him for the same see above chapter 9.26 and 11.2.]
\p
\v 4 . He is the rock [that is firm and unmovable assure refuge and defense for those that be his so below verse 31 whose work is perfect for all his ways are judgments [allhisactions all his rules are accompanied with righteousness tending to the preservation of the godly and punishment of the wicked] God is truth and is no iniquity just and right is he.
\p
\v 5 . He namely Israel hath corrupted it [namely the Lord] there are not his children the spot is theirs [they are not his children to wit they have so corrupted themselves and so shamefully behaved themselves others their spot is not the spot of his children that is becometh cometh not that are called his children for as much as it prooceedeth not out of weakness but out of willfulness and impenitent heart ] it is a perverse and croked generation.
\p
\v 6 . Will ye requite this unto the Lord ye foolish people and unwise? Is not he thy father that hath gotten [or bought] thee that hath made thee and established thee?
\p
\v 7 . Remember the days of old [ Heb. Of age or eternity that is remember all that hath happened in the church of God from the beginning of the world see Jeremiah 2.20 ] consider the years of every generation [Heb. Of generation and generation that is of all generation or of every generation see 1 Kings 8 on verses 39.] ask thy father he will make it known to thee thy ancient ones and they will tell it to thee.
\p
\v 8 . When the most high divided the inheritances to the nations when he separated the children from Adam [others the children of men] he set the bounds of the nations according to the number of the children Israel [to wit in the tribes and posterity of Israel their habitations and their possessions compare above chapter 3, .12, 13 &c. Joshua chapter 13, 14, 15 &c. Acts 17.26 the meaning is that God and his cancel and providence hath had his eye especially upon his people.]
\p
\v 9 . For the Lords portion is his people [that is every dear unto the Lord as inheritance are wont to be unto men ] Jacob is the line of his inheritance [that is the people of Israel descended from Jacob are as near unto God and in as great account with him as mans inheritance are unto with them which inheritance are wont to be measured out and divided by lines see above chapter3 on verse 4]
\p
\v 10 . He found him in a land of desert and in a waste of howling wilderness [Heb. In a wasteness of howling of solitariness of wilderness ]he led him about he instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eye [as men are wont to keep diligently as the apple of their eye which is very tender see psalms 17.8 Zachariah 2.8 and compare Proverbs 7.2.]
\p
\v 11 . As an eagle stirreth up her nest [that is awakened her brood or young ones with a certain sound or noise to signify unto them she intends to teach them to fly and to bring them to fly] fluttereth over her young spreadeth abroad her wings taketh them and carrieth them [Heb. Taketh it and carrieth it to wit every young one ]on her wings.
\p
\v 12 . So the Lord alone did lead him [to wit Israel or Jacob ] and there was no strange god with him.
\p
\v 13 . he made him ride on the high places of the earth ]that is he advanced him most gloriously and delivered in unto him the tallest and strongest city see above chapter 1.28 compare with chapter 2.36 and Numbers 21.25,32 so below chapter 33.29] that he might eat the increase of the field and he made him suck honey out of the rock [for the land of promise flowed with honey Exodus 3.8,17 even in woods 1samuel 14 and caves of rocks according to the nature of bees Psalms 81.17]and oil out often flint of rock [compare above chapter 8.15.]
\p
\v 14 . Butter of kine and milk of small cattle with the fat of lambs and of rams that fed in Basan [Heb. Children of Basan see Numbers 32.4 and 33 and elsewhere after where Basan lying at the east end of Jordan is said to have been a very fat country ] and of goats with the fats of kidneys of wheat [that is with special thick and swelled up grains of wheat which in respect of their form situation in the fat and swelling are compared to kidneys ] and thou didst drink the blood of the grapes pure [or red wine ]wine.
\p
\v 15 . Now when Jeschurun [meaning the people of Israel who are called here Jeschurun because they ought to be right and upright or to walk uprightly in Gods ways as being thereunto called by him and because of the rule of true righteousness was only with them but for as much as it was far otherwise with them and would be for the future this title the right one or he that is become right is given to them in an upbraiding way which otherwise was an excellent title of honor as below chapter 33.5,26] waxed fat and kicked [as wanton calves or willful horses that is he became a rebel against God ] thou art waxen fat thou art grown thick yea covered over with fastness and he let God go that made him [ Heb. His maker see Job 4 on verse 7] and despised the rock of his salvation.
\p
\v 16 . They provoked him to zeal [see above chapter4 on verse24] by strange gods by abomination provoked they him to anger.
\p
\v 17 . They offered unto devils [that is unto idols by whom devils are served compare 1Corinthians 10.20 the Hebrew word signifieth wasters destroyers so the devils are rightly called as the angel of the bottomless pit is called the destroyer Revelations 9.11] not unto God unto Gods whom they knew not unto now Gods that were come from nigh at hand [that is that were newly or lately sprung up] which your fathers were not afraid of.
\p
\v 18 . Thou hast forgotten the rock that begat thee [that is God who hath been as a father and mother towards you and hath made and adopted ye for his children and hath entreated you with fatherly and motherly affection] and hast put in oblivion the God that performed thee.
\p
\v 19 . When the Lord saw him then he despised them because of the anger against his sons and his daughters [Heb. The anger of his sons and his daughters that is wherewith he was anger against them compare Jeremiah7.29 Joel 3.19 Obadiah 1.10 &c. others which his sons and his daughters had provoked.]
\p
\v 20 . And he said I will hide my face from them[ see above chapter 31 on verse 17] I will see what their end shall be [Heb. Their last uttermost hand most so below verse 9 that is what will befall them at last compare Psalms 37 on verse 37 and Proverbs 14.12 and 16.12 with the annotate] for they are a very perverse generation [Heb. a generation of perverseness ]] children in whom is not faithfulness [that is which keep no faith nor word which are unfaithful and perjurious.]
\p
\v 21 . They have provoked me to jealousy by that which is not God [that is by idols see 1Corinthians 8.4,5 and 10.19] they have provoked me to anger by their vanity I will provoke them to jealousy by those which are not a people [meaning the gentiles which God should convert and call to the knowledge of him and the fellowship with him in stead of the Jews see Romans 9.25 an d10.19 &c.] I will provoke them to anger by a foolish nation.
\p
\v 22 . For a fire [that is horrible plagues of desolation war famine pestilence &c. as followeth compare above chapter4 on verse 24 see Job 22 on verse 20] is kindled in mine anger and shall burn unto the lowest or of inferiority that is unto the place of the graves or sepulchers deep in the ground which shall be so wasted and be destroyed that in a long while it shall bear no fruit see further of the Hebrew word scheol Genesis 37 on verse 35] and shall consume the land with her incense and set the foundation of the hills in a flame [Heb. Flames.]
\p
\v 23 . I will heap evils [ that is plagues mischief which are meant by Gos arrows here in this verse and by fire verse 22] upon them will shoot away all mine arrows [that is all mine plagues which the scripture calleth Gods arrows because they are sent by him an d hit sure and deep so below verse 42.]
\p
\v 24 . They shall be consumed with hunger eaten up with the carbuncle [that is fiery swelling having the of the fiery coal] and bitter destruction and I will send the teeth of beasts among them with the fiery poison of serpent of the dust [that eat the dust of the earth Genesis 3.14.]
\p
\v 25 . The sword shall deprive [the one from the other favoring or pitying any as followeth in the verse ] abroad and terror from the upper chamber also the young man also the virgin the sucking child with a man of grey hairs [Heb. The man of grayness or boariness.]
\p
\v 26 . I said I would scatter [or destroy] them into all corners I would fetch them out of corners I would them out of one corner into another [see the sequel of this verse 28] I will cause this remembrance to cease from among men.
\p
\v 27 . Were it not that I feared the wrath [or provocation ] of the enemy [spoken of God after the manner of men the meaning is were it not that I omitted it for the honor of my name that the same might not be blasphemed among the heathen ] lest their adversaries should have themselves strangely [to wit so that they would not know that I had done it because of Israelis abominable sins but that they by the help of their idols had so mastered and destroyed Israel ] lest they should say our hand hath been high the Lord hath not wrought all this [that is by our own strength we have gotten the upper hand of Israel it is not Gods works at all.]
\p
\v 28 . For they [to wit the Israelites] are a nation that perish by counsels [that is that thrust themselves into perdition by their own wicked counsel ]neither it there any understanding in them.
\p
\v 29 . O that they were wise they would perceive this they would consider their end [or that they would understand this that they would consider their end of the word end see above verse 20.]
\p
\v 30 . How should one [to wit of the enemies] chase a thousand [to wit of the Israelites others of the Israelites would chase a thousand enemies except &c.] and two cause ten thousand to fly were it is not that their rock [that is God as above ] had sold them and the Lord had delivered them up? Or had shut them up to wit in the enemies hand.]
\p
\v 31 . For their [to wit the enemies] rock [that is the idols on which they rely as on a rock ] is not as our rock [that is our God on whom as on a rock] our enemies themselves being as judges [or let our enemies themselves be judges that is they themselves must needs to confess it as finding by experience that their idols have no power at all to revenge or to punish as the God of Israel doth publicly manifest his power both towards his people and their enemies making known his justice towards both.]
\p
\v 32 . For their vine is of the vine of Sodom and of the field of Gomorra [as if it were sprung from thence that is they are of like nature and works as those of Sodom and Gomorra were a very fair and fruitful country but most wicked and profane inhabitants this hath respect to the wine which was offered to idols see verse 38] their grapes are venomous grapes [Heb. Grapes of venom or poison others grapes of gall that is gallish ] they have bitter berries.
\p
\v 33 . Their wine is fiery poison of dragons and cruel venom of adders.
\p
\v 34 Is not that shut up with me and sealed in my treasures ?[that is I know all this very well and have firmly concluded the vengeance of which is spoken in the next verse but will adjoin the execution until the time which is in my secret counsel I have appointed it compare Job 33 verse 16 Psalms 56 on verse 9.]
\p
\v 35 . The vengeance and the recompense is mine at the time when their foot shall slip for the day of their ruine is at hand and the things shall befall them [others that are prepared for them ] make haste.
\p
\v 36 . For the Lord will do right unto his people and it shall repent him[ see Genesis 6 on verse 6] concerning his servants for he shall see that the hand [that is all power all his people strength ability]is gone that he that is shut up is left this seemeth to have been a proverb signifying the utmost distress and desolation compare 1 Kings 14.10 and 21.21 and especially2Kings 14.26 the meaning is that they were at a non-plus both those that hid themselves in the city upon the hope of escaping or were shut up or shaved in prison by any one through pity or favor and also those that were in the wide field were let go or fled away conceiving that none would think of them any more that they seemeth to be quite left and forgotten of the enemies when it is come thus far then as if he should say will Godsend help and deliverance from heaven.]
\p
\v 37 . Then he shall say where are their [to wit the enemies ] Gods? The rock in whom they trusted?
\p
\v 38 . The fat of whose slay offerings they did eat the wine of whose drink offerings they drank [others which did eat fat of their slay offerings and drank wine of their drink offerings] let them rise up and use ye that they may be hiding for you [or an hiding place for you .]
\p
\v 39 . See now that I, I am HE and there is no God with me [compare above chapter 4.35 Isaiah 45.5,8.22] I kill and make alive [ see 1Samuel 2.6] I smite [ or wound thrust through ] and I heal and there is none that delivereth out of mine hand.
\p
\v 40 . For I will lift up mine hand from heaven [that is I will swear God speaketh thus after the manner of man this manner of action was usual in swearing see Genesis 14 on verse 22] and I will say I live forever [swearing by myself see Hebrews 6.13.]
\p
\v 41 . If I wet my glittering sword [Heb. The lightning or shining of my glittering sword] and mine hand take hold of judgment then I will cause the vengeance to return upon mine adversaries and reward mine haters.
\p
\v 42 . I will make mine arrows [see above on verse 23] drunk with blood and my sword shall eat flesh with the blood of the slain and of the captive [Heb. Of the captivity] from head there shall be vengeance of captivity [that is from above beginning at the head others from the beginning shall the vengeance or wrong of the enemy be that is I will revenge all at once wherein the enemy hath offended from the beginning.]
\p
\v 43 . Shout for joy ye heathen with his people [meaning the Jews see Romans 15.10] for will avenge the blood of his servants [compare Revelations 19.2 and he shall cause the vengeance to return upon his advisory and reconcile his land and his people [to wit unto himself grace freely for the Messiahs sake.]
\p
\v 44 . And Moseh came and spake all the words of this song before the ears of the people he and Hosea [that is Joshua ] the son of Nun.
\p
\v 45 . Now when Moseh had made an end of speaking all these words unto all Israel.
\p
\v 46 . then he said unto them set your heart unto all the words which I testify among ye this day that ye may command them your children that they may observe to do all the words of this law.
\p
\v 47 . For that is not a vain [or idle ] word for you[the meaning is the words is not so vain and empty or poor that it may not be worth your labor to mind it in the highest degree ] but it is your life through this word ye shall prolong your days in the way wither ye go over Jordan to inherit it.
\p
\v 48 . After that the Lord spake unto Moseh that self same day saying.
\p
\v 49 . Get up into the mountain Abram this tis the mount Nebo which is in the land of Moab which is over against Jericho [or in the sight of Jericho ] and behold the land of Canaan which I will give unto the children of Israel for a possession [see Numbers 27.12.]
\p
\v 50 . And die upon that mountain whither thou shalt go up and be gathered unto thy people [see Genesis 15 on verse15] according as thy brother Aaron died in mount Hor and was gathered unto his people [see Numbers 27.13 and 33.38.]
\p
\v 51 . Because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the water of strife of Kades in the wilderness of Zin because ye hallowed me not me not in the midst of the children of Israel [that is ye did not at that time publickly shew before the people such affiance in me and for my glory as did become to do you see further Leviticus 10on verse 3.]
\p
\v 52 . For thou shalt see that land over against thee but not enter in thither into the land which I will give unto the children of Israel.
\c 33
\s Moseh blesseth the twelve tribes of Israel before his death and foretelleth what shall befalleth every tribe.
\p
\v 1 Now this is the blessing [see Genesis 27 on verse 4] wherewith Moseh the man of God [that is the prophet speaking by the motion or instinct of the holy Ghost 2Peter 1.21 see further of this title Judges 13 on verse 6] blessed the children of Israel before his death.
\p
\v 2 . He said then the Lord came from Sinai then rose up from Seir unto them he appeared shining from mount Paran [or seir and Paran see Genesis 14 on verse 6 and above chapter 1.1 ] and came with ten thousand of saints [Heb.

\p
\v 3 . Yea he loveth the people [meaning the tribes of Israel as Judges 5.14 and below verse 19 &c.] all his saints are in thine hand [that is thou lookest upon them providest for them Moseh here speaketh unto God ]they shall be set in the midst between thy feet [others let them be set &c. to wit a disciple or scholars at the feet of their masters see 2kings 2 on verse 3 and 4 on verse 38 Acts 22.3] everyone shall receive of thine words [that which may tend to his instructions and salvation.]
\p
\v 4 . Moseh commanded us the law an inheritance [which must be as dear and precious unto the people of God as an inheritance to a man ] of Jacobs congregation [the congregation that descended from Jacob .]
\p
\v 5 . And he was king [giving laws and governing the people as a king the word king is also taken for a prince or ruler Jeremiah 19.3 and 46.25 see the annotate there] in Jeschurun [see above chapter 32 on verse 15] where the head of the people together with the tribes of Israel are gathered together.

\v 7 . And this is of Judah [that is this is the blessing of Judah under whom Simeon is likewise comprehended as having his land dispersed among Judah and going forth to war with him see Joshua 19.1 Judges 1.3 1 Chronicles 14.24] which he [namely Moseh and so in the sequel] said dear Lord the voice of Judah [when they pray unto thee for victory ]and bring them again into his people [cause him to have the victory and to return home safe unto those that be his ] let his hands be sufficient for him strength to stand against his enemies ] and be thou an help to him against [Heb. From ] his enemies [that is t assist him and deliver him from his enemies.]
\p
\v 8 . And of Levi he said Thummim an d Urim be with the man [Moseh speaketh here as also in the following verse unto God of Urim and Thummim see Exodus 28.30] thy favorite [to wit the high priest who was a man of God and in favor of God others thy well beloved thy bountiful courteous gracious one] whom thou didst tempt in Massa with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meriba [seethe history Numbers 20.]
\p
\v 9 . Who [namely Levi] said unto his father and to his mother I see him not [that is I pity or spare them not when God commanded me to do it this relateth to the history mentioned Exodus 32.26&c.] and who knew not his brethren and regarded [Heb. Knew] not his sons for they observed thy word and kept thy covenant.
\p
\v 10 . they shall teach Jacob thy judgments and Israel thy law they shall lay incense before thy nose [spoken of God after the manner of man that is before thee who art in a special manner present with the ark of the covenant which was in the most holy places behind whose vail the altar of incense stood ] and that which shall be consumed [with fire as burning offerings and some other offerings] upon thine altar[of burnt offerings.]
\p

\p
\v 12 . And of Benjamin he said the beloved of the Lord [this hath respect to the tender love of Jacob towards Benjamin where unto without doubt Jacob was moved by God see thereof Genesis 42.36,38 and 43.6,14 and 44.20,22,29 &c.] he shall dwell in the safety by him [that is by the Lord as Benjamin dwelt formerly by his father Jacob ] he shall cover [or protect defend ] him all the day long and he shall dwell Benjamin’s shoulder that is Jerusalem the chief city of his possession thus Jerusalem is compared to the head standing between the shoulders and Benjamin’s land to the body.]
\p
\v 13 . And of Joseph he said blessed of the Lord be his land from the most excellent things of heaven [meaning the most excellent fruits which by reason of the heaven that is of the air do spring forth and grow see Genesis 49.25] from the dew and from the deep [that is the deep waters see Genesis 49 verse 25] that lieth beneath.
\p
\v 14 . And from the most excellent revenues of the sun [Heb. From the most excellent of the revenues of the sun and so in the sequel this is the fairest fruit which by the heat and warmth of the sun come forth and ripen ] and from the most excellent putting forth of the moon [which the moon in divers months putteth forth or thrusteth forth in that the moistened the earth.]
\p

Of the eternity that is which hath been from the beginning of the world see Genesis 49.26 Heb. From the head of the hills &c. that is the principalest chiefest as Exodus 30.23 understand the fair wholesome Herbs of the fruits of trees vines the fair olives and fig trees that grow most pleasantly on the mountains and hills.]
\p
\v 16 . And from the most excellent things of the earth and fullness thereof and from the good will of him [or and this by the good will of God being the fountain of this blessing] that dwelt in the bush [that appeared to Moseh in the bush Exodus 3.2 ] let the blessing come upon from the head of Joseph [that is Joseph posterity ] and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren [see Genesis 48.22 and 49 on verse 26.]
\p
\v 17 . He hath the glory of the first born of the first born of his ox [that is he is fair strong and nimble as the first born of one of his oxen] and his horns are the horns of the unicorn [see Numbers 23.22 and 24.8 the similitude of the horns is often used in the scripture to signify power strength and defense glory honor dignity pride exaltation also firmness and continuance for a thing see 1Samuel 2.1 2 Samuel 22.3 Job 16.15 Psalms 22.21 and 75.4,5,11 and 89.17,24 and 92.10 and 112.9 and 132.7 and 148.14 Jeremiah 48.25 Lamentations 2.3,17 Ezechiah 29.21 and 34.21 Michah 4.13 Luke 1.69 &c.] with them he shall push the people together to the end of the land [or of the earth ] now these are the ten thousand of Manasseh [Ephraim is counted greater than Manasseh because of the birth right was translated upon him by Jacob see Genesis 48.14,18,19.]
\p
\v 18 . And of Zebulon he said he said ye rejoice Zebulon in thy going out [that is because of thy navigation and traffic whereby thou shalt get riches see Genesis 49.13 Joshua 19.11 Matthew 4.15.] and Issachar in thy cottages [that is about thy trading cattle for which the huts and tents served see Genesis 4.20 and compare 49.14,15.]
\p
\v 19 . They shall call the people unto the mountain [that is they shall being moved by the blessing of God being zealous to invite and stir up their example the other tribe as dwelling far from thence to go along with them at mount Zion to the service of God some do also understand that by the means of navigation they should invite the heathen to the true religion] there they shall offer offerings of righteousness [that is the lawful offerings or thank offerings which they do owe according to right] for they shall suck the abundance of the seas [ that is those wares and riches which are brought from beyond sea] and the covered hidden things [meaning all manner of costly things as gold precious stones &c. which are wont to be locked up and hid these are carried and transported by sea and land as we say ] of the sand [that is of the sea whose shores and bottom are full of sand or the costly things which by reason of ship wreck are commonly hid in great abundance in the bottom of the sea and are sometimes cast out upon the shore or else fished and taken up.]
\p
\v 20 . And of Gad he said blessed [that is thanked praise see Genesis 14 on verse 20.] be he that maketh room for Gad [namely God who gave the Gadites room by Jephy the Gileadite when they were also straightened by the Amorites see Judges 11 compare Genesis 49.19 Psalms 4.2 &c.] he dwelled as an old lion [bold and undaunted marching forth out of his troop like a lion to subdue his enemies see the accomplishment 1 Chronicles 5.19,20,21,22] and teareth the arm yea also the crown of the head.
\p
\v 21 . and he provided the first for himself [ he looked out in the beginning for a fit dwelling place for himself or of the first that is of the first place that he met with to wit Gilead Numbers 32.1 &c. which also was granted them by Moseh the law giver Numbers 3,33 &c. and there the Gadites according to their offer and Moseh content or yielding left their wives children and cattle under Gods judgment against the Canaanites see Numbers 32.16,17&c. and above chapter 4.16,18,19,20] because he was there covered in the portions of law giver therefore he came with the heads of people he executed the justice of the Lord and his judgments with Israel.
\p
\v 22 . And of Dan he said Dan is a young lion [nimble and courageous against the enemy ] he shall leap forth as from Basan [hence is gathered that there were many and strong lions there compare Judges 14.5 of Basan see above chapter 32 on verse 14.]
\p
\v 23 . And of Naphtali he said O Naphtali be satisfied with the good will and full with the blessing of the Lord [with gifts which come from the favor and blessing of God ] possess hereditarily the west [Heb. The sea because the midland sea lay on the west side of Canaan see Genesis 12 on verse 8] and the south.
\p
\v 24 . And the Aser he said let Aser be blessed with sons [others above the other sons that is his brethren or blessed that is thanked and praised of the other sons as those that shall partake for the fruitfulness of his land ] let him be acceptable to his brethren and let him dip his feet in oil [compare Genesis 49.20and Job 29.6.]
\p
\v 25 . Iron and copper shall be under thy shoe [others be thy shutting up meaning the mountain wherein these metals should be found Hebrews let iron and copper be thy shoe the meaning is iron and copper shall under thy feet compare above chapter 8.9 shall be shut in and kept as with iron and copper bars ] and thy strength [others fame] as thy days [the meaning is as long as thou shalt be a nation thou salt be strong mighty or famous by reason of strength or power thine old age shall be thine youth.]
\p
\v 26 . There is none like unto God O Jeschurun [others there is none like unto the God of Jeschurun of Jeschurun see above chapter 32.15] who rideth upon the heaven of thy help [upon the heaven that is upon the air from whence he sendeth help unto his people against their enemies whom he from thence smiteth and destroyeth with terrible tempest of hail lightning and thunder see an excellent exposition hereof Psalms 18 on verse 7 to verse 20] and with his highness [that is with his high and glorious working ] upon the uppermost [or thinnest ] clouds which are angered in the uppermost part of the air.]
\p
\v 27 . The everlasting God [ the Hebrew word rendered here everlasting being used of creatures signifieth what which was in the former times of old or from the beginning of the world as above verse 15 but being used of God its like signifieth eternity ]be an habitation unto thee [that is an high place wherein thou mayest live quietly and in safety ] and underneath everlasting almightiness of God shall help and protect them on the earth beneath ] and let him drive away the enemy before thy face and let him say destroy them.
\p
\v 28 . Israel then shall dwell in the safety alone and Jacobs eye shall be upon a land of corn and new wine [that is Jacobs posterity shall dwell in peace behold the fruitfulness of their land with their eyes and take delight in it others the fountain of Jacob that is a lasting spring that stood of all kinds of blessings be among the people of Israel that is sprung from Jacob &c.] yea his heaven shall drop with dew.
\p
\v 29 . Happy art thou O Israel who is like unto thee? Thou art a people redeemed by the Lord the shield of thy help [or thy shield of help that is thy helping shield as Psalms 2.6 the mountain of my holiness that is my holy mountain] who is is a sword of thy highness who fighteth for thee to lift thee up on high] therefore thine enemies shall feignedly subject themselves unto thee [shall be forced to submit unto thee though they have no real intention in it or do it not from the heart see 2 Samuel 25 on verse45 Psalms 18.45 and compare Psalms 66.3 and81.16] and thou salt tread upon their high places [see above chapter 32on verse 13.]
\c 34
\s Moseh goeth up into the mount Nebo from whence God letteth him see the land of promise verse 1 &c. Moseh being yet Lusty and in health dieth there is buried of God and is lamented by Israel 5 Joshua is convinced but Moseh much more 9.
\p
\v 1 Then Moseh went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo [lying as some maps do shew at the southside of Pisga close to the city of Nebo built up by the Reubenites Numbers 32.38 compare above chapter 32.49 Moseh by revelation from God knowing afore hand that he was to die there went very willingly this dying place ] to the top [Heb. Te head ] ofPisga [this was a very high mountain lying close to Nebo which was much lower serving as an ascent to the top of Pisga ] which is over against Jericho and shewed him all the land of Gilead [see Genesis 31 on verse 21 and Numbers 32.1,19 &c.] unto Dan [lying in the north end of Canaan former called Laschem or Lais taken by the tribe of Dan and by them so called Joshua 19.47 Judges 18.29 this chapter according to the opinion of most interpreters was written after Mosehs death by some other men of God whether Joshua Eliazar or some other by a special revelation or instinct of the holy ghost without that the author of this chapter as also the apostle Jude whore lateth somewhat from whence in his epistle could not know these things which passed between Moseh and God alone .]
\p
\v 2 . And at Naphtali [that is in the land of Naphtali] and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh and all the land of Judah unto the hindmost sea [see above chapter 11 on verse24.]
\p
\v 3 . And the south and the plain of the valley of Jericho the palm city [so called because many [palm trees grew there in the valley of Jericho as also balm for which this city was famous and had the name Jericho because of the good and the sweet smell see likewise Judges 1.16 2 Chronicles 28.15] unto Zoar [see Genesis 19.20.]
\p
\v 4 . And the Lord said unto him this is the land which I swear unto Abraham unto Isaac and unto Jacob saying I will give it unto thy seed [see Genesis 12.7 and13.5 and 15.18 and 26.4 and 28.13] I have caused thee to sea with thine eyes but thou salt not go over [over the Jordan thither.]
\p
\v 5 . So Moseh the servant of the Lord died therein the land of Moab according to the Mouth [that is word saying or ordinance] of the Lord.
\p
\v 6 . And he [to wit the Lord] buried him in a valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-Poer [see above chapter 3 on verse 29] and no man hath known his sepulcher [that is the place where the Lord had buried him see the epistle of Jude verse9 this doubtless God would have to be for to prevent all occasion of superstition or idolatry whereunto that people are much inclined as on the contrary the devil would fain have discovered it ] unto this day [from these words it appeareth plainly that this chapter was written after Mosehs death.]
\p
\v 7 . Now Moseh was an hundred and twenty years old [Heb. A son of an hundred and twenty years.] when he died his eye was not grown dim and his strength [that is vigor lustiness youthfulness Heb. Properly greenness a similitude taken from green herbs that are full ofsap and abounding with juice and moisture not withstanding this God made him die even while he was yet lusty and strong ] was not decayed [Heb. Sted away compare Joshua 14.10,11.]
\p
\v 8 . And the children of Israel wept for Moseh in the plains of Moab thirty days [compare Genesis 50.3,10 and Numbers 20.29] and the days of weeping and mourning for Moseh were ended .
\p
\v 9 . Now Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom [that is of the gift of wisdom which the holy ghost had wrought in him for the executing of such an office] for Moseh had laid his hands upon him [Heb. Properly had leaned with his hands upon him see hereof Numbers 27 on verse 18 likewise Genesis 48 on verse 10] so the children of Israel hearkened unto him and did according as the Lord had commanded Moseh.
\p
\v 10 . And there arose not a prophet in Israel like unto Moseh whom the Lord had known [others who had known the Lord ] from face to face [see above chapter 5 on verse 4 and Exodus 33.11 Numbers 12.8.]
\p
\v 11 . In all the tokens and wonders whereunto the Lord had sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land.
\p
\v 12 . and in all that strong hand [that is the work of divine power compare above chapter 4 on verse 34] and in all that great terror [that is terrible miraculous acts ] which Moseh [that is God by the hand of ministry of Moseh] did before the eyes of all Israel.
\mt THE END OF THE FIFTH BOOK OF MOSES CALLED DEUTERONOMY.
