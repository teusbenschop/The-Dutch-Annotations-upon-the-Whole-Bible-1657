\mt2 THE FIRST BOOK OF THE
\mt KINGS
\s THE ARGUMENT OF THIS BOOK
\p In this, and the following Book, is described the History of the Kings that governed the people of God, from Davids time, unto the Babylonish Captivity. Therefore they are called the first and second Book of the Kings. The first beginneth with the sickeness, and death or departure of King David: whereupon followed the Reign of his Son Salomon, who after that he had received of his Father good instruction, to order his life aright; and wise direction to establish his Kingdom; and was honoured of God with his communication, or speaking to him: was also blessed in his person, with wisdom, riches, and honour ; and in his Land, with peace, trading, and abundance of all things, having settled his Court and house in order, he buildeth and halloweth a Temple unto the Lord, and besides reareth certain royal buildings: he growth so famous, that he is solemnly visited, and honoured by the Queen of Scheba, and of the Nations round about, with many Heathenish wives, he provoketh God to wrath, who raiseth up enemies against him, and denounceth by his Prophet Achia, the renting of his Kingdom. This now happened when his son Rehabeam kept nothing to himself, save onely Juda, and a part of Benjamin. He likewise is forbidden by God to bring back to himself the revolted tribes by force of arms, as he intended. For his and his people’s sins the Temple of Jerusalem is robbed by Silak the King of Egypt. His son Abiam succeedeth him in his Kingdom, and in his sins: but Asa and Josaphat being Godly, reformed the Worship of God. As for the Kings, who after the dividing of the tribes, reigned over Israel, of whom mention is made in this first Book; they were all Idolaters, who corrupted the true Religion by Idolatrous abominations. For Jerobeam, besides the rearing of two golden Calves, changed almost the whole Worship of God, and ordained Priests according to his own phansie: whereby he drew aside the ten tribes from the true Religion, and from true Godliness. His Successors followed his foot-steps; but especially Achab. For besides the Idolatry, wherein he exceeded the former Kings, he excercised great tyranny against the true Believers that yet remained in his Kingdom. By reason whereof the Scepter of Israel continued not in one family, as it did in Juda, but by terrible commotions, and cruel blood-sheddings was now and then transported to others. Although now the adnmonitions of the Prophets Achia, Semaja, Adda, Azaria, Jehu, Amani, Elia, and Mach, sent by God, to call those back-sliding Israelites to repentance, were not wanting; yet amongst the greatest part they were fruitless and unprofitable, even when they were backed also with eminent and powerful Miracles. In Juda the Faith of Doctrine, and the Purity of Worship, was stronger rooted and grounded, because there the godly Kings joined hand in hand with the Prophets, and with singular zeal raised up that which was fallen. Of this we have in this Book, as also in the following, a very fair Map, wherein is lively potrayed unto us the changeable condition, which the visible Church is subject to in this world and the unchangeable faithfulness, which God never ceased to show toward his chosen remnant, for the most part invisible to the eyes of men. This Book containeth the passages of 118. Years: where 40. Belong to the Reign of Salomon, and 78 to the reign of the following Kings of Juda, and Israel; to wit, whose History is described in this Book.
\c 1
\s David being old, is ministered unto by Abisag, vers. 1, & c. His Son Adonia usurpeth the Kingdom, 5. Which is hindered by Bathseba, by the advice of Nathan the Prophet, 11. David reneweth his promise, of leaving the Kingdom to his son Solomon, 28. Who is anointed King, 32. Tidings thereof is brought to Adonia, and his party, who leave him, 41. Adonia is afraid of Salomon, who pardoneth his fault, and so sendeth him home to his own house, 50.
\p
\v 1 Now King David was old, [viz. About 70 years, for in his thirtieth year he began to reign, and he reigned 40 years; 7. In Hebron, and 33. In Jerusalem] stricken in years; [Heb. Come into days; i.e. was of a good age: see Gen. 18. On ver. 11.] and they covered him with clothes, but he got no warmth. [Heb. To him was no warm.]
\p
\v 2 . Then said his servants [i.e. Counsellors, Officers, chiefest Courtiers, see Gen. 20. On v. 8.] unto him; let my Lord the King seek (out) a Damsel, a Virgin, that may stand before the face of the King, [i.e. Minister unto him: see this phrase, Deut. 1. On v. 38. & 10. 8. & 1 Sam. 16. 22. 1 King 12. 6. And compare below verse 4. And 15.] and cherish him; and let her lie in the bosom, [see this phrase also, 2 Sam. 12. 3. & Mich. 7. 5. And compare Deut. 13. 6. Together with the annotate. It’s thought that this was done after that he had married her] that my Lord the King may grow warm.
\p
\v 3 . So they sought (for) a fair damsel in all the borders of Israel; and found Abisag, a Sunamite; [so called, because she was of the city of Sunem, lying in the tribe of Issaschar, on the south side of mount Gilboa: see Judg. 19. 18. & 2 king 4. 8.] and brought her unto the King.
\p
\v 4 . And the damsel was exceeding fair, and fostered the King, and ministered to him; but the King knew her not. [See Gen. 4. On v. 1.]
\p
\v 5 . Now Adonia [Who was now the eldest of Davids sons: for Amnon and Absalom were dead; as also Chileab, as is conceived: See of these 2 Sam. 3. 2, 3, 4, 5.] the son of Haggith [See also of this woman 2 sam. 3. 4.] exalted himself, saying; I shall be King: and he prepared him charets, and horsemen, and fifty men running before him, [to have a Kingly Retinue, and train, Absalom also had done, 2 Sam. 15. 1. Compare below chap. 14. The annotate. On the 27 verse.]
\p
\v 6 . And his father had not grieved him, [viz. To rebuke him for it] from his days, [i.e. all his life long, or at any time] saying; Why hast thou done so? and he was also very fair of feature, [see Gen. 6. On v. 2] and (Haggith) had born him after Absalom. [who was born of another woman named Maacha, 2 Sam. 3.3.]
\p
\v 7 . And his consultation [Heb. Words, which is likewise so taken, Numb. 31.16. Ezek. 38.10.] were with Joab [i.e. he conferred, or advised with these men, the better to attain to his design] the son of Zeruja, and with Abjathar the Priest: they helped, following Adonia, [Heb. And helped after Adonia: i.e. helped and followed Adonia: so 2 Sam. 2. 10. & below chap. 16. 1, & c.]
\p
\v 8 . But Zadok the Priest, and Benaja the son of Jojada, and Nathan the Prophet, and Sinei, and Rei, and the champions which David had, were not with Adonia. [Heb. Adoniahu: so below, ver. 29, & c.]
\p
\v 9 . And Adonia slew [viz. to keep a stately feast at his installing. The word slaying is likewise so taken, Gen. 31. 54. 1 Sam. 28. 24] Sheep and oxen, and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by the fountain of Rogel; [or, En-Rogel: see of this fountain, Jos. 15. 7. & 18. 26. & 2 Sam. 17. 17.] and invited all his brethren the Kings sons, and all the men of Juda the Kings servants.
\p
\v 10 . But Nathan the Prophet, and Benaja, and the Champions, and Salomon his brother he invited not.
\p
\v 11 . Then spake Nathan unto Bathseba, the mother of Salomon, saying; Hast thou not heard that Adonia the son of Haggith is King? And David our Lord knoweth that not.
\p
\v 12 . Now then, come; let me, I pray, give thee counsel [Heb. Let me counsel thee counsel] that thou mayest deliver thine (own) soul, and the soul of thy Salomon. [i.e. Save thy own life, thy Son Salomon’s life, which is in danger of Adonia the King. Compare below ver. 21. And of the word soul taken in this sense, see Gen. 19. On v. 17.]
\p
\v 13 . Go thy ways, and enter in unto King David, and say unto him; Didst thou not, my Lord, (O) King, swear unto thine hand-maid, [So she calleth herself out of humility of heart, and reverence toward the King: Otherwise she was his wife, 2 Sam. 11. 27.] saying; Surely Salomon thy son shall be King after me, and he shall sit upon my throne! [i.e. Be King, reign as a King. See Exod. 11. 5. Deut. 17. 18. And below ch. 16. 11. 1 Chr. 29. 23.] why then is Adonia King?
\p
\v 14 . Behold, when thou shalt yet speak there with the King; then will I come in after thee, and will fulfil thy words. [viz. by adding somewhat thereunto, if thou shalt be too short in thy relation: and by confirming thy sayings with my testimony, and exhorting the King to execute the Will of God, who hath determined that Salomon shall inherit the Crown. See below on verse 17.]
\p
\v 15 . And Bathseba went in unto the King into the inner-chamber; but the King was very old: and Abisag the Sunamite ministered to the King.
\p
\v 16 . And Bathseba bowed the head, [See Gen. 24. On v. 26.] and bowed herself down before the King: [understand it of a civil reverence; and see Gen. 18. On ver. 2. Also, below vers. 23.] and the King said, what ailest thou?]
\p
\v 17 . And she said unto him: My Lord, thou hast sworn by the LORD thy God [Salomon to be thine heir in the Kingdom, adding withal thereunto glorious promises, see 1 Sam. 7. 13. 2 Chron. 2. 8. & 29. 1.] unto thine hand maid, Surely Salomon thy son shall be King after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.
\p
\v 18 . And now behold! Adonia is King: and now, my Lord, (O) King, thou knowest it not.
\p
\v 19 . And he hath slain oxen, and fat cattle, and sheep in multitude, and invited all the King’s sons, and Abjathar the Priest, and Joab the Commander in chief, but Salomon thy servant hath he not invited.
\p
\v 20 . But thou, my Lord, (O) King, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest make known to them, who shall sit upon the throne of my Lord the King after him. [i.e. All Israel wait and depend upon thee, that thou shouldest make known to them, who shall sit upon the throne of my Lord the King after him. [i.e. All Israel wait and depend upon thee, that thou wouldst publicly before thy death declare thy Successor in the Kingdom. See the like phrase, 2 Chron. 20. 12. Psal. 145. 15.]
\p
\v 21 . Otherwise it shall come to pass, [Heb. And it shall, or, should, &c.] when my Lord the King shall be fallen a sleep [Heb. properly lie down; i.e. be dead according to the body, and according to the soul taken up into the rest of heaven, to expect there the blessed resurrection of the dead. Death is compared unto a sleep, because it happeneth with the remaining of the souls life, and endeth with the resurrection of the dead body: see hereof also Deut.31.on v.16.] with his Fathers, that I and my son Salomon shall be (as) sinner: [or, be counted as sinners: i.e. as guilty persons, and worthy of death, as malefactors, or such as had unjustly aspired after the Crown. See Gen.43.on v.9. Thus innocent, or guiltless persons are called, that have deserved no punishment at all, Gen.44.10. Jos.2.19.
\p
\v 22 . And behold she spake yet with the King, when Nathan the Prophet came in.
\p
\v 23 . And they acquainted the King, saying; Behold, Nathan the Prophet is there; and he came before the face of the King, [viz. After that Bathseba was gone out of the chamber, as may be gathered from v.28.] and bowed himself before the King on his face to the ground.
\p
\v 24 . And Nathan said; My Lord, (O) King, hast thousand said, Adonia shall be King after me; and he shall sit upon my throne?
\p
\v 25 . For he is gone down [viz. to the stone of Zoheleth, by the fountain of Rogel. See above ver.9.] this day and hath slain Oxen, and fat cattle, and sheep in abundance, and hath invited the Kings sons, and the Commanders of the host, and Abjathar the Priest, and behold, they eat and drink before his face, and say; Let King Adonia live. [i.e. We wish, that King may have a long and prosperous life in his reign. So below v.34, and 39.2 Sam. 16.16.]
\p
\v 26 . But me that am thy servant, and Zadok the Priest, and Benaja the son of Jojada, and thy servant Salomon hath he not invited.
\p
\v 27 . Is this thing done by my Lord the King? and hast not acquainted thy servant therewith, who should sit upon the throne of my Lord the King after him?
\p
\v 28 . And King David answered, and said, [viz. To the Grooms, or Minister, that waited upon him in the chamber] Call me Bath-Seba; and she came before the face of the King, [viz. After that Nathan the prophet was gone out of the chamber, as may be gathered from ver.32.] and stood before the face of the King.
\p
\v 29 . Then the King sware, [David reneweth the Oath which he had made unto Bath-Seba, not out lightness to, or rashness, but, 1. by this resolute and zealous stedfastness to opposite the practise and bold attempt of Adonia. 2.To comfort Bath-Seba.3. To leave to all men after his death a sure testimony, that he had kept close, as in this, so also in all other things, to the word, and will of the Lord, even to the end of his life] and said: (As true as) the Lord liveth, who delivered my soul out of all distress.
\p
\v 30 . Assuredly, as I sware by the LORD the God of Israel saying: Assuredly, Salomon thy son shall be King after me, and shall sit upon my throne in my stead: assuredly so will I do this day.
\p
\v 31 . Then Bathseba bowed her self with the face to the ground, and bowed her self down before the face of the King; and said, Let my Lord King David live for ever. [i.e. A very long time: intimating, that she wished not for the Kings death, when she petitioned, that the right of succession might be settled in her son; but prayed unto God, notwithstanding her petition, for the Kings long life. So is the word Olam taken for a long and unlimited time, below chap.2.33. Dan.2.4. This is a manner of salutation or greeting, wherewith Kings and Princes were spoken to. Of which see also Dan.2.4. and 3.9. and 5.10. & 6.6.]
\p
\v 32 . And King David said, Call me Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet, and Benaja the son Jojada: [Heb. Jehojada] and they came before the face of the King.
\p
\v 33 . And the king said unto them; Take with you the servants of your Lord, [i.e. My servants, who have hither to faithfully served me. Otherwise, of your Lords, in the plural number: that is, mine and Salomons servants; understand by these the Kings Foot-men, Lifeguard, and who in the war fought round about his person] and cause Salomon my son to ride upon the mule which is for me; [This was a token of Kingly dignity and honour, unto which the King would advance a man. Gihon. [The name of a Fountain flowing on the West side of Mount Zion, 2 Chron.32.30. and is to be distinguished from a River of Paradise: so likewise called, Gen.2.13.]
\p
\v 34 . And let Zadok the Priest, with Nathan the Prophet, anointed him there King [This were the Kings, whose choice had somewhat extraordinary in it, installed in to their office, 1 Sam.10.1. & 16.12, 13. 1 King.19.15, 16. 2 King.9.3. This ceremony of anointing, signified, that they are called by God to their office, and should receive from him gifts needful thereunto] over Israel: and after that ye shall blow with the trumpet, and say, Let king Salomon live.
\p
\v 35 . Then ye shall come after him, and he shall come and shall sit on my throne, and he shall be King in my stead: for I have commanded him that he should be a leader, [Or, Conductor, Prince, &c. so below chap.14 7. and 16 2.] over Israel, and cover Juda.
\p
\v 36 . Then answered Benaja, the son of Jojada, unto the King, and said, Amen; The LORD God of my Lord the King say so, [i.e. Well. Let him, and do so to: for his saying is his doing: see Gen.1.on v.3.]
\p
\v 37 . According as the LORD hath been with my Lord the King, so he be with Salomon; and make his throne great then the throne of my Lord King David.
\p
\v 38 . Then Zadok the Priest went down with Nathan the Prophet, and Benaja the son of Jojada, and the Crethi, and the Plethi, [Meaning men, and Guard-men of War, which ordinarily, in time of peace, or war, attended upon the kings person, who above ver.33. are called his servants. See likewise of these, 2 Sam.8.18. & 15.18.] and caused Salomon to ride upon King Davids mule, and conducted him to Gihon.
\p
\v 39 . And Zadok the Priest took the horn of oil out of the tent, [viz, In which David had set the Ark of the LORD, 2 Sam.6.17.] and anointed Salomon: [Understand this of the first anointing of Salomon, which was onely done before the men of Jerusalem; not of the second, which was done afterward in a more solemn manner before all Israel. See 1 Chron.29.22.] and they blew with the trumpet, and all the people said, Let King Salomon live. [see 1 Sam.10.25.]
\p
\v 40 . And all the people came up after him, and people pipes, and rejoiced with great joy: so that the earth rent with the sound of them. [This is an Hyperbolical expression. Compare Genesis 13.on verse 16.]
\p
\v 41 . And Adonia heard it, and all the guests that were with him, who now had made an end of eating: Joab also heard the sound [Heb. voice: and so in the sequel] of the city, that is in an uproar?
\p
\v 42 . As he yet spake, behold, then came Jonathan the son of Abjathar the Priest, and Adonia said; Come in, for thou art a valiant man, [Heb. a man of courage, or, valour] and wilt bring tidings of good. [Or, that which is acceptable and well pleasing: so below chap.12.7. & 22.8. 2 King.25.8. 2 Chron.20 7. Jer.12.6. & 52.32.]
\p
\v 43 . And Jonathan answered, and said unto Adonia: Yea but my Lord King David hath made Salomon King.
\p
\v 44 . And the King hath sent with him Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet, and Benaja the son of Jojada, and the Crethi and the Plethi, and (they) have caused him to ride upon the Kings Mule.
\p
\v 45 . Besides, Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet, have anointed him King in Gibon, and are come up [viz. Into the City of David, which was the hold of Zion. 1 Chron.11 5. 2 Chron.5.2.] from thence rejoicing, so that the City is in an uproar: this is the noise that ye have heard.
\p
\v 46 . And also Salomon sitteth [Or, Hath sat: which served as a publick Evidence, that he was made King: see above on v. 13.] upon the throne of the Kingdom.
\p
\v 47 . So likewise the Kings servants come, to bless our Lord King David, [i.e. To bid him joy with the instalment of his son Salomon into the Kingly Office] saying, Thy God make the name of Salomon better (i.e. more excellent, more glorious, more renowned] then thy name, and make his throne greater then thy throne, and the King worshipped [understand this of a religious worship, which he performed to give God thanks, that he had fulfilled his promised toward Salomon, and to beseech him to bless him in his Government: compare Gen.47.31. & see Gen.34.on v 26.] upon the bed-stead.
\p
\v 48 . Yea also the King said thus: Praised [Or, blessed: see Gen.14.on v.20.] be the LORD the God of Israel, who hath given this day, one sitting on my throne, that mine eyes have seen it. [or, do see it]
\p
\v 49 . Then all the guests, that were with Adonia, were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.
\p
\v 50 . But Adonia feared before Salomon, and he arose, and went his way, and caught hold on the horns of the Altar. [Which was at Gibeon, where the Tent of the Congregation was at that time: see 1 Chron.1.3, 5. The taking hold of the horns of the Altar was an ancient custome, whereby those that were guilty of any crime or facts, and feared immediately to be punished, betook themselves to both places for refuge, to find mercy and favour, and to escape the punishment of death: which sometimes succeded well, as here in Adonia; sometime ill, as in Joab: below chap.2.28. for that against some sins there was a Law to the contrary, Exod.21 14.]
\p
\v 51 . And they told Salomon, saying; Behold, Adonia feareth King Salomon: for behold, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying; Let King Salomon swear unto me as this day, that he will not slay his servant [Thus Adonia calleth himself, to declare, that he now acknowledge his brother for his Soveraign, and was ready to serve and obey him. Compare below chap.18.12, 13. & 20.32. 2 King.5.15, 17.] with the sword. [Heb. If he shall slay his servant with the sword!]
\p
\v 52 . And Salomon said; If he will be a worthy man, [Heb. a son of worthiness, or, honesty. The Hebrew word signifieth not onely strength, and worth, or valour of body, but also virtue and valour of mind or spirit, as here; and Ruth 3.11. Prov.31.10.] there shall none of his hair fall on the ground: [i.e. the least harm shall not be done to him: see this proverbial phrase, 1 Sam.14.45. and 2 Sam.14.11.] but if evil shall be found in him, then he shall die.
\p
\v 53 . And King Salomon sent forth, and they made him depart from the Altar; and he came, and bowed himself down before King Salomon: And Salomon said unto him, Go thy ways to thine house. [i.e. Live a private life, busy thy self with thine own affairs, and rest satisfied therewith, without intermeddling with, or causing any disturbance in the Government.]
\c 2
\s David lying on his death-bed, exhorteth Salomon to a godly life, and to courageous governing, verse 1, &c. He enjoyneth him to punish Joab, for his murders, 5. Recompense Barzillai his kindness, 7. And to punish Simei, 8. David dieth, 10. Salomon reigneth, 12. Adonia sueth to have Abisag to wife, 13. Is denied, and put to death, 22. Abiathar deposed, 26. Joab put to death, 29. and Simei, 36.
\p
\v 1 Now when Davids days were near that he should die, then he charged his son Salomon, saying;
\p
\v 2 . Depart in the way of all the earth: [This phrase is also found, Jos.23.14. and signifieth the departure of man out of this world, by bodily death, which none can escape, Heb.9.27.] so be strong, and be a man. [Heb. for, or, to a man: although thou art yet but young, 1 Chron.22. 5. nevertheless labour to get the vertues of a man, consisting chiefly in wisdom and understanding, a courageous mind, and stedfastness.]
\p
\v 3 . And take heed to the guard of the LORD thy God, [This phrase is elsewhere used of the service of the Tabernacle, as Lev 8.35. Numb.3.7. but here and in some other places of the civil Duties, which Princes and other Governors were to mind and observe, according to the order prescribed them by God. See Jos.22.3. 2 King.11.5. But the word guard is also translated command, or, charge, signifying in general all that the Lord hath prescribed us, either to do, or to omit. See Genes.26.on ver.5.] to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandements, and his judgments. [These three first words are thus distinguished, that the first is taken for the ceremonial, the second for the moral, the third for the judicial or civil laws. See Genes.26.on ver.5. Deut.5.on ver.31.] and his testimonies, [understand the doctrine of salvation, which fully testifieth of Gods will toward us, and of our duty toward him. See Deut.4.on ver.45.] as is written in the law of Moseh: [See Deut.17 18.] that thou mayest deal understandingly in all that thou shalt do, and whithersoever thou shalt turn thyself. [or, make all prosper, &c. See this phrase, Deut.29.9. Jos.1.7.]
\p
\v 4 . That the LORD may confirm his word, which he spake concerning me, saying: If thy sons keep their way, [i.e. Order themselves in affections, purpose, words and works, according to my will: so below chap.8.25. 2 King.20.3. 2 Chron.6 16. This Moses calleth keeping of the soul, Deut.4.15.] to walk faithfully before my face, [i.e. to live uprightly, as in the presence of God, (who knoweth the heart) according to all the commandements: see 2 King.20.3. & 2 Chron.6.18.] with all their heart, and with all their soul: [i.e. to obey God uprightly, and without dissembling, not according to some, but according to all his Commandements, which obedience he looketh on, not in its own nature, (according to which it is here yet defective and wanting) but according to his grace in Christ, in whom it is perfect, Colos.2.10.] then shall not a man, said he, be cut off unto thee from the throne of Israel. [The meaning is, that none of his Posterity should fail to govern; to wit, until the Messiah shall come, whose Kingdom shall be everlasting.]
\p
\v 5 . So thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruja did to me, [viz. Being ever most proud and spiteful against me, because he was very gracious with the souldiers: see 2 Sam.3.39. & chap.19. of the same book] (and) what he did to the two Commanders of Israel, Abner the son of Ner, and Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, [see 2 Sam.3.27. & 2 Sam.20.10.] and shed the blood of war in peace: [Heb. set bloods of war, etc. that is, committed murders. Now that is called the blood of war, which is shed in war; but Joab had shed in war; but Joab had shed blood in time of peace] and he put the blood of war upon his girdle, [viz. putting up his bloody sword into the scabbard, after that he had murdered those two men] that was on his Loines, and upon his shoes, [on which some of the blood of the parties that were stabbed sell] that wereon his feet.
\p
\v 6 . Do thou according to thy wisdom, [viz. According to which thou shalt surely find occasion to punish him, he being a man inclined to changed and commotions,] that thou let not his gray hair, [Heb. his hoariness, or, grayness, i.e. his gray rage] go down into grave in peace. [The meaning is, that Salomon should not let Joab die his natural death, but cause him to suffer a violent death, or inflicted a violent death upon him. See the Exposition below vers.8. & compare Gen.42.38. & 44.29. and 31.]
\p
\v 7 . But thou shalt shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, [See 2 Sam.17.27. & 19.31.] and they shall be among those that eat at thy table: [Hebr. Among thy table-eaters: i.e. that eat of the meat of thy table] for they drew near to me, [viz. Bringing to me, and setting before me all manner of provision, which I indeed lacked in a day and desert place: see 2 Sam.17.27.28, 29.] when I fled before the face of thy brother Absalom.
\p
\v 8 . And behold, Simei, the son of Gera, the son of Jemini [Oth. a Benjamite: see Judg.19.on ver.16 & 2 Sam.16.on ver.11.] of Bahurim, is with thee, who cursed me with a grievious curse, [see 2 Sam.16.5. & 19.19.] in the day when I went to Mahanaim: [a city lying beyond Jordan in the Land of Gilead, in the tribe of Gad, by the brook Jabbok. Why it was so called, see Gen.32.on verse 2.] but he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I sware unto him by the LORD, [see 2 Sam.19.23.] saying; If I slay him with the sword! [Heb. If I slay thee with the sword, (let God punish me) or, (do this, or that unto me:) for the Hebrews in swearing are wont to conceal the punishment: see Genes.14.on verse 23.]
\p
\v 9 . But now, hold him not guiltless [i.e. Let him not go unpunished: so Exod.20.7. & 34 7. & Job 9.28.] for thou art a wise man; and thou shalt know what thou shalt do unto him, [viz. according to the wisdom which the Lord hath given thee, leaving to him the manner how thou shalt put him to death: compare above ver.6.]
\p
\v 10 . And David fell a sleep [See above chap.1.on verse 21. & Deut.31.on verse 16.] with his fathers, and was buried [See Act.2.29. & 13.36.] in the city of David. [meaning the hold, where Davids house was: so below chap.3.1. see 2 Sam.5.7. 1 Chron.11.5. 2 Chron.5.2.]
\p
\v 11 . Now the days [i.e. The time] that David reigned over Israel, are fourty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, [the name of a city; of which see Genes.23.on verse 2.] and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem. [see 1 Chron.29.23.]
\p
\v 12 . And Salomon sat upon the throne of David his father, and his Kingdom was established greatly. [See 1 Chr.29.23. 2 Chron.1.1.]
\p
\v 13 . Then come Adonia, the son of Haggith, unto Bathseba, the mother of Salomon, and she said: Is thy coming peace? [Heb. Is thy coming ( a verb of the infinitive mood) peace? She speaketh out of fear, that he would raise some trouble or commotion, because he had aspired after the Kingdom. ‘Tis as much as if she had said; tendeth thy coming to the welfare of the Kingdom, and of the Common-wealth? What Peace signifoeth with the Hebrews, see Genes.37.on verse 14.] and he said Peace.
\p
\v 14 . After that he said, I have a word to thee; and she said, speak.
\p
\v 15 . Then he said, Thou knowest that the Kingdom was mine, [viz. Because I am the eldest of my fathers son; see above chap.1.on ver.5.] and all Israel had set his face on me, that I should be King: [i.e. all the men of Israel had kept their eyes on me, expecting that the Kingdom should be mine, and wishing the same with all their heart. Compare Jer.42.15. with the annotate.] howheit, the Kingdom is turned about, and is become my brothers, for it became his from the Lord. [He feigneth, as if he desired with all his heart that the Kingdom might be his brother Salomons, to this end taking Gods name in vain, and very cunningly hiding his sinister intent and design, which was by means of the Sun amine to make a party, and so to draw the Kingdom to himself: which King Salomon straightway perceived; as appeareth by v.22.]
\p
\v 16 . And now Lask one Petition of thee, refuse not my face, [i.e. Reject not my Petition: so v.17. & 20.2 Chron.6.42. Psal.132.v.10. contrary to this phrase, to accept a mans face: see Gen.19.on v.21.] and she said to him.
\p
\v 17 . And he said, speak, I pray, unto Salomon the King, for he will not refuse thy face, that he give me Abisag the Sunamite to wife.
\p
\v 18 . And Bethseba said, It is good, I will speak for thee unto the King.
\p
\v 19 . So Bathseba came unto King Salomon, to speak unto him for Adonia; and the King rose up, to meet her, and bowed himself before her, after that he sat upon his throne,and caused a seat to be set for the Kings mother, [i.e. For his mother; it is an Hebrew phrase: so below chap.8.1. & 9.1. & 11.9. Compare Gen.5.5.] and she sat on his right hand. [Being thus honoured with equal dignity and worship, as herson, and that according to the custom and practise of the great ones, who are wont to place them on their right hand, to whom they will give equal honour with themselves, or the next honour to themselves: compare Mat.20.21.]
\p
\v 20 . Then she said, I desire one small Petition of thee, [viz. Small in her opinion, but not in the Kings judgment; as appeareth by his answer] refuse not my face, and the King said unto her, Ask on, my mother, for I will not refuse thy face.
\p
\v 21 . And she said, let Abisag, the Sunamite, be given to Adonia, thy brother, to wife.
\p
\v 22 . Then King Salomon answered, and said unto his mother,; And why doest thou ask Abisag the Sunamate for Adonia? Ask for him the Kingdom also, [Salomon perceived whither Adonia’s Petition tended, viz. to a new tumult and commotion, by means of the desired match the better and easier to attain to the Crown. Hence those that aspired to be great, have frequently used this course: see 2 Sam.3.7. & 16.21.] (for he is my brother, who is elder [Heb. greater, or, bigger, viz.of age] then I am) yea for him, and for Abiathar the Priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruja [Who were addicted to Adonia, doubtless they might continue in their offices and places, and be free from danger.]
\p
\v 23 . And King Salomon sware by the LORD, saying, Let God do so to me, and let him so add thereunto, assuredly Adonia shall have spoken that word against his (own) life. [Heb. against his (own) soul: that is, to the endangering of his life. The word soul is oftentimes taken for life. See Gen.19on v.17.]
\p
\v 24 . And now (as true as) the LORD liveth, who hath established me, and hath caused me to sit on the throne [i.e. Caused me to reign as King. So 2 King.10.3. and 2 Chron.23.20. Compare above chap.1. the annotat. on verse 13.] of David my father, and who hath made me an house [i.e. a Family, and Court according to the seat and dignity of a King: for the word House signifieth often the whole train or retinue of Courtiers. See Gen.34.on ver.19.] according as he had promised: Assuredly Adonia shall be put to death this day. [as being guilty of High-Treason against the King.]
\p
\v 25 . And King Salomon sent by the hand of Benaja, the son of Jojada, [i.e. Sent Benaja, commanding him with his own hand to slay Adonia. See Gen.12.on verse 15.] the same sell upon him, that he died. [viz. he fell upon him with a weapon, sit to kill. So also ver.31, 32, 34 46. the 32. Versespeaketh of two fallings on that were done with the sword.]
\p
\v 26 . And the King said unto Abjathar the Priest: Go 10 Anothoth, [The name of a city belonging to the Priest, lying in the tribe Benjamin, where Abiathar the Priest, and Jeremiah the Prophet were born. See of this city, Jos.21.18: Jer.1.1.] unto thine (own) fields, for thou art a man of death; [i.e. guilty of death, or, that is worthy of death. So 2 Sam.12.5. Item, sons of death, [Which may be thus understood, that Salomon was for the present satisfied with inflicted a lesser punishment upon him then death, keeping him in the mean while still under the guilt of death, so that if in time to come he should commit the like offence again, he should be sure to die for it] because thou barest the Ark of the Lord the LORD, before the face of David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted an all wherein my father was afflicted [See 1 Sam.22.20, etc.]
\p
\v 27 . Then Salomon thrust out Abjathar, that he should not be the LORDS Priest: [Heb. From being Priest unto the Lord, or, of the Lord: Not that Salomon properly deposed, or removed him from his Priestly Office; for he was already deposed in Davids life-time, for his offence committed against the Kings Majesty, when Zadok was anointed Priest in his room, 1 Chron.29.22. but he thrust him out, that is, banished him to his own house at Anothoth; from whence it must needs follow, that he could not administer the office of Priest at Jerusalem, being as it were dead in law] to fulfil the word of the LORD, which he had spoken [which indeed was thus performed by Salomon, but the secret over-ruling providence of God, which it may be Salomon thought not of at that time. See the fore-telling of this fulfilling, 1 Sam.2.33. and compare Matth.13.35. and 27.5. John.12.38. and 19 25. Which places shew that the Prophecies of God are very often fulfilled by men without their knowledge] concerning the house of Eli [viz. that the house of Eli, which descended from Itharmar, should be removed from the Priesthood, and that another house should come into its room: which was fulfilled in Zadok, who descended from the family of Eleazar. See 1 Sam.2.35. and compare Ezek.44.15.] at Silo. [a city in the tribe of Ephraim, where the Ark of the Lord was a long time, Jos.18.1. Judg.21.19. Psalm 78.60.]
\p
\v 28 . When tidings came to Joab, (for Joab had turned after Adonia, though he had not turned after Absalom) then Joab fled to the tent of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the Altar. [see above chap.1. on verse 50.]
\p
\v 29 . And it was told King Salomon, that Joab was fled to the tent of the LORD; [Which together with the Altar, being made in the Wilderness by Gods appointment. Exod.36.1,2,3, & 38.1, &c. were at this time in Gibeon, 2 Chron.1.3, 5.] and behold he is by the altar: Then Salomon sent Benaja, the son of Jojada, saying, Go thy ways, fall upon him.
\p
\v 30 . And Benaja came to the Tent of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the King, Come forth; and he said, Nay, but I will die here: and Benaja brought the King answer again, saying; Thus spake Joab, and thus he answered me.
\p
\v 31 . And the King said unto him; Do according as he [viz. Joab] hath spoken, [Understanding this according to the Law, Exod.21.14.] and fall upon him, and bury him, that thou mayest take away from me, and from my fathers house, the blood which Joab hath shed without a cause.
\p
\v 32 . So the LORD shall cause his blood to return upon his own head, [viz. which he hath shed unjustly. God returneth the blood of another man upon a mans own head, when he recompenseth the death of another wilfully procured by him, with his own death; and that either immediately by himself, Gen.4.11. or mediately by the means of man, Gen.9 6. So below ver.44. Judg.9.24, 27. 2 Sam.15.8.] because he fell upon two men more righteous and better then he, and slew them with the sword, whereas my Father David knew it not, [i.e. My Father not being privie thereunto before it was done, nor consenting thereunto after it was done: see 2 Sam. 3.28, 29. and above v.5.] Abner the Son of Ner, the Commander in chief of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, the Commander in chief of Juda.
\p
\v 33 . So shall their blood [Heb. Bloods. The word blood is put in the plural number, not only because Joab had murdered two men, but because this word being often so put, signifieth the guilt and punishment of death, which the murderers bring upon themselves, Exod.22.2, 3. Psa.51.16. Although sometimes also in the singular number, Gen.42.22.] return upon head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: [i.e. a long time, so long as Joabs posterity shall continue. See 2 Sam.3.39. and compare above chap.1.31. with the annotate.] but David, and his seed, and his house, and his throne shall have from the Lord for ever. [Understand in respect of the outward welfare a long time, as immediately before; and in respect of the spiritual prosperity in Christ, time without end.]
\p
\v 34 . And Benaja the son of Jojada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him, and he was buried in his house in the wilderness.
\p
\v 35 . And the King put Benaja the son of Jojada in his room over the host: and the King put Zadok the Priest [Who before while David yet lived, was anointed with the general consent of all congregation. See 1 Chron.29.22. which Solomon here approved and ratifieth in deed] in the room of Abjathar.
\p
\v 36 . After that the King sent and called Simei, and said unto him: build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there; and go not forth thence, hither, or thither.
\p
\v 37 . For it shall come to pass in the day of thy going out, when thou shalt go over the brook Kidron, [It was a brook running between Jerusalem and the mount of Olives thorow a dark valley Eastward from the city. See of this brook, 2 Sam.15.23. 2 Kings 23.4. Jos.18.1.] know assuredly [Heb. knowing know. So below v.42.] that thou shalt die the death: [Heb. dying shalt die. So below v.42.] thy blood shall be upon thine head. [see Lev.20.on v.9.]
\p
\v 38 . And Simei said unto the King; that word is good, according as my Lord the King hath spoken, so will thy servant do: and Simei dwelt at Jerusalem many days.
\p
\v 39 . But it came to pass at the end of three years, that two servants of Simei run away to Achis, [See of this man, 1 Sam.21.10.] the son of Maacha, [otherwise called Maacha, 1 Sam.27.2.] the King of Gath, [the name of a city in the tribe of Dan, inhabited by Giants that descended from the Philistines, Josh.11.22. So likewise the Giant Goliath was of this city, 1 Sam.17.4.] and they told Simei, saying; Behold, thy servants be in Gath.
\p
\v 40 . Then Simei gat him up, and sadled his ass, and went his ways to Gath to Achis, to seek his servants: So Simei went his ways, and brought his servants from Gath.
\p
\v 41 . And it was told Solomon, that Simei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.
\p
\v 42 . Then the King sent and called Simei, and said unto him. Did I not make the to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying; in the day of thy going out, when thou shalt go hither, or thither, know assuredly that thou shalt die the death? and thou saidest unto me, that word is good, (which) I have heard.
\p
\v 43 . Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD; [Understand the oath made by the name of the name the Lord, which Solomon had added to his threatening uttered against Simei. See the foregoing 42. verse] and the commandment which I had charge upon thee.
\p
\v 44 . Moreover the King said unto Simei, thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: [See 2 Sam.16. 5,6,7.] therefore the Lord hath caused thy wickedness to return upon thine own head. [see above on v.32.]
\p
\v 45 . But King Solomon is blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the face of the LORD for ever.
\p
\v 46 . And the King commanded Benaja the son of Jojada, who went out, and fell upon him, that he died: so the Kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon. [See 2 Chron.1.1.]
\c 3
\s Solomons marriage with the daughter of Pharao, v.1, &c. his worship; 2. The LORD appeareth to him in a dream, to whom he prayeth for wisdom, 5. he obtaineth it, together with riches and honour, 10. and giveth evidence of his wisdom by the sentence passed upon the two women that were at variance about a child.16.
\p
\v 1 And Solomon made affinity with Pharao the eleventh King of Egypt, and took Pharaos daughter, [viz. to wife. See 1 Kings 7.8.] and brought her into the city of David. See above chap.2.v.10. Here Solomon had his Royal Palace or Habitation, from whence he removed, when he had built another dwelling-place in Jerusalem. See below chap.7.ver.1.and 8.] until he had made an end of building his (own) house, and the house of the LORD, [see below chap.6. Understand an house set apart to the outward worship of God, wherein the Ark, a token of God presence, was to be placed, and wherein God would dwell by his spirit and word. Hence the temple is called the Lords habitation, or dwelling, 2 Chron.6.2.] and the wall of Jerusalem round about. [see below chap.9.v.15.19.]
\p
\v 2 . Only the people offered on the high places: [i.e. although things went generally well in Solomons reign, yet there was this default against the lawful worship of God, that they offered upon the high places, and on strange altars; and not only in the tent of the congregation, and on the altar of the Lord. In this case they took too much liberty, chusing yet other places and altars to offer sacrifice unto the Lord; which was expressly forbidden them, Lev.17.3, 4. against which they likewise often sinned at other times. See below chap.22.44. 2 Kings 14.4. and 2 Chron.33.17. What these high places the high places, on which they offered unto Idols, but here of those, on which they offered sacrifice unto the Lord; so 2 Chron.33.17.] for (there) was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days. [see Deu.12.5.]
\p
\v 3 . And Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the institutions of David his father, [i.e. according to the prescript and institution which he had given him in his life-time, and especially when he lay on his death bed] only he offered and burnt incense upon the high places, [i.e. he followed the common abuse of his people; and though God did in some sort wink at it, as long as the temple was not yet ordained for the outward worship of God, yet we read not that ever David did it, who without doubt offered by the Ark, and on the altar of Moses. For in that he offered sacrifice in the threshing-floor of Arauna, the same was done by Gods extraordinary command, 2 Sam.24.18.]
\p
\v 4 . And the King went to Gibeon, [A city belonging to the Levites, lying in the tribe of Benjamin, Jos.9.3. and 18.5. and 21.17. where the tent of the Congregation was, as also the altar which Behaleel had made in the wilderness, 2 Chron.1.3, 5. For which cause they had made there an high place on which they offered. So they had likewise an high place at Jerusalem, where the Ark of the Lord was, below v.15. and 2 Chron.1.4.] to offer there, because that high place was great: [i.e. of great esteem, and very famous, because the tent of the congregation, and the altar of burnt-offering were there] a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.
\p
\v 5 . At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream [Understand not a natural, but a divine dream, which remained firm in his memory, with an assurance, that he was extraordinarily raised up by God: whence arose an actual experience and feeling of the singular wisdom, which God in a wonderful manner had poured out upon him. Compare Gen.28.on ver.12.] by night: [viz. the same night, after that he had sacrificed: compare 2 Chron.1.7.] and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.
\p
\v 6 . And Salomon said, Thou hast shewed great kindness unto thy servant David my father, according as he walked before thy face, in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee: [i.e. In believing, professing, and defending the true doctrine, and in leading a godly and vertous life, as well in his person, as in his office: and all this out of an upright zeal, without hypocrite of spirit] and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son sitting on his throne, as this day.
\p
\v 7 . Now then, (O) Lord my God, thou hast made thy servant King in stead of David my father: [See 2 Chron.1.8.] And I am (but) a little lad, I know not (how) to go out, nor to come in. [see Deut.31.on v.2.]
\p
\v 8 . And thy servant is in the midst of thy people, which thou hast chosen: a great [Or, manifold] people, that cannot be numbred, nor counted, for multitude. [see 2 Chron.1.9.]
\p
\v 9 . Give then thy servant an understanding heart, [Heb. An hearing heart: i.e. which can apprehend wisdom: so hearing is often taken for understanding: see Genes.11.on v.7. and the Exposition here below v.11.] to judge thy people understandingly, discerning between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy heavy people, [i.e. many in number, and great in power: compare Gen.50.9. and see the annotat.]
\p
\v 10 . Now that thing was good in the eyes of the Lord, [i.e. Pleased the Lord well: see Gen.19on verse 8.] that Salomon had asked this thing.
\p
\v 11 . And God said unto him: Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thief many days, [i.e. Long life: so below verse 13.] all thy days, [for all thy life: so a long life is called lengthening of days, below verse 14. also, multiplying of days, Job 29.18, etc.] neither hast asked riches for thy self, nor hast asked the soul of thine enemies: [i.e. their life, to deprive them of it] but hast asked for thy self understanding, to hear causes. [i.e. to be able to discern between good and bad, right and wrong, when he should hear causes, that should be brought before him judge and determine.]
\p
\v 12 . Behold, I have done according to thy words: behold, I have given thee a wise, and understanding heart, [2 Chron.1.10,12. Wisdom and knowledge. Understand here by wisdom, a firm and grounded knowledge of all divine and humane Laws, according to which a King ought to live, and reign, to pleased God, and to preserve his people. Knowledge, or understanding, is a faculty of the spirit, infused into him by God in an extraordinary manner, to use wisdom aright, and to practise the same according to the Laws and Statutes, or Judgements. Compare Job 12.12. & 28.12. Prov.1.2.] (so) the like unto thee, (there) hath not been (any) before thee: neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. [Understand this in respect, 1.Of Kings, Princes, and Potentates, among whom he was exceeding eminent in wisdom. 2. Of natural, politic, and civil things, whose properties, workings, and casualties, he wonderfully reached. 3. Of the manner how he attained to so great a wisdom, viz. not barely by humane instruction, and industry, but by divine instinct, and secret inspiration of the spirit.]
\p
\v 13 . I have also given thee even that which thou hast not asked, [See Matth.6.33. Ephes.3.20.] both riches and honour: (so) that there shall not be any among the Kings like unto thee all thy days. [i.e. In all thy lifetime, or as long as thou livest.]
\p
\v 14 . And if thou shalt walk in my ways, keeping my Statutes, and my Commandements, according as David thy father walked: then I will also lengthen thy days.
\p
\v 15 . And Salomon awaked, and behold it was a dream: and he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD, [Which David had set in the Fort of Zion, 2 Sam.6.17.] and offered up burnt-offerings, and prepared thank-offerings, [viz. to thank God, 1. For that favourable apparition, wherein he offered him the choice, of asking any thing of him. 2. For the Liberal promise, which he there made unto him. 3 For the sense and apprehension of the fulfilling thereof. 4. For the prosperous confirmation of his Kingdom] and made a feast to all his servants. [see Genes.20. on verse 8.]
\p
\v 16 . Then came there two women that were harlots, [See of the Hebrew word, Jos.2.on v.1.] unto the King, and they stood before his face.
\p
\v 17 . And the one woman said, O my Lord, I, and this woman dwell in one house: and I was delivered of a child with her in that house.
\p
\v 18 . Now it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were to gather, (there) was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.
\p
\v 19 . And this womans son died in the night, because she had lain upon him, [or, overlaid him: viz. So that she had pressed her child dead in her sleep.]
\p
\v 20 . And she arose at midnight, and took my son from by me, when thine hand-maid slept, and laid him in her bosome, and she laid her dead son in my bosome.
\p
\v 21 . And I arose in the morning, to give my son suck, and behold, he was dead: but I considered [The Hebrew word signifieth often, to consider and observe a thing very diligently, Job 37.14. Psal.119.95. Isa.43.18.] him in the morning, and behold, it was not my son, whom I had born.
\p
\v 22 . Then said the other woman, Nay, but the living (child) is my son; and the dead is thy son; on the contrary that said, No, but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son; thus they spake before the face of the King.
\p
\v 23 . Then said the King; This (woman) saith, This is my son that liveth, but thy son is that which is dead: and that (woman) saith, Nay, but the dead is thy son, and the living (is) my son.
\p
\v 24 . Moreover the King said, Fetch me a sword: [Heb. Take me a sword; i.e. Taking (bring) me. See of this phrase, Gen.12.on ver.15.] and they brought a sword before the face of the King.
\p
\v 25 . And the King said, Divide the living child asunder in two; and half to the other.
\p
\v 26 . But the woman whose son the living (child) was, spake unto the King, (for her bowels yerned upon her son) [Understand hereby the natural affection, and stirring, that a motherly heart hath, when she sees her child in any distress or danger. See this phrase, Gen.43.vers.30. and the annotate.] and said, O my Lord, Give her that living child, and in no wise slay it: [Heb. slaying, slay it not: so in the following verse] this on the contrary said, Let it be neither thine nor mine, cut it asunder. [Heb. also mine, also thine let it not be, cut it asunder.]
\p
\v 27 . Then the King answered, and said, Give unto that (woman) the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is his mother.
\p
\v 28 . And all Israel heard that judgement which the King had judged, and feared before the face of the King: for they saw that the wisdom of God [A most excellent, and extraordinary wisdom, given him of God] was in him [Heb. in the midst of him. See Job 20.on ver.14.] to do right.
\c 4
\s Salomon chiefest Princes, and Officers, ver.1, &c. The largeness of his Kingdom, 20,24. His daily provision for his Court, 22. The stables for his horses, 26. His great wisdom, 29.
\p
\v 1 So King Salomon was King over all Israel. [i.e. Over the twelve Tribes: which is affirmed of Salomon, to distinguish him from the succeeding Kings: whereof some (namely those who after him descended from the house of David) reigned onely over two tribes, viz. Juda and Benjamin. Others over the ten other tribes.]
\p
\v 2 . But these were the Princes [Meaning chief Officers, or Commanders] which he had: Azaria the son of Zadok was supream Officer. [Or, Duty, viz. of the King, in the whole government of the Kingdom. This Zadok is not held to be the High Priest mentioned in the foregoing Chapters, but another of that name, sprung from another tribe, and that he was chief President in the Government of all the Land next to the King, and therefore named first of all. For the Hebrew word signifieth not onely a Priest, but also a civil Governor. See Gen.41.on v.45.and below v.5. Others think that he was Zadoks Nephew, or the son of Ahimaaz, of whom mention is made, 2 Sam.15.27. and that son called Azariah was a particular Priest, to minister unto Salomon and his family in divine things.]
\p
\v 3 . Elihoreph, and Achia, the son of Sisa, were Scribes: [Or, Secretaries. See likewise of such Officers, 2 Sam.8.17. Esth.3.12.] Josaphat, the son of Achilud, was Chancellour. [Or, Register, Master of the Rolls, or, Recorder: see of this office, 2 Sam.8.16.]
\p
\v 4 . And Benaja the son of Jojada was over the hast and Zadok and Abjathar [Who kept the name of Priest while he was alive, without the deed or actual Ministery: see above chap.on v.26,27.] were Priests.
\p
\v 5 . And Azaria, the son of Nathan, was over the Surveyors: [Heb. Appointers, or, appointed. Understand the twelve Officers hereafter named from the 7. verse to the 19. Who were appointed and ordained, every one in his moneth to furnish the King and his Household with a set quantity, or provision of meat and drink. The Hebrew word is elsewhere taken for a Kings Deputy, or, Lieutenant, who supplyeth the Kings place in the Government of the Land: below chap.22.48. Item, for any other Governour, or, commander, below chap 5.16. 2 Chron.8.10.] and Zabud, the son of Nathan, was principal Officer, [or, President, viz. in the Kings Privy Councel; for which cause he had daily access to the King, as his familiar and special friend. He is to be distinguished from the Supreme Officers, mentioned verse 2. Compare the annotate.] the Kings friend.
\p
\v 6 . And Ahisar was a steward; [Heb. Was over the house i.e. over all the Kings Court-Household, as the word house was so used above chap.2.ver.4. See gen.34.on ver.29.] and Adoniram, the son of Abda, was over the tribute, [i.e. over the Kings Moneyes, Treasures, yearly revenues, Tolls, Customes, Taxes, Tributes, &c. So that this Officer might well be called the Kings Receiver General, Cash-keeper, Treasurer, or Master of the Kings Treasure. Others understand here, him that is set over the Leavie of the chosen men, which were given to the King as a tribute to minister unto him: so below, chap.5.13, 14.]
\p
\v 7 . And Salomon had twelve Purveyors over all Israel, which provided [viz. Meat and drink] for the King [i.e. for him] and his household: each man had a month in a year (allotted to him) to make provision.
\p
\v 8 . And these be their names the son of Hur [Oth. Ben-Hur; and so in these following verses] was in the mountain of Ephraim.
\p
\v 9 . The son of Deker in Makaz, and in Sarabbim [These Cities, and those which follow, are mostly in, the tribe of Dan: see Jos.19.41, 42,43.] and Beth-Semes; [called Ir-Semes, Jos.19.41.] and Elon-Beth-Hanan.
\p
\v 10 . The son of Hesed in Aruboth, [This was a part of the Land of Juda] he had (besides) Socho, [see of this City, Jos.15.35.] and all the land of Hepher, [see Jos.12.17.]
\p
\v 11 . The son of Abinadab all the Region of Dor: [Which was in the tribe of Manasseh beyond Jordan, Jos.17.11. Judg.17.27.] this (man) had Taphath the Daughter of Salomon to wife.
\p
\v 12 . Baana the son of Achilud had Taanach, and Megiddo, and all Beth-Sean, [These belonged to the tribe of Manasseh, Jos.17.11.] which is by Zartana [see of other Zartans, Jos.3.16.] beneath Jizreel; [a city in Jos.17.11. & Judg.1.27] to Abel-Mehola; [see was in the tribe of Zebulon, Jos.19.12.]
\p
\v 13 . The son of Geber was at Ranoth, [See Deut.4.43. & 1 King.22.20.] in Gilead: [see Geb.31.on ver.21.] he had the villages of Jair [see of these Numb.32.41.] the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; he had also the is in Basan, threescore great cities, with walls, and copper bars.
\p
\v 14 . Abinadab the son of Iddo, was at Mahanaim. [See Gen.32.on v.2.]
\p
\v 15 . Ahimaaz was in Naphtali: this man took also Basmath, the daughter of Salomon, to wise.
\p
\v 16 . Baana the son of Husai, was in Asor, and in Aloth. [Some take this word not for a proper name, but interpret it upper parts, lying in or on the mountains, and belonging mostly to the tribe if Dan, and Aser.]
\p
\v 17 . Josaphat the son of Paruah, in Issaschar.
\p
\v 18 . Simei the son of Ela, in Benjamin.
\p
\v 19 . Gober the son of Uri, was in the Land of Gilead [understand the remaining part of this Land, of that which was mentioned before v.13.] the Land of Sihon, King of the Amorites, and of Og King of Basan, and was the onely Purveyor which was in that Land.
\p
\v 20 . (Now) Juda and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and being chearingful.
\p
\v 21 . And Salomon reigned over all Kingdoms, from the River [viz.Euphrates: see Gen.2.on v.14. This River was the Israelites border North-Eastward] (unto) [this word is here inserted out of 2 Chron.9.26.] the Land of the Philistines. [which was their border West-ward] and unto the border of Egypt, [understand the River Sichor the South-border of their land Here we have the fulfilling of the promises heretofore frequently made; as Genes.15.18. Exod.23.31. Deut.11.24. Jos.1.4.] they brought Presents, and served Salomon all the days of his life.
\p
\v 22 . Now Salomons meat [Heb.Bread] for one day was thirty Cor [Understand by this word the great measure of the Hebrews of dry Wares, containing ten Epha’s, one Epha 43 2.common egg-shells, and consequently one Cor 43 20.egg-shels. This measure is also called an Homer, Lev.27.16.] of meal-flower, and threescore Cor of meal.
\p
\v 23 . Ten fat oxen, and twenty pasture-oxen, and an hundred sheep; besides the Harts, and roe-Bucks, and wild oxen, and fatted fowls.
\p
\v 24 . For he had dominion over all that was on this side the river [viz.Euphrates. See above v.21. See the annotat.] from Tipsah [the name of a city lying on the north-east border of the Kingdom of Israel. See of this also, 2 King.15.16.] unto Gaza, [Heb. Hazza. a city lying on the South-west-border of the Land of Canaan, Gen.10.19. Deut.2.23.] over all the Kings on this side the river; and he had peace on all his sides [Heb. passages] round about.
\p
\v 25 . And Juda and Israel dwelt safely, [See Lev.26.5.] every man under his vine, and under his fig-tree; [a phrase, signifying a time of great peace, plenty, and prosperity in all things, not onely in temporal, as here, but also in spirituals; as Mich.4.4. Zach.3.10.] from Dan to Ber-Seba, [i.e. from the North-border of the Land of Canaan, to the South-border. So Judg.20.1. Of Dan, see Gen.14.on v.14. Of Berseba, Gen.21.on v.31.] all the days of Salomon.
\p
\v 26 . Salomon had also fourty thousand stalls of horses, [Understand this of places for horses, in each whereof one horse stood. Now Salomon had also four thousand stalls for horses, 2 Chron.9.25. whereof each had ten partitions for horses, making together the number of fourty thousand] for his charets, [the number of these was a thousand and four hundred, below chap.10.26.] and twelve thousand horsemen.
\p
\v 27 . Now those Purveyors, [Which were named above, ver.7, &c.] every one in his month, made provision for King Salomon, and for all them that approached to King Salomons table; they let nothing be wanting.
\p
\v 28 . Now they brought the barley and the straw for the horses, and for the swift camels, [Called Dromedaries. Others interpret the Hebrew word Post-horses, Swift-horses, or Mules, who were likewise very swift in running. See Esth 8.10, 14.] to the place where he was, [viz. King Salomon. Oth.unto the place where it was (appointed) or, where they were, or, where every man was, according to this charge] every man according to his charge.
\p
\v 29 . And God gave Salomon wisdom, and understanding exceeding much, [See above chap.3.on ver.12.] and a large capacity of heart, [Heb. wideness, or, breadth of heart; which is sometime taken in a bed sense, signifying loftiness, or pride of heart, Prov.21.4. sometimes in a good sense, as here, and signifieth a great measure, or capacity, not onely of knowledge, discerning, and memory, but also of boldness, courage, and desire to effect and per. form every thing most bravely and nobly] as the sand which is on the sea shore. [Heb. lip of the sea. The meaning is, he had as much aforesaid things, as the sand, &c. an hyperbole, or excessive kind of speech, as above chap.1.ver.40.]
\p
\v 30 . And the wisdom of Salomon was greater then the wisdom of all those of the east, [Heb. Children of the East. See Gen.29.on v.1. These as also the Egyptians, were renowned for their great wisdom and skill in all manner of Arts and Sciences, although afterward they declined to vain and superstitious arts, Isa.2.6.] and then all the wisdom of the Egyptians:
\p
\v 31 . Yea, he was wiser then all men; then Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda the sons of Mahol: [See of these men, 1 Chron.2.6.] and his name was among all the Heathen round about.
\p
\v 32 . And he spake three thousand sentences [Whereof a part are in the books of the Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Salomons song. The Hebrew word translated Proverb, signifieth a speech or sentence, which for its brevity, wise, and deep learning, exceedeth all the rest, Prov.1.1.] besides, his songs were a thousand and five.
\p
\v 33 . He spake also of trees; [The Writing hereof are not now extant, and that without diminishing the holy Scripture, or hinderance of our salvation] from the Cedar-tree, [see Judg.9. onv.15.] which is on Libanon, [an excellent mountain, lying on the North border of Palestina.See Deut.3.25.& 11..24. Jos.9.1. Psal.92.13. Isa.35.2.] unto the hyssop that growth out of the wall: [the Hebrew word Ezob, the Greek Translators have translated it Hyssop, which word the Apostle retaineth, Heb.9.19. although some hold it to be wild marjoram, others, wild savoury; others, Rosemary, or, Parietaria, i.e. Pellitory of the wall: so that it is uncertain what kind of hearby it was among the Ancients: see Exod.12.22.] he spake also of cattle, and fowl, and of creeping (beasts), and of fishes.
\p
\v 34 . And there came of all people, to hear the wisdom of Salomon; from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.
\c 5
\s Hiram maketh friendship with Salomon, ver.1, &c. Who requesteth of him materials for the building of the Temple, 2 etc. Hiram praising God for such a Successor of David sendeth them to him, together with order touching the conditions, 7. The number of labourers, and workmen employed about the Temple, 13.
\p
\v 1 And Hiram [He is also called Hirom, below v.10 &18. also Haram, 2. Chron.2.3. and is to be distinguished from another Hiram, who was a skilful artificer, a widows son; of whom see below chap.17.13, 14. & 2 Chron.2.14.] King of Tyrus, [the Metropolis or chief city of Phaenicia, lying in the midland sea, seven hundred paces from the Continent or firm land, before Alexander the Great his time, very rich, mighty and renowned for their Navigation and Merchandise. See Isa.23. Item, chap.26, & 27, & 28.] sent his servants unto Salomon [to declare his joy, that Salomon was made King in his Fathers room, to obtain his friendship, and to enter into a Covenant with him; as it came to pass also: see ver.12.] (for he had heard that they had anointed Salomon King in the room of his Father,) because Hiram had ever [Heb. all the days] loved David. [or, been Davids friend, see 2 Sam.5.11. 1 Chron.chap.14. verse 1.]
\p
\v 2 . After that, Salomon sent to Hiram, saying:
\p
\v 3 . Thou knowest that David my father could not build an house [Compare Gen.28.on v.27. and 22.] unto the name of the LORD his God, [i.e. unto the LORD himself, who revealed himself in his word and works: so below, and Psa.20.2. and 52.11. &c. See Deut.28.on v.58.] because of the war, wherewith they [viz.the enemies that made war against him] compassed him about; until the LORD gave them under the soles of his feet. [i.e. subdued and brought them under his dominion. See the like phrase, Psa.8.7. 1 Cor.15.27. Eph.1.22.]
\p
\v 4 . But now the LORD my God hath given me rest round about: there is no adversary, nor entreating of evil. [Or, evil occurrent: viz. which might hinder me from building the LORD an house.]
\p
\v 5 . And behold, I purpose [Heb. I say, viz. In mine heart, as such saying is expounded, gen.17.17. Psal.14.1. & 36.2. Rom.10.6. saying in his heart, is as much as thinking, pondering, conceiving, purposing, concluding; see Gen.20.on v.11. And the meaning here is, that Salomon not onely thought, but also purposed, and firmly determined to build an house unto the LORD] to build an house for the Name of the LORD my God: according as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying; Thy son whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build that house unto my Name. [see 2 Sam.7.13. 2 Chron.22 10.]
\p
\v 6 . Now then command that they hew me Cedars [See above chap.4.on v.33.] out of Lebanon, and my servants shall be with thy servants, and I will give the hire of thy servants unto thee, according to all that thou shalt say: for thou knowest, that (there) is none among us, that knoweth to hew wood, like unto the Sidonians. [i.e. the Natives and Citizens of the city of Zidon: of which see Gen.10.on v.15.]
\p
\v 7 . And it came to pass, when Hiram had heard the words of Salomon, that he rejoiced greatly: and said, Blessed [see gen.14.on v.20.] be the Lord this day, who hath given unto David a wise son, over this great people.
\p
\v 8 . And Hiram sent unto Salomon, saying; I have heard whereof thou hast sent unto me: I will do all thy will concerning Cedar-wood, and concerning Fir-wood. [Or, a sort of Cedars, of which they made Arrows, Lances, Chests, Musical Instruments, &c. Others Poplar-wood: see of this 2 Sam.6.5. below chap.6.15, 34. 2 King.19.23. 2 Chron.3.5.]
\p
\v 9 . My servants shall bring them down from Libanon [See above chap.4.on v.33.] unto the sea, [viz. of Japho, or Joppe, 2 Chron.2.16.] and I will cause them to be carried over the sea in floats [Heb. cause them to be laid, etc.i.e. I will lay them on floats, and cause them to be transported by sea. It is an Hebrew phrase, which often occurreth, see Gen.12.on ver.15.] unto the place that thou shalt signifie unto me, [Heb. that thou shalt send me: by sending, acquaint me, or let me know] and will loosen [or, undo, untie. The Hebrew word signifieth properly to scatter, divide, loosen one thing from another: as this also is done with the floats] them there, and thou shalt take them away; thou shalt also do my will, that thou give food [Heb. bread: under which other food is likewise comprehended, as the 11. verse sheweth: see Gen.3 on verse 19.] for my house. [Although Tyre and Zidon were rich cities, in respect of navigation, yet they had but a dry and barren country that they yielded not much fruit, for which cause they were to be furnished with provision of food out of other countries, and especially out of the Land of Israel, Act.12.20.]
\p
\v 10 . So Hiram gave Salomon Cedar-wood, and Fir-wood (according to) all his will.
\p
\v 11 . And Salomon gave Hiram twenty thousand Cor[See of this measure above chap.4.on ver.22.] of Wheat, for food of his house, and twenty Cor of beaten oil: [It appeareth by this place, as also by Ezek 45.14. that this measure was likewise used in liquid wares, although it was properly of dry wares, 2 Chron.2.10. mention is made of twenty thousand baths of oil: Item, hereunto are yet added twenty thousand Cor of Barley; and twenty thousand haths of wine. But it’s conceived, that both here, and 2 Chron.2.10. is spoken of divers delivering in: here, of that which belonged to the yearly maintenance of Hirams household; and there, of that which the work-folks and labourers had need of] such gave Salomon to Hiram year by year.
\p
\v 12 . The LORD then gave Salomon wisdom, according as he had spoken unto him: [See 1 King.3.12.] and there was peace between Hiram, and between Salomon, and they both made a Covenant.
\p
\v 13 . And King Salomon raised a Leavie out of all Israel, and the Leavie was thirty thousand men. [By Leavy here is meant a Tax, not of goods, or monies, but of persons and men, that were chosen and taken up, to hew wood, &c. upon mount Libanon, for the building of the Temple. Compare below chap.9.21. and the annotations.]
\p
\v 14 . And he sent then to Libanon ten thousand a month by turns, [Heb. with changes] a month they were in Libanon, two months every man in his (own) house; and Adoniram was over this Leavie. [i.e. He had a charge to raise this Leavie, or to be an Overseer thereof, after it was raised, or he was put in trust for both. See likewise of this Adoniram above chap.4 6.]
\p
\v 15 . Besides, Salomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens: [These were strangers, as appeareth 2 Chron.2.17.18.] and fourscore thousand hewers [The Hebrew word signifieth as well hewers of stone, 1 Chron.22.2. as hewers of wood, Ezek.3.7.] on the mountains.
\p
\v 16 . Besides the Commanders of Salomons appointed men [i.e. Officers, Commissioners, Overseers. Compare above chap.4.5. and the annotat.] which were over that work, three thousand and three hundred [2 Chron.2.2. is mentioned six hundred, which is thus understood, that the three hundred here omitted, were the overseers of these Commanders. Some conceive that there were three thousand and three hundred over those that carried burdens, and hewed stone, and three hundred over those that were employed in mount Libanon] which ruled over the people that did that work.
\p
\v 17 . Now when the King commanded, then they brought great stones, costly stones, [understand, not precious stones, which are likewise so called below chap.10. ver.2, 10.] but such as were eminent for size and greatness] bewed stones, to lay the foundation of that house.
\p
\v 18 . And Salomon builders, and Hirams builders, and the Giblites [The opinion of some is, that these were the Inhabitants of the city of Gebal, which lay by Zidon in Phenicia: of which see Psal.83.8. & Ezek.27.9. It’s conceived likewise that Gilblin was the name of name famous Artificers in stone-works] did hew them, and prepared the wood, and the stones, to build that house.
\c 6
\s The time of the building of Salomons Temple, ver.1, &c. The form and Largeness thereof, 2. The Windows, Chambers, and Materials, 4. The Promise pronounced by God concerning the Temple, 11. The covering of the Walls and Floor, 14. The Oracles place, 16. The Cherubims, 23. Divers Ornaments, 28. Doors, 31. The inner Court, 36. The time how long the Temple was in building, 37.
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass in the four hundred and fourscore year, [Some count these years thus; the children of Israel were fourty year under Moseh in the Wilderness, seventeen under Josua, and two hundred ninety nine under the Judges, eighty under Eli, Samuel and Saul, fourty under David. These being summed up together, with four years of Salomons Reign, make in all four hundred and eighty years] after the departure of the children of Israel out of Egypt, in the fourth year of Salomons reign over Israel [see 2 Chron.2.2.] in the month Zihu, [almost agreeing with our April, and partly with our May. See of this month also below v.37. Item, Numb.1.on v.1.] (this is the second month) [according to Gods appointment, Exod.12.2.] that he built [i.e. begun to build: so Gen.5.22. See hereof further below v.37.38. 2 Chron.3.1.] the house of the LORD. [see Acts 7.47.]
\p
\v 2 . And that house which King Solomon built unto the LORD, was threescore ells (or cubits) [viz. of the sanctuary. See of this measure, Gen.6.on ver.15.] in the length thereof, [this extended from the East to the West] and twenty in the breadth thereof, [this was from the South to the North] and of thirty ells in the height thereof.
\p
\v 3 . And the Porch before the Temple of that house, [See Jos.10.23. Acts 3.11.and 5.12.] was twenty ells in the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house, [i.e. this porch was just as long as the LORDS house, or the Temple was broad. Compare the foregoing verse] ten ells in the breadth thereof, before the house. [here is only spoken of the length and breadth thereof: but 2 Chron.3.4. we find also the height thereof, which was of a hundred and twenty ells.]
\p
\v 4 . And he made windows to the house of close lookings out. [i.e. which were partly narrow, and as it were shut against the looking in and inconveniency of the weather, partly broad, and so consequently sit to let in the sunbeams, and to look out. Thus according to the opinion of some, the windows in the wall, (which was very thick) were narrow without, and wide within. Others think that they were wide without, and narrow within: others, that they were wide both without and within, but by degrees narrow on both sides, entring to the middle of the wall, where they were shut close with glass, against foul weather. Oth. which might be opened and shut.]
\p
\v 5 . And round about, [viz. on the South, West and North-side of the house, and not on the East-side, which was filled up with the entry or porch] at the wall of the house [i.e. at the wall of the Temple; and that so, as that the beames of the chambers here mentioned, were not wrought into the wall of the Temple, but lay upon the buttresses of the same wall, where it was narrowed from without. This narrowing happened three times at each, with the raising of it five ells or cubits, and then upon those sticking out were buttresses laid and sitted for the beams of the chambers, which were three stories high] he built chambers. [Heb. floors, i.e. chamber-buildings and with-drawings, rooms without the Temple for the Priests use, when they executed their office, and to look up in them the first fruits, tenths, Priest garments, offerings and other things appertaining to the service of God, &c. See 2 Kings 11.2. and 1 Chron.28.12. and Ezek.42.13, 144.] against the walls of the house round about (both) of the Temple, [understand the foremost part of the Temple, otherwise called the holy place, into which the Priest daily entered to burn incense, and to dress the Lamps] and oracles-place: [or answering-place. The Hebrew word hath its name from communing, or speaking to. Understand the innermost place of the Temple, otherwise called the holy of holies, from whence God gave his oracle and answer. Compare below ver.16. and 20.] So he made side-chambers [Heb. ribs. Understand the same chambers, whereof was spoken in the beginning of this verse, or certain passages of galleries, which were before, all along the second and third story of these chambers] round about.
\p
\v 6 . The lowermost chamber was five ells in the breadth thereof, and the middlemost six ells in the breadth thereof, and the third seven ells in the breadth thereof: [The wall of the Temple having three narrowing’s, the lowermost, the middlemost and the uppermost, the lowermost story of the chambers was an ell narrower then the middlemost, and the middlemost was again so much narrower then the uppermost] for he had made narrowed rests round about at the house, [he each time had made the thickness of the wall an ell narrower, to lay the beams of the chambers without upon the rests. This narrowing or shortning was in the top of the wall of 5 and 10 and 15 ells] that they [viz. the chambers] should not be fastened in the walls of the house. [i.e. that they might not with their beams be fastned in the wall of the temple by boring thorough or breaking the wall. Compare Ezek.41.6.]
\p
\v 7 . Now the house when it was built with perfect stone, [i.e. which was before perfectly prepared and sitted for the work, which is likewise affirmed of the wood or timber, above chap.5.18.] as it was brought thither [Heb.or bringing thither, i.e. as it came (being brought) thither] so that no hammers, nor axe (or iron tool was heard in the house, when it was built.
\p
\v 8 . The door of the middlemost side-chamber, [i.e. thorough which they went up to the middlemost side-chamber] was on the right side of the house: [Hebr.shoulder, etc. The right side of the Temple as they went forth, was the south, for the entrance of the Temple stood in the Eats, and the most holy place in the West] and they went by winding stirs to the middlemost (side-chamber) and from the middlemost to the third. [viz. side-chambers. By the plural number here may be understood that every story had divers chambers and corners. See 2 Kings 11.2.]
\p
\v 9 . So he built the house, and perfected it: and covered the house [viz. within on its roof] with arches, [Heb. according to the opinion of some, backs] and rowes of Cedars, [Hebr. orderings in, or with Cedars, i.e. with orderly fastening or joying together of Cedar-beams, planks or boards.]
\p
\v 10 . He built also the chambers against all the house, five ells in the height thereof: and joined them fast to the house, [i.e. he joined and sitted them on the narrowings of the wall of the Temple. See ab.v.6.] with Cedar-wood.
\p
\v 11 . Then came the word of the LORD unto Salomon, saying;
\p
\v 12 . Concerning this house that thou buildest, if thou walkest in my statutes, and executes my judgements, and keepest all my commandments, [How these three words, statutes, judgements, and commandments are distinguished, see above chap.2.on v.3.] walking in the same: then will I confirm my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy Fathers. [see 1 Kings 2.4. and 9.4. 2 Sam.7.13. 1 Chron.22.10, 19.]
\p
\v 13 . And I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel: [See Lev.26.on v.12.] and I will forsake my people of Israel.
\p
\v 14 . So Solomon built that house, [i.e. he went on in the building of the Temple, to perfect and adorn the same within] and finished it.
\p
\v 15 . He also built the walls of the house within with Cedar-planks; [Heb. sides, and so in the following verse, i.e. he covered the walls with Cedar-planks, etc. so in the following word] from the floor of the house to the roof of the walls, [Heb. to the walls of the roof; i.e. to the uppermost part of the wall, on which the rooftesteth] he covered it within with wood: and covered over the floor of the house [understand this not of the innermost part of the house, but of the fore most, called the holy place] with planks of fir.
\p
\v 16 . Besides he built twenty ells [The length of the Temple was threescore ells, above v.2. whereof the foremost part had forty, and consequently the innermost twenty] with planks of Cedar, on the sides of the house, [the meaning is, that he covered the partition-wall (whereby the holy place was distinguished or divided from the holy of holies) with planks Cedar] from the floor to the walls: [i.e. the whole floor from one wall to another] he built this for him [viz. for the Lord, of whom was spoken immediately before ver.13.] within for an oracles-place for the holy of holies.
\p
\v 17 . Now that house was fourty ells; (namely) the Temple, [Called, the holy place. This was as long again as the holy of holies, which had but twenty ells in length below v.20.] that was before it.
\p
\v 18 . And the Cedar on the house within was carved with knops, [Others, wild gourds, so below chap.7.24.] and open flowers: [Heb. opening of flowers. So in the sequel] it was all Cedar, (there) was no stone seen.
\p
\v 19 . And the Oracles-place he prepared in the house [Heb. in the midst of the house. The word house signifieth here the whole fabric or building of the Temple] within [viz. the place where the holy of holies was in the outermost part of the Temple] to set there the Ark of the covenant of the LORD.
\p
\v 20 . And the Oracles-place in the forepart [i.e. which as a man entered in from the East to the West, lay before him in the end of the holy place. Oth. the space, (or the faces) of the Oracles-place] was twenty ells in length, and twenty ells in breadth, and twenty ells in the height thereof, [indeed above v.2. is mentioned concerning the whole house that it was thirty ells high: but seeing they were to go up by steps or stairs from the first court into the second, and from the second into the holy place, and from this into the holy of holies, as may be gathered from Ezek.49.6. Its no wonder that the floor was certain ells higher, and nigher to the roof] and he over-laid it with close gold; [i.e. plate-gold, fine, pure gold. See 2 Chron.3.4. or so called, (as others conceive) because it was locket up; and kept by David for the building of the Temple, 1 Chron.29.3, 4. where it is also called gold of Ophir, which for its worth and value was ever held in great esteem, Job 22.24. but the costliest and most precious gold was likewise generally so called, be cause they were wont to lock it up very close, Job 28.15.] he likewise over-laid the Cedar-altar. [Meaning the altar of incense; of which also mention is made below v.2. and 23. This Solomon likewise over-laid with gold, and is therefore called the Golden altar, below Chap.7.48.]
\p
\v 21 . And Solomon over-laid the house [Meaning, the holy of holies, as is expounded in the end this verse] within with close gold: and he drew (a vail) thorough it with golden chains before the Oracle-place, [the meaning is, that Salomon caused a veil to be made, which he drew all along to the partition, which divided the holy from the most holy place, hanging on golden chains. See of this veil, Exod chap.26. vers.31, 32, 33.] and over laid it with gold.
\p
\v 22 . So he over-laid the whole house with gold, until all the house was finished: besides, he over-laid with gold the whole altar, [See above on ver.20.] which was before the Oracles-place.
\p
\v 23 . Now in the Oracles-place he made two Cherubims [See Gen.3.on v.24.] of oily wood: [The Cherubims which Moses caused to be made, were of beaten-gold, Exod.25.18. Now some hold these oily trees not to be olive-trees, but some other trees, that also yield oil, as Cedar-trees, and Pine-trees, etc. for the Olive-trees are sometimes distinguished from the oily-trees, as Neh.8.16.] the height of each was ten ells.
\p
\v 24 . And five ells was the one wing of the Cherub, and five ells the other wing of the Cherub: from the end of his one wing, to the end of his other wing, [Heb. from the ends of his wings to the ends of his wings] were ten ells.
\p
\v 25 . So the other Cherub was ten ells: both Cherubims had one kind of measure, and one kind of cutting. [i.e. shape.]
\p
\v 26 The height of the Cherub was of ten ells, and so of the other Cherub.
\p
\v 27 . And he set these Cherubims in the midst of the innermost house, [i.e. the holy of holies, so the holy place is called the Temple, which was before it, above v.17.] and the Cherubims spread forth the wings, so that the wing of the one touched this wall, and the wing of the other Cherub touched the other wall, and their wings in the midst of the house reached wing to wing. [the meaning is, that the two Cherubims ending the wall, the one the wall that was on the South side; the other, on the North-side; and that they then touched one another with their other wings: so that with the same they reached over the whole breadth of the place: fro as this was twenty ells broad, above ver.20. so was every wing five ells long, above ver.24. and consenquently both the Cherubims stood ten ells distant one from another, and each five ells distant from the wall of his side, making together twenty ells. Compare 2 Chron.3.11, etc.]
\p
\v 28 . And he overlaid these Cherubims with gold.
\p
\v 29 . And carved all the walls of the house round about, with carved engravings of Cherubims, and of Palm-trees, and of open flowers; within and without. [Some understand by this the wall which parted the holy of holies from the holy place, which he adorned not only within, on the side, which was in the most holy place, but also without on the side, which stood in the holy place. Others understand it of the walls in general both of the most holy and holy place.]
\p
\v 30 . He also overlaid the floor of the house with gold within and without. [i.e. in the most holy and in the holy place.]
\p
\v 31 . And at the entering of the Oracles-place he made doors of oily wood; the lintel, (with) the posts was the fifth part (of the wall). [i.e. it was as broad and high, as the fifth part of the wall; to wit, four ells: for the wall of the Oracles-place was twenty ells broad and high. See above v.16. Others interpret this thus, that the lintel and post were five square, or five-cornered.]
\p
\v 32 . The two doors also were of oil-trees, and he carved upon them carvings of Cherubims, and of Palm-trees, and of open flowers, which he overlaid with gold: he also spread gold upon the Cherubims, and upon the Palm-trees. [Hereby the making might ever be discerned from the carved work.]
\p
\v 33 . And he also made at the door of the Temple posts of oily trees: out of the fourth part (of the wall). [For the posts (the door being also counted) were five ells broad, and high, which is the fourth part of twenty. Others understand this of the posts, that they were foursquare, or four-cornered. Compare above the 31 verse with the annotat.]
\p
\v 34 . And the two doors were of fir-wood, [See above chap.5.on v.8.] the two sides of the one door were turning about, so the two carved (sides) of the other door were turning about.
\p
\v 35 . And he carved them with Cherubims, and Palm-trees, and open flowers; which he overlaid with gold; sited to the carved work.
\p
\v 36 . Then he built the innermost Court [Meaning the Court that was next to the Temple, and was called the Priests court, 2 Chron.4.9. because none but they and the Levites might enter into it, and because the Priests offered there upon the Altar of burnt-offering, and observed the worship of God] of three rowes of hewed stones, and a row of Cedar-beams.
\p
\v 37 . In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid in the month Ziu: [See above on ver.1.]
\p
\v 38 . And in the eleventh year the in month Bul, which is the eight month, [This month answereth partly to our October, and partly to our November] was this house finished according to all its parts, [Heb. things, or words, i.e. according to all that was said and ordered concerning it] and according to all its appurtenances; so was he seven years in building it.
\c 7
\s The building of Solomons house, v.1.&c. Of the house of Libanon, 2. Of the porch of pillars, 6. of the porch of judgement, 7. of the house of Phraohs daughter, 8. Of Hiram the skillfull artificer, 13. Of the two copper pillars, 15. The molten sea, 23. The ten copper bases, 27. The ten copper lavers. 38. Briefly, all work-tools, and vessels, copper, and golden, 40. The dedicated things are brought into Temple, 51.
\p
\v 1 But Salomon was fifteen years [Almost as long again as in building the Temple, above v.6.38. The same requiring more haste, both in regard of Gods command, and of his worship, and wherein more workmen were employed, and for which more provision of materials was made] in building his (own) house; [serving him and his Court-household for a dwelling place. See below v.48. and chap.9.10.] and he finished all his house.
\p
\v 2 . He built also the Forest of Libanon [So called (as some conceive) because it was built in a very pleasant and exalted place in Jerusalem, or without the city, and was beatified with many fair and high trees, like the forest of Libanon, serving the King for an house of pleasure, and recreation. Compare below chap.9.19.] an hundred [understand common ells: and see concerning this length, Gen.6.on vers.15.] and fifty ells in the breadth thereof, and thirty ells in the height thereof; upon four rows of Cedar-pillars, [this house being six stories high, and having three dwellings one above another, this is to be understood of the lowermost] and Cedar-beams [which made the floor of the middlemost dwelling] upon the pillars.
\p
\v 3 . And it was covered with Cedar above [Whence arose the third or uppermost flooring] upon the ribs [or, beams, lofts, chambers] which were upon five and fourty pillars, fifteen in a row. [understand the uppermost part of this house, which (because it had a less burden or stress to hear then the lowermost) had only three rowes of pillars, whereas the lowermost had four, above v.2. each row consisting of fifteen pillars.]
\p
\v 4 . There were three rows of lookings out: (so) that the one window was against the other window in three ranks. [As the house was three stories high, so it had likewise three rows of windows, in every story one row, whereof the uppermost stood right against the lowermost.]
\p
\v 5 . Also all the doors and posts were four square of (one manner of) looking out: and window was over against window, in three ranks. [Heb. three times. The meaning is, the windows and gates of both sides, were in each loft raised up just one above another, so that man could extend his sight from the one to the other being over against it. Others interpret it thus, all the doors and posts were four square with the lookings out, etc.]
\p
\v 6 . Then he made a porch [Here three porches are mentioned, whereof this is the first, and was in the forepart of the house of the forest of Libanon. See of the second, v.7. and of the third, v.8.] of Pillars; [i.e. consisting of many pillars, and from the roof resting upon them] fifty ells was the length thereof, [according to the breadth of the house. Compare above v.2.] and thirty ells the breadth thereof: and the porch was over against them, [viz. the doors, of which mention is made in the former verse, or the pillars, or house of the forest. The meaning is, that this porch was before the house of the forest; so that the pillars and beams, of which this porch consisted, were right against the doors, and consequently in the sight of the fore-mentioned house] and the pillars with the thick beams over against the same.
\p
\v 7 . He also made a porch [viz.in Jerusalem, before his house, very convenient for the people, which came for judgement, to be sheltred there against the intemperateness or foulness of the weather] before the throne, where he judged, (to be) a porch of judgement, which was covered with Cedar, from floor to floor. [i.e. from the one end of the floor to the other. Some understand this of the walls, viz. that they were covered with Cedar, from below on the floor, to the ceiling above which is a floor likewise.]
\p
\v 8 . And (at) his house where he dwelt, there was a Court more inward then that porch, which was like unto the same work; [The third porch, which was between the porch of judgement and the Kings house] he made also for Pharaos daughter, whom Salomon had taken (to wife) an house, [distinct from the strong hold of David, where he first dwelt. See above chap.3.1. and 2 Chron.8.11.] like unto that porch. [understand the third porch which was more inward, mentioned immediately before, unto the porch, the Queens house is said to be like, not so much in regard of the form, as of the matter, as appeareth by the following verse.]
\p
\v 9 . All these things [Meaning all the buildings mentioned in this and the former Chapters. Compare below v.12.] were of costly stones, hewed according to measures, [i.e. according to the measures, which skilful masons or stone-cutters follow, to finish a work in the 11.] sawed with the saw within and without; and that from the foundation unto the rests an hand-breadth, [i.e. the rests sticking out, at the uppermost part of the wall, whereon the vault of the roof rested, and stook out an hand-breadth without the wall] and so without unto the great court. [where the people met.]
\p
\v 10 . The foundation was also laid with costly stones, great stones; with stones of ten ells, and stones of eight ells.
\p
\v 11 . And above, [viz. upon the foundation-stones] upon costly stones, hewed after the square, and Cedars. [i.e. planed planks of Cedar-wood, wherewith the hewed stones were covered over.]
\p
\v 12 . And the great court [See above on v.9.] was round about of three rows of hewed stones, with one row of Cedar-beams: So it was with the inner court [see above chap 6.on v.36.] of the LORDS house, and with the porch of that house.
\p
\v 13 . And King Salomon sent forth, and caused Hiram [See above chap.5.on v.1.] to be fetch [Heb. took, or took on. See Gen 12.on vers.15.] out of Tyrus. [see above chap.5.on v.1.]
\p
\v 14 . He was the son of a widow-woman [By the descent of the tribe of Dan, 2 Chron.2.14.] of the tribe of Naphtali, [understand this of the widows son, whose descent by the Father side was of the tribe of Naphtali] and his father had been a man of Tyre, [viz. in respect of the city where he dwelt, and not in respect of his descent, according which he was an Israelite. Oth. this may be also understood, that this Father was likewise Tyrian by pedigree and descent, that is, an heathen, but that his wife was both of Dan and Naphtali; to wit, of one tribe by the Fathers side, and of another by the Mothers side, which might be done by the mixtures of the tribes one with another; for the Israelites did not always follow the rule of Gods law, which forbade them to marry out of their own tribe. See further 2 Chr.2.on v.14.] a worker (in) copper, who was filled with wisdom, and with understanding, and with knowledge, to make all (kind of) work in copper, [see Exod.31.3.] this (man) came unto King Salomon, and made all his work.
\p
\v 15 . For he formed [Or cast] two copper pillars, [See Jer.52.21. 2 Kings 25.16, 17.] the height of the one pillar was eighteen ells, [Counted after the measure of the sanctuary, which were again as long as the common ells: see Gen.6, on v.15. and hence 2 Chron.3.15. there are thirty five ells (after the common measure of ells) ascribed to these pillars, to which one ell more being allowed to the foot, or basis, each pillar was thirty six common ells high, that is, eighteen holy ones, or ells of the Sanctuary] and a filler of twelve ells compass of the other pillar about. [viz. the compass and roundness of its body: understand the same likewise of the first pillar.]
\p
\v 16 . He made also two [viz. For each pillar one] Chapters, [understand hereby the Chapter, an Ornament, made above on the top of the top of the body of a pillar, consisting of three parts, viz. the Foot or Basis, the plaited work of the Pomegranates, and the Crown] of molten copper, to set upon the heads of the pillars: five ells was the height of the one Chapter, and five ells the height of the other Chapter. [Meaning the whole Chapter being measured altogether with all the three parts thereof: for the foot or basis was an ell high, the pomegranate work an ell also, and the crown three ells: so many ells are attributed to the crown alone, 2 King.23.17. and being counted with the pomegranates four ell: see below vers 19.]
\p
\v 17 . The nets were of net-work, [Or, of twisted, or of grated work] the wreaths of chain-work, for the chapters, which were on the head of the Pillars: [The meaning is, that the uppermost part, or the crown of the Chapter consisted of a most artificial twisting together of leaf, flower, and fruit-work, in certain rows fastened with wreaths most curiously one to another: compare 2 Chron.3.16.] seven were for the one Chapter, and seven for the other chapter. [some understand this work of the rows of the leaf-work, and of the strings or wreaths that tied the work close together: Others, of the strings or wreaths alone.]
\p
\v 18 . So he made the pillars; as also two rows [viz. Of pomegranates that compassed the middle part of the knop about] round about upon the one net, to cover the Chapters, [i.e. the crowns, the uppermost part of the Chapters: see above on v.16.] that were upon the head of the pomegranates; he did likewise so to the other Chapter.
\p
\v 19 . And the Chapters, which were upon the head of the pillars, were of Lilie-work [i.e. Had the form, fashion, and resemblance of Lilies] in the porch; [i.e. to be set in the porch] four ells. [understand this of two parts of the Chapter, the uppermost, and middlemost, namely the crown, and the pomegranate work both together: see above on v.16.]
\p
\v 20 . Now the Chapters [The Chapter here signifieth the uppermost part of a whole chapter, called the Crown, which was round like a bowl, either in bulk like a ball, or in oval length] were upon the two pillars, yea upon it over against the belly, [understand the middlemost, or the middle part of the bowl, that which sticketh most out. Others understand by the belly, the hole that was above in the midst of the pillar, into which the Chapter were put, to stand fast] which was by the net, and two hundred pomegranates were in rows round about, (also) upon the other Chapter.
\p
\v 21 . After that he reared up the pillars in the porch of the Temple; and having reared up the right pillar, he called the name thereof Jachin, [i.e. He (viz. the LORD) will establish] and having reared up the left pillar, he called the name thereof Boaz. [i.e. Power is in him. These two names intimated, that spiritual Temple, which is the Church of true Believers, and of the Elect, resting on the almighty power of God, should be able to stand against all outward and inward violence whatsoever, so that the gates of hell should never prevail against it, Matth.16.18.]
\p
\v 22 . And upon the head of the pillar was Lilies-work: [See hereof above ver.19.] so the work of the pillars was finished.
\p
\v 23 . Moreover, he made the molten sea [Called likewise so, 2 Chron.4.2. but 2 King.25.13. a copper-sea. Understand a huge great vessel, or kettle, containing great store of water, and in that regard called a Sea, according to the instance of the Hebrews, who were wont to call the gatherings of many waters together, Seas. This water served for the washings of the Priest and Levites: compare Exod.30. ver.18,19,20. & 40. ver 30,31,32. & Lev.8.on ver.11. 2 King.16,17. 2 Chron,4.6.] it was ten ells from the one brain direct [Heb. lip so in the following verse] thereof, to the other brim thereof [i.e. measured over thwart in a direct thorough, from the one brim to the other] round all about, and five ells in the height thereof, and a measuring-line of thirty ells did compass it round about. [i.e. this which being measured in roundness without was thirty ells wide: for the roundness containeth twice as much room as the direct line doth: compare 2 Chron.4.2.]
\p
\v 24 . And under the brim thereof [viz. At the outside of this molten sea] were knops, [The Hebrew word signifieth properly wild gourds, or the pictures and droughts, or representations thereof, as above chap.6.v.18. & 2 King.4.39. but it seemeth that it signifieth also in general all manner of pictures of leaves, flowers, fruits, and beasts wrought upon, or in any thing for ornament: for 2 Chron.4.3. for further expounding of this place is put the resemblance or picture of Oxen] compassing the same round about, ten in an ell, [the meaning is, that in a cubit, or ell, were ten knops. And it being said in the former verse, that one row of these knops was thirty Ells in compass, it followed, that the number of knops in one row was three hundred; and in two together six hundred] compassing that Sea round about: two rows of these knops were casting of it. [viz. of the sea: for they were not carved or engraven in this copper sea, but cast together with the same: so 2 Chron.4.3.]
\p
\v 25 . It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the North, and three looking toward the West, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the East, and the Sea was above upon them: and all their hinder parts were inward. [i.e. the hinder parts of these Oxen were inward hidden under this copper sea, that they could not easily be seen. So 2 Chron.4.4.]
\p
\v 26 . Now the thickness of it was an hand-breadth, and the brim thereof as the work of the brim of a cup: (or) of a Lilie-flower: it contained two thousand Baths. [Meaning that ordinarily so much water was put into it: but being brim-full, it held three thousand Baths, 2 Chron.4.5. A Bath was a great measure of the Hebrews of liquid or moist Wares, containing as much as an Epha did in dry Wares, Ezk.45.11. an Epha held ten Gomers, Exod.16.36. and Lev.5.on ver.11. a Gomer contained fourty three common Egg-shels: six of these shells contain the measure of a Log: see Levt.14. on verse 10. threescore and twelve Logs make about a Bath.]
\p
\v 27 . He made also ten Copper-bases, [Or, undershoarings, feet, under-proppings, which stood foursquare, or four-cornered, upon which was set a Laver, or Wash-vessel, containing a great quantity of Water, wherein the Offerings were washed; for which end they had also Wheels, by which they were carried from one place to another] four Ells was the length of one be
\p sis, and four Ells the breadth thereof, and three Ells the height thereof.
\p
\v 28 . And this was the work of the bases; they had borders; [Heb. Shuttings in. Understand wide spaces inclosed or shut in between two ledges, wherein Pictures of Beasts and Cherubims were made for ornaments. See the following verses, and below verse 36.] and the borders were between the ledges. [Heb.steps. These were borders sticking out, or bands, or brims made round about each seat, which followed one upon another like steps or stairs, and enclosed the afore-mentioned borders or spaces both above and below. The uppermost were as the roof of the pictures and images, the lowermost as their ground and bottom.]
\p
\v 29 .And upon the borders that were between the ledger, were Lions, Oxen and Cherubims, and upon the ledges (there) was the foot [Meaning an even place or space ,serving for the under –propping of the Laver, rested thereon] above: and between the Lions and Oxen in addition of extend work.[i.e. adjoined ornaments of work twisted thorough and drawn out ,which were at the neck of the laver, an half ell below it :see below verse .35.]
\p
\v 30 .And one base four copper wheels, and copper plates ;[Wherein the axle-trees of the wheels stuck ,for the under –propping of the bases ,that lay thereon]and the four corners of the bad shoulders :[i.e. tenons, or stays, like unto shoulders ,that came above out of the hollowness at the four corners of the base; not made thereon without, but from the thence ifluing, and begin cast there with to hold the laver fast that lay thereon, that it might not wag or glide off from the base, when it was carried or transported from one place to another. Compared below v.34.] under the laver [see hereof below on v.38.] were these molten shoulders at the side of every ones additions.
\p
\v 31 . And the mouth [Understand an equal and like hollowness in the plate, which was above upon the base, and which even filled the laver that was let into it about an half ell deep] of it was within the ledge, [i.e. the circumference of the mouth, or of the hollowness into which the laver was let in] and above it an ell, and the mouth thereof was round of foot-work [comformable unto the work which is made to support or under prop anything, and must every way fit the same. Therefore as the laver was round, so was it likewise requisite that this hollowness of the mouth should be round] an ell and half an ell: [viz. according to the measure of the laver which was let into the seat] and also upon the mouth of it [i.e. upon the plate, or the covering wherein the mouth was, which comprehended the laver] were covenant rings, and the border thereof [i.e. the outer most compass or circumferences, which conclude the uppermost covering of the base] were four square, not round.
\p
\v 32 . Now the four wheels were under the borders, and the axles-trees [Heb. hants] of the wheels at the base: and the height of a wheel was an ell and half an ell.
\p
\v 33 . And the work of those wheels was like the work of a charet wheel: their axles-trees, and their naves, and their strakes, and their spokens were all molten.
\p
\v 34 . And there were four shoulders [Some conceive that these shoulders differed from these mentioned above ver.30. for that those came out of the hollowness into which the laver is let, but these in the outside of the hollowness of the laver supported the middlemost part thereof] upon the four corners of one base: the shoulders thereof were of the base. [i.e. they were not fastened to it without, but one work issuing out of the base: see above on ver.30.]
\p
\v 35 . And upon the head of one base [viz. above the face, and the shoulders thereof] was around height of half an ell round about: also upon the head of the base the handles thereof [Heb. the hands thereof: so in the following verse. Understand the uppermost part of the shoulders, wherewith as with hants the laver was supported: or, understand hereby little pillars, which issued above out of the four corners of the base, have foursquare borders, wherein were curious gravings] and the borders thereof were of the same.
\p
\v 36 . Now he carried upon the plates of the handles thereof, and upon the borders thereof, [See above on ver.31.] Cherubims, lions, and Palm-trees: according to every ones empty place, and additions rounds about.
\p
\v 37 . Like unto he made the ten bases; they had all one kind of casting, one kind of measure, one kind of size.
\p
\v 38 . He made also ten copper lavers: [Standing upon the copper bases, which might be transported from place to place, described in the former verses beginning at the 27. These vessels were filled with water, which the Priests were to use in their ministration. See 2 Chron.4.6. and compare Lev.8. the annotate. on verse 11.] one laver contained fourty Baths, [viz. of water: see of this measure above on verse 26.] one laver was four ells; upon every base, of those ten bales, was one laver.
\p
\v 39 . And he set five of those bases on the right side of the house, [viz. In the Court of Priests, where the Offerings were prepared] and five on the left side of the house; but he set the sea [see above on verse 23.] on the right side of the house Eastward [where the entering of the house was] over against the south.
\p
\v 40 . Moreover, Hirom [Straightway called in this verse Hiram, and elsewhere also Huram: see above on vers.13. the same name the King of Tyre had] made the laver, and the shovels, and the sprinkling basins; and Hiram made an end of doing all the work, that he made King Salomon for the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 41 . (To wit) the two pillars, and bowls of the Chapters [Understand hereby Crowns, which were the uppermost part of the Chapter, of which see above verse 19. and 20.] that were on the head of the two pillars: and the two nets, to cover the bowls of the Chapters, which were on the head of the pillars.
\p
\v 42 And the four hundred Pomegranates [See above verse 20.] for the two nets: (namely) two rows of Pomegranates for one net, to cover the two bowls of the Chapters, that were above upon the pillars.
\p
\v 43 . Also the ten bases, [See of these above ver.27.] and the ten lavers [see above ver.38.] upon the bases.
\p
\v 44 . Moreover, one sea: [see above ver.23.] and the twelve oxen under that sea: [see above verse 25.]
\p
\v 45 . Also the poes [To seeth the flesh in of certain sacrifices, that was eaten by the Priests, and by those that brought the beasts to be offered. Some pots were also to gather the ashes of the sacrifices in, and to carry them forth: see Exod.27 3.] and the shovels; and the sprinkling basins, and all these vessels which Hiram made for King Salomon for the house of the LORD; (all) of polished copper.
\p
\v 46 . In the plain of Jordan did the King cast it in close earth: [i.e. Clayie, and tough ground: so 2 Chron.4.17.] between Succoth, [lying in the tribe of Gad beyond the Jordan: see Gen.33.on ver.17.] and between Zarthan. [see Jos.3.on v.16.]
\p
\v 47 . And Salomon left all these vessels (unweighed) because of the exceeding great multitude: [Heb. For the multitude greatly] the weight of the Copper was not searched.
\p
\v 48 . Salomon likewise made all the vessels, that were for the house of the LORD: the golden altar, [i.e. Overlaid with gold, Exod.30 3. but otherwise made of Cedar-wood, above chap.6.20. which is called Sittim-wood, Exod.30.1.] and the great table, [understand tables in the plural number: for there were ten in Salomons temple, 2 Chron.4 8. They were of gold, viz. being therewith overlaid without, but within they were of wood: compare Exod.25. ver.23, 24.] upon which the shew bread, (loaves) [Heb. bread-(loaves) of faces: so called, not because they had faces, but because they lay before the face of the Lord, that is, before the Holy of Holies. see Exod.25.30.] were.
\p
\v 49 . And the candlesticks of inclosed gold, [See above chap 6.on ver.20. Of such kind of gold were these candlesticks made, being not onely overlaid therewith, be-wholly consisting of it, as Moseh’s candlestick did, to which with its appurtenances, a whole talent of gold went, Exod.25.31, 39.] five on the right hand, and five on the left hand [that is, on the North and South side of the holy place] before the Oracles place; and the flowers and the lamps, and the snuffer [see of these three, Exod 25 v.31,37, and 38.] of gold.
\p
\v 50 . Likewise the cups, and the flesh-hooks, [Or, Forks, or, chopping-knives, [of which there were an hundred in number, 2Chron.4 8.] and the incense cups, [others spoons] and the censers of inclosed gold: [see above chap.6.on ver.20.] beside the hinges, the hinges of the door of the innermost house, of the Holy of Holies, (and) of the doors of the house of the Temple of gold.
\p
\v 51 . So all the work was finished that King Salomon made for the house of the LORD: After that Salomon brought the dedicated things of David his father; [i.e. Which were dedicated unto the Lord by David for an holy use: see 2 Sam.8.7,11. & 2 Chron.5.1.] the silver and the gold, and the vessels did he put among the treasure of the house of the LORD.

\s Salomon assembleth the chieftest of the Israelites, to dedicate the Temple, vers.1,&c. The Ark of the Covenant with the holy instruments are brought into it, 4. The LORD giveth a token of his presence, 10. Salomon Blesseth the Congregation, and giveth God thanks, 14, and 54. He maketh an excellent prayer unto God, 22. He offereth with the congregation, 62. They keep the Feast of leaf-huts, 65.
\p
\v 1 Then Salomon assembled the Eldest of Israel, [See Lev.4. on ver.15.] and all the heads of the tribes, Father among the children of Israel, [each tribe of the Israelites consisted of certain Households or Families, which had each in particular their cheif Fathers. Besides these, there were in every tribe Captains of hundreds, of thousands, &c whose chiefest and most principal are here to be understood. Compare Exod.18.21. Numb.3.24,30,35. 1 Chron.4 38.] unto King Salomon [i.e. unto him, according to the Hebrew phrase. See above chap.2.on ver.19.] at Jerusalem, to bring up [viz. Into the Temple, into which, because it was built upon mount Morija, they were to ascend by steps or stairs] the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD out of the City of David, [viz. Which David had taken, built, and inhabited. See above chap.2.on v.10.] which is Zion. [see 2 Sam.5.9. & 6 12,17.]
\p
\v 2 . And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto King Salomon at the Feast, [Meaning the Feast of dedication, going before the Feast of Leaf-huts. See below ver.65. and of the Feast of Leaf-huts, Levit.23.34. Deut.16 13 2 Chron.5.3.] in the month Ethanaim: [This months agreeth mostly with our September. It is called Ethanaim, i.e. of strong, or of strengths; because (as some conceive) in it the fruits of the Land were gathered in, which are as the strength of the earth, ordained by God to preserve and strengthen the life of man] the same is the seventh month: [viz. according to the account of Ecclesiastical months ordained by God, Exod.12.2. otherwise, before the departure of the Israelites out of Egypt, this month was the first, viz. of the civil year.]
\p
\v 3 . And all the Eldest of Israel came; and the Priests took up the Ark. [Which was at this time at Jerusalem 2 Chron.1.4.]
\p
\v 4 . And they brought up the Ark of the LORD, and the Tent of the Congregation, [which with the Copper Altar made by Bazaleel in the Wilderness, was at this time at Gibeon, 2 Chron.1.3,5.] together with all the holy vessels, [Heb. vessels of holiness; that is, which are ordained for an holy use. See Levit.16.on verse 4.] that were in the Tent, and the Priests, and the Levites brought the same up, [viz. With this difference, that the Priests carried the Ark, and the holy vessels, but the Levites the Tent of the Congregation, with its appurtences. Compare Numb.4. the annotate. on verse 15.]
\p
\v 5 . Now King Salomon, and all the Congregation of Israel that were assembled with him, were with him before the Ark, [viz. With King Salomon. Otherw.(went) with him before the Ark.] offering sheep and oxen, [understand, that the offerings here mentioned, were here and there offered by the way, which the Ark was carried. Compare 2 Sam 6.13.] which could not be numbered nor for multitude.
\p
\v 6 . So the Priests brought the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD unto its place, unto the Oracles place of the house, [i.e. Of the Temple] to the Holy of Holies, even under the wings of The Cherubims. [which Salomon had caused to be made, and were much bigger then those which Moseh had caused to be made in the Wilderness. See above chap.6.v.27. Exod.25.20.]
\p
\v 7 . For the Cherubims spread (forth) both wings over the place of the Ark; and the Cherubims covered the Ark, and the hand-beams thereof [By which the Ark was carried] above.
\p
\v 8 . Then they shoved the hand-beams further out, [Heb. Lengthened them; viz. by drawing them longer and further out: for to take them quite out, was forbidden by God, Exod.25.15. See Numb.4.on v.6.] that the heads [i.e. the ends] of the hand-beams were seen forth of the holy place [i.e. by those that were in that part of the temple which was more outward, called the holy place. 2 Chron.5.8. it is said, that they were seen out of the Ark: which is not so to understood, as if the Ark had been seen: but the meaning is, that the outmost ends of the hand-beams, which came forth out of the Ark, shewed themselves in the holy place, viz. not bare, but covered with the veil] before the Oracle place, but were not seen without: [viz. the holy place] and are there unto this day. [viz. when this book was written.]
\p
\v 9 . There was nothing in the Ark, but onely the two tables of stone, [The Apostles words, whereby he seemeth to say, Heb.9.4. that there were also in Ark the golden pot with manna, and Aarons rod that budded, must thus be understood, that they were in the same place of the Tabernacle, where the Ark stood, yea were by it, Exod.16.34. Numb.17.10. as the word in is often taken for by; as Jos.5.13. & 10.10, &c. yea even here in this verse in horeb, for, by horeb] which Moseh put in it [see Deut.10.5.] by Horeb, when the LORD made (a covenant) [the like phrase, wherein this word is concealed, yet to be understood, we find, 1 Sam.20.16.& 22.8. 2 Chron.5.10.] with the children of Israel, [see Exod.34.27.] when they were come forth out of the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 10 . And it came to pass, when the Priests came forth out of the holy place, [i.e. The fore-part of the Temple, Exod.20.33. & 28.43.] that a cloud filled the house of the LORD:
\p
\v 11 . And the Priests cloud not stand to minister, because of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD [i.e. The Cloud, wherein God appeared to the Israelites. Compare Exod.16.10. & 24.16. & 40.34.35. Numb.16.19. 2 Chron.15.13,14.&7.1,2,3.] had filled the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 12 . Then said Salomon, The Lord said, that he would dwell in darkness. [i.e. He declared, that he would manifest his presence by such a visible token as the Cloud, or the darkness was. See Levit.16.2. which he also oftentimes did. See the annotate. on the former verse; also Exod.13.22. & 14 19 & 19.16. & 20.21. Numb.9.15. Deut.4.11. & 5.22.]
\p
\v 13 . I have surely built [Heb. Building built; that is, I have surely, or certainly, or wholly built, or I have fully built] an house, for a dwelling place for thee; [viz. wherein thou wilt dwell with thy people by thy Word, and by the visible tokens of thy grace: so 2 Chron.6.2.] a settled [ort, prepared] place, for thine everlasting dwelling. [understand this everlastingness of the time of the Law; and see Gen.13.on verse 15. Here is to be added the condition of obedience, which the Israelites did owe unto God, that this Word might continue firm and stedfast. See above chap.6.12,13. and below chap 9.4. Psal 89.29,30,31.]
\p
\v 14 . Then the King turned his face about, and blessed all the Congregation of Israel; [i.e. Wished them from the LORD all happiness both in soul and body. So below verse 55. Compare Numb.6.23. Psal.118 26. Others understand this thus; that the King with all the Congregation blessed God, that is, thanked and praised him: to this end taking in the Word God into the text] and all the Congregation of Israel stood.
\p
\v 15 . And he said, Praised be the LORD the God of Israel, who spake with his mouth, [i.e. By the Prophet Nathan, 2 Sam.7.6. 1 Chron.17.4. The prophets are as it were the mouth of God, because his Word is in their mouth, Exod.4.12. 1 King.17.24. Isa.51.16. Jer.5.14.] unto David my father, and hath fulfilled it with his hand, saying:
\p
\v 16 . From the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of the Land of Egypt, I chose [i.e. I did not manifest nor put in practice my choice. So the word chasing is taken for the execution of the choice, Deut.12.1. 2 Chron.6.5. Zach.2.12. for unto God all his works are known from eternity, Act.15.18.] no city, out of all the cities of Israel, to build an house, that my name might be there: [i.e. that my doctrine might be heard and published, the worship instituted by me might be administered, the people, that is called by my Name, might meet together, and my spirit might likewise powerfully work there. Compare Deut.13 11. below ver.29.& 14.21. 2 Kings 21.4. 2 Chron.6.6. Psal.132.13,14.] but I chose David to be over my people Israel.
\p
\v 17 . It was also in the heart of David my father, [i.e. He purposed. See the like phrase, 1 Sam.10.7. & 14.7. 2 Sam.7.3. 1 King.10.2. 1 Chron.27.2. & 22.7. also compare above chap.5. the annotate. on ver.5.] to build an house for the Name of the LORD the God of Israel. [See 2 Sam.7.2. 1 Chron.17 1. 2 Chron.6.7.]
\p
\v 18 . But the LORD said unto David my father, seeing it was in thine heart to build an house unto my Name; thou didst well, that it was in thine heart.
\p
\v 19 . Nevertheless, thou shalt not build that house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build that house unto my Name.
\p
\v 20 . So the LORD hath stablished his word, which he had spoken: for I am risen in the place of David my Father, and I sit upon the throne of Israel, according as the LORD hath spoken; and I have built an house for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
\p
\v 21 . And I have appointed there a place for the Ark wherein is the Covenant [i.e. The Tables of the Covenant, or of the Testimony; understand the Laws of the Covenant, according to which the Covenant was made, which were written in two Tables of stone. Compare Deut.31.on verse 26.] of the LORD, which he made with our Fathers, when he brought them out of the Land of Egypt.
\p
\v 22 . And Salomon stood [viz. Upon the Copper and exalted Scaffold, which was in the peoples Court, over against the altar of burnt-offering, which he could behold from his seat. See hereof, 2 Chron.6.13. also. 2 King.11.14. and 23.3.] before the altar of the LORD, over against all the Congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven: [In token that he lifted up his heart unto God, upon whom he called, and from whom alone he expected all good things. Of which Ceremony used by the Ancients in prayers, see likewise, Ezra 9.5. & Job 11.13. Psal.44.2. & 63.5. 1 Tim.2.8.]
\p
\v 23 . And he said; LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, nor on earth beneath; keeping Covenants, and bounty with thy servants, that walk before thy face [See Genesis 17.on verse 10.] with all their heart. [see above chap.2.on verse 4.]
\p
\v 24 . Who hast kept with thy servant David my Father, that which thou hadst spoken unto him, for with thy mouth thou hast spoken, and with thine hand fulfilled, [i.e. begun to fulfil] as it is this day.
\p
\v 25 . And now LORD God of Israel; keep unto thy servant David my father, that thou hast spoken to him, saying: No man shall be cut off unto thee before my face, [Otherwise, no man shall be lacking unto thee before my face] to sit upon the throne of Israel: [the meaning is, that there should be ever some in Davids family, to succeed him in the Kingdom: which promised was fully accomplished in Christ, whose Kingdom is without end Luke 1.53.] onely if thy sons keep their way [see above chap.2.v.4.] to walk before my face [see Gen.17.on ver.1.] according as thou hast walked before my face.
\p
\v 26 . Now then, O God of Israel, let thy word (I pray) he verified, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David my father.
\p
\v 27 . But will God indeed dwell on the earth? [He denieth not that God is on the earth, but he implies that he is not there circumscribed or shut up, in regard of his effence, or being; although he manifested himself in the Temple, a visible token of his presence, in respect of his grace] Behold, the heavens, yea the heavens of the heavens [so Psal.148.4. understand the highest or uppermost heaven, which is the most spatious, or, the most capacious heaven, called by Paul the third heaven, 3 Cor.12.2. And see this phrase, Lev. chap.2.vers.3. and in the annotate.] cannot contain thee, how much less this house, that I have builded? [‘Tis as if he had said; although this house be not fit contain thee, who fillest heaven and earth, yet not withstanding let it please thee to dwell therein, and to hear prayers therein. See 2 Chron.2.6. Isa.66.1. Jer.23.24. Act.7.49.]
\p
\v 28 . Yet not withstanding turn thee unto the prayer of thy servant, [i.e. Unto my prayer] and unto his supplication, O LORD my God; to hearken to the cry, and to the prayer which thy servant this day prayeth before thy face.
\p
\v 29 . Let thine eyes be open [Spoken of God after the manner of men; whose eyes are said to be open toward his, when he hath compassion on them, heareth them, and doth them good. Compare below ver.52. & Psal.33.18. & 34.16. Zach.12.4.] toward this house, toward this place, of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: [see above on ver.16. Deut.12.11.] to hearken to the prayer, which thy servant shall pray in this place. [Otherwise, toward this place; viz. turning himself toward this house, and looking on the promises of thy presence; see Dan.6.10.]
\p
\v 30 . Hearken then to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which shall pray [Otherw. which they, etc.] in this place; and thou, hear in the place of thy dwelling, in heaven, yea hear, and forgive.
\p
\v 31 . When any man shall have sinned against his neighbour, and he [viz. The Neighbour against whom the sin is committed] shall have laid upon him an oath of the curse, [Heb. curse, or, execration, imprecation. Understand an oath imposed by the Judge, or was made in weighty and doubtful matters, with cursing of a mans self, if he did swear falsely, and that most solemnly before the altar, to stir up the swearer to more attention, and fear. Compare Exod.22.8. Numb.5.15,16,17,18, etc.] to curse himself; and the oath of the curse shall come before thing altar in this house;
\p
\v 32 . The hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning [See of this word, Deu.25.on verse 1.] the unrighteous, giving his way upon his head, [by punishing his sins with deserved judgements. See the like phrase, 2 Chron.6.23. Ezek.9.10. and compare below ver.39.] and justifying the righteous, [i.e. clearing him, counting him free and innocent, and pronouncing him just or righteous: see of this word Gen.44.on vers.16. & Deut.25.on v.1.] giving him according to his righteousness.
\p
\v 33 . When thy people Israel shall be smitten before the face of the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall turn again unto thee and confess thy Name, [i.e. Ascribe unto themselves the guilt of the punishment, and unto thee the glory of justice: so below verse 35. See Jos. 7.on v.19.] and pray unto thee in this house, and make supplication.
\p
\v 34 . Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again into the land, which thou gavest unto their fathers.
\p
\v 35 . When heaven shall be shut up, [See Deut.11.on v.17. which otherwise is called, making the heaven as iron, or as copper, Lev.26.19. Deut.28.23.] that there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee, and they shall pray in this place, and confess thy Name, and turn again unto thee, when thou shalt have plagued them: [Otherwise, because thou shalt have testified against them; viz. by thy Prophets, or, by the judgement of drought: so 2 Chron.6.26.]
\p
\v 36 . Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when thou shalt have taught them the good way, [Called so likewise, 1 Sam.12.23. Otherwise, the way of the Lord, Psal.27.11. of truth, Psal.119.30. of understanding, Proverbs 9.6. Of holiness, Isa.35.8. Of righteousness, 2 Pet.2.21. Of life, Proverbs 6.23, etc.] wherein they should walk; and give rain upon thy Land, which thou hast given thy people for an inheritance.
\p
\v 37 . When there shall be famine in the Land, when there shall be pestilence, when there shall be blasting, mill-dew, Locusts, Caterpillars, when his Enemy shall besiege him in the Land of his Gates, [i.e. In his own Land and Cities. The word gates, is here taken for Cities. See Genesis 2. on verse 17. Now the Land of his Cities, signifieth the cities of his Land. So 2 Chron.6.28.] (or there) shall be any plague, (or) [this particle is expressed in the original text, 2 Chron.6.28.] any sickness.
\p
\v 38 . What prayer soever, what supplication so ever that shall be made by any man, by all thy people Israel: [i.e. by every one in particular, or by the Congregation of the people in general] when they shall acknowledge every man the plague of his (own) heart, [i.e. which goeth to their very heart, and doth inwardly so afflicted them, that they are forced unto prayer, by confidence in God, with true repentance of heart] and (every man) shall spread forth his hands in this house; [or, towards this house. See below on v.44.]
\p
\v 39 . Then hear thou in heaven, the sure place of thy dwelling, and forgive, and do, and give to every man, according to all his ways, [See Genes.6.on ver.12.] as thou knowest his heart; for thou onely knowest the hearts of all the children of men. [i.e. Of all men. So Numb.23.19. Job 16.21. Psal.8.5. Eccles.3.21.]
\p
\v 40 .That they may fear thee [i.e. Walk in thy ways; as is explained, 2 Chron.6.31. for the fear of the Lord exciteth a man to cease from evil, and to do good, Prov.1.7. and 8.13. and 10.6.] all the days, that they shall live in the land, which thou gavest unto our fathers.
\p
\v 41 . Yea also concerning the stranger, [Understand those that should be converted from their Idolatry to the true God] that shall not be of thy people Israel; but shall come out of (a) far land for thy Names sake: [i.e. for the glory and praise which thou hast, as well in regard of the Creation, Suftentation, and Government of all things in general, as in regard of the providing, keeping, and delivering of thy Church in particular. See the following verse, and 2 Chron.6.32.]
\p
\v 42 . (For they shall hear of thy great Name, and of thy strong hand, [i.e. Power, might; so Deut.3.24. Psalm 136.12. See Numb.11. on ver.23.] and of thy stretched out arm) [so Psal.136.12. Jer.32.17.] when he shall come, and pray in his house.
\p
\v 43 . Hear thou in heaven the sure place of thy dwelling, and do according to all that stranger shall call unto thee for: that all the Nations of the earth may know thy Name, to fear thee, as (do) thy people Israel, and to know that thy Name is called upon this house, [which hath its name of thee. Compare above the annotat.on v.16.] which I have built.
\p
\v 44 . When thy people shall go forth to war against their enemy, [i.e. In a just and lawful war, which shall be commanded by thee] by the way which thou shalt send them; and shall pray unto the LORD toward the way of this City, which thou hast chosen; and toward this house, which I have built for thy Name: [i.e. turning themselves in prayer toward this place, in token that they acknowledged that God to be the onely true God, and called upon him, who was worshipped in the Temple at Jerusalem according to his Word. So below verse 48. And see hereof an example in Daniel, Chap.6. verse 10.]
\p
\v 45 . Then hear in heaven their prayer, and their supplication; and execute their right. [Or, Maintain their right. Heb. do their judgement, or, right. Now God doth executed his peoples judgement or right, when as a Judge he maintaineth and defendeth their cause, and deservedly punishment their enemies. So below v.40. Item, 2 Chron.6.35,39. Psal.9.5. & 140.13.]
\p
\v 46 . When they shall have sinned against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not) [See 2 Chron.6.36. Prov.20.9. Eccles.7.20. 1 Joh.1.8,10.] and thou shalt be incensed against them, and shalt deliver them before the face of the enemy, that they that have taken them; carry them away captive into the enemies Land, which is far, or near.
\p
\v 47 . And they shall bring again to their heart, in the Land, whither they were carried away captive, that they repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them, that carried them away captive, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have dealt wickedly:
\p
\v 48 . And they return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul [See 1 Kings 2.on v.4. i.e. out of a true sense and feeling of their sins, and sorrow for them, have an unfeigned purpose, with stedfast faith and confidence in thy mercy, to cease from evil, and to do good: so 2 Chron.6.37.] in the land of their enemies, that carried them away captive: and shall pray unto thee toward the way of their land, (which thou gavest unto their Fathers) toward this City which thou hast chosen, and toward this house [see above on v.44.] which I have built for thy Name;
\p
\v 49 . Then hear in heaven, the sure place of thy dwelling, their prayer, and their supplication, and execute their right; [Hebr. Do their judgement; as verse 45.]
\p
\v 50 . And forgive thy people, that they have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions, wherewith they shall have transgressed against thee: and give them mercy before the face of those that detain them captive, that they may have compassion on them, [Heb. Put them, or, give them to mercies, etc. i.e. to have compassion shewed them, or, to obtain compassion. See almost the like phrase, Genes.43.14. The meaning is, that God would give the captive Israelites, to find grace and compassion in the eyes of their enemies, in stead of cruel misusages, and oppression. See some fulfilling hereof, Nehem.2.2, &c. Esth.10.2,3. Dan.1.9,10, &c.]
\p
\v 51 . For they are thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the iron furnace: [The Hebrew word signifieth properly a place, or a vessel, in which all kind of metal by the fire: whereunto Egypt is compared, because they endured there many oppressions, and grievous trials: see Deuteronomy 4. on verse 20. and compare Isa.48.10.]
\p
\v 52 . That thine eyes may be open, unto the supplication of thy servants, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel: [See above on ver.29.] to hearken unto them, in all their calling unto thee.
\p
\v 53 . For thou didst separate them from all the Nations of the earth, (to be) an inheritance unto thee; according as thou spakest by the Ministry [Heb. Hand] of Moseh thy servant, when thou broughtest forth our Fathers out of Egypt, Lord. [see Exod.19.5. Duet.4.20. & 7.6. & 9.26,29. & 14 2.]
\p
\v 54 . Now it came to pass, when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer, and this supplication unto the LORD, (that) he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees, [The Saints used that Ceremony of bowing the knee in prayer, in token of humility of heart, wherewith we are to appear before God: see 2 Chron.6.13. Daniel 6.10. Luke 22. 41.] with his hands spread forth toward heaven: [see v.22.]
\p
\v 55 . Then he stood, and blessed all the Congregation of Israel, [See above on v.14.] saying with a loud [Heb. great] voice.
\p
\v 56 . Praised be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people of Israel, according to all that spake: there is not one word fallen (to the ground), of all his good words, [Heb. of all his good word] which he spake by theMinistert [Heb. hand. See Exod.4.on v.13.] of Moseh his servant. [The meaning is, he hath fulfilled all his promises, and broken not one of them: so likewise Jos.21.45. & 23.14. 2 King.10.10.]
\p
\v 57 . The LORD our God be with us, [See Gen.21.on vers.22. & 26. on ver.24.] according as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:
\p
\v 58 . Inclining our heart unto him; to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandements, and his statutes, and his judgements, [See the difference of these three words above, chap..on vers.3.] which he commanded our fathers.
\p
\v 59 . And that these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, may be nigh before the LORD our God, day and night: that he may execute the right of his servant, [He understandeth hereby himself, as above ver.28,29,30,32.] and the right of thy people Israel, every man daily on his day. [Heb. the word, or, the thing of the day on his day: i.e. every day, according as daily any need shall happen. The like phrase is found, Exod.5.13. Lev.23.37.]
\p
\v 60 . That all the Nations of the earth may know, that the LORD is that God; (and that there is) none else. [see Deut.4.35,39.]
\p
\v 61 . And let your heart be perfect [Understand the perfection of this life, consisting in all the parts of godliness, and not in the full increase thereof, which is the perfection of the life to come: so below chap.11.4. and 15.3,4. 2 Kings 20.3. 1 Chron.28.9. & 29.9, 19. 2 Chron.15.17. & 19.9. Compare Philip 3.12,15.] with the LORD our God: to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandements, as at this day. [Understand henceforth for ever, as ye do this day.]
\p
\v 62 . And the King and all Israel with him offered slay offerings before the face of the LORD. [Before the Temple; see Lev. on v.3.]
\p
\v 63 . And Salomon offered a thank-offering, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand Oxen, and an hundred and thousand sheep. [See 2 Chron.7.5, &c.] Thus they dedicated the house of the LORD, the King, and all the children of Israel.
\p
\v 64 . The same day did the King hallow [See Lev.8.on v.10.] the middlemost (part) of the Court, [understand this of the Priests Court, whose middlemost part he, being led by the spirit of God, used in that extra-ordained work, to offer sacrifices there, and for that end to rear altars, because the altar of burnt-offering was not able to bear all the offerings, by reason of their multitude] which was before the house of the LORD, [i.e. close before the forepart of the Temple, called the holy place,] because he had prepared there the burnt-offering, and the meat-offering, together with the fat of the thank-offerings: for the copper altar, which was before the face of the LORD, [see ab on v.62.] was too little to contain the burnt-offerings, and the meat-offerings, and the fat of the thank-offerings. [see 2 Chron.7.7.]
\p
\v 65 . At that time also Solomon held the feast, [Understand the Feast of Leaf-huts which was to be kept seven days. See hereof, Lev.23.34.] and all Israel with him, a great Congregation, from the entering in of Hamath [see hereof Numb.13.22. This was the uttermost border of Canaan toward the North] to the river of Egypt [called Sichor, Jos.13.3. and was the uttermost border toward the south: see Gen.15.on v.18.] before the face of the LORD our God seven days, and seven days: [understand seven days toward the dedication of the altar and temple, and seven days more toward the keeping of the Feast of Leaf-huts, 2 Chron.7.9.] being fourteen days.
\p
\v 66 . On the eighth day he let people go, [Understand that he gave the people leave to go home on the eighth day, which was the 22. of the seventh month; but in regard that day was likewise to be kept holy, therefore they departed the day following, which was the 24. See 2 Chron.7.10. and the annotate.] and they blessed the King: after that they went to their tents, joyful, and full of courage, [Heb. good of heart] for all the good that the LORD had done for David his servant, [i.e. for the house of David, and his posterity in the Kingdom] and Israel his people.
\c 9
\s God appeareth to Salomon the second time, ver.1, &c. Salomon giveth certain Cities unto King Hiram for his good service, 10. A relation of the buildings and strong holds built by Salomon, 15. Of the distinction or difference of his subjects, 20. Of his yearly offerings, 25. Of his Navie that went to Ophir, for gold, 26.
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass, when Salomon had made an end of building the house of the LORD, and the house of the King: [See 2 Chron.7.11.] and all the desire of Salomon, [i.e. all his desire] which he had a mind to make, [i.e. all that came into Salomons heart to make, as is explained 2 Chron.7.11.]
\p
\v 2 . That the LORD appeareth to Salomon the second time, [viz. After the building, and dedication of the Temple, but not after the building of the Kings house, which was finished thirteen years after the Temple was built. Some conceive that this appearance happened after that both houses were finished] according as he had appeared unto him in Gibeon. [see above chap.3.5.]
\p
\v 3 . And the LORD said unto him; I have heard thy prayer, and thy supplication, which thou hast made supplicating before my face; I have hallowed that house; [i.e. separated it to any holy use: so Gen.2.on v.3.] which thou hast built, to set my Name there, [see above Chap.8.on ver.13.] and mine eyes, and mine heart shall be there [understand by the eyes of the LORD, his providence in keeping and preserving the Temple, and in protecting, and maintaining the Worship of God, which was to be performed there, understanding withal, according to the condition that is here annexed. And understand by his heart, his mercy, and love toward those that should serve him upright in this house] at all days.
\p
\v 4 . And if thou shalt walk before my face, [See Gen.17.on ver.1. and above chap.8.23.] according as David thy Father walked with perfectness [i.e. unfeignedness, truth, simplicity; see Gen.6.on v.9.] of heart, and with uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, (and) shalt keep my statutes, and my judgements.
\p
\v 5 . Then I will establish the throne of thy Kingdom over Israel for ever: according as I spake concerning David thy father, [See 2 Sam.7.12,16. above chap.6.12. 1 Chron.2.10. Psal.132.12.] saying; (There) shall not a man be cut off unto thee from the throne of Israel. [see above chap.2.on v.4.]
\p
\v 6 . But if ye shall wholly turn away, [Heb. Turning away, shall turn away] ye, and your children, from (following) after me, [Heb. from after me, namely, coming, or following, that is, from hearing, believing, fearing, and serving me according to my Word. So 1 Sam.12.20. 2 King.18.6. Compare 2 Sam.2.21.] and shall not keep my Commandements, (and) my statutes, which I have given before your face: but shall go and serve other gods, and bow your selves down before them:
\p
\v 7 . Then will I destroy Israel out of the Land which I have given them, and this house, which I have hallowed unto my Name, [See Jerem.7.15.] will I cast away from my face: [i.e. out of my sight, and out of mine heart: see above on v.3.] and Israel shall be a Proverb, and a By-word among all Nations. [see Deuteromony 28.37.]
\p
\v 8 . And concerning this house, (which) [This word here inserted out of 2 Chron.7.21.] shall have been exalted, [namely by the declaration of my word and works] whosoever shall pas by it, shall be astonished, and whistle: [as at those, whom they scorn and deride. See also such kind of phrase, Jerem.19.8. & 49.17. & 50. 13. Sometimes unto this word is also added the nodding of the head, the clapping, and moving of the hands, which are all outward tokens and gestures of scornful division. See Lament.2 15. Zephan.2.15.] they shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this Land, and to this house? [see Deuteronomy 20.24. Jerem.22.8.]
\p
\v 9 . And they shall say, Because they forsook the LORD their God, [viz. By a faithless wretchedness, at which the very Heathens themselves did blush, that would not part with their seigned Gods, Jerem.2.10,11.] who had brought forth their Fathers out of the Land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other Gods, and bowed themselves down before them, and served them: therefore the LORD hath brought upon them all this evil.
\p
\v 10 . And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, in which Salomon had built those two houses; the houses of the LORD and the Kings house; [viz. the house of the Lord in seven years, above chap.6. v.38. and the other houses in thirteen years, above chap.7.v.1.]
\p
\v 11 . (Whereunto) Hiram the King of Tyre, had furnished Salomon with Cedar-trees, and with Fir-trees, and with gold, according to all his desire) that then King Solomon gave unto Hiram twenty cities [Which lay in the North-border of the Land of Canaan, about the Syrians and Sidonians, and bordering upon the tribe of Aser, but (as some conceive) not belonging unto that tribe: because otherwise Salomon might not have given them away. Others are of opinion, that he gave him only the use, and not the propriety thereof] in the land of Galilee. [which bordered West-ward upon the Country of Tyre. For Galilee is a land, Having East-ward the Jordan, South-ward the land of Samaria, North-ward the land of Libanon, West-ward Phaenicia, wherein Tyre lay. Galilee is divided into the upper and lower Galilee. Of the upper Galilee sirnamed the Galilee of the Gentiles is here spoken, ands Mat.4.15.]
\p
\v 12 . And Hiram came out from Tyre, to see the cities, which Salomon had given him; but they were not right in his eyes. [i.e. they pleased him not. So judg.14.3.1. 1 Chron.13.4. for which cause Hiram gave them to King Solomon again, as may be gathered out of 2 Chron.8.2. for there the word give must be taken for giving again.]
\p
\v 13 . Therefore he said; What Cities are those, my brother, which thou hast given me? and he called them the Land of Cabal, [viz. Because it misliked him, for this word signifieth so in Phaenicia (unto which Tyrus belonged) as some hold. Others interpret this word, mirie, sandy, or, Moorish] unto this day.
\p
\v 14 . And Hiram had sent the King an hundred and twenty talents of gold. [Understand this of common talents, and see the value hereof, Exod.25.on v.39.]
\p
\v 15 . Now this is the cause of the Leavie, [See hereof above chap.5.on v.13.] which King Salomon raised to build the house of the LORD, [the meaning is, for asmuch as Salomon had such a stock of money, and other furniture for the building of the Temple, he caused a certain Leavy of men, that were to be employed in this work, to further the same with all speed and diligence, until it should be finished] and his (own) house, and mills, [it’s thought that this was some great Fort or Bulwark, about the Kings Palace, where the people at their first entering in were received; serving for a place of retreat, or Watch house for the Kings Guard. See hereof, 2 Sam.5 9. & 1 King.11.27.] and the Wall of Jerusalem; as also Hazor, [a city lying in the tribe of Naphtali, at the Jordan: see Jos.11.10. & 19.36.] and Megiddo, [lying in the tribe of Manasseh, on the side of the Jordan. See Jos.12.17. & 17.15. Judg.1.27.] and Gezer. [lying in the tribe of Ephraim: see Jos.10.33.]
\p
\v 16 . For Pharao the King of Egypt was come up, and had taken Gezer, and burnt the same with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and had given it for a Present unto his daughter, Salomons wife.
\p
\v 17 . So Salomon built Gezer, and the nether Beth-Horon: [Lying in the tribe of Benjamin. Add hereunto out of 2 Chron.8.17. the upper Beth-Horon, lying in the tribe of Ephraim.Jos.21.22.]
\p
\v 18 . And Baalath [Lying in the tribe of Dan, Jos.19.44.] and Tamor, [or. Tadmor] in the wilderness, in that Land: [i.e. in the Land of Israel. Some hold this place to be a city lying in the Wilderness of Juda, not far from Engedi: Others to be the city of Palmyra, lying in the Wilderness of Syria.]
\p
\v 19 . And all the cities of store, [In which all manner of stone, provision, and furniture for war, and likewise of victual, was stored and laid up: otherwise called Magazines, or, houses of ammunition and provision. Compare Exod.11.] which Salomon had, and the charet-cities, [where the arms that were used in war were kept] and the cities of the horsemen; and what the desire of Salomon desired to build, in Jerusalem, and in Libanon, [see above chap.7.on ver.2. &2 Chron.8.6.] and in all the Land of his Dominion.
\p
\v 20 . Concerning all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hethites, Perezites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 21 . Their Children that were left after them in the Land, which the children of Israel were not able to ban: [See Deut.2.on ver.34.] those Salomon brought to a slavish Leavie [i.e. he taxed them as his own slaves, or bond-men. They dwelt among the Israelites, and were called the slaves, or, servants of Salomon, Ezra 2.55. Nehem.7.57. because Salomon had made the Ordinance or Law concerning these slaves. The bond-men were firm to embrace the true Religion first, otherwise Salomon might not have shewed them this kindness, Deut.7.2. Of the word Leavie, see also above chap.5.3.] unto this day.
\p
\v 22 . But of the children of Israel did Salomon make no bond-men: [See Levit.25. ver.39.] but they were men of war, and his Servants, and his Princes, and his Captains, and Rulers of his charets, and of his Horsemen.
\p
\v 23 . These were the chief of the appointed that were over Salomons work, five hundred and fifty: [2 Chron.8.10. there are mentioned two hundred and fifty; but know, that these were in all five hundred, as is mentioned here, but taking the charge of overseeing by turns upon them, they were every time two hundred and fifty] which bare rule over people that were busied in the work. [i.e. which by turns executed the office of ten men, to excite and pull on the rest to the work. See 1 King.5.16. and the annotat.]
\p
\v 24 . But Pharaohs daughter came up from the city of David [See above chap.8.on v.1.] unto her house, which he [viz. Salomon] had built for her: then he built Millo. [see above on v.15.]
\p
\v 25 . And Salomon offered thrice in a year [viz. At the Passover, Pentecost, and Feast of Leaf-huts, 2 Chron.8.13.] burnt –offerings, and thank-offerings, upon the altar which he had built unto the LORD, and burnt incense upon that, which was before the face of the LORD: [i.e. in the sanctuary, or holy place, just before the most holy place, in which the Ark was, a token of Gods presence] when he had finished the house.
\p
\v 26 . King Salomon made also ships at Ezion-Gebers, [This was the 32. camping-place of the Israelites, Numb.3.35. It was a city with a haven or port lying on the Reed-Sea, or Red-sea] which is by Eloth [otherwise called Elath, 2 King.14.22. a city lying in the land of Edom, on the shore of the Reed-sea. See Deut.2 7. This city Azan, called otherwise Uzzia, the King of Juda took, and restored or brought it again to Juda, and re-edified or built it again, 2 King.1.22. but under the reign of Achaz the King of Juda, Rezin the King of Syria took it again from the Jews, 2 King.16.6.] on the shore of the Reed-sea in the Land of Edom.
\p
\v 27 . And Hiram sent with those ships his servants, ship men, [Heb. men of ships; i.e. that lived by Navigation] knowing the Sea, with the servants of Salomon.
\p
\v 28 . And they came to ophir [This is held to be an Island in the East-Indies, and is called by Josephus, Lib.8. Antiquit. chap.2. Aurea Chersonesus, which we now call Malacca. Some will have this to be Peru in the West-Indies] and fetch from thence of the gold four hundred and twenty talents: [Compare this with 2 Chron.8.18. with the annotate.] and brought it to King Salomon.
\c 10
\s The Queen of Scheba cometh to Jerusalem, vers.1, &c. She admireth Salomons wisdom and glory, 3. Giveth God thanks, 9. Giveth Salomon Presents, 10. Salomons riches, 11. Targets, and shields, 16. Ivorie Throne, 18. Vessels, 21. Presents which he receiveth, 24. Charets and horses, 26. Silver, Cedar-wood, and tributes or Customes of Horses and Wares, 27.
\p
\v 1 And when the Queen of Scheba [A country lying southward of Canaan, Matth.12.42. and Luke 11.31. having its name from Scheba, the son of Cus.See Gen10.on ver.7.] heard (of) the fame of Salomon, concerning the Name of the LORD; [or, for, of the Name, etc. Hereby is shewed the cause of Salomons great renown, which was not onely his transcendent wisdom, whereby he surpassed all men, above chap.4. vers.30,31. but especially the wonderful manner, forasmuch as he had even the same of the LORD very speedily by an infused gift illumination, without his own labour, and human instruction] she came to prove him with riddles. [Enigmatibus. The Hebrew word signifieth dark sayings, wherein somewhat is asked and propounded, which hath a secret and hidden meaning. So Numb.12.8. Judg.14.12. & Matth.13.35. out of Psal.78.2. it is translated hidden things.]
\p
\v 2 . And she came to Jerusalem, [See Matth.12.42; [i.e. with a very great Retinue and state Train: see Gen.50.on vers.9.] with camels, bearing spices, and very much gold, and precious stones; and she came to Salomon and spake to him all that was in her heart. [i.e. all that she had purposed in her heart to common with him of: see above chap.8.on v.17.]
\p
\v 3 . And Salomon explained to her all her words: [i.e. The dark Questions, and deep Ripples, which she propounded to the King] there was nothing hid from the King, which he explained not to her. [i.e. There was nothing so dark, acute, or subtile, where in his wisdom should have come too short to have explained it.]
\p
\v 4 . Now when the Queen of Scheba saw all the wisdom of Salomon, and the house, which he had built.
\p
\v 5 . And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the standing of his ministers, [Understand the well-disposed, and glorious order; according to which his Princes and Counsellours sat at the Table, and the Courtiers stood to wait at the Table. Others understand this of the Kings sitting in counsel, or, Judgement] and their apparel, and his cup-bearers, and his ascent, by which he went up into the house of the LORD: [understand this of the curious Galleries, by which the King went up from his own house into the house of the Lord, or also of the stately train, that accomplained hymn therein. Others interpret this thus: And his offering which he offered in the house of the Lord] then there was no more spirit in her. [viz. by reason of the astonishment, which the exceeding great admiration wrought in her.]
\p
\v 6 . And she said unto the King; The word was truth which I heard in my Land, of thy matters, [Heb. words] and of thy wisdom.
\p
\v 7 . And I believed not those words, until I came, and mine eyes have seen (that); and behold the half was not told me, thou hast in wisdom, and good, excellent the fame which I heard. [Heb. thou hast added wisdom and good to the fame which I heard. Understand by wisdom the gift of understanding, wherewith the King was adorned, and by good, his vertues and excellent works, whereby he benefitted his subjects.]
\p
\v 8 . Happy are thy men, [viz. that dwell with thee] happy these thy servants, that stand continually before thy face, [i.e. that do ordinarily minister unto thee. See Deu.1.on v.38.] which hear thy wisdom.
\p
\v 9 . Praised be the LORD thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loveth Israel forever, therefore he made the King to do judgement and justice. [This phrase being ascribed to Magistrates, signifieth as much as in judgement to condemn and punish the wicked, and to absolve and defend the good; or to take notice of occident matters, and to judge aright, and then to execute that which is just and right, by punishing the wicked, and protecting the good, 2 Sam.8.15.]
\p
\v 10 . And she gave the King an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: There came never spices in greater abundance then these, which the Queen of Scheba gave to King Solomon.
\p
\v 11 . Moreover, the ships also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought from Ophir very much Almug-wood, [What kind of wood the Hebrew word signifieth, is uncertain, 2 Chron.2.8. and 9.10. it is called Algum-wood. Some think that it was Thyne-wood, of which mention is made, Rev.18.12. Others take it to be Brasil-wood. So much we may conceive of it, that it was a very costly and precious wood, and such, as at that time was unknown in that land. See the following verse and 2 Chron.9.11.] and precious stones.
\p
\v 12 . And the King made of this Almug-wood, stays [Understand herewith all bars, under-setters, or hand leanings at the galleries, by which they went from the Kings house into the Temple. Compare above vers.5. 1 Chron.26.16, & 18 1 Chron.9.11.] for the house of the LORD, and for the Kings house, as also harpes and lutes for the fingers: the Almug-wood came not, nor was seen [viz. in the land of Juda before this time. 2 Chron.9.11.] so, [viz. so costly, or in such abundance] unto this day.
\p
\v 13 . And king Solomon gave unto the Queen of Scheba all her desire, what she desired; besides that which he gave her, according to King Solomons [i.e. his. Compare above chap.8.1. and 9.1.] ability: [Heb. according to King Salomons hand, i.e. of his own accord, according to his royal ability and munificence] so she turned and went to her (own) land, she, and her servants.
\p
\v 14 . Now the weight of the gold that came in to Salomon in one year, [i.e. every year. See Numb.8.on v.13.] was six hundred threescore and six talents of Gold. [see of the value of a talent of gold. Exod.25.on vers. 39.]
\p
\v 15 . Besides that which was of the Chap-men, [Heb. of the men that spie-out, search, ransack every corner. Understand such as are sent forth-by great Merchants into divers countries, to sell their wares and commodities at the dearest rates, and to buy other commodities for them at the lowest prices, and to send and convey them over to their masters. Others understand this of the farmers of custom, or Toll, or, Tribute-gathers, which were wont to look very narrowly, to entrap the merchants, if they should hide or conceal any of their wares, without paying toll or custom for the same] and of the traffick of the spice-Merchants: [or dragsters] and of all the Kings of Arabia, [as well East-ward as South-ward] and of the mighty men of the same land. [understand those that were near at hand.]
\p
\v 16 . King Salomon also made two hundred targets of beaten gold: he caused six hundred (shekels) of gold [understand common shekels, of whose value, see Gen.24. on v.24.] to be weighed [Heb. to ascend, or go up] for every target.
\p
\v 17 . Likewise three hundred shekels of beaten gold: he caused three pound of gold [Heb. Manin, etc. One mina or pound made ordinarily an hundred common shekels: and consequently every shield was worth three hundred shekels of gold. See 2.Chron.9.16.] to be weighed for every shield: and the King laid them in the house of the forest of Libanon, [see hereof above chap.7.on vers.2.]
\p
\v 18 . Moreover, the King made a great Throne of Ivory; [Heb. a throne of the tooth; viz. of Elephants, whereof the Ivory cometh, of which divers things are made for ornament, as appeareth here, and below chap.22.39. Psa.45.9. Amos 3.15. and 6.4.] and he overlaid the same with gold. [i.e. which was well purified and refined: and therefore also very close and solid.]
\p
\v 19 . This throne had six steps, and the head of the Throne was round behind [i.e. like a bow, or of the shape and fashion of a bow] and on both sides [Hebr.bence, and thence, or to, and fro. So in the following verse] were stays [Heb. hands] unto the seat, and two lions stood by those stays.
\p
\v 20 . And twelve lions stood there on the six steps on both sides: the like hath not been made in any Kingdoms:
\p
\v 21 . Also all King Solomons drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Libanon were of. close gold: [see above chap.8.on v.20.] (there) was no silver on them: (for) it [viz. Silver] was nothing accounted of in the days of Salomon. [an hyperbole, or excessive manner of speaking. Compare below v.27. and annotate. Thereon.]
\p
\v 22 . For the King had at Sea ships of Tarsis. [Some understand by this word the great sea, called the Ocean, and by the ships of Tarsis, the ships that failed in that sea, Others take Tarsis to be Cilicia, whose metropolis or chief city called Tarsus, had a very well known port or haven, in which they found opportunity to sail into Africa, Juda, and other remote countrys. Compare Gen.10.on v.4. Others conceive Tarsis to be Africa, and by the ships of Tarsis to be understood a sleet or navy, sitted and prepared for to sail unto the African sea] with the ships of Hiram: these ships of Tharsis came home once in three years, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, [or munkies] and peacocks. [or parrats.]
\p
\v 23 . So King Solomon waxed greater than all the Kings of the Earth, in riches, and in wisdom. [See chap.3.13.]
\p
\v 24 . And all the Earth [Understand not all the men of the whole world, but the chiefest, as the Kings, Princes, Lords, etc. of all the countrys round about. See 2 Chron.9.23.] sought the face of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
\p
\v 25 . And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of Gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, every thing from year to year, [Heb. the thing of the year in the year, i.e. every present yearly.]
\p
\v 26 . Besides, Salomon gathered together charets, and horsemen, and he had a thousand and four hundred charets, and twelve thousand horsemen: [see above chap.24.6. and 2 Chron.1.14. and 9.25.] and bestowed them in the charet-cities, and with the King [i.e. with him. Compare v.16.] in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 27 . And the King made [Heb.gave] silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, [An hyperbole, or excessive manner of speaking, intimating exceeding great abundance. See Gen.13.on v.13. and above v.21. so 2 Chron.9 27.] and he made the Cedar-trees to be as the wild fig-trees, [or, as the sycamore-trees, i.e. fig-mulbeery-trees] in multitude.
\p
\v 28 . The bringing forth of Horses, was that which Salomon had out of Egypt; and concerning the Linen yarn, [See Gen.41.on v.42.] the Kings Merchants [understand the Publicans or Farmer of the customs, and tolls, or tributes] took the linen yarn [as also the horses] at the price [i.e. at a certain set price. Egypt abounded with exceeding goodly horses, fine flax, and linen called Byssus: which were exceedingly well vented in the neighbouring countries, but were not suffered to be transported without paying the set tribute or custom. Now Pharao made over unto Salomon, that had married his daughter, the right and interest of the tribute or custom, who by his Merchants or Farmers gathered the same, and received great profit or revenue thereof.]
\p
\v 29 . And a charet came up, and went out of Egypt, for six hundred (shekels) [See of the value of the shekel, Gen.20.on v.16. and 23.on v.15.] of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: [understand this of a charet, or wagon loaden with linen yarn, and also of horses that were loaden, yea of the horses themselves. Now a charet or wagon paid four times as much custom as a horse did, because they were wont to fasten four horses to acharet or wagon. The custom or tribute of a loaden charet or wagon, being six hundred shekels, the tribute or custom of a loaden horse was an hundred and fifty shekels] and so for all the Kings of the Hethites, [dwelling East-ward from Palestina] and for the Kings of Syria [north-ward of Palestina] did they bring them out by their hand. [viz. by the hand of the Merchants & Farmers mentioned in the former verse. The meaning of the words is this; that Salomon laid not only a tax or custom upon the wares and commodities, when they came into his land, but also when they were carried unto the Lands of the Hethites and Syrians, of whom Salomon also received custom or tribute by this means, because the horses and wares were to pass thorow his country or jurisdiction. Others understand this thus, that the Kings of the Hethites and Syrians did likewise take custom or toll of the wares, or commodities brought into their lands.]
\c 11
\s Salomons wives and concubines, ver.1. &c. which seduce him to Idolatry, 4. whereat God is angry and threateneth him, 9. Salomons adversaries are, Hadal an Edomite, fled into Egypt, 14. Reson, who reigned in Damascus, 23. and Jeroboam the Ephratite, 26. to whom the Prophet Ahia foretelleth that he should have the Kingdom of Israel, 29. Salomon seeketh Jeroboams life and dieth, 40.
\p
\v 1 And King Salomon loved many strange [Or, out landish] women, [viz. according to the opinion of some, after that he had reigned five or six and twenty years. These years are counted thus: three years before the building of the Temple; seven years bestowed in the building thereof; thirteen years in the building of his own house, and other fabrics; lastly, two or three years more, wherein the Queen of Scheba visited him] and that besides [so is the Hebrew word taken below v.25. and 2 Chron.11.18.] the daughter of Pharao: Moabitish, Ammonitish, Edomitish, Zidonitish, Hethitish:
\p
\v 2 . Of those Nations, concerning which the LORD had said unto the children of Israel; ye shall not go in to them, [i.e. unite your selves with them by marriages. See Gen.6.on v.4.] neither shall they come in unto you, they will surely inclined your heart after their Gods: [see Exod.34.16. and Deut.7.3,4.] Salomon clave unto these with love.
\p
\v 3 . And he had seven hundred wives, Princesses, and three hundred concubines; [Which were of meaner or lower condition then the wives, and held in less esteem. See Gen.22.on v.24.] and his wives inclined his heart. [viz. to depart from the true God, and to cleave unto Idols, as the Following words declare.]
\p
\v 4 . For it came to pass in the time of Solomons old age, (that) his wives inclined his heart unto other Gods: that his heart was not perfect [see above chap.8.on v.61.] with the LORD hos God, as (was) the heart of David his Father.
\p
\v 5 . For Salomon walked after Astoreth the God of the Zidonians, [Astoreth is the name of an Idol, whether male, or female, of the Zidonians. See further thereof, judg.2.13.] and after Milcon [an Idol called also Molech, below v.7. See of this Idol, Lev.18.on v.21.] the abomination [i.e. which is very loathsome and abominable in the sight of God, and to be abhorred of all godly and truly religious persons. So below v.7.] of the Ammonites. [to go or walk after Idols, is to cleave unto them, and to follow after them, in whole, or in part, yea even by permitting and furthering or advancing the same: In which last manner Salomon to please his wives made himself guilty of this sin. Compare below chap.18.18. and 21.25, 26. Jerem.2.23.]
\p
\v 6 . So Salomon did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD: [Understand especially the idolatry, and the false worship of God. Compare herewith, Gen.38.v.7.] and continued not to follow the LORD, [Heb.fulfilled not after the LORD. See Num.14.on v.24.] as David his father (did).
\p
\v 7 . Then Salomon built an high place [See Lev.26.on v.30.] for Camos, [the name of an Idol of the Moabites and Ammonites, of which see also Num.21.29. and Judg.11.24. and Jerem.48.7. This, with the two Idols mentioned v.5. did good King Josias take away, 2 Kings 23.13.] the loath someness of the Moabites, [who are therefore called the people of Chamos, Nu.21.29.] on the mount [viz. the mount of Olives, of which, see 2 Sam.15 30. and is called (2 Kings 23.13.) mount Maschith, that is, the mount of the corrupter, because the Jews did there corrupt themselves by Idolatry] which is before Jerusalem: and for Moleh [called also Milcom, above v.5.] the loathsomeness of the children of Ammon.
\p
\v 8 . And he did so for all his strange wives: which burnt incense, and offered unto their Gods.
\p
\v 9 . Wherefore the LORD was angry with Salomon, because he had inclined his heart from the LORD [i.e. from him. Compare above chap.8.1. and see the annotate.] the God of Israel who had appeared unto him twice; [viz. the first time at Gibeon, above chap.3.5. and the second time at Jerusalem after the building of the Temple chap.9. v.2.]
\p
\v 10 . And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not walk after others Gods: but he kept not that which the LORD had commanded.
\p
\v 11 . Wherefore the LORD said [Either he himself, or by some Prophet, possibly by Nathan, if he were yet alive: or Ahia the Silonite, of whom mention is made below v.30.] unto Salomon: Forasmuch as this is done by thee, that thou hast not kept my covenant, and my statutes, which I have commanded thee: I will certainly rend [Heb. rending, rend] this Kingdom from thee, [i.e. I will surely in a violent manner take away a great part of this Kingdom from thee. See of this phrase, below v.12.13,31.] and give the same unto thy servant. [i.e. to one of thy Ministers, namely, Jeroboam, of whom see below v.26,27,28, &c.]
\p
\v 12 . Notwithstanding, I will not do it in thy days, for David thy Fathers sake: [i.e. because of the promise which I have made unto thy Father, 2 Sam.7.13. 1 Chron.28.5,6. in which promise the Messiah is likewise promised, for whose sake God properly doeth good to those that be his] I will rend it out of the hand of thy [son. namely, Rehabeam; see also v.35 See the accomplishment of this threatening below chap.12. and 1 Sam.15.28. the explaining whereof we have below v.35.]
\p
\v 13 . Howbeit I will not rend away all the Kingdom, I will give one tribe to thy son; for my servant Davids sake, and for Jerusalem sake which I have chosen. [The explaining whereof we have below v,36.]
\p
\v 14 . So the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad an Edomite: he was of the Kings seed in Edom.
\p
\v 15 . For it came to pass when David was in Edom, [Waging war there. See 2 Sam.8.14. 1 Chron.18 12,13.] when Joab the commander in chief marched up to bury the slain: [viz. Israelites, that perished in the battle which David had against the Edomites, or whom he had out in Garrison in the Land of the Edomites, after his victory against them, to keep them still in subjection unto him, but after his departure were slain of the inhabitants] that he smote every man in Edom.
\p
\v 16 . (For Joab continued there six months, with all Israel; until he had destroyed all that was male in Edom.)
\p
\v 17 . But Hadad was fled away, he, and (certain) Edomitish men of his Fathers servant with him, to go unto Egypt; Now Hadad was a little youth.
\p
\v 18 . And they gat them up from Midian, [See Gen.25.on v.3.] and came to Paran; [see Gen.14on vers.6.] and took with them men of Paran, and came into Egypt unto Pharao the King of Egypt; who gave him house, and promised him food, [Heb. bread, i.e. victuals, apparel. See Gen.3.on v.19.] and gave him a land.
\p
\v 19 . And Halad found great favour in the eyes of Pharao: [Heb. found greatly grace, or favour, etc. What it is, to find grace, or favour in any mans eyes, see Gen. 18.on v.3.] so that he gave him his wives sister to wife, the sister of Tachpenes the Queen. [The Hebrew word signifieth properly the chief woman of the household: as if they should lay the Lordess, or mistress. Therefore mention is made of the Kings house, or family, then is there to be understood withal his wife, or mother the Queen, as here 2 Kings 13. and 15.13. Jerem.13.18. and 29.2.]
\p
\v 20 . And the sister of Tachpenes bares him Gembath his son, whom Tachpenes brought up [Heb. weaned] in Pharaos house: [Heb. in the midst of Pharaos house] (so) that Gembath was in Pharaos house among Pharaos sons.
\p
\v 21 . Now when Hadad heard in Egypt that David was fallen a sleep with his Fathers, and that Joab the Commander in cheif was dead: Hadad said unto Pharoa: Let me depart, that I may go into mine (own) Land.
\p
\v 22 . But Pharoa said unto him: but what lackest thou with me, that behold, thou sleekest to go into thine (own) land? and he said; nothing, but notwithstanding let me go. [Heb. letting go let me go.]
\p
\v 23 . Also God stirred up unto him an adversary, Rezon, the son of Eljada, who was fled from his Lord Hadad-Ezer, [viz. when he perceived that David had the victory over Hadad-Ezer, [viz. when he perceive that David had the victory over Hadad-Ezer in battle; of which see 2 Sam.8.3.] the son of Zoba. [the name of a Country in Syria, lying between Damascus and Euphrates. See hereof 1 Sam.14.47. and 2 Chron.8.3. and Psal.60.2.]
\p
\v 24 . Against whom he had also gathered [viz. unto his lord Hadad-Ezer] men, [understand souldiers who served the King of Zoba, and now were used under the conduct of Rezon (that revolted from his Lord) to spoil and plunder his Land, and the land lying thereabout] and became Captain of a band when David slew them: [namely, the Syrians of Zoba. See 2 Sam.8.3.] and being gone to Damascus, [See of this City, Gen.14.on v.15. This city Rezon then subdued, and drave our thence the Garrison, (place therein by David, to keep the same under him, 2 Sam.8.6.) and took also the government thereof in his own hands] dwelt there, and reigned in Damascus.
\p
\v 25 . And he [Namely, Razon] was Israels adversary all the days of Solomon, [viz. when Salomon had departure from the Lord, and was fallen to Idolatry. See 1 Kings 5.4.] and that besiege the evil that Hadad (did): [understand the same man, of whom mention is made above v.14.] for he [viz. Rezon] abhorred Israel, and he reigned over Syria.
\p
\v 26 . Moreover, Jeroboam the son of Nebat an Eprathite [i.e. an Ephraimite, or that was of the tribe of Ephraim. So judg.12.5.] of Zereda, [the name of the city where he was born, lying in the Ephraim See Jos.3.on v.16.] Salomons servant, (whose mothers name was Zerua, a widow-woman) lift up also the hand against the King. So in the following v.& 2. Sam.20.21. and comp.bel.v.40.]
\p
\v 27 . Now this is the cause, why he lifted up the hand against the King: Salomon built Millo, [See above chap.9.on v.15.] (and) closed up the breach of the city of David his father. [viz. the breach which David had made, when he drave out the Jebusites from thence, and took the strong hold of Zion. See 2 Sam.5.6,7.]
\p
\v 28 . And the man Jeroboam was a valiant champion: [viz. in the work of building of great fabric, and strong holds, over which Salomon had made him Overseer] when Salomon saw this lad [this word is also used of man, and especially when they are any mans servants. See Gen.22.on v.5.] that he was liborous, [i.e. diligent, industrious, very carefully and circumspect, and busie in providing and performing the work, over which he was set by the King. Heb. doing work] then he set him over all the charge of the house of Joseph.[understand the tribes of Ephraim and Menasseh. Two occasions are mentioned in this verse, whereby he became disloyal to his Prince, in stead of being thankful. The first, that he was advanced to the aforesaid office: the second, after that he attained to a higher state and dignity, as the words mentioned in the verse declare.]
\p
\v 29 . Now it came to pass at that time, when Jerobeam went forth out of Jerusalem, that the Prophet Ahia [ He is to be distinguished from others of this name, as from Ahia the Priest, 1 Sam 13. 14. From Ahia the Levite, who was over the treasures of the house of the Lord, 1 Chron. 26. 20. And from Ahia Salomons Scribe, 1 Kings 4. 3, etc] the Silonite found [i.e. met] him on the way, and he had put on a new garment, [Heb. Had covered himself with a new garment] and they two were alone in the field.
\p
\v 30 . Then Ahia caught that new garment that was on him: and rent in twelve pieces.
\p
\v 31 . And he said unto Jeroheam, take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the Lord the God of Israel; behold I will rend the Kingdom out of the hand of Salomon, and give ten tribes unto thee. [See 1 Sam. 15. 28.]
\p
\v 32 . Bu he shall have one tribe; [Meaning the tribe of Judah, although the tribe Simeon was in a manner intermixed with it, as also a part of the tribe of Benjamin. Now in the ten tribes Ephraim and Manasseh are counted for two tribes; but the tribe of Levi having no particular land, and being scattered among the other tribes, is not counted at all] for my servant David’s sake, [See above on v. 12. And 13] and for Jerusalem’s sake, the City which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.
\p
\v 33 . Because they have forsaken me, and bowed themselves down [viz. To worship] before Astoreth the God [or Goddess] of the Zidonians, Camos the God of the Moabites, and Milchom of the children of Amon: and have not walked in my ways, [to walk in the way of the Lord, is to live according to the rule and prescript of his word, as the following words declare. See 2 Kings 21. 22. Psa. 119. 3. And 128. 1.] to do that which is right in mine eyes; [what is right in the eyes of the Lord, the following words do explain, namely, that which is done according to human traditions. So below chap. 15. V. 5, 11. And 22. 43.] to my statutes, and my judgements, as David his Father (did).
\p
\v 34 . Howbeit, I will take nothing of this Kingdom out of his hand: [Heb. And I will not take this whole Kingdom out of his hand, i.e. nothing thereof. This phrase signifying not a special or particular, but a general, or universal abnegation and denials, is very frequent in the holy Scripture; as Gen. 23. 6. Jos. 11. 14. Psa. 143. 2. Mat. 24. 22. Rom. 3. 20. See also Gen. 39. On v. 23.] but I will make him a Prince all the days of his life, for my servant David’s sake, whom I have chosen, who kept my commandments, and my statutes.
\p
\v 35 . But I will take the Kingdom out of the hand of his son: and I will give unto thee ten tribes thereof. [Heb. And I will give that unto thee, (to wit) ten tribes.]
\p
\v 36 . And I will give one tribe unto his son: [See above on v. 32] that David my servant may have a lamp [ or candle, or light, i.e. successors in the Kingdom, being types of the Lord Christ. So is this word also taken, 2 Sam. 21. 17. See likewise below chap. 15. 4. 2 Chron. 21. 7. Psa. 132. 17.] always [Heb. All days. Understand in the tribe of Judah, until the coming of the Messiah: for from David unto the Babylonish captivity, did the Kingly government continue in Judah: after that the Princely power and the Sanhedrim, unto Christ, whose Kingdom is everlasting] in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me, to put my name there. [see above chap. 8. On verse 16.]
\p
\v 37 . So I will take thee, and thou shalt reign over all thy soul shall desires: [i.e. as a Sovereign Prince over a great, mighty and blessed land: as these things are commonly desired of Kings] and thou shall be King over Israel. [i.e. over the greater part of the people]
\p
\v 38 . And it shall come to pass, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I shall command thee, and shalt walk in my ways, and do that which is right in mine eyes, keeping my statutes and my commandments, according as David my servant did: that I will be with thee, [See Gen. 21. On v. 22. And 26. On v. 24.] and build there a sure house, [i.e. so establish thy Kingdom, that it shall continue with thy posterity. Compare 1 Sam. 2. 35. 2 Sam. 7. 16.] according as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.
\p
\v 39 . And I will for that humble the seed of David: yet not for ever. [Heb. Not at all days: for the Messiah that was to come forth of the seed of David according to the flesh, and to succeed in the Kingdom in a spiritual manner, should not only bear rule over all the tribes of Israel, but also over all the whole world]
\p
\v 40 . Therefore Salomon sought to kill Jerobeam: but Jerobeam got him up and fled into Egypt, unto Silak the King of Egypt, and was in Egypt until Salomon died.
\p
\v 41 . Now the rest of the acts [Heb. Words] of Salomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, is that not written in the book of the acts of Salomon? [Hereby is not understood the two books of the Chronicles, which long after that were first written (as is conceived) by Ezra, but another book, wherein the acts and passages of Salomon are related at large, which is now not extant.]
\p
\v 42 . Now the time [Hebr. The days] that Salomon reigned at Jerusalem over all Israel, was forty years.
\p
\v 43 . After that Salomon fell asleep with his Fathers, and was buried in the City of David his Father: and Rehabeam [Called Roboam, Mat. 1. 7.] his son became King in his stead.
\c 12
\s The Israelites seek to Rehabeam for easement of their imposed burdens, v. 1. & c. About it he adviseth first with the old men, 5. After that with the younger sort, whose counsel he followeth, 8. For which cause ten tribes revolt from him, 16. He attempteth to bring them again to him, but in vain, 18. Yea God himself forbiddeth him to do it, 22. Jerobeam King of Israel, secureth his Kingdom by building certain strong holds, 25. And by instituting a new kind of worship, 26.
\p
\v 1 And Rehabeam went to Sichem [The name of a City lying in Ephraim; of which see further, Gen. 12. On v. 6.] for all Israel were come to Sicheam to make him King. [in the City, viz. Sichem, as in the midst of the land, was the assembly held, wherein they were to treat of the installing of the new King, and of the affairs of the Kingdom]
\p
\v 2 . Now it came to pass when Jerobeam the Son of Neaat, heard (this), where he was yet in Egypt, (for he was fled from the face of King Salomon: [See above chap. 11. V. 40.] and Jerobeam dwelt in Egypt) [viz. Waiting for a fit opportunity, to obtain the Kingdom promised him of God by the Prophet Ahia, above ch. 11. 31.]
\p
\v 3 . That they sent and caused him to be called; and Jerobeam, and all the Congregation of Israel came; and spoke unto Rehabeam, saying;
\p
\v 4 . Thy Father made our yoak, [i.e. the bondage, and the burden of tribute, which Salomon had laid upon them. See above chap. 4. 7. And 5. 13. So is the word yoak used in the following words: Item, Gen. 27. 40. And Lev. 26. 13.] hard: although Salomon had charged the goods and estates of his subjects with taxes for maintaining of his state and court, above chap. 4. 7. 22. Yet they had no cause to complain thus, for as much as they had under his government, (which lasted fourty years, 2 Chron. 9. 30.) enjoyed besides the true Religion, great peace and outward prosperity, as appeareth make thy fathers hard service, [i.e. which thy father hath laid upon us: so, the burden of the King, Hos. 8. 10. That is, which the King imposeth, or layeth upon] and his heavy yoak which he laid upon us, [Heb. Gave upon us, so v. 9] lighter, [or, lessen, diminish somewhat of thy fathers hard service, etc.] and we will serve thee. [i.e. be thy subjects, and accept of and acknowledge thee of our King, and obey thee. This is expressed below v. 7.] to be servants.
\p
\v 5 . And he said unto them: go your ways until the third day, then come to me again : and the people went their ways.
\p
\v 6 . And the King Rehabeam consulted with the eldest, [i.e. with the Counsellors of the Kingdom. See Gen. 50. On v. 7.] that had stood before the face of Solomon his Father, [i.e. that had served him with advice and counsel. Compare below v. 8. And see Deut. 1. On v. 38. And above chap. 1. On v. 2.] when he lived; saying; how do you advise, that we may answer this people?
\p
\v 7 . And they spoke unto him saying ; If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt answer them, speak good words [i.e. acceptable, friendly, comfortable words. See above chap. 1. On v. 42.] unto them: then they will be thy servants [see ab. On v. 42.] unto them: then they will be thy servants [see ab. On v. 4.] at all days.
\p
\v 8 . But he forsook the counsel of the eldest, which they had counselled him, and he consulted with the young men, [See on the Hebrew word, Gen. 44. On v. 20.] that were grown up [or nourished] with him, which stood before his face. [i.e. which were in his service, as ab. V. 6.]
\p
\v 9 . And he said unto them; what counsel give ye, that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, make the yeak which thy father laid upon us, lighter.
\p
\v 10 . And the young men that were grown up with him, spake unto him, saying: Thus shalt thou speak unto that people, that spake unto thee, saying; thy father made our yoak heavy; but make thou it lighter upon us: Thus shalt thou speak unto them; my least (finger) shall be thicker then my Fathers loins. [or, my least (joint) etc. A common proverb, whereby is intimated, that he would use more violence to oppress his people, then his Father had done.]
\p
\v 11 . Now if my Father hath caused an heavy yoak to be laden upon you; then I will besides your yoak yet add thereunto: my Father hath chastised you with scourges, but I will chastise you with scorpions. [i.e. with scourges that have sharp hooks out them, to prick, and to wound thorough, as the scorpions do. Others understand scourges made of Eglantine or other thorns, whereunto bondage is compared, with which the King is counselled to threaten his people.]
\p
\v 12 . So Jerobeam and all the people came to Rehabeam the third day, according as the King had spoken, saying; come to me again the third day.
\p
\v 13 . And the King answered the people hardly: for he forsook the counsel of the eldest, [See above v. 7.] which they had counselled him.
\p
\v 14 . And he spake to them after the counsel of the young men, [See above verse 10 and 11.] saying; my father made your yoak heavy, but I will besides your yoak yet add thereunto: my father chastised you with scourges, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
\p
\v 15 . So the King hearkened not unto the people: for this turning about [ Or, going about, revolution : item, cause] was from the LORD, that he might confirm his word, which the LORD had spoken by the ministry [Heb. Hand. See Lev. 8. On v. 36.] of Ahia the Silonite unto Jerobeam the son of Nebat. [the meaning here is, that this act, passage, or dealing, whereby the state and condition of the land thus wheeled and turned about, happened according to the dispose of Gods providence, that he might execute his judgement which he had threatened to Salomon for his back-filling, yet so as that God in no wise contracted any person from men’s sinful acts or doings. See below v. 24. Item, Gen. 45. 5, 7, 8. And 50. 20. Exod. 9. 16. 2 Sam. 12. 12. 2 Chron. 25. 20.]
\p
\v 16 . When all Israel saw, that the King hearkened not unto them, then the people returned answer to the King hearkened not saying, what portion have we in David? [ Compare 2 Sam 20. 1. The meaning is, that they expected benefit or advantage by it. They speak by way of question, to deny it the stronger. See Gen. 18. On ver. 17. ] yea (we have) no inheritance in the son of Isai; to your tents, O Israel ; [i.e. let every man return to his own home, and to those that be his] now see to thine own house, [i.e. let him take care of himself, and not of us, but let him take care of himself, and not of us, but let us alone] O David: [they mean the posterity of David, and those that were addicted to him, but called him out of scorn and disdain, the son of Isai] so Israel departed to their tents.
\p
\v 17 . But as for the children of Israel, which dwelt in the Cities of Judah; [Understand by these, the tribes of Simeon, who were in part intermixed with the tribe of Judah, the Levites, and a part of the tribe of Benjamin, which lay by North-ward by the tribe of Judah. See above chap. 11. On v. 22. And compare below v. 23.] Rehabeam reigned also over them.
\p
\v 18 . Rehabeam the King sent Adoram, who was over the tribute, [This man is he, who (according to the opinion of some) is also called Adoniram, above chap. 4. 6. And 5. 14. Of whom its said there, that he was over the Kings tribute, as is also affirmed here of this man; which office, made them that executed the same, to be odious and hateful unto the people; so that it was great imprudence to send such an one to pacify the Israelites] and all Israel stoned him with stones that he died: but King Rehabeam encouraged himself to get up into a charet, to flee to Jerusalem. [viz. Making haste to escape the danger.]
\p
\v 19 . So the Israelites revolted from the house of David, [Oth. So the Israelites were rebellious, or disloyal against the house of David. So is the original word used in the like case, 2 Kin. 1. 1. And 3. 7. And 8. 22.] unto this day.
\p
\v 20 . And it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jerobeam was come again, that they sent and called him with the assembly, [i.e. which the chief men of the tribes of Israel had commanded, to consult what they were to do in this division of the tribes, and case or condition of their land. Compare above the annotate. On ver. 1.] and made him King over all Israel, no man followed the house of David [Heb. No man was after the house of David] but the tribe of Juda only. [See ab. On v. 17.]
\p
\v 21 . Now when Rehabeam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, [i.e. a part of the tribe; for Bethel and other Cities were with Jerobeam] an hundred and four score thousand chosen (men) practised in war, or well practised in warlike affairs, or skilful in waging war, able and experienced souldiers. So 2 Chron. 1. 11. And 26. 13.] to fight against the house of Israel, [i.e. the ten tribes, which were parted from Rehabeam, and the house of Judah, above v. 16. And 2 Chron. 10. Vers. 16.] to bring the Kingdom again to Rehabeam the son of Salomon. [i.e. to himself. See above chap. 2. On v. 19.]
\p
\v 22 . But the word of God came to Semaja the man of God, [See of this Prophet also, 2 Chron. 12, 5, 15. He is to be distinguished from two false Prophets of this name: the one was the son of Delaja, Nehem. 6. 10. The other was surnamed the Nehelamite, Jerem. 29. 31.] saying;
\p
\v 23 . Speak unto Rehabeam the son of Salomon, the King of Juda, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin; and in Judah and Benjamin, 2 Chron. 11. 3.] saying;
\p
\v 24 . Thus saith the LORD, ye shall not march up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel; let every man return to his (own) house, for this thing is happened from me: [See above on ver. 15.] and they hearkened to the word of LORD, and returned to depart according to the word of the LORD.
\p
\v 25 . Now Jerebeam built Sichem [i.e. he strengthen and fenced it. See of the City above on v. 1.] on mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein, and went out from thence, and built Penuel. [ a City lying beyond Jordan in the tribe of God. See Gen. 32. 30.]
\p
\v 26 . And Jerobeam said in his heart; [i.e. thought, conceived, imagined, judged: so Psal. 14. 2. And 36. 2. To say in his heart, is to purpose and conclude somewhat with himself, Psa. 74. V. 8.] now shall the Kingdom return to the house of David.
\p
\v 27 . If this people shall go up to make offerings in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their Lord, unto Rehabeam the King of Judah: yea they shall kill me, and turn again unto Rehebeam the King of Judah: yea they shall kill me, and turn again unto Rehabeam the King of Judah.
\p
\v 28 . Therefore the King held a counsel, et made two golden Calves: and he said unto them, it is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem, [i.e. it will be too troublesome, and too chargeable for you. Oth. Let it suffice you, that hitherto ye have gone up to Jerusalem, to bring your offerings thither. Henceforward it’s no more needful, seeing you have so fit an opportunity for it in your own land. Compare this phrase with Numb. 16. 2. 3.] Behold, thy Gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. [ He knew well enough that these golden calves were no Gods, and that the Israelites would so conceive of them: But his meaning is, that they should honour and serve the true God by these images, contrary to the express command of God, Exod. 20. 4, 5. Deu. 4. 14, 15, 16, 17, etc. See the like offence, Exod. 32. 4.]
\p
\v 29 . And he set the one at Bethel, and he put the other at Dan. [i.e. at both the uttermost borders of his Kingdom, for Bethel lay in the South-border, and Dan in the North-border.]
\p
\v 30 . And this thing became sin: [viz. Of idolatry which is called sin, by way of eminency, because it is directly opposite against the Majesty of God. Hence it’s often said of Jerobeam, that he made Israel to sin, 1 Kings 16, 19. Etc. See also 2 Kings 21. On vers. 16.] for the people went before the one unto Dan. [viz. To worship it, and to offer sacrifice unto it. And it seemeth hence, that the one Calf was first set up at Dan, and the other afterward at Bethel, as appeareth by the following 32 verse.]
\p
\v 31 . He made also an house of the high places; [i.e. a Temple on the exalted place; were altars were reared, to commit idolatry thereon] and made Priests of the meanest of the people, [Heb. Of the ends, or uttermost parts of the people, i.e. of the meanest and most contemptible sort of the people, and not of the worthiest and ablest. Or understand it of both sorts of people, both high and low. Compare this phrase with Gen. 47. 2. And see the annotate. Thereon.] which were not of the sons of Levi. [out of whom, especially out of the family of Aaron, the Priests according to Gods institution were to be chosen.]
\p
\v 32 . And Jerobeam made a feast in the eighth month, on the fifiteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that was in Judah, [Namely, a feast of Leaf-huts, to imitate that which was so called in Judah: but he ordained this feast in the eighth month; that is, in October: whereas the feast of the Leaf-huts was according to God’s appointment to be kept in the seventh month, Levit. 23. 34. That is, in September, as it was then kept in Judah] and offered upon the altar; [viz. He himself offered. Compared chap. 13. V. 1. And 4. Which was unlawful for him to do, seeing this duty was enjoyed by God to the Priests only, Exod. 30. 7, etc and 2 Chron. 26. 18.] the like he did at Bethel, offering to the Calves, which he had made, he placed also at Bethel Priests of the high places; which he had made.
\p
\v 33 . And he offered upon the altar, which he had made at Bethel, on the fifteenth day of the eighth month; of the month which he had devised out of his (own) heart: [i.e. according to his own choice, taking upon him to institute and ordain such a worship as pleased himself, against the express command of the Lord, numb. 15. 39.] So he made a feast for the children of Israel, and offered upon that altar [viz. Jerobeam offered. Compare the first verse of the following chapter] burning incense. [i.e. that which he offered was incense: or, he offered and burnt incense together. Oth. And went up to that altar, to burn incense.]
\c 13
\s A Prophet of Juda prophecyeth against the altar at Bethel, vers. 1, & c. The Prophecy is confirmed by miracles, 3. The Prophet being invited by jerobeam, to eat with him, refuseth, 7. An old Prophet seduceth him, so that he turneth back, 11. He is for it reproved of God by the old Prophet from God, 20. And slain by a Lion, 23. The old Prophet hearing of it, burieth him, 25. And ratifieth his Prophecy, 31. Jerobeams obstinacy, 33.
\p
\v 1 And behold a man of God [See of this appellation Judg, 13. 6.]came out of Juda, by the word of the LORD, [i.e. by the command of the Lord; so in the following verse. Or with the word of the Lord, that is, with a certain charge, which he was to deliver unto King Jerobeam] unto Bethel: and Jerobeam stood by the Altar, to burn incense. [Compare above chap. 12. v. 32, 33. And the annotat, thereon, item below verse 4.]
\p
\v 2 . And he cryed against the altar by the word of the LORD, and said, altar, altar, [He speaketh to the altar, because the King hearkened no to this, an the like exhortations. In the men while the whole outward idol-worship is threatened by the word altar, which is sometimes taken for the whole outward divine worship, as Isa. 19. 19. 1 Cor, 9. 13.] thus saith the LORD, behold, a son shall be born [viz. About three hundred thirty years after this time] unto the house o David, whose name shall be Josia, he shall offer upon thee, the Priests of the high places, whereby the alter should be polluted, and the Priests that offered thereon be punished. See the fulfilling hereof, 2 Kin. 23. 15, &c.] that burn incense upon thee.
\p
\v 3 . And he gave a token [i.e. he declared that straightway a miracle should happen, for confirmation of that which he foretold so below vers. And so doth Moses also speak. Duet. 18 on ver. 1.] the same day, saying; This is that token of which the LORD spake: behold, the altar shall be rent asunder, [i.e. of this own accord, no man laying a hand thereon] and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.
\p
\v 4 . Now it came to pass, when the King heard the Word of the man of God, which he had cried against the altar at Bethel, that Jeroboam stretched forth his hand from the altar,[i.e. Wherewith he was busie upon, and about the altar; in offering and burning incense] saying, Lay hold on him ;but his hand which he had stretched forth against him,[meaning the man of God, that had threatened the Altar] withered,(so) that he could not pull it (in) again to him.
\p
\v 5 . And the altar was rent asunder, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to that token, which the man of God had given, by the Word of the LORD.
\p
\v 6 . Then the King answered, [Answering signifieth here to begin a speech, or discourse. See Judg. 18. on v. 14.] and said unto the man of God; Call now earnestly upon the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me that my band may come to me again: Then the man of God be sought the face of the LORD earnestly, and the Kings had come to him again, and became as it was before.
\p
\v 7 . And the king spake to the man of God; come hence with me, and strengthen thyself, [the Hebrew word rendered here strengthening, signifieth properly under propping , which here is as much as to bring new strength to the body by the use of meat and drink compare Genesis 18.5 Judges 13.5,8 and Psalms 104.15] and I will give thee a present.
\p
\v 8 . But the man of God said unto the king if thou wouldst give me the half of thine house , I would not go with thee [the like phrase doth Bileam use Numbers 22.18 but not with an upright heart ] neither would I eat bread, nor drink water in this place [that is use no meat nor drink so below verse 9.16,17&c. Compare 1samuel 30.11 2Kings 6.22,23.]
\p
\v 9 . For so the LORD charged me by his word, [Heb. So he charged me by the word of the LORD. That is, so he, to wit, the LORD, charged me by his Word. See the like phrase, Gen. 1. 27. & 5. 1. And the annotate.] saying, Thou shalt eat no bread, nor drink water. [Namely, at Bethel. Compare the last foregoing verse: for this prohibition, as it was personal, so was it likewise to be understood in regard of the place unto which he was sent, and doubtless also of the time of this sending forth] neither shalt thou return by the way that thou wentest.
\p
\v 10 . And he went another way; and turned not again by the way, that he came to Bethel.
\p
\v 11 . Now an old Prophet [Old in days, and perhaps in office also, but herein not always honest and faithful: for though he had the gift of Prophecy, and some fear of God before his eyes, and seemeth to have been a lover of the true Prophets, as may appear by that which is related hereafter, vers. 20, 21, 22, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32. Yet here he is found in a lie and falsehood, vers. 18. Whereby he deceived the true Prophet, and brought him to suffering, vers. 24.] dwelt at Bethel; and his son came, and told him all the work which the man of God had done that day in Bethel, with the words which he had spoken unto the King; these they [viz. The fore-mentioned son with his brethren, who confirmed his relation] told also to their Father.
\p
\v 12 . And their Father spoke unto them: What way went he? And his sons had seen the way which the man of God went, that came from Juda. [i.e. They had observed or taken notice which way he was gone, when he departed from Bethel, and told their Father of it.]
\p
\v 13 . Then said he unto his son; Saddle me the ass; and they saddled him the ass, and he rode thereon.
\p
\v 14 . And he went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: [The Prophet seemeth to have rested himself here through weariness, mixed with hunger] and he said unto him; Art thou the man of God, that camest from Juda? And he said, I am.
\p
\v 15 . Then said he unto him; Come home with me, and eat bread.
\p
\v 16 . But he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread, nor drink water with thee in this place. [viz. Bethel; as above verse 8.]
\p
\v 17 . For a word (came) to me by the word of the LORD; [i.e. A command and charge was given me by the Lord’s speaking to me] Thou shalt neither eat bread there, nor drink water: thou shalt not turn again, going by the way, that thou camest.
\p
\v 18 . And he said unto him, I am a Prophet also, as thou (art), and an Angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying; Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread, and drink water: (but) he lied unto him. [This old Prophet sinneth three ways, 1. Because he setteth God against himself. 2. Because he suffereth not the Prophet of Judah to perform the command given him of God. 3. Because he alledgeth a false revelation, or communication.]
\p
\v 19 . And he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drink water. [Here this Prophet sinneth likewise, forsaking the true word of God, of which he was sure, and embracing the false one, which he could not be sure of.]
\p
\v 20 . And it came to pass as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came [viz. Inwardly by revelation unto his mind] unto the Prophet, [meaning the old Prophet, that dwelt at Bethel. And hence may be gathered, that God used this man also as a Prophet] that had made him [viz. The Prophet of Judah] go back. [viz. From the place where he had found him on the way, unto the city of Bethel.]
\p
\v 21 . And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, [i.e. he spake unto him with a loud, clear, and most audible voice] saying; thus saith the LORD: because thou hast been refractory unto the mouth of the LORD [i.e. to the command of the LORD, expressed here before v. 9. And 17. And again repeated v. 22.] and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God had commanded thee:
\p
\v 22 . But camest back, and hast eaten bread, and drunk water at the place, of which he had spoken unto thee, thou shalt eat no bread, nor drink water; thy carcass shall not come into the sepulchre of thy Fathers, [which was held to be a judgement: not as if the place of burial could any wise either benefit or prejudice the party deceased, but because those that cannot attain to the ordinary place of their burial, have commonly more trouble before they die, and less civil honour when they are buried, and some of them have done some public and noted evil in their lifetime. See below chap. 14. V. 13. Isa. 14. 19, 29. Jerem. 22. 19 and 26. 24.]
\p
\v 23 . And it came to pass after he [viz. The man of God, that was come from Juda] had eaten bread, and after he had drunk; that he [viz. The old Prophet of Bethel] saddled for him the ass, [which he did, either by his sons, or by himself, to show by this officiousness (as some conceive) the sorrow and grief that he had for the evil that he had done to the Prophet of Judah, desiring to continue still a friend] (to wit) for the Prophet, whom he had made go back.
\p
\v 24 . So he went away, and a lion found [i.e. met] him on the way, and slew him; and his carcase lay cast on the way, and the ass stood by it, [as being stayed there by the hand of God’s providence to carry the dead body to be buried] the lion also stood by the carcase. [not as a beast of prey, to devour it; but as a guard to keep it for burial.]
\p
\v 25 . And behold there passed men by, and saw the carcase cast on the way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the City, wherein the old Prophet dwelt.
\p
\v 26 . When the Prophet, that had made him turn back from the way, heard (this), then he said: it is this man of God, that was refractory unto the mouth of the mouth of the LORD; [see above on v. 21.] therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the Lion, that broke him, and slew him, according to the word of the LORD, [which he had spoken [viz. By me. See above on v. 22.] unto him.
\p
\v 27 . Moreover, he spake unto his sons saying; saddle me the ass; and they saddled (him).
\p
\v 28 . Then he went his way, and found his carcase cast on the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase, nor broken the ass. [i.e. not torn him, nor done him any hurt, to devour him.]
\p
\v 29 . Then the Prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid that on the ass, and carried that back; so the old Prophet came into the city to mourn, [see of the manner and custom of mourning over the dead, Gen. 23. On v. 2.] and to bury him.
\p
\v 30 . And he laid his carcase in his grave, [viz. In his own grave, which he had there in the land of Israel. And hereby the prediction of God was fulfilled, mentioned above v. 22. For the body of the dead Prophet did not come into the grave of his fathers, but into the grave of a stranger, namely, of the old Prophet of Bethel] and they, [viz. Not only the old Prophet, but also his household, yea (as some conceive) many of the city likewise] made a lamentation over him, as my brother. [the opinion of some is, that these were the first words of a funeral song, that was sung over him.]
\p
\v 31 . Now it came to pass after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying; when i shall be dead, then bury me in that grave, wherein the man of God is buried, and lay my bones by his bones. [Some conceive that he expressly gave this in charge, that his bones after his death might not get among the bones mentioned above v. 2.]
\p
\v 32 . For the thing shall certainly come to pass, [Heb. Coming to pass, come to pass, or being be] which he proclaimed by the word of the LORD against the altar that is at Bethel; and against all the houses of the high places were, see Lev. 26. On v. 30.] which are in the cities of Samaria. [Heb. Schomeron (otherwise called Samaria) lying in it, and from a mountain of the same name, upon which King Omri built that city. Others understand this of the mountain itself, that by reason of its largeness and greatness, might have had many little towns or cities upon it. Compare below chap. 16. The annotate. On v. 24.]
\p
\v 33 . After this passage [viz. After the miracles which God had wrought on Jerobeams hand, which suddenly withered, and was restored sound and whole again: on the altar, which of its self, without the hand or help of man, split and rent in twain, on the Prophet of Juda, who according to God’s prediction came not into the sepulchre of his Fathers] Jerobeam turned not from his evil way; but made again Priests of the High places [see above chap. 12. On ver. 31, 32.] of the meanest of the people, [see above ch. 12. On ver. 31.] whosoever would, [others, whom he would, & c.] he filled his hand, [i.e. he made him a Priest: see Exod. 28. 41. & Lev. 7. On ver. 37.] and (he) became one of the Priests of the high places.
\p
\v 34 . And he [Namely Jerobeam. Oth. And this, etc.] became in this thing, sin [that is, by this action of his he was the cause, that his posterity fell into abomination and idolatry, and that God’s judgement came upon them, whereby they were utterly destroyed; as in the following Chapters is described] unto the house of Jerobeam. [i.e. unto his own house: see above chap. 2. On v. 19.] to cause (the same) to be cut off, and to be destroyed from the earth.
\c 14
\s Jerobeam sendeth his wife unto the Prophet Ahia, to enquire what should become of his son that was sick, vers. 1, etc. Who foretelleth him his ruin, because of his idolatry, 7. Item, the death of his child, 12. And the destruction of Israel, 15. His son dieth, and he likewise, and Nadab his son reigneth, 17. Rehabeam and Juda sin against the Lord, 21. They are punished by Sisak, King of Egypt, 25. After the death of Rehabeam doth Abiam his son reign, 29.
\p
\v 1 At that time, [viz. When Jerobeam went on in the way of his abominable idolatry mentioned in the end of the former chapter] Ahia the son of Jerobeam was sick.
\p
\v 2 . And Jerobeam said unto his wife; Get thee now up, and disguise thy self, [Heb. Alter thy self, viz. In apparel, ornaments, train, words, behaviour, and gestures] that it be not perceived that thou art Jerobeam’s wife; and go thy ways to Silo [a City lying in the tribe of Ephraim, where the Tent of the Congregation, and the Ark of God were a long time: and where the Prophet Ahia, who spake concerning me that I should be King over this people. [see above chap. 11. 31.]
\p
\v 3 . And take in thine hand ten loaves, and cakes, [Heb. Prickt cakes, in which certain pricks, tokens, marks, were made or imprinted for ornaments sake. Oth. Cracknels, or, biscate] and a cruse [or, bottle] of honey [viz. For a Present for the Prophet, which in those times was used by many, not to reward the service of the Prophets, but to honour and grace their persons. See Judg. 13. 17. 1 Sam. 9. 7, 8. 2 King 5. 15. & 8 ver. 8.] and go to him , he will make known to thee, what shall happen to this lad. [i.e. whether he shall recover, or die of his sickness.]
\p
\v 4 . And Jerobeam’s wife did so, and got her up, and went to Silo, and came into the house of Ahia: now Ahia could not see; for his eyes stood stiff, by reason of his age: [Heb. Stood through, or from his grayness ; i.e. his sight grown thick and stiff, and consequently dark, by reason of his great age, which is usually accompanied with gray hairs.]
\p
\v 5 . But the LORD said unto Ahia; Behold, Jerobeam’s wife cometh to ask a thing of thee, [viz. What shall become of her son’s sickness] concerning her son, for he is sick; thus and thus, thou shalt speak unto her. Understand hereby that which the Prophet was charged to certify and denounce, and is related hereafter, ver. 7, & c.] and it shall be, when she cometh in, that she will behave herself strange. [see above on v. 2.]
\p
\v 6 . And it came to pass when Ahia heard the noise of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in thou wife of Jerobeam, why doest thou behave thyself so strange? [Or, to what end (is) this, that thou behaves thy self strange?] for i am sent [viz. By the Lord] to thee with an hard (message). [Which after the recounting of God’s mercies shewed to Jerobeam, setteth before him his abominable sins, with a Prediction of the righteous and fearful judgements of God, that should follow thereupon: or, for some hard thing.]
\p
\v 7 . Go thy ways, tell Jerobeam: Thus saith the LORD the God of Israel: Forasmuch, as I exalted thee out of the midst of the people, and made thee a Leader [Compare above chap. 1. 35. & below chap. 16. 2. & 2 King 25. 5. 2 Chron. 6. 5. Where the Hebrew word is likewise so translated] over my people Israel.
\p
\v 8 . And have rent the Kingdom from the house of David, and given that unto thee; and thou hast not been, as David my servant (was), who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, [see above chap. 2. On vers. 4.] to do only that which is right in mine eyes.]
\p
\v 9 . But hast done evil, doing much more than all that were before thee, and hast gone , and hast made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back. [i.e. Disdainfully despised, and disloyally forsaken. The Lord speaketh also thus, Nehem. 9. 26. Ezek. 23. 35.]
\p
\v 10 . Therefore behold, I will bring evil [i.e. Mischief, judgement, vengeance: see Gen. 19. On ver. 19.] upon the house [i.e. family: so in the sequel. Item, 2 Sam. 3. 10. & 9. 3. And below chap. 16. 3.] of Jerobeam, and destroy from Jerobeam him that passeth against the wall, [understand hereby a total, and utter destruction, wherein none is spared, even not so much as a dog. So 1 Sam. 25. 22, 34. And below chap. 16. 11. & 21. 21. & 2 King 9. 8.] him that is shut up [ see the explaining of this phrase, Deut. 32. On ver. 36.] and forsaken in Israel; and I will put away the posterity of the house of Jeroboam, as the dung is done away, until it be utterly perished.
\p
\v 11 . Him that dieth of Jerobeam in the City, shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field, shall the Fowls of the Heaven cat: [A phrase signifying an unhappy death, with the loss of the grave. See the same also below chap. 16. 4. & 21. 24.] for the LORD hath spoken it.
\p
\v 12 . Thou then get thee up, go to thine house; when thy feet shall have entered into the City [viz. Upon the threshold of thine house; as appeareth by the fulfilling hereof, below verse 17.] then shall the Child die.
\p
\v 13 . And all Israel shall mourn for him, [viz. The good (ones) in Israel, because of the good hope they had conceived of this young man ; the bad to please the father. Of the mourning and lamenting of the godly (ones) for the dead, see Gen. 23. On vers. 2.] and bury him; for this (man) only of Jerobeam shall come to the grave: [burial is also a mercy of God, because it is the last civil honour done to the dead in this life, and a spiritual instruction to the living of the life, and a spiritual instruction to the living of the life to come, by the renewing of the hope of the resurrection from the dead. See Gen. 13. On ver. 4.] because in him there is found some good thing [i.e. some beginnings of the fear of God, and true piety, not by nature, but wrought in him by the spirit of God, Jos. 1. 13. And 3. 6.] before the LORD the God of Israel in the house of Jerobeam.
\p
\v 14 . But the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, [viz. Baesa, of whom see below chap. 15. 27.] who shall it also be now? [i.e. what shall now further God shall raise up one hereafter , or in time to come? He hath also now done it . That is, he hath already raised him up one, that he might begin to execute this threatened judgement.]
\p
\v 15 . The LORD shall also smite Israel, as a read in the water is driven about, [viz. Hither and thither by all manner of winds, so should Israel be disquieted, and troubled by dissensions within, and wars without] and shall pluck up Israel out of this good land, which he gave unto their fathers, and shall scatter them on the other side of the River; [viz. Euphrates. See Gen. 31. On vers. 11. He foretelleth the transportation of the Israelites into Assyria, Mesopotamia, and Media, of the accomplishment whereof (which happened about 240 years after this time) we may read 2 Kings 17. 6.] because they have made themselves groves, [See of these Exod. 34. On v. 31. Deu. 7. On v. 5. Under one kind of idolatry God understandeth the rest; yea all false worships. Oth. Grove-gods, grove-images. So verse 23.] provoking the LORD to anger.
\p
\v 16 . And he shall give up Israel, [viz. Into the hands of their Enemies] because of the sins of Jerobeam, that sinned, [or, wherewith he sinned, or which he sinned. Understand the sin of Idolatry, of which see above chap. 12. V. 28, 29, & c. And 13. V. 33, 34.] and who made Israel to sin. [or, and wherewith he made Israel to sin: or, and which he made Israel to sin. To wit, by setting abominable idol-worship, and commanding his subjects to practise idolatry, and obstinately forcing them thereunto by his own example.]
\p
\v 17 . Then Jerobeam’s wife gat her up, and went, and came to Tirza; [A city lying in the tribe of Manasseh, where the court of the Kings of Israel was, before they dwelt in Samaria. It was very fair and pleasant, so that the spouse of Christ is compared unto it , Cant. 6. 1. See of this city, Jos. 12. V. 24. And below chap. 16. 8.] now when she came upon the threshold of the house, then the young men died. [as was foretold by the Prophet Ahia, above v. 12.]
\p
\v 18 . And they buried him, and all Israel lamented for him; according to the word of the LORD, which he had spoken by the ministry [Heb. By the hand. See Lev. 8. On v. 36.] of his servant Ahia the Prophet. [above ver. 13.]
\p
\v 19 . Now the rest of the acts of Jerobeam, how he warred, and how he reigned; behold, they are written in the book of the words; or acts of things of the Kings of Israel. So below vers. 29. Of the Kings of Judah. By this book is not to be understood the two books of Chronicles, contained in the scriptures of the Old Testament, and (as is conceived) first written by Ezra, who lived a long time after those times: But thereby is to be understood certain writings containing the Histories of the government of the Kings of both Kingdoms, which without prejudice or detriment of the doctrine of salvation, are not extant now, and out of which the books of Chronicles left us in holy scripture, were (as some conceive ) gathered and composed by Ezra through the instinct and inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Compare above chap. 11. The annotate. On v. 41.]
\p
\v 20 . Now the days that Jerobeam reigned, are two and twenty years: and he fell asleep with his Fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.
\p
\v 21 . Now Rehebeam the son of Salomon reigned in Judah: Rehabeam was one and fourty years old, [Heb. A son of one and fourty years] when he became King, and reigned seventeen years at Jerusalem, in the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there; [see above chap. 8. On v. 29.] and his mothers name was Naama, [so below v. 31.] the Amonitess.[among other heathenish women, that seduced Salomon from the Lord, are the Ammonitish women also named, above chap. 11. 1, 2, & c. Of which without doubt this was one of the chiefest, who not only seduced her husband to idolatry, but also her son her son Rehabeam, after he had served the Lord three years, 2 Chron. 11. 17.]
\p
\v 22 . And Judah did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, [viz. After that Rehabeam had reigned three years. See 2 Chron. 11. 17. And 12. On v. 1.] and they provoked him to jealousy [ see Deu. 4. On v. 24.] with their sins which they had sinned, more than all their Fathers had done.
\p
\v 23 . For they also, [i.e. not only the blinded heathen, and backsliding Israelites, but also the Jews themselves, with whom God had preserved the light of the truth, and the purity of worship] built them high places, and images reared, and groves: [see Deu. 12. On v. 3] upon all (or every) high hill, and under all (or avery) green tree. [See Deu. 12. On v. 2.]
\p
\v 24 . There were also buggerers [see Deu. 23. On ver. 17.] in the land: they did according to all the abominations of the heathen, [see some kinds of these abominations described, Deu. 18. v. 9, 10, 11, 12. 2 Chron. 33. 2, 3, 4, & c. Rom. 1. 25, 26, & c.] which the LORD had driven out of possession from the face of the children of Israel;
\p
\v 25 . Now it came to pass in the fifth year of King Rehabeam; (that) Sisak the King of Egypt [See of this man also above chap. 11. 40. and 2 Chron. 12. 2.] came up against Jerusalem.
\p
\v 26 . And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the Kings house; yea he took all away: [viz. All the gold and silver, and all that which was of any special value, that he could come at, and was not hid from his sight. Compare below chap. 15. 18.] he took away also all the golden shields which Salomon had made. [See above chap. 10. 16, 17. And 2 Chron. 9. 15.]
\p
\v 27 . And King Rehabeam made in their room copper shields: and he charged (them) under the hand of the chief of the guard, [Heb. Runners. Understand pages, lackeys, or life-guard, which great Lords and Princes are wont to have about them, being at home, or abroad, 1 Sam. 22. 17. 2 Kings 11. 19. So called, because they run on the way before and about their Lords, 2 Sam. 15. 1. 1 Kings 1. 5.] which kept the door of the Kings house.
\p
\v 28 . And it came to pass, when the King went into the house of the LORD, (that) the guard carried them; [viz. The shields. These the guard carried, when they conducted the King to the house of the Lord] and brought them back into the guard-chamber. [understand some appointed place, where the guard usually kept close together.]
\p
\v 29 . Now the rest of the acts of Rehabeam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. [See above on v. 19.]
\p
\v 30 . And there was war between Rehabeam, and between Jerobeam [Understand this of defensive war, which Rehabeam waged to defend his own Kingdom; and not of offensive, to take the Kingdom of Israel, for this was forbidden him by the Prophet Semaja, above chap. 12. 24.] all (their) days. [this insertion is in the like case expressed by the holy Ghost, below chap. 15, v. 16, 32.]
\p
\v 31 . And Rehabeam fell asleep with his Fathers, and was buried by his Fathers in the city of David; [see above chap. 2. On vers. 10.] and his mother’s name was Naama, the Ammonitess: and Abiam [otherwise called Abia 2Chronicles 12.16 and 13.1] his so reigned in his stead.
\c 15
\s Abiam reigned and followeth his fathers sins verse 1 &c. nevertheless God keepeth his promise 4 Abiam dieth 7 Asa reigneth in his stead who causeth a reformation to be made both in war and manner of his subjects 9 he is warred against the Baesa 16 is assisted of Benhadad 20 he dieth leaving Jehosaphath his son in his stead 23 Nadab reigneth over Israel 25 Bayesa stayeth him and destroyeth his fathers house and reigneth in his stead. 27.
\p
\v 1 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jerobeam the son of Nebat Abiam [otherwise called Abia 2Chronicles 12.16 and 13.1 &c.] became king over Judah[see 2Chronicles 13.1.]
\p
\v 2 . He reigned three years at Jerusalem [beginning from the eighteenth year of Jerubeams reign verse 1 and ending with the twentieth see below on verse 9] and his mothers names was Maacha [called also Machaja 2Chronicles 13.2] a daughter of Abisalom [called also Absalom 2Chronicles 11.21 some think him to have been the son of David many others another man of that name who was of Gibea otherwise called also Uriel 2Chronicles 13.2 see the annotate there.]
\p
\v 3 . And he walked in all the sins of his father which he had done before him and his heart was not perfect [see above chapter 8 on verse 6] with the Lord his God as the heart of David his father was [see above chapter 11 on verse 36.]
\p
\v 4 But for David's sake [See above chap. 11. on ver. 12.] did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, raising up his son after him,and establishing Jerusalem. [viz. in its former political and ecclesiastical estage, preserving therein the Kingly authority, with the remainders of the true Religion and pure worship of God.]
\p
\v 5 . Because David had done that which was right in the eyes of the Lord [so below verse 11 see above chapter 11 on verse 33] and had not turned aside from all that he had commanded him all the days of his life but only in ten matter of Uria the Hethite[understand this exception in respect of very gross sins which are done with full knowledge of that which God hath forbidden without precedent or foregoing inconsiderateness forgetfulness of judgment.]
\p
\v 6 . And there was war between Rebabeam and between Jerobeam all the days of his life [viz. of Rehabeam life of this war there is also mention made above chapter 14.30 the same is here again repeated to shew that Abiam continued the same war as appeareth in the following verse and 2Chronicles 13.3.]
\p
\v 7 . Now the rest of the acts of Abiam and all that he did is that not written in the book of Chronicles of the kings of Judah [see above chapter 14 on verse 19] there was also war between Abiam and between Jerobeam.
\p
\v 8 . And Abiam fell asleep [see above chapter 1 on verse 21 and Deuteronomy 31 on verse 16] with his father and they buried in the city of David [see above chapter 2 on verse 10] and Asa his son reigned in his stead [see 2Chronicles 14.1.]
\p
\v 9 . In the twentieth year of Jerobeam [viz. about the end of this year]the king of Israel Asa became king over Judah.
\p
\v 10 . And he reigned one and forty years at Jerusalem and his mothers name was Maacha [understand of it of his grandmothers name so below verse 13 for she was the mother of Abiam his father above verse 2 thus among the Hebrews not only the immediate parents which a man is properly born but also those that be reckoned up higher in a straight line are called fathers and mothers see the following verse &c.] a daughter of Abisalom [see n verse 2.]
\p
\v 11 . And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord[ see above chapter 11 on verse 33] as did David his father [viz. his grandfather Rehabeams grandfather.]
\p
\v 12 . For he took away the buggerers [see Deuteronomy 23 on verse 17] out of the land [see below 1kings 22.46] and removed all the dung-gods [see Leviticus 26 on verse 30] which his father had made[namely his father had made [namely his father Abiam his grandfather Rehabeam and his great grand father Solomon.]
\p
\v 13 . Yea even his mother Maacha her he also deposed that she should be no queen [see of this word above chapter 11 on verse 19 Heb. from all government and authority which she as widow of king Rehabeam and as mother of his father abeam had taken upon her others he also removed from the queen that is from his wife that he might not be corrupted by her] because she had made an abominable idol [ the Hebrew word signifieth the trembling of joints and fear of heart so this idols is called because he terrified men both in soul and body some think him to have been the idol called by the heathen Priapus others hold him to have been the idol Pan. see of this idol also 2Chronicles 15.16] and burnt him [viz. after he had broken him in pieces and ground him to powder 2chronicles 15.16] and burnt him [ viz. after he had broken him in pieces and ground him to powder 2Chronicles 15.16] by the brook Kidron [see above chapter 2 on verse 37.]
\p
\v 14 . The high places [see Leviticus 26 on verse 30] indeed were not taken away yet the heart of as a was perfect[see above chapter 8 on verse 61 and understand this perfection and uprightness of the king properly in respect of the his affection inclination and zeal in and for the pure worship of God although in ten residue of his life he had several infirmities and imperfections ]with the Lord all his days.
\p
\v 15 . And he brought into the house of the Lord the hallowed things [see Leviticus 5.15] of his father and his own[this word his is here inserted out of 2Chroniclers 15.18] hallowed things silver and vessels and gold.
\p
\v 16 . And there was between Asa and between Baesa the king of Israel all their days [viz. except the first year that they reigned together for Judah was quiet the first ten years under the reign of Asa 2Chronicles 14.1 and Baesa began to reign over Israel in the third year of king Asa below verse 28 or must be said that though perhaps there were in the first years of the king some falling out of both sides yet there was no perfect war between them compare 2Chronicles 14 the annotate on verse 1.]
\p
\v 17 . For Baesa king f Israel went up against Judah and built Rama [a city lying in the tribe of Benjamin about the borders of the kingdom of Israel and on the way to Jerusalem see further of this city Judges 4.5] that he might not suffer any to go out and come into Asa king of Judah [Heb. not to suffer the person going out and the person coming into Asa &c. understand of Benjamin Ephraim Manasseh and other adjacent tribes out of which many when they saw Asa minded the pure worship of God came over to him to serve the Lord at Jerusalem according to his word 2Chroncles 15.9 now to hinder this king Baesa caused his city of Rama to be fortified compare herewith above chapter 12 verse 26,27 &c.]
\p
\v 18 . Then Asa took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasures of the house of the Lord [viz. from the time of Rahabeam see above chapter 14.26 and compare herewith the annotate upon it.] and the treasuers of the kings house and delivered them into the hand of his servant [ see Genesis 20 on verse 8] and the king of Asa sent them to Benhadad the son of Tabrimmon the son of Hezion [some conceive this man to have been the same who above chapter 11 on verse 23 is called Reson] king of Syria that dwelt at Damascus [see Genesis 14 on verse 15] saying:
\p
\v 19 . There is a covenant between me and between thee between my father and between thy father[although Rezon had been an enemy to Israel as long as Solomon had lived above chapter 11.25yet it seemeth by these words that after the division of the Kingdom he was at peace and league of both kings ] behold i send thee a present go thy ways disannul thy ways with Baesa king of Israel that he may depart [Heb. go up] from against me.
\p
\v 20 . And Benhadad hearkened the king Asa and sent the commanders of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel and smote Aon[a city according to the opinion of some lying in the tribe of Aser other places in the tribe of Naphthali see of this city also 2Kings 15.29 & 2 Chronicles 16.4] and Dan [see Genesis 14 on verse 14 and Abel-beth-Maacha [otherwise called Abel Maim 2 Chronicles 16.4] and all the Chinneroth [a country lying in Naphtali about the sea of Genesareth see Joshua 11.2] with all the land of Napthali.
\p
\v 21 . And it came to pass when Baesa heard it that eh ceased from building Rama and he remained at Tirza [ see of this city above chapter 14 on verse17.]
\p
\v 22 . Then the king of Asa called Proclamation to be made throughout all Judah [Heb. caused all Judah to hear] none was free[Heb. innocent guiltness pure that is none might plead any excuse to tarry behind understand any that were come to years of discretion that might be used in this work being not hindered by sickness age absence out of the land or public offices whereof the king commissioners were to judge] that they should carry away the stones of Rama and the wood thereof wherewith Baesa had builded and King Asa built therewith Geba of Benjamin [a city of the tribe of Benjamin lying on the borders of Ephraim upon an hill Joshua 18.24 alloted to the Levites Joshua 21.17 in the days of king Joshua it was in the north borders of the kingdom of Judah 2Kings 23.8] and Mizpa [see of this city Judges 11.11.]
\p
\v 23 . Now the rests of all the acts of Asa and all his might and all that he did and the cities that he built are not they written in the book of Chronicles of the kings of Judah but in the time of the old age [viz. in the three last years of his reign as appeareth by 2Chronicles 16 on verse 12,13] he was diseased [in which disease he sought more to the physician then to God 2Chronicles 16.13]in his feet[which is conceived to have been the Gout.]
\p
\v 24 . And Asa slept with his fathers and buried with his fathers in the city of David [see above chapter 2 on verse 10] his father and Johasaphat his son became king in his stead.
\p
\v 25 . Now Nadab the son of Jerobeam became king over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah and he reigned two years over Israel [understand not two years complete as appeareth by the following 28 and 33 verses.]
\p
\v 26 . And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the lord[ see above chapter 11 on verse 6] and walked in the way of his father [to walk in the way of his ancestors is to follow them either in that which was good that is in their fath and good works 1Samuel 8.3 2kings 22.2 2Chronicles 17.3 or in that which is evil that is in their unbelief and sins as here and below verse 34 and chapter 15 on verse 19 & 22.53] and in his sins [understand the sin of idolatry chapter 14 on verse 16] wherewith he had made Israel to sin.
\p
\v 27 . And Baesa the son of Abia [another man different from Abia the prophet of Silo above chapter 11.29 and from Abia Solomon’s scribe above chapter4.3 and from Abia the priest 1Samuel 14.3&c.] of the house of Issachar [that is of the tribe of Issachar thus its said the house of Ephraim Judges 10.9 the house of Judah Hoseah1.7 the house of Levi Psalms 135.20&c.] made a conspiracy against him [the Hebrew word rendered here conspiracy signifieth properly to bind to tie therefore when its used of the mind of men its taken sometimes in a good sense for a confederacy Genesis 44.30 but very frequently for a combination of enemies against persons or state as here and 1Samuel 22 on verse 8 and below chapter 16verse 9,20 & 2Kings 10.9 & 12.20 Nehemiah 4.8 Amos 7.10] and Baesa smote him at Gibbethon which is the Philistines city when Nedab and all the Israel besieged Gibbethon [a city lying in the tribe of Dan Joshua 19.44 alloted to the Levites a place of habitation Joshua 21.23 but subdued and inhabited by the Philistines and therefore now besieged therefore was afterwards reassumed by the Israelites see below chapter 16,17.]
\p
\v 28 . And Baesa slew him in the third year of Asa king of Judah and became king in his stead .
\p
\v 29 . Now it came to pass when he reigned that he smote all the house [that is family see above chapter 14 on verse 10] of Jerobeam he left nothing of Jerobeam that had breathe [Heb. he left not all every breath of Jerobeam that is he let no man of Jerobeam’s family remain so the word breathe is taken for man Deuteronomy 20.16 Joshua 10.40 &11.14] until he had destroyed him [viz. Jerobeam or until he had destroyed to wit the house that is the family of Jerubeam ] according to the word of the Lord which he had spoken by the ministry of his servant Abia the Solonite [this is not to be applied to the intent and purpose of Baesa as if in destroying Jerobeam but the meaning is that God by the cruel tyranny of Baesa fulfilled the word of the prophecies and punished the sins of Jerobeam so below chapter 16 on verse 13.]
\p
\v 30 . For the sins of Jerobeam who sinned and who made Israel to sin [so above chapter 14 verse 16 see the annotate ] and for the provocation whereby he had provoked the Lord God of Israel.
\p
\v 31 . Now the rest of the acts of Nadab and all that he did is that not written in the book of Chronicles of the kings of Israel?[see above chapter 14 on verse 19.]
\p
\v 32 . And there was war between Asa and between Baesa the king of Israel all their days .
\p
\v 33 . In the third year of Asa king of Judah Baesa the son of Abia became king over all Israel at Tirba and reigned [this is here inserted out of the full entire phrase which we have 2Samuel 2.10 item above here verse 9.10,25 below chapter 16.8&c. and here the word reigning signifieth how long a king reigned lasted when it is used of the beginning of the king reign then we translate it became king] four and twenty years.
\p
\v 34 . And did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord [see above chapter 11 on verse 6] and walked in the way of Jerobeam and in his sin wherewith he had made Israel to sin [see above on verse 6.]
\c 16
\s The prophet Jebu prophesieth against Baesa verse 1 &c. his see his son Ela suceedeth him8 Zimri slayeth him and becometh king 9being besieged by Omri burieth himself 15 Omri prevaileth against Tibni becometh king 21 he buildeth samaria 24 followeth the sins of Jerobeam 25 and dieth 28 Achab his son suceedeth in his room 29 he is more wicked and his pre cessors 30 Hiel buildeth Jericho, 34.
\p
\v 1 Then the word of the Lord came to Jebu [of this prophet we read also 2Chronicles 19.2 and 20.34 and he is to be distinguished from Jebu that was king of Israel below chapter 19.16 and from others that have likewise had this name 1Chronicles 2.38 &12.3] the son of Hanani[who is likewise to be distinguished from others that have had the same name 1Chronicles 25.4 Ezra 10.20] against Baesa saying.
\p
\v 2 . For as much as I exhalted thee out of the dust [that is out of a very low and mean estate compare 1Samuel 2.8 Psalms 113.7 the word dust is often taken for lowness contempt impotency grief nothingness Psalms 7.6 and 119.25 Job 16.15 Isaiah 26.5 Lamentations 3.6]and made thee a ladder over my people Israel and thou hast walked in the way of Jerobeam [see above chapter 15 on verse 16 provoking me to anger by their sin.
\p
\v 3 . Behold I will remove the posterity of Baesa and the posterity of his house [that is family so in the sequel see above chapter 14on verse 10 others I will cause to burn after Baesa and after his house ] and I will make thine house as the house of Jerubeam the son of Nehat [see chapter 15.29.]
\p
\v 4 . Him that dieth of Baesa in the city shall the dogs eat and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the heaven eat [see above chapter 14 on verse 11.]
\p
\v 5 . Now the rest of the acts of Baesa and that which he aid and his might are they not written in the book of Chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\p
\v 6 . And Baesa fell asleep with his father and was buried at Tirza[see of this city above chapter 14.17] and Elia his son reigned in his stead.
\p
\v 7 . Thus also the word of the Lord came into the ministry [Heb. the hand so below verse 12 see Leviticus 8 on verse 36]of the prophet Jebu the son of Hanani against Baesa and against his house [the meaning is that as the meaning of the word of the Lord came by the prophet Abia against Jerobeam above chapter 14.7so also the same to the prophet Jebu against Baesa and that both prophecies each in their due time were fulfilled] and that for all the evil which he had done in the rise of the Lord [so below verse 19.25 and 30 see Genesis 38 on verse 7 and above chapter 16.6]provoking him to anger by the work of his hand [which was especially two folds first idolatry wherein he had been like unto Jerobeam secondly blood guiltiness and tyranny committed against his house as the following words of this verse do shew compare Hosiah 1on verse 5]because he was like just the house of Jerobeam and because he had smitten the same [to wit Jerobeams house see above chapter 15.29.]
\p
\v 8 . In the six and twentieth year of Asa king of Judah Elia the son of Baesa became king over Israel at Tirza and reigned two years [understand not two years complete but unto the second year for in the six and twentieth year of king Asa eh became king as is said in this verse and in the seven and twentieth he was slain below verse 10it is custom for the scripture to use an even number for an odd one or a perfect number for an imperfect one see Genesis 15 verse 25 and 33 and chapter 16.8.]
\p
\v 9 . And his servant Zimri the commander of the charets made a conspiracy against him when he was at Tirza drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza the steward[Heb. who was over the house to wit of the king understand thereby the whole court now he that is placed over it we call him the Stewart compare above chapter 4 on verse 6and the annotate upon it] at Tirza.
\p
\v 10 . Then Zimri came in and smote and killed him in the seven and twentieth year of king of Judah see above on verse 8] and he became king in his stead[to wit for the time of seven days so below verse 15.]
\p
\v 11 . and it came to pass when he reigned when he sat upon his throne to sit upon the throne is to govern as king which word doth also here go before for explanation sake as above chapter 1 on verse 13 see likewise the annotate there ] that he smote all the house of Baesa he left him not anyone that pisseth against the wall [see above chapter 14 on verse 10]neither his kinsfolks [Heb. deliverers to whom it lawfully appertainly to execute vengeance on the slayer which were the next of kin or blood Numbers 35.12]nor his friends [that is his beloved friends and acquaintance though there were no kin at all to him.]
\p
\v 12 . Thus did Zimri destroy all the houses of Baesa according to the word of the Lord which he had spoken over Baesa by the ministry of prophet Jehu.
\p
\v 13 . For all the sins of Baesa and the sins of Ela his son wherewith they had sinned and wherewith they had made Israel sin [at which God looked who thus executed his right vengeance and not Zimri who followed his unrighteous wilfulness above verse 7compare also above chapter 15 on verse 29]provoking the Lord the God of Israel by their vanities [that is idols which are nothing in the world 1Corinthians 8.4 and chapter 10.19 see Leviticus 19 on verse 4.]
\p
\v 14 .Now the rest of the acts of Ela and all the he did is that not written in the book of Chronicles of the kings of Israel? [see above chapter 14 on verse 19.]
\p
\v 15 . In the seven twentieth year Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days at Tirza and the people had camped themselves at Gibbethon [above chapter 15 on verse 27] which is the Philistine city.
\p
\v 16 . Now the people that had camped themselves [namely before Gibbethon]heard say Zimri had made a conspiracy [see above chapter 15 on verse 27]yea hath also smitten the king therefore all Israel made Zimri [the father of Achab which whom is joined in the matter of false worship vain superstition and evil work Micah 6.16 and in respect is said to have been worse than all the kings that have been before him below verse 25]the commander in chief king of Israel that day in the camp.
\p
\v 17 . And Omri matched up and all Israel with him for Gibbothon and besieged Tirza.
\p
\v 18 . And it came to pass when Zimri saw the city was taken that he went into the place of the kings house and burnt the kings house upon with fire [that s burnt the kings house wherein he was together with himself a like phrase is Judges 12.1]and died.
\p
\v 19 . For his sins which he had sinned doing that which is evil in the eyes of the Lord [see above chapter 11 on verse ]walking in the way of Jerobeam [that is following the sins of Jerobeam see above chapter 15 on verse 26]and his sins which he had done making Israel to sin [see above chapter 14.16.]
\p
\v 20 . Now the rest of the acts of Zimri and his conspiracy [see above chapter 15 on verse 27]which he made [Heb. bound] are they not he in the book of Chronicles the kings of Israel ?[hence it apeareth that this book is not to be meant of the two books of Chronicles which follow in the bible after the two books of kings as is noted above chapter 14 on verse 19foras much as in this Chronicles here is not extent that which is related here and below verse 27.]
\p
\v 21 . Then the people of Israel were divided into two halves [Heb. into the half ]half of the people following Tibini so in the sequel see above chapter 1 on verse 7]the son of Ginath to make him king and half followed Omri.
\p
\v 22 .But the people that followed Omri was stronger then the people that followed Tibni teh son and Tibni died and Omri reigned.
\p
\v 23 .In the one and thirtieth year of Asa king of Judah Omri became king over Israel and reigned twelve years [then ten years that reigned Tibni being under comprehended beginning from the seven and twentieth year of Asa reign ] he reigned six years at Tirza.
\p
\v 24 . And he bought the mountain Samaria [Heb. Schameron which is mountain lying in the tribe of Ephraim about the borders of the tribe of Mannasseh for which the city of Samaria built thereon and all the country round about obtained its name compare above chapter 13 the annotate on verse 32.]of Semer for two talents of silver [see of the weight of a talent Exodus 35 on verse 39] and build upon the mountain and called the name of the mountain which he built after the name of Semer [distinguished others that had this name 1Chronicles 6.46nad 7.34] the lord or owner of the mountain Samaria [a city built upon the aforesaid mountain in which the kings of Israel after they had left Tirza kept their court and dwelling above two hundred year years before Salmansa took this city and destroyed the kingdom of Israel and carried away the ten tribes captive in Assyria 2Kings 17.5&c.]
\p
\v 25 . And Omri did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord yea he did worse than all that had been before him.
\p
\v 26 . And he walked in all ways of Jerobeam the son of Nebat and his sins wherewith he had made Israel to sin provoking the Lord the God of Israel to anger by their vanities [see above verse 13.]
\p
\v 27 .Now the rest of the acts of Omri what he did and what his power which he exercised [Heb. did otherwise whereby he did it] are they not written in the book of Chronicles of the kings of Israel? [see above on verse 20.]
\p
\v 28 . And Omri fell asleep with his father and was buried at Samaria and Achab his son reigned in his stead.
\p
\v 29 . And Achab the son of Omri became king over Israel in the eighteenth and thirtieth year of Asa the king and Achab the son of Omri reigned over Israel at Samaria two and twenty years [to wit not complete for the first year he reigned jointly with his father the last with his son see above on verse 8.]
\p
\v 30 . And Achab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord more than that had been before him.
\p
\v 31 . and it came to pass was it a light thing that he walked in the sins of Jerobeam the son of Nebat? [that is was it a small and mean sin that he followed the idolatry and abomination of Jerobeam? understand no in no wise but it was as if holy ghost should say an abominable departing from the true God for this kind of questioning inferreth a very strong denial see Genesis 18 on verse 17] that he took yet to wise Izebel the daughter of Eth-Baal king of Zidonians and went and served Baal [see Judges 2 o verse 11] and bowed himself before him.
\p
\v 32 . And he reared up an altar of Baal in the house of Baal [that is in the temple of Baal so 1Samuel 5.2 and 31 verse 9,10above chapter 12,31 2Kings 10.21] which he had built at Samaria.
\p
\v 33 . Achab also made a groove [to wit in honour of the idol Baal see Deuteronomy 7 on verse 5] so that Achab did yet more [Heb. added or adjoined to do see Genesis 8 on verse 10] to provoke the Lord the God of Israel to anger then all the kings of Israel that had been before him.
\p
\v 34 . In his days did Hael the Bethilile built Jericho he laid thefoundation thereof of Abiram his first born son and set up the gates thereof in Seguh his youngest son according to the word of the Lord which he had spoken of the ministry [Heb. the hand compare Leviticus 8.36 and the annotate ]of Joshua the son of Nun [the meaning is that he began the building with the loss of his first born and finished it with the loss of his youngest son whereby the curse denounced above a thousand years before against the rebuilding of the city was fulfilled Joshua 6.26.]
\c 17
\s Elia foretelleth Achab the great drought verse 1&c. is sent by God to the brook crith 2 there he is fed by the ravens 5 it sent to Zarphath to a widow 8 who feedeth him with meal and oil of which there is no want 11 Elia raiseth the widows son 17 she acknowledged him to be a prophet,24.
\p
\v 1 And Elia the Tisbite of the inhabitants of Gilead [a land lying beyond Jordan see Genesis 31 on verse 21 some understand a part of that land which lay east-ward which the Reubenites Gadites and the half tribe of Manasseh the half Sauls time had taken from the Hagarens and after he had planted it with new inhabitants of their own people 1Chronicles 5.20,21,22 who from this new plantation got the name of Tesbites for Toschab with the Hebrews signifieth an inhabitant ] said unto Achab as true as the Lord the God of Israel liveth before whose face I stand [ [that is whom I serve see Deuteronomy 10 on verse 8]if there shall be a dew or rain these years [understand the ensuing years in the number three and six months Luke 4.25and James 5.17]but according to my word[that is but as I shall publish it having received charge and command for it from the Lord or as I shall be my prayer obtained dew and rain from the Lord this is a kind of oath of which see Genesis 8.23 and below verse 12.]
\p
\v 2 . After that the word of the Lord came unto him saying:
\p
\v 3 . Depart from hence turn thee towards the east and hide thyself towards the brook Crith [which taking its original from mount Ephraim falleth into Jordan ] which is before the Jordan.
\p
\v 4 . And it shall to pass that thou shalt drink from the brook and I have commanded the ravens to sustain thee from thence [that is determined myself so to use them by my providential dispose that they shall bring food unto thee to command signifieth here to purpose intend upon which the execution followeth so verse 9.3,4that God used the ministry of these creatures to feed the prophet maketh his miracle to be so much the more admired for as much as his fowl is so greedy and so bent for its own self that they forsake their young ones which should perish and die of hunger if God did not in a wonderful manner feed and sustain them Job 39.3 Psalms 147.9]
\p
\v 5 . He then went and did according to the word of the Lord for he went and dwelt by the brook Crith which is before the Jordan.
\p
\v 6 . And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning likewise bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook.
\p
\v 7 . And it came to pass at the end of many days [Heb. from the end of the days that is after the end of many days so Genesis 4.3 Numbers 9.22 see the annotate there now these many days seems to have been six months and that by compare the verse of the 18chapter so that Elia should have been six months by the brook Crith and three years with the widow of Zerepta] that the brook dried up for there had been no rain in the land.
\p
\v 8 . Then the word of the lord came to him [namely to the prophet Elia ]saying:
\p
\v 9 . Get thee up go to Zerphath [otherwise called Zerepta Luke 4.26 a city lying in the tribe of Asa between Tyre and Zidon of which see also Obad verse 20]which is by Zidon and dwelt there and hold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee [that is determined to raise up and to use a widow woman to provide meat for thee compare above the annotate on verse 4.]
\p
\v 10 . Then he got him up and went to Zerphath now when he came to the gate of the city behold then there was a widow woman gathering wood and he called to her and said fetch me I pray a little water in this vessel [Heb. taking &c. that is fetch some water to give me afterwards see Genesis 12 on verse 15] that I may drink.
\p
\v 11 . Now when she went to fetch it then he called to her and said fetch me also I pray a morsel of bread unto your hand [Heb. take me a morsel &c. that is fetch it and bring it me.]
\p
\v 12 . But she said as true as the Lord thy God liveth if I have a cake [the word signifieth properly a loaf of bread or cake baked under or upon the coals and not in oven see Genesis 18 on verse 6 the meaning is that she had no baked bread in her house to serve her need even not as much as little bread baked with coal on the hot earth]serve only a handful of meal in the pitcher and a little oil in the bottle and behold I had gathered a couple of sticks and as we say one or two ] and I go and I will dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die [as if she had said when this shall be eaten up we have no more in store so that we have nothing else to expect but die of hunger.]
\p
\v 13 . And Elia said unto her fear not go do according to thy word but first make me a little cake thereof and bring it forth hither to me but after that thou shalt make somewhat for thee for thy son.
\p
\v 14 . For thus saith the Lord ten God of Israel the meal of the pitcher shall not be wasted neither shall the oil of the bottle fall until the day the Lord shall give the rain upon the earth [Heb. the pitcher of the meal &c. and the bottle of oil &c. the meaning is that this should surely come to pass if the woman believed the promise of God and did that which was here enjoined her.]
\p
\v 15 . And she went and did according to the word of Elia [the obedience of this work proceeded out of the sure assent of her faith whereby she embraced the foresaid promise ]so she did eat he and her house[that is household see Genesis 7 on verse1] man days [some think of the time of three years compare the annotate above on verse 7 and below on chapter 18 on verse 1.]
\p
\v 16 . The meal of the pitcher was not consumed and the oil of the bottle failed not according to the word of the Lord which he had spoken by the ministry [Heb. hand] of Elia.
\p
\v 17 . And it came to pass after these things that the son of these woman the hostess of the house fell sick and the sickness grew very strong until no breath was left on him [that is until he had given up the ghost and he was dead indeed for the Hebrew Nesama is often taken for the soul or ghost of a man which is distinguished from the body and by death departed out of it as Genesis 2.7 Job 27.3 &c.]
\p
\v 18 . And she said unto Elia what have I to do with thee thou man of God?[see above chapter 13 on verse 1] and thou come in unto me [others thou art come in unto me &c. but these words are for the most part translated by way of question or demand ]to bring mine iniquity in remembrance and to kill my son?[to bring mine iniquity in remembrance to wit with the Lord and consequently to provoke him to anger against me Heb. what is me and thee &c. see of this phrase 2Samuel 16 on verse 10 if she had said I have willingly attained thee in my house expecting by means of the Gods blessing upon me and mine but now by the decease of thy son I perceive that Gods judgment is fallen upon me because thou hast perhaps discern some falling in me and hast prayed unto God against me which if it be so I have entertained thee in mine own mischief.]
\p
\v 19 . And he said unto her give me thy son and took him from out of the lap and carried him up into the upper room where he himself dwelt and he laid him down upon his own bed.
\p
\v 20 . And he called upon the Lord and said O Lord my God hast thou dwell so ill with this widow [viz. as thou dost deal with many others that perish through hunger and thirst] with whom I lodge that thou hast slain her son?[he speaketh thus not to control God for visiting this widow but to lament that he feared that for Gods name might come to be blasphemed and his worshiped despised because he had promised that Gods blessing should light upon his house .]
\p
\v 21 . And he measured himself upon the child three time [that is he stretched himself out upon the child three times see the like examples 2kings 4.34 Acts 20.10] and called upon the Lord and said O Lord my God I pray thee let this child’s soul come unto him [Heb. into his middle or inner most part so in the following verse others into his body] again an excellent proof shewing that the soul of man is distinct being from the body departing out of it by death and by the resurrection into it again see Genesis 35 on verse 18.]
\p
\v 22 . And the Lord heard the voice of Elia and the voice of the child came unto him again [Heb. into his most part ]that it revived.
\p
\v 23 . And Elia took the child and brought it down from the upper room into the house and gave it to his mother and Elia said see thy son liveth.
\p
\v 24 . Then said that woman unto Elia now I know this that thou art a man of God and that the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth.
\c 18
\s Elia is sent untoAchabverse1 &c. he meeteth Obadjah chargeth him to certify the king of his coming 8 speaketh to Achab 17 and then to the congregation and to the prophets of Baal 21 these stand ashamed 26 the Lord discovereth himself by a token to Elias offering 30 the prophets of Baal are slain 40 rain is obtained by Elias prayer 41.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after many days [to wit three years and six months Luke 4.25 and James 5.17that the word of the Lord came unto Elia in the third year[to wit after he was lodged at the widow Sarepts house see on verse 7 of the former chapter saying go thy ways shew thyself unto Achab [to promise him rain from me and to charge him to gather Baal priest together upon mount camel see below verse 19and the sequel]for I will give rain upon the earth.
\p
\v 2 . And Elia went to shew himself unto Achab and the famine was strong in Samaria [understand this not only of the city of Samaria but of all kingdom of Israel.]
\p
\v 3 . And Achab had called Abadja who is to be distinguished from others that had this name 1Chronicles 27.19 and 2Chronicles 34.12 and from the prophet Abadja Obadea verse1 unless he were the same as some conceive he was] the steward [Heb. who was over his house that is his steward see above chapter 4.6 and 16.9] and Abadja feared the Lord greatly.
\p
\v 4 . For it came to pass when Izebel destroyed the prophets of the lord that Abadja took an hundred prophets and his them by fifty men in one cave [Heb. hid them fifty men in one cave to wit and fifty in another that is by with every time fifty together and sustained them with bread and water [that is with meat and drink see above chapter 13 on verse 8.]
\p
\v 5 . And Achab had said unto Abadja pass throughout the land unto all fountains of water and unto all river peradventure they shall find grass[the Hebrew word signifieth all kind of herb that serveth for food to beast growing in unmanured places and mowed down with these they and made up with the hay compare Job 8.12and 40.10 Psalms 104.14 and 129.6 and 147.8] that we may serve the horses and mules alive and destroy nothing of the beast [viz. by leaving them through neglect and carelessness unprovided of fodder.]
\p
\v 6 . And they divided the land among themselves to pass it through Achab went one way by himself and Obaja went one way by himself.
\p
\v 7 . Now when Obadja was upon the way he met Elia [Heb. was in his meeting] and knew him so he fell on his face [viz. to shew him civil respect according to the custom of the country see Genesis 18 on verse 2] and said art thou my lord Elia.
\p
\v 8 . He said I am go tell thy lord behold Elia is here.
\p
\v 9 . But he said what have I sinned that thou deliverest thy servant into the hand of Achab to slay me?[intimating that Elias joining that which is mentioned in the former verse seemeth to hear no good will unto him as if he had offended him for he could not well perform that command without greatly endangering his life before Achab the reason hereof he sheweth below verse 12.]
\p
\v 10 . As true as the Lord liveth if there a people or kingdom wither my Lord hath not sent to seek thee [add with all the judgement which in the oath of the Hebrew hath concealed as god this or that unto me &c. see Genesis 14 on verse 23]and when they said he is not here then they took an oath of that kingdom and of that people that they had not found thee [Achab had not only sent forth men in search after Elia his own country but likewise desired his own neighbours kingdoms and nations in amity with him to do the like with their jurisdiction of whom when they reported afterwards that they could not find him they desired to confirm the truth of their assertion by oath.]
\p
\v 11 . And now thou sayest go tell thy Lord behold Elia is here.
\p
\v 12 . And it may come to pass when it should be gone from thee that the spirit of the Lord may take thee away wither I know not [that this might be done and sometimes hath been done may be gathered from 2Kings 2.16 Acts 8.39 understand this of the holy ghost who could do this by his divine power or by means according to his good pleasure ]and I should come to tell that unto Achab [viz. that thou present here and ready to speak with him and he should not find thee and he should put him to death [viz. as one that hath causened and abused him with lies ] now I thy servant [that is I that I am bent and ready to do thy service so in the following verse compare above chapter 1 the annotate on verse 51 verse ] fear the lord from my mouth.
\p
\v 13 . Was it told my Lord what I did when Israel slew the prophet of the Lord ? that I hid an hundred men of the Lords prophet every time fifty men in one cave [Heb. one fifty one fifty men that is fifty in one cave and fifty in another or every time fifty in one cave see genesis 7 on verse 2] and sustained them with bread and water.
\p
\v 14 . And now sayeth thou go tell thy Lord behold Elia is here and he will kill me.
\p
\v 15 . And Elia said as true as the Lord of hosts [understand here by all host all creatures heavenly and earthly visible and unvisible reasonable and unreasonable living and liveless the reason for which they are called hosts or armies see Genesis 2 on verse 1God is sovereign lord of all these not only because he created them all and still preserveth them so that they properly belong to them but also because he so governeth them that they stand in great number and multitude ready prest for his service to execute his most holy will and this name viz. Lord of hosts is often attributed to God in scripture as 1samuel 1.3 &4.4 2Samuel 5.10 Psalms 24.10 Isaiah 1.9&c.]liveth before whose face I stand [so above chapter 17.1see Deuteronomy 10 on verse 8] I will shew myself unto him today[that is so true it is that I will today appear before Achab as it is true that the Lord liveth.]
\p
\v 16 .Then Abadja went to meet Achab and told him [viz. that Elia was come and was desirous to appear before him ]Achab went to meet Elia[not to entertain him with friendly and courteous behaviour but with scornful and revealing terms and accuse him to be the cause of the long continuing drought.]
\p
\v 17 . And it came to pass when Achab saw Elia that Achab said unto him art thou that trouble of Israel?[the Hebrew word rendered trouble here signifieth properly by words and deeds to raise trouble vexation disquietness conjoined with care and unsettledness of heart and mind compare Genesis 34.30 Joshua 7.25 Judges 11.35 Proverbs 15.27for this is Elia accused by Elia not only he was accused by Achab not only because he was utterly against idolatry but also because he thought him to be the cause of drought and of the famine wherewith the land had now been for a long time plagued.]
\p
\v 18 . Then he said he I have not troubled Israel but thou and thy fathers house in that ye have forsaken the commandments of ten Lord and hath followed Baalim [see above chapter 16 on verse 31.]
\p
\v 19 . Now then send [ to the end that thou mayst be rid of this drought for in that command this promise is contained that God would deliver the land from the Judgment if he did obey this command ]gather unto me all Israel upon mount Camel ]lying in the tribe of Issachar by the midland of the sea Joshua 19.26Jeremiah 46.18 this mount was exceeding high Amos 9.3 well grown or planted with trees vineyards and sweet smelling herbs in brief exceeding fruitful Isaiah 35.2upon the mount did prophet Elizeus also keep his abode 2Kings 4.25and it is to be distinguished from mount carmel lying in the tribe of Judah in the wilderness of moan where Nabal dwelt 1Samuel 25.2 ]and the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal of the groove[to wit the idolatrous grove see above chapter 16.33 of such grove see exodus 34.13 and Deuteronomy 7.5with the annotate others grove gods or tree god]which eat of Izebels table [or at her table.]
\p
\v 20 .So Achab sent among all children of Israel and gathered the prophets together upon mount carmel.
\p
\v 21 .Then Elia drew unto all people and said how long halt ye open two thoughts? [others leaping upon two boughs for the Hebrew word signifieth also a bough as Isaiah 17.6 but its taken for thoughts John 4.13 and 20.2]if the lord be God [that is only and true God to whom alone religious honour is due ]follow him and if it be Baal follow him [he accuseth them of two things first that they serve God and Baal together secondly that they were not fully resolved which of the twain to cleave unto alone seeing they ought to have alone that there is but one God see Joshua 21.15]but the people answered him not a word.
\p
\v 22 . Then said Elia unto people I am only left a prophet of the Lord [viz. who maintain and defend the truth of doctrine the purity of religion in Israel the rest of the prophets being either dead or murdered or driven away or hid in caves ]and the prophet of Baal are four hundred and fifty men [its conceived that among these its not comprised any of the four hundred prophets of the idolatrous grove which Elias likewise caused to be summoned into the assembly above verse 19but that Izebel kept back and commanded them not to appear which is which may be gathered from that which is related below chapter 22 of the annotate there.]
\p
\v 23 . Let them give us two bullocks for themselves and divide him into pieces and lay him on the wood and put no fire to it and I will dress the other bullock and lay [Heb. properly give.]him on the wood and put no fire to it.
\p
\v 24 . After that call ye on the name of your God and I will call on the name of God and the god shall answer by fire [understand by sending fire from heaven to kindle and consume the sacrifice to evidence which is the true God and the true doctrine and the true worship of God ]he shall be God[as above on verse 21]and all the people answered and said that word [or that thing is good.
\p
\v 25 . And Elia said unto the prophets of Baal chose ye for yourself and dress him for yourself one bullock and dress ye him first for ye are many and call ye on the name of your God and put no fire to it.
\p
\v 26 . And they took the bullock which he had given unto them[that is which Elias immediately before had permitted them to chose see above verse 23] and dressed him and called noon the name of Baal from morning till noon saying O Baal answer us but there was no voice nor answer and they leaped against [or upon over] the altar which they had made[understand this of the altar which Elia had made which out of meer malice they sought to overturn with their skipping and leaping against it feigning themselves to be acted hereunto by the zeal of the prophetical spirit see below verse 29 and 30.]
\p
\v 27 . And it came to pass at noon that Elia mocked them and said cry with a loud voice for he is a God and he is a study [that is because he had somewhat to think and meditate upon with this senses or because he is busied with speaking somewhat with the mouth as thinking somewhat with their heart ]or because he hath somewhat to do[others hath a pursuit that is whereby he issued to be others or himself sueth and persueth others as man and beasts [or because he hath a journey peradventure he sleepeth and will awaken [to wit if ye cry loud enough.]
\p
\v 28 . And they cried with a loud voice and they cut themselves with knives and with lancers after their manner until they poured out blood upon themselves [others until they were poured all over with blood wherein they did imitate the vain heathen Deuteronomy 14.1as those who out of a shew holiness whip themselves till they shed their own blood as followers of both.]
\p
\v 29 . Now it came to pass when noon was past that they prophesied [that is so behaved themselves in countenance and gesture as if by the spirit of the prophecies they had been in trance see 1Samuel 18.10] until the meat offering was to be offered [which was done in Jerusalem about the latter part of the day or as the scripture speaketh between the two eating’s see exodus 29.41 Acts 3.1 so there was also daily a meat offering offered in the morning Exodus 29.39 2Kings 3.10]but there was no voice nor any answer nor any breed taking.
\p
\v 30 . Then said Elia unto all people draw near unto me and all people drew near unto him and he healed the altar of the Lord that was broken down [viz. which he had formerly made and Baal’s prophets had broken with their leaping see above verse 26.]
\p
\v 31 . And Elia took twelve stones [he would shew by this act that the twelve tribes not withstanding their rent in matters of state yet ought to be nit and united together in religion to perform with one accord due and the same service and honour to God according to his word by avoiding all manner of idolatry and vain superstition ]according to the number of tribes of children of Jacob unto whom the word of the Lord came saying Israel shall be thy name [see Joshua 4.5,20 Genesis 32.28&2 Kings 17.34.]
\p
\v 32 .And with those stones he built the altar this was an extraordinary work proceeding from a special and peculiar command of God and their fore to be expected from the common rule Leviticus 17.3 Deuteronomy 12 verse 13,14] in the name of the Lord [that is by the charge and command from God and from his honour see below verse 36]after that he made a trench [or water course ]about the altar according to the wideness of the two measures [see of this measure Genesis 18 on verse 6] of seed that is according to the wideness or capacity some conceive that the trench was as wide as a sack which two measures of seed or into which two measured of seed could enter others understand of the wideness of the trench but of the space that was between the trench and the altar comprehending so much place as might be sown into two measures of seed.]
\p
\v 33 . And he put the wood in order and divided the bullock in pieces and laid him on the wood.
\p
\v 34 . And he said fill four pitchers [or pails ]with water[the prophet would use this water and that in great abundance to take away all suspicion and to make the miracle that should be done to appear the plainer]and pour it upon the burnt offering and upon the wood and he said do it the second time and they did it the second time moreover he said do it the third time and they did it the third time.
\p
\v 35 . So that the water ran round about the altar besides he filled also the trench [of which is spoken above verse 32] with water.
\p
\v 36 . Now it came to pass when they offered meat offering[see above on verse 29]that Elia the prophet drew water [viz. to the altar ]and said Lord God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Israel [this name of God was to put the Israelites in mind that they and the Jews had not only the same descent after the flesh which should stir them up of unity but likewise ought to persevere in the fellowship of the holy doctrine and worship of God received by means of these holy fathers from God compare Genesis 26 on the annotate on verse 24see also Exodus 3.6Matthew 22.32 Mark12.26Luke 20.37 Acts 7.33]Let it God in Israel and that i am thy servant and that I have done all these things [understand not only that which was done by him but also which that yet afterwards should be done ]according to thy word.
\p
\v 37 .Answer me O Lord answer me [that is hear me and make it appear by a visible token that thou hast heard me causing fire to fall from heaven to consume my sacrifice as I gave this token to the people according to thy command above verse 24]that this people may know that thou O LORD art thou God and that thou hast turned their heart about [viz. from the idolatry wherein they lie drowned for one of the end of his prayers was that those from among the people should be converted should ascribe the convection of their glory unto God.]
\p
\v 38 . Then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed that burnt offering [see the like examples Leviticus 9.24 Judges 6.21 2Chronicles 7.1]and that wood and those stones and that dust yea licked up that water which was on the trench.
\p
\v 39 . Now when all the people saw that now they fell on their faces [in token that they knew God to be a true a true God and accordingly called upon him as in the following words is manifested see Genesis 24on verse 6]and said the Lord is God the Lord is God [see above on verse 24.]
\p
\v 40 . And Elia said unto them lay hold on the prophets of Baal none of them escape and they lay hold of them and Elia brought them down to the brook Kison [see of this book Judges 4.7]and slew them [cut their throats that is killed them with the sword below chapter 19.1 this was also comprised in the command of God of which Elia maketh mention above verse 36for he did nothing herein by his own proper motion but by the word and command of God to him and by the conduct of his spirit so as that this act is altogether as particular and may not be abused by imitation see the like act in Samuel 1Samuel 15.33]there.
\p
\v 41 .After that Elia said unto Achab go up eat and drink for there is a sound of an over flowing rain[Heb. a voice of noise or abundance of rain.]
\p
\v 42 . So Achab went up to eat and to drink but Elia went up to the top of carmel and spread himself abroad towards the earth after that he put his face between his knees [with his behaviour of his body making servants prayer unto God and beseeching him for rain although he was fully assured by the promise of God that rain would come.]
\p
\v 43 . And he said unto his lad go up now and look towards the sea [Heb. the way of the sea ]then he went up and looked out and said there is nothing then said he go again seven times.
\p
\v 44 . And it came to past the seventh time that he said behold there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea like a mans hand and he said go up say unto Achab make ready and come down that the rain stop thee not [or shout thee not in that is so surprise and hinder thee thou canst not get home.]
\p
\v 45 . And it came to pass in the mean while that the heavens grew black with the clouds and wind [Heb. hither to hither to &c. that is in the interim and while Achab made himself ready to go home or that is here and there or every where the heaven grew black] and there came [Heb. was or grew ]a great rain rode away and went to Jezel [a city lying in the border of the tribes of Manasseh and Issachar Joshua 19.18and to be distinguished from the city of this name lying in the tribe of Judah Joshua 15.18.]
\p
\v 46 . And the hand of the Lord was on Elia and he girded up his loins [vi. to go the readier because they wore long garments so 2Kings 4.29&9.1]and they ran before the face of Achab till where they came to Jizrel [Heb. till thou &c. that is the Lord gave him an extraordinary strength that with running he would outgo Achab charets and come to Jezrel before him.]
\c 19
\s Elia fleeth from Izebel verse 1 &c. is fed and sustained by an angel 5 fasting forty days and forty nights he cometh to the mount Horeb 8 where complaining to God is his distress is strengthened by him by means of a revelation 9 he receiveth command from God to anoint Hazael and Jebu to be kings and Elisa to be prophet 15 whereunto God also added comfort 17 Elisa is called.
\p
\v 1 And Achab told Izebel all that Elia had done and all that he had slain [understand the whole translation which he had, had with the prophets of Baal to shew that the Lord was teh only true God and to punish those prophets with deathin his name.]to wit all the prophets with the swords [that is the four hundred and fifty man which are called prophets above chapter 18.19and 22 and not the four hundred prophets of the idolatrous grove see the annotations above chapter 18 on verse 22 and compare below chapter 22.6.]
\p
\v 2 . Then Izebel sent a message unto Elia to say let the Gods do so to me and let them add so thereunto [see of this phrase Ruth 1 on verse 17] assuredly I will tomorrow about this time make thy soul [that is life and so in the sequel see Genesis 19 on verse 17]as the soul of one of them.
\p
\v 3 . When he saw that he gat him up and went for his life [Heb. soul others according to the soul that is according to his mind or opinion] and came to Barseba [see of this city Genesis 21.31] which is in Judah[Heb. which is of Judah that is which lieth among the tribe of Judah properly pertaining to Simeon]and left his lad there.
\p
\v 4 . but he himself went into the wilderness a days journey and came and sat under a juniper tree[others bramble bush see likewise of this bush John 30.4 & Psalms 120.4] and prayed that his soul might die [that is that his person or that he himself might die[that is that his person or himself might so Numbers 23.10 Judges 16.30 compare Genesis 12the annotate on verse 5others prayed for himself or by himself or in his mind that he might die ]and said it is enough [to wit lived and suffered Heb. much which word is so taken Deuteronomy 2.3 & 3.26 ] Lord now take away my soul [that is let me live no longer separating my soul from this body that it may dwell with thee so Jonah 4.3 compare Genesis 35 the annotate on verse 18] for I am no better than my father [understand to live longer than they have lived.]
\p
\v 5 . And he laid himself down and slept under Juniper tree and behold an angel touched him and said unto him arise eat.
\p
\v 6 . And he looked down and behold there was a cake baked on the coal [Heb. a cake of coals that is a cake baked or roasted on coals]and a bottle with water at his head end so he did eat and drink and laid himself again[Heb. and he turned again and led himself down that is he laid himself down again see Numbers 1 on verse 4.]
\p
\v 7 . And the angel of the Lord came to him again the second time arise eat for the way will be too much for thee [or the journey will be too great for thee to wit to go it by thy own strength of that meat forty days and forty nights [understand by the strength that God had given or put into the meat to furnish Elia by means thereof with necessary strength for that long and tedious journey] unto Horeb the mount of God[see Numbers 10 on verse 33.]
\p
\v 8 No text on verse.
\p
\v 9 . And he came thither into a cave and overnighter there and behold the word of the Lord came unto him and said unto him what doest thou here Elia?[Heb. what is there here Elia?]
\p
\v 10 . And he said I have been very zealous for the Lord [Heb. being zealous if have been zealous &c. understand by this zeal; an holy commission of the heart which a man hath when he perceiveth that the Lord’s name doctrine commandments and worship are rejected and persecuted and on the contrary idolatry and wickedness followed and maintained see the like examples Numbers 25.11 2Kings 10.16 Psalms 69.10 Job.2.17 ] the God of host [ see above chapter 18 on verse 15 below verse 14] for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant and broken down thine altars [understand by these the outward ceremonial worship instituted by God by the ministry of Moseh or here by may be understood such altars [understand by these the outward ceremonial worship instituted by God by the ministry of Moseh or here by may be understood such altars as had been extraordinarily built by some of the prophets through Gods instinct and inspiration]and slain thy prophet with the sword and I only am left and they seek my soul[that is life see Genesis 19 on verse 17] to take that away.
\p
\v 11 . And he [namely the Lord] and said go forth and stand upon this mount before the face of the lord behold the Lord passed by and a great strong wind renting mountain and breaking rocks in pieces before the Lord [the Lord appeared thus unto Elia to assure him of his present to instruct him concerning his divide properties and attributes and to strengthen him in his ministry that having vanquished and overcome the fear of man he might steadfastly persevere and go in his calling] but the Lord was not in the wind an earth quake the Lord was not also in the earth quake.
\p
\v 12 . And after the earth quake a fire and the Lord was not also in the fire [The Lord indeed is everywhere but not every manner of way he was not in the wind neither in the earth quake nor in the fire in respect of his divine speaking to Elia but only in respect of his discovery of certain divine attributes ]and after the fire a low noise of soft calm [to wit wherein there was not noise of a strong wind or violent earth quake or kindled fire.]
\p
\v 13 . And it came to pass when Elia heard that he wrapped his face [ Viz. through reverence and fear Exodus 36 thus and compare Genesis 16 the annotate on verse 13] in his manile [or upper garment see Jonah 3 on verse 6] and went forth and stood in the entering of the cave and behold a voice came unto him which said what doest thou here Elia ?[ Heb. what is thee here &c.]
\p
\v 14 .And he said I have been very zealous [Heb. being zealous I have been zealous so above verse 10] for the Lord the God of hosts for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant broken down thine altars and slay thy prophets with the sword and I am only am left and seek my soul to take that away.
\p
\v 15 . And the Lord said unto him go return unto thy ways to the wilderness of Damascus [see of this city Genesis 14 on verse 15] and enter into it and anoint Hazael to be king over Syria [how and when this was done we find not indeed Elisa foretold him that he should be king see 2Kings chapter 8 verse 12&c.]
\p
\v 16 . Moreover thou shalt anoint Jebu ten son of Nimsi to be king over Israel [this Elisa put in practice by one of the disciples of the prophets 2Kings 9.1,2&c.]and thou shalt anoint Elisa the son of Saaphat of Abelmehola[see of this city Judges 7 on verse 2] to be prophet in thy room [that is to perform the aforesaid things or others that as a prophet in my name.]
\p
\v 17 . And it shall come to pass that him that escapeth the soul of Hazael [to wit in the war against king Joram 2Kings 8.12,13,28 and 10.3,2 &13.3]shall Jebu slay[see hereof 2Kings 9.14&c.] and him that escapeth the sword of Jebu shall Elisa slay[to wit prophecies threatening curses &c. see an example 2Kings 2.24.]
\p
\v 18 . I have also caused seven thousand [that is very man see Leviticus 26 on verse 8] to be left in Israel [others I will cause seven thousand to be left in Israel all the knees that have not bowed themselves before Baal and all or every mouth that hath not kissed him [that is shewn no reverence no subjection whereof kissing was an outward token see Genesis 41 on verse 40 which the idolators to this day shew to their images and feigned duties see of the unlawful religious kissing Job 31.27 Hosiah 13.2.]
\p
\v 19 . So he departed from thence and found Elisa the son of Sephat the same ploughed with twelve yoke of oxen [this word is here inserted out of the following 21 verse ]before him and he was with the twelfth and Elia went over to him and cast him mantle see 2kings 1.8 Zachariah 13.4.]
\p
\v 20 . And he left the oxen and ran after Elia [compare Matthew 4.20,22] and said let me I pray kiss my father and mother [that is suffer me in ten civil way to take my leave on them see Genesis 29 on verse 11] then I will follow thee [Heb. go after thee] and he said unto him go return back for what have I done to thee?[that is consider what I did just now to thee for it was not done in vain that I cast my mantle upon thee and that God hath put an inclination into thee to obey thy call compare Matthew 8.22 Luke 9.62.]
\p
\v 21 . So he returned back from after him and took a yoke of oxen and slew them and boiled their flesh with the furniture of the oxen [understand the wood of the plough the yoak the harrow the shovel and other tools wherewith he had don e in husbandry of which he made a fire to boil the flesh wherewith ]which he gave unto the people and they did eat [by this he signified that he had left his former calling of tilling the ground taking as it were by this feast his leave to his friend and kindred] then he arose and followed after Elia and ministered unto him.

\s Benhadad besiegeth Samaria and his first demand is granted him verse 1 &c. the second his denied him 5 therefore he prepareth to storm the city 10 Achab maketh defence by a prophet counsel or promise and gotteth twice the victory 13 Benhadad is fain to hide himself 30 Achab maketh peace with him 33 a prophet that first suffereth himself to be smitten 35. reproveth Achab ,39.
\p
\v 1 And Benhadad the king of Syria [Heb. Aram that is Syria and so in the sequel see Genesis 10 on verse 22 and22 on verse 21] gathered all his strength together and two and thirty kings were with him [doubtless not so great kings as Benhadad was compare Genesis 14 the annotate on verse 1] and horses and charets and he marched up and besieged Samaria and warred against it.
\p
\v 2 . And he sent messenger to Achab king of Israel into the city.
\p
\v 3 . And he said unto him thus said Benhadad thine silver and thine gold that is mine besides thy wives and thy children they are mine [ that is belong to me as my own that is they send them to the forth with if thou wouldst have peace and have me desist from besieging thy city that is was his intent and meaning some do gather below from verse 5,6 although Achab seemeth to have interpreteth his words only of the sovereign and supremacy which he sought to have over him his wives his children and his estate by this siege as appeareth by verse 4,7,9.]
\p
\v 4 . And the king of Israel answered and said according to thy word my Lord the king I am thine [that is thy vassal acknowledging thee to be my sovereign &c.] and all that I have.
\p
\v 5 . then came the messengers again and said thus speaketh Behadad saying I sent indeed to thee saying thou shalt deliver me thy silver and thy gold and thy wives and thy children [as if he had said it is true as I sent word unto thee and thyself wast fain to acknowledge that all thy own belongs to me but it was to this end that thou shouldst have transmitted the same unto me forth with actually without delay which being not performed I shall tomorrow &c. as it followeth in the sixth verse.]
\p
\v 6 . But I will send tomorrow about this time my servants unto thee to search thine house and the houses of the servants some conceive that hereby aggraveteth his first demand perceiving the pullfilanimity of Achab by his answer mentioned above verse 4 for now he not only desireth Achabs but also his servant estate ]and it shall come to pass that they shall put into their hands all the desirable of thine eyes [that is whatsoever thou willingly seest with desire still to keep it by thee] and take it away.
\p
\v 7 . Then the king of Israel called all the eldest of the land [see Leviticus 4 on verse 15] and said consider I pray and see that this man seeketh evil [that I mine and my kingdoms ruine not being contempt with the reasonable terms that I have proferred him ]for he had sent to me for my wives and for my children and for my silver and for my Gold and I denied it not unto him [viz. in subjection of mine estate unto him as my sovereign and protector though not delivering up the propriety thereof.]
\p
\v 8 . But all the eldest and all the people said unto him hearken not unto him nor consent.
\p
\v 9 . Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad tell my Lord the king all that thou didst send me thy servant at the first I will do [which Achab understood of the sovereignty and supremacy in the civil jurisdiction and not of the propriety and use see above the annotate on verse 3] but this thing I cannot do so the messengers departed and brought him [viz. king Benhadad ] word again.
\p
\v 10 . And the king Benhadad sent unto him and said the Lord do so unto me and so add thereunto [see above chapter 19 on verse 2]if the dust of Samaria shall suffice the handful of all the people that follow my footsteps [Heb. that are at my feet see Exodus 11.8 and Judges 4.10 with the annotate the meaning is that he had so much people in his camp that was not dust enough in Samaria in every one of his man to take an handful of it.]
\p
\v 11 . But the king of Israel answered and said speak to him let not him that girdeth himself boast himself as he that loosneth himself [that is let not him that armeth himself for the battle carry himself before he hath gotten the victory as he that disarmes himself after he hath had the victory it is a proverb of this like sence when we say the song of triumph is not the sing before the victory.]
\p
\v 12 . And it came topass when he heard this word when he was drinking he and the kings in the tents that he said unto the servants lay on [that is your weapon and all the instruments of war to put yourselves in array to storm the city and to take it by force ] and they laid on against the city.
\p
\v 13 . And behold a prophet stepped to Achab the king of Israel and said thus saidth the lord hast thou seen all this great multitude behold I will deliver them this day unto thine hand that thou mayst know that I am the lord [so below verse 28 this is the end of all the mercies of God that he may be rightly acknowledged seriously thanked and faithfully served.]
\p
\v 14 .And Achab said; by whom? and; he said; thus saith the LORD; by the young men of the chief of the Provinces: [under stand by these the servants and pages of the prines of the Provinces, and tribes, or the young gentlemen son of Lords of the Land, that lived with the King, or foot-men, which were practised in armes] and he said who shall bind the battle ?[that is as some translate it order teh battle to set the battle in array or as others who shall begin the battle to wit we Israelites ? or shall we wait till the Syrians fall upon us? the like phrase is also 2Chronicles 13.3] and he said thou.
\p
\v 15 . Then he numbered the Lord of the governors of the countries and there were two hundred thirty and two and after them he numbered all the people all the children of Israel seven thousand.
\p
\v 16 . And they marched forth at noon now Benhadad drank himself drunk in the tents he and the kings and the two and thirty kings led him.
\p
\v 17 . And the lids of the governors of the country marched forth first but Benhadad sent forth so he and they told him saying they are men marched out of Samaria [the meaning is that he having understood by his guard that some men shewed themselves about the city sent to enquite what they were the report was that there were men march out of the city.]
\p
\v 18 . And he said whether they become in peace take them alive whether there also become out of the battle take them alive.
\p
\v 19 . So these lads of governors of countries marched out of the city and the hosts that followed them [Heb. that was after them.]
\p
\v 20 . And everyone slew his man [viz. everyone of the Israelites slew one of the Syrians that came to take the Israelites alive ] so that the Syrians fled and Israel pursued unto them but Benhadad the king of Syria escape on an horse with certain horsemen.
\p
\v 21 . And the king of Israel marched forth and smote the horses and charets so that he made a great slaughter among the Syrians.
\p
\v 22 . Then slept that prophet[ of whom mention is made above verse 13] the king of Israel said unto him go strengthen thyself and mark and see what thou shalt do [to wit not only by using human means but especial by obtaining the divine sustenance by true repentance ]for at the return of the year [that is at the coming of the summer when the camps are wont to take the field to enjoy the opportunity of food and victual so below verse 26 compare 2Samuel 11.1 1Chronicles 20.1 2Chronicles 26.10] the king of Syria will march up to thee.
\p
\v 23 . For the servants of the king of Syria said unto him [namely to their king] their Gods are Gods of the mountain[that is dwelling upon the mountains as they conceive that can only help their people there and not in the plain] ]therefore they were stronger than we but surely let us fight against them on the plain field if we had not stronger than they[add with all the conceal curse or judgement as let us perish or lose our honour or let us &c. to wit lets see or lay the wages others shall we not be stronger? so below verse 25 see Genesis 14 on verse 23 this was made known to the prophet either by some report that come to him the revelation of God whereof see the excellent example 2Kings 6.8.]
\p
\v 24 . Therefore do this thing remove the kings [viz. whose help he formerly had used above verse 1,16] every one out of his place [that is out of the command which he had in thine army ]and put land governors [that is Lord Lords and princes of thine own land which are better known to thee and will truster to thee] in their room.
\p
\v 25 . And thou number thee an army like that army which is fallen [that perished or was slain in battle see Genesis 14 on verse 10] of thine [Heb. or of out of thee that is which being in thy service were while slain by the Israelites see above on verse 20 and 21 ] and horses as those and charets and those charets and let us fight against them on the plain field if we be not stronger than they [ see above on verse 23] and he hearkened unto their voice and did so.
\p
\v 26 . Now it came to pass at the return of the year the Benhadad mustered the Syrians, and he marched up to Aphek, [A city lying in the tribe of Aser, which the Syrians in this expedition (as appears by the following 30 verse) seem to have gotten in their power. See of this city, Josh. 13.4 and 19.30. Judg. 1.31.] to war against Israel.
\p
\v 27 The children of Israel were also mustered, and were provided of victual [others were found in full number ]and marched to meet them and the children of Israel camped themselves over against them like two naked great of flocks of goats[to these the army of the Israelites divided in twain is compared to shew that there were not only in few numbers but also weak in the warlike preparation and armes in comparison of the Syrians ] but the Syrias filled the land.
\p
\v 28 . And the man of God [viz. the prophet of whom mention is made verse 13and22 on some other ]slept on and spake unto the king of Israel and said thus saith the Lord is a God of the mountains and he is not a God of the Low grounds therefore I will deliver all the great multitude in thine hand that ye may know that I am the Lord [see above on verse 13.]
\p
\v 29 . And these were camped over against those seven dates now it came to pass on the seventh day that the battle began and the children of the Israel smote on the Syrians an one hundred and foot men on one day.
\p
\v 30 . And the rest fled to Aphek into the city [see above on verse 26 it seemeth by this that the Syrians had taken this city] and the wall fell upon seven and twenty thousand men that were left Benhadad also fled and came into the city from chamber into chamber [so below chapter 22 on verse 25 the meaning is that Benhadad being much dismayed at his great defeat and being afraid of his own person fled from chamber into another not knowing where to hide himself others into a chamber inner chambers understand a secret withdrawing room or hidden place made in some chamber for safety.]
\p
\v 31 . Then said his servants unto him behold now weave heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings [Heb. kings of mercy or loving kindness [let us I pray put loins [they will signify by this token that they had deserved death and begged for mercy as with great sorrow and humility off the heart see Genesis 37 on verse 34[and ropes over heads [which malefactors also at this day are fain to have about their necks in token that they’re worthy of death ]and go forth to the king of Israel it may be he will save thy soul [that is person so in the sequel see above chapter 19 on verse 4] alive.
\p
\v 32 . Then they girded sacks about their loins and ropes about their heads and came to the king of Israel and said thy servant of Benhadad saith I pray thee let my soul live and he said is he then yet alive? he is my brother[that is to whom I am ready to shew kindness as to a brother.]
\p
\v 33 . Now the man did diligently observe and did hastily catch it to wit the king of Israel had called their king his brother came from an upright heart and whether he meant true brotherhood or whether his speech were only a deceitful feigning of the mouth ]and said thy brother Benhadad is alive and he said come bring him [Heb. take him that is take him and bring him see Genesis 12 on verse15]then Benhadad came forth to him and he caused him to come up unto charets.
\p
\v 34 . And he [viz. Benhadad said cities which my father took from thy father I will restore [ see of these cities above chapter 15 on verse 20] and make streets for thee in the Damascus as my father made in Samaria [by streets here understand market places out of Achab might gather some tributes or places of judicature in which the supreme judgments should belong to him or certain conquite-port and fronter towns in the country that should be in his power and I answered Achab will let thee go with this covenant so be made a covenant go with him and let him go.
\p
\v 35 . Then a certain man of the sons of prophets [which were young men instructed by the true doctrine of the prophets in the true doctrine directed to the true religion and exhortation to the uprightness of life they had their colledges wherein the prophet whereas their fathers 2Kings 2.12 and they as their children as are likewise so called here and 1Samuel 10.12 2Kings 2.3,5 & Isaiah 8.18 compare Judges 17 on verse 10]said unto his neighbour by the word of the Lord [that is by Gods command which he acquainted this his neighbour with ] smite me I pray thee [the word smiting signifying here not slaying r killing as it doth in the following verse but smiting or beating with the first stick rope &c. so as death following thereupon as Exodus 21.15,18 Proverbs 23.13 and below verse37]and the man refused to smite him [wherein did ill seeing he understood that it was command of God.]
\p
\v 36 . And he said unto him because thou hast not been obedient to the voice of the voice of the God behold when thou shalt be departed from me then a lion shall smite [that is kill slay so Genesis 32.11 Levites 24.21 and above verse 20&c. &c. Genesis 8 on verse 21] thee and when he was departed from him then a lion found him smote him.
\p
\v 37 . After that he found another man and said smite me I pray thee and that man smote him smiting wounding [that is he smote a long while together and very much so that he hurt and wounded him.]
\p
\v 38 . Then the prophet departed and stood before the king on the way and distinguished himself with ashes [others with a scarf or covering the Hebrew word rendered here distinguished signifieth properly to change oneself so as not to be known which this prophet did by strewing ashes upon his face or as others translate it by putting a covering upon his eyes below chapter 22 on verse 30 it signifieth to change and disguise a mans self by changing his apparel compare above chapter 14 verse2.]
\p
\v 39 . And it came to when the king passed by that he cried to the king [as having some matter to tell him] and said thy servant was gone forth into the mids of the battle and behold a man turned aside and brought a man aside unto me [meaning a prisoner to keep him that he should not run away ]and said keep this man if any wise he be missed then shall thy soul in the room of his soul [that is thy life be of his life that is thou shalt die for him so below verse 42 item Exodus 21.2,3] or thou shalt weigh [that is pay ] a talent of silver [see of the value hereof and above chapter 16 on verse 24.]
\p
\v 40 . Now it came to pass when thy servant was busy here & there that he [to wit the captive or prisoner ] was not there then said the king of Israel unto him so is thy judgment [that is such is thy own judgement understand teh judgment or sentence of condemnation whereby a man is pronounced guilty and worthy of punishment so is the word judging also taken Luke 19.22 John 12.48 1Corinthians 6.2] thou hast past it thy self [the meaning is thou bringest thy own edict or sentence along with thee seeing thou didst undertake keepest with thee seeing thou didst undertake to keep the man upon the terms by thee already related.]
\p
\v 41 . Then he made haste and took the ashes away from his eyes [see above verse 38and the annotate thereon] and the king of Israel knew him that he was one of the prophets.
\p
\v 42 . And he said unto him thus said the Lord because thou hast let go thine hand the name [namely Benhadad ]whom I banned that is whom I have to be slain and utterly destroyed see Deuteronomy 2 on verse 34] therefore thy soul shall be in the room of his soul thy people in the room of his people.
\p
\v 43 . And the king of Israel went away displeased [that is peevish discontented fretful] and angry to his house and came to Samaria.
\c 21
\s Achab converteth to buy Naboth vineyard verse 1&c. whereunto Naboth refuseth to yield 3 Izebel promiseth to deliver the same to Achab 7 she causeth Naboth tube stoned 8 Achab taketh possession of the vineyard 15 here upon is foretold by Elia the ruine both of him and of those that belong unto him 17 which is in regard Achab maketh some outward shew of sorrow and repentance 27 is delayed, 29.
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass after these things for as much as Naboth a Jizreelite [see of this cit above chapter 18 on verse 45] hard by the palace of Achab king of Samaria.
\p
\v 2 . That Achab spake unto Naboth saying give me thine vineyard that it may unto me fore garden of herbs [or garden of green things a garden of verdure or the green things the Hebrew word signifiet all kind of green herbs especially that which is sewen and used for food compare Deuteronomy 11.10] because it is neer unto mine house and I will give thee a vineyard for that is better than it or if it be good in thine eyes [see of this phrase Genesis 9 on verse 8 instead whereof ye have below verse 6 if it pleased thee ] I will give thee the worth it in money.
\p
\v 3 . But Naboth said unto Achab the Lord let that be far from me that I should give thee the inheritance of my fathers [Heb. be that far unto me because of or for the Lord &c. the reason of this refusal was because God in his law was forbidden to altar or alienate the property of inheritance belonging to tribe and families Leviticus 25.23 Numbers 36.7&c.]
\p
\v 4 . Then Achab came into his house displeasing [so below verse 5 see above chapter 20 on verse 43] and angry at the words which Naboth the Jizreelite had spoken to him spoken to him and said I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers about [to wit towards the wall from men not desiring to speaking to any man or to have any thing to do with any man] and did eat no bread [that is no meat see Genesis 3 on verse 19and so in the sequel.]
\p
\v 5 . But Izebel his wife came to him and spake unto him what is this that thy spirit is thus forward and that thou eatest no bread?
\p
\v 6 . And he said unto her because I spake unto Naboth the Jizreelite and said unto him give me thine vineyard for money or if so it please thee I will give thee a vineyard in stead thereof but he said I will not give thee the vineyard.
\p
\v 7 . Then said Izebel his wife unto him shouldst thou now govern [Heb. do that is govern administer manage] the kingdom over Israel ?[the meaning is that he was not worthy to be king over Israel ? [the meaning is that he was not worthy to be king over Israel if he had not so much understand ding nor courage as to compel one Naboth and to get his vineyard away from him]arise eat bread and let thine heart be cheerful [Heb. good that is cheerful see good for cheerful Judges 16.25 & 18.20 1Samuel 25. 8 and 36]I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jizrelite.
\p
\v 8 . Then she wrote letters in achabs name and she sealed them with signet and sent the letter to the eldest [that is magistrate or counsel and governors of the city so Deuteronomy 21.2 Judges 8.14 Ruth 4.2 ]and to the noble [the Hebrew word properly signifieth white and whereby must be understood by the noble chiefest and most honourable man because they are commonly went clothed in white see Genesis 41 the annotate on verse 42 item Esther 8.15 and below verse 11] that were in the city [so below verse 11 understand Jizreel which is called Naboths city as he himself is also called a Jizreelite above verse 17 because he dwelt therein or perhaps was also born therein see the like phrase Genesis 23.10 and 24.10 an the annotate thereon ]dwelling with Jabot [that is which were his fellow citizens.]
\p
\v 9 . And she wrote in those letters saying proclaim fast[ she gives this in charge that they might take notice of the life and conversation of Jabot for fast were kept as for other reasons so also for this namely to make enquiry concerning some gross sins that were public and notorious and to punish them according to the desert to the end that so the wrath of God might be turned away from all the congregation ]and set naboth in the highest place of the people [Heb. in the head of the people so below verse 12understand hereby an exalted place of the congregation into which the parties accused were put that there might be better be seen and heard of the people or understand hereby an high and stately seat in which the chiefest of the city among whom its conceived that Jabot was one were wont to fit and that Jabot was to sit there in the usual place to take away all suspition of evil that was intended and plotted against him.]
\p
\v 10 . And set over against him two men sons of Belial [understand by these wicked vicious men that having cast off the yoke of Gods fear and of humane honesty are only bent to do mischief without remorse of conscience at all see Deuteronomy 13 on verse 13] to bear witness against him saying thou hast blessed [to bless here signifieth to curse this was held to be a thing of abominable that is durst scarcely he named so that he stirded thereof the contrary was affirmed in a coverted way so below verse 13 and Job 1verse 5,11 and 2.9] God and the king and carry him out [to wit out of the city for heretofore it was a custom for malefactors to be punished without the cities and places of abode or dwelling as being unworthy to give up the God among the usual society of men see Leviticus 24.14,23 and Joshua 7.24 Mark15.20]and stone him that he may die [as the law concerning blasphemy and cursing given by Moseh required Leviticus 24.15,16 &c.]
\p
\v 11 . And the men of his city[see above on verse 8] those eldest and those noble [see above on verse 8] that dwelt in his city did according as Izebel had sent [that is had signifieth by letters ]unto them according as was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.
\p
\v 12 . They proclaimed a fast and they set Jabot in the highest place of the people [see above on verse 9.]
\p
\v 13 . Then came two men sons of Belial[see above on verse 10] and set themselves over against him the men of Belial witnessed against him against Jabot of the people both before the people saying Jabot hath blessed [see above on verse 10 ] God and the king they carried him out of the city and stoned him with stones that he died.
\p
\v 14 . Then they sent to Izebel saying Jabot is stoned and is dead.
\p
\v 15 . Now it came to pass when Izebel heard that Jabot was stoned to death that Izebel said unto Achab arise and possess the vineyard of Jabot the Jizreelite hereditarily it seemeth by this that Jabot estate was forefeited to the king his son being also put to death 2Kings 9.26. and that under a false pretence of religion as if they herein intended to follow example of Gods judgement so exalted in this time past upon Datham and Abiram Numbers 16.32 and then Achan Joshua on verse 24,25 so that also their children were not spared and so did these judges perversely follow these examples of Gods extraordinary vengeance which is in a manner hidden from us but not righteous and not the ordinary appointed to live by the which forbiddeth to punish the children of the parents offence Deuteronomy 24.16]which he refused to give thee for money for Jabot is not alive but is dead.
\p
\v 16 . And it came to pass when Achab heard that Jabot is dead that Achab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Jabot the Jizreelite to possess the same hereditarily.
\p
\v 17 . But the word of the Lord came unto Elia the Tisbite [see above chapter 17 on verse 1] saying:
\p
\v 18 . Get thee up go down to meet Achab the king of Israel who is in Samaria [understand where Achab dwelt and where he was in person at that time when God uttered these words unto Elia but was upon going down to Naboths vineyard where Elia should meet him in which respect is said in the following words that Achab was in the vineyard because he would be there because Elias should come to Jizreel ]behold he is in the vineyard of Jabot wither he is gone down to possess that hereditarily.
\p
\v 19 . And thou shalt speak to him saying thus saith the Lord hast thou killed and also taken an hereditary possession ?[Elia is charged to put this question not tomake enquiry into Achab sin as into a fact that was unknown but to reprove Achab for it and toehold before him the righteous vengeance of God because he had not only killed Jabot but also taken the inheritance of Naboths heir to himself against the law of God ]moreover thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saying thus saith the Lord instead that the dogs have licked the blood of Jabot the dogs shall lick thine blood yea thine [that is that the dogs or according as the dogs have licked the blood of Jabot shall the dogs also lick so is the Hebrew word taken Zacharia 2.10 others understand this of the same place not in particular of the field without Jizreel but in general of the land of Israel for Jizreel without which city Jabot blood was shed lay in the tribe of Issachar and Samaria where the dogs licked the blood of Achab below chapter 22.38 lay in the tribe of Ephraim or if it be taken for the same field then see the accomplishment of Achabs son 2Kings chapter 9.26.]
\p
\v 20 . And Achab said unto Elia; half thou found me, o mine enemy? [this is as much if he had said, Art thou so bold that thou darest come into my sight? oughtest thou not to keep away from me seeing thou mayest well perceive that I hate thee because thou never leavest threatening me and dealing with me like an enemy ] and he said I have found thee because thou hast sold thyself to do that which is evil in the eyes of the Lord [that is haste given thyself over the slavery of sin for as he that selleth himself to another is contended to follow his will and command in all things so is he said to sell himself to do evil that giveth himself over unto sin to obey it in all things this phrase is also used 2Kings 17.17Isaiah 51.1.]
\p
\v 21 . Behold I will bring evil upon thee and take away the posterity and I will cut off from Achab him that that seth against the wall[see above chapter 14.10] together with him that is shut up left in Israel [see Deuteronomy 32 on verse 36.]
\p
\v 22 . And I will make thine house like the house of Jerobeam the son of Nebat and like that house of Baesa the son of Abia for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me and that thou hast made Israel to sin.
\p
\v 23 . Furthermore also concerning Izebel the Lord spake saying the dogs shall eat Izebel by the out wall of Jizreel [see the accomplishment 2kings 9.33,34,&c.]
\p
\v 24 . Him that died of Achab into the city the dogs shall eat and him that dieth into the field the fowls of heaven shall eat [see above chapter 14 on verse 11.]
\p
\v 25 . But there had been none like Achab that had sold himself to do evil in the eyes of the Lord [see above on verse 20 & chapter 11on verse 6] because Izebel his wife stirred him up.
\p
\v 26 . And he did every abominable walking after the dung dogs [see Leviticus 26 on verse 30]according to all that the Amorites [understand one kind of Canaanites likewise al the rest see Genesis 15 on verse 16 & 48 on verse 22] had done which God had driven out of possession before the children of Israel.
\p
\v 27 . Now it came to pass when Achab heard these words that he rent his clothes [see Genesis 37 on verse 29] and put a sack about his flesh [see Genesis 37 on verse 34] and fasted he lay also down [to wit to sleep ] in the sack and went slowly [or softly creeping lamely an example of only outward and temporal repentance which proceeded not from a heart which is purified and truly converted before it appeared on chapter 24.8.]
\p
\v 28 . And the word of the Lord came unto Elia the Tisbite saying :
\p
\v 29 . Hast thou seen that achab bambleth himself before my face I will not bring that evil in his days [an example of Gods goodness in deferring the deserved punishments because of some feigned humiliation ] in his sons days I will bring that evil upon his house.

\s Achab intending to make war against the Syrians verse 1&c. is advised by Josphat first to ask counsel of God by his prophests 5 Achabs prophet advise him to it 6 especially Zedekiah 11 Micah a prophet of the Lord dissuaded it 13 is smitten for it by Zedekia 24 and put in prison by Achab 26 Achab goeth forth to battle is shot and dieth 29 and the dogs lick his blood 38 Josphats reign over Judah 41 Ahazia the son of Achab reigneth in his fathers stead. 52.
\p
\v 1 And they [namely the Syrians and the Israelites between whom there had been war in time past see above chapter 20] sat still three years [ these years are to be counted from the second overthrow which the Syrians received in the war against the Israelites of which see above chapter 20 on verse 29&c.] so that there was no war between Syria and between Israel.
\p
\v 2 . But it came to pass in the third year when Josphat the king of Judah was come down to the king of Israel ?[Namely Achab with whom he not only was at peace below verse 45 but also had entered into the affirnity by the marriage of joram his son and Athalia the daughter of Achab 2Kings 8.18 & 2Chronicles 8.1.]
\p
\v 3 . That the king of Israel said unto his servants [see Genesis 20 on verse 8] know ye that Rammoth in Gilead [see of this city Deuteronomy 4.43and above chapter 4.13] is ours? [for the city belonged to the land of the Israelites had promised to restore the same above chapter 10.34] and we be still [Heb. are silent or hold our peace but the Hebrew word signifieth omission not only of speaking but also of doing anything as Exodus 14.14Judges 18.9 Isaiah 64.12] without taking the same out of the hand of king of Syria.
\p
\v 4 . Then he said unto Josphat wilt thou go with me into the battle to Rammoth in Gilead? and Josphat said unto the king of Israel i will be so as thou art my people so as thy people my horses so as thy horses[ Heb. as I so thou as my people so thou people as my horses so thy horses so 2Kings 3.7 and 2Chronicles 8.3 that is I will march forth with thee into the battle and be so trusty that thou mayst rely upon my person as upon thine own upon my people as upon thy people &c.]
\p
\v 5 . Moreover Josaphat saying unto the king of Israel inquire I pray as today after the word of the Lord [tat is inquire by some prophet of the Lord whether it be also his will that we should undertake this war and he will give us success and victory therein.
\p
\v 6 . Then the king of Israel gathered the prophet together [it seemeth that these were the four hundred prophets of the idolatrous grove of whom mention is made above chapter 18.19 and who appeared not before Elia upon mount carmel with the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal see in the same chapter the annotate on verse 22] about four hundred men and he said unto them shall I go against Rammoth in Gilead to battle or shall I for bear ? and they said go up for the Lord shall deliver it into the hands of the king.
\p
\v 7 . But Josaphat said is there not here a prophet yet of the Lord [understand besides these four hundred prophets of whom king Josaphat began to have suspicion or besides many other prophets that formerly had been in Israel] that we might enquire of him.
\p
\v 8 . Then said the king of Israel unto Josphat there is yet one men by whom to enquire of the Lord [observe that these idolators will yet to know the true the true God aright and to seek to obey him ] but I hate him because he doth not prophesy good upon me [ that is that which is pleasing and acceptable unto me see above chapter 1 on verse 42]but evil Micah surnamed the Marasthite being born in the city of Morasah Micah 1.1 which lived in the times of Jothaam, Ahaz, and Hizkia, Kings of Juda] the son of Jimla: and Josaphat said, Let not the King say so. [i.e. let him not hate the person for the words sake, nor despise the word for the persons sake.]
\p
\v 9 .Then the King Israel called a Groom of the Chamber, [The Hebrew word signifieth generally a Courtier, Court-Gentleman, Court-Officers. See Genes.37.on vers.36.] and said; Fetch hastily Micha, the son of Jimla.
\p
\v 10 . Now the King of Israel, and Josaphat the King of Juda, sat each on his throne clothed with (their) robes [To wit, with special Royal Robes, in which they shewed their majesty, state, and glory. Oth. having on (their) armour] on the plain, [understand an even, unbuilt, and empty void place: see Gen.50.on ver.10. Such are conceived to have been in former times before the gates of the City for Market-places, or wide spacious places, there to put a number of souldiers in battle-aray, when they feared the in rode of enemies] at the door of the gate of Samaria: and all the Prophets [understand of whom is spoken above ver.6.as also below ver.12.] prophesied in their presence.
\p
\v 11 . And Zedekia [One of the fore-mentioned Prophets, who is to be distinguished from another false prophet of this name, the son of Maaseja, Jerem 29 21.] the son of Canaan had made himself iron horn; [To set, forth, or shew forth his prophecy by it, as by a token, and then to explain it by word of mouth, as Prophets frequently used to do] and he said; Thus saith the LORD; [he pretendeth the Name Jehovah, to wit, the Name of the onely true God, and not the names of his Idols; as also below ver.12,24 not onely to make his Prophecy the more acceptable before King Josaphat, but also to testify before every one, that their whole Religion, Worship, and prophesying, was as it were directed thither, and aimed threat, viz. to perform honour and service to the God of that name. Compare Exod.32.4 5. Judg.17.3. 1 Kings 12.28.] with these thou shalt push the Syrians, until thou shalt have utterly consumed them. [the meaning is, that he should easily vanquish, and destroy them. For as the horned beast easily shall overthrow the others that have no horns; so it would not be difficult for him to vanquish and subdue the Syrians, that were much weaker then he.]
\p
\v 12 . And all the Prophesied so, saying: Go up to Ramoth in Gilead, and thou shalt be prosperous; [Heb. Be prosperous: so below v.15. Compare Psal.37.on vers.3. and Prov.3.on ver.25.] for the LORD shall deliver it into the Kings hand.
\p
\v 13 . Now the messenger that was gone to call Micha, spake unto him saying; Behold now, the words of the Prophets are out of one mouth [Heb. one mouth, or, with one mouth] good unto the King; Let thy word, I pray, he according as the word of one of them, and speak (that which is) good. [i.e. the Victory over the Syrians, and the subduing of Ramoth in Gilead. Compare above v.8.and the annotate. and below v.18.]
\p
\v 14 . But Micha said; (As true as) the LORD liveth, that which the LORD shall say unto me, that will I speak.
\p
\v 15 . When he was come to the King, then the King said unto him; Micha, shall we go to Ramoth in Gilead to battle, or shall we for bear (it)? And he said unto him; deliver it into the Kings hand. [The Prophet doth not speak this in good earnest, but as it were mocking at the answer, and foretelling of the false prophets, whose words he therefore likewise useth, as they are related above verse 12. (for the Lord had revealed them unto him). ThereforeAchab perceiving by his phrase, countenance, and gestures, that he meant not in earnest what he said chargeth him in the following verse, to give a serious answer: it was therefore a command or counsel ironically. Compare Judg.10.14. Eccles.11.9. Ezek.20.39. Amos 4 4,5. Matth.23.32.]
\p
\v 16 . And the King said unto him; for how many times shall I adjure thee, that thou tell me nothing, but onely the truth, in the Name of the LORD? [i.e. By the command and inspiration of the LORD. See 2 King.2. on verse 24.]
\p
\v 17 . And he said; I saw [To wit, in a Prophetical Vision, which happened to my spirit. See of these Visions, Gen.15.on v.1.] all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no sherperd: and the LORD said; These have no Lord; [oth. these shall have no Lord] every man return to his house in peace. [in this Vision three things were revealed to him: First, That the Israelites should get no Victory, but should flee before the Syrians. Secondly, that Achab should perish and die. Thirdly, that the people should not perish at this time in battle, but should return home to their houses]
\p
\v 18 . Then said the King of Israel unto Josaphar; Did I not tell thee (that) he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil? [See above v.8.]
\p
\v 19 . Furthermore, he [Namely the Prophet Micha] said; Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD [viz. not in his essence, but in the tokens of his manifestation, which were shewed unto the Prophets, sometimes corporally to the eyes of the body, sometimes onely spiritually to the understand: see Genes.32.on v.30. and Numb.12.on v.3.] sitting on his throne, and all the heavenly host [understand the Angels, or heavenly spirits: see Gen.2. on v.1. and above chap.18.on v.15. and compare Psal.103.21. and 148.2. Isa. 45.12.] standing by him at his right hand, and at his left. [God is thus represented to us by resemblance of an Earthly Monarch, who being compassed about with many Ministers and Attendants, sitteth down to judge. The end is, to instruct us concerning the glory of his Majesty, the wisdom of his Government, and the righteousness of his judgement, and the omnipotency of his Works.]
\p
\v 20 . And the LORD said; Who shall persuade Achab, that he may go up, and fall at Ramoth in Gilead? Now the one said, thus; and the other said, so. [Heb. This said in, or, with, so; and this said in, or, with so; that is, the one said, on this manner, and the other said, on that manner.]
\p
\v 21 . Then a spirit came forth, and stood before the face of the LORD, and said, I will persuade him. [This was one evil spirits, which God, according to his infinite wisdom, knoweth to use, without being defiled by their evil practise, not onely to try his children, Job 1.12. and 2.6. and to humble them, 2 Cor.12.7. but also to punish, and destroy the wicked , as appeareth here, and 1 Sam.16.14. & 2 Thes.2.9,10,11.] and the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?
\p
\v 22 . And he said; I will go forth, and he a Lying Spirit [Heb. a spirit of falsehood, or, of lies: so in the following verse; that is, that produceth untruths, and lies, and maketh others to believe the same. Compare Joh.8.44. Rev.12.9.] in the mouth of all his Prophets: [to wit, Achabs Prophets: meaning of those that were addicted to, & soothed him up in his Idolatry] And he said; Thou shalt persuade, and shalt prevail also: [that is, thy Lies shall have power to deceive the false Prophets, and by them Achab. Compare 2 Thes.2.11.] go forth, and do so. [God is said to command the reasonable creatures to do evil, when he useth them to execute his holy intent by it; which he doth not by infusing any sin into them, or commanding it them by the word, but by not onely not hindering their own wickedness, but also by ordering, ruling, and directing the same, without their knowledge and will, according to his infinite wisdom, to an holy end, agreeing with his goosness and mercy to those that are saved, and justice toward that perish. Compare 1 Sam.16.10.]
\p
\v 23 . Now then, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy Prophets: and the LORD hath spoken evil [Meaning the evil of punishment. See Gen.19.on v.19.] over thee.
\p
\v 24 . Then step forth Zedekia [See above on vers.11.] the son of Onaana, and smote Micha on the Cheek: [a clear proof of hatred and contempt: see Job 16.10. Psal. 3.8. Jer.20.2. Mark 14 65. Acts 23.2. 2 Cor.12.7.] and said; Which (way) went the spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?
\p
\v 25 . And Micha said; Behold, thou shalt see it [i.e. Find, and perceive that the Spirit of God hath not spoken by thee, but by me. Seeing, is often taken for finding, or perceiving; as Gen.26.28. Mat.2.16. Rom.7.23.] in that day, when thou shalt go (from) chamber into chamber, [see above chap.20.on ver.30.] to hide thy self.[viz. fearing to be taken prisoner, and to be punished, because thou shalt by thy false prophecy have been the cause of the Kings death.]
\p
\v 26 . Now the King of Israel said [Namely to one of his servants;] Take Micha, and carry him back unto Amon, the Governor of the City, and to Joas the Kings son.
\p
\v 27 . And thou shalt say, thus saith the King: Put this (fellow) in the prison, [Heb. the house of compulsion, or restraint, shatting up: so 2 King.17.4. & 25.27. Isa.42.7. Jer.37.15.] and feed him with bread of affliction, [i.e. which they are wont to give the afflicted and captives: or, that which being given very sparingly, not for delight, but onely for necessary sustentation of the body, and is eaten in trouble, grief, and anguish of spirit. Hence also, the bread and drink of tears of sorrow, and of affliction, or, adversity, is taken for the estate and condition of misery and distress it self, Psal.80.6. and 127.2. Isa.30.20.] and with the water of affliction, [add withal, drench him] until I come (again) [this word is here inserted out of the following verse; and out of 2 Chron.18.v.26.] in peace. [i.e. with Victory over my Enemies, with subduing of the City, and with prosperity of mine own person.]
\p
\v 28 . And Micha said, If thou return at all [Heb. returning return] in peace, then the LORD hath not spoken by me: [Compare Numb.16.29.] moreover, he said; Hearken ye people all together. [Heb. hearken ye people they all. So Mich.1.2, etc. or, hear, (O) people all these things. He calleth them all to bear witness, as well to his prophecy, as to that which he now at last had answered the King.]
\p
\v 29 . So the King of Israel, and Josaphat the King of Juda, went up to Ramoth in Gilead.
\p
\v 30 . And the King of Israel said unto Josaphat, When I have disguised my self, [i.e. Changed mine apparel, that I may not shew who I am, to the end I may not be known: see above Chap.20.on v.38. for he was afraid of death, which was foretold him by Micha, although he would seem to dispise his words] I will enter into the battle, but thou put on thy clothes: [see above on ver.10.] So the King of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
\p
\v 31 . Now the Kings of Syria had commanded the charets, of which he had thirty and two [viz. Chief Commanders] saying; Ye shall fight neither with small, nor with great, [that is, neither with the meanest, nor with chiesfest among the souldiers. Thus by the words of Great and small, are meant in Scripture all sorts of men, both old and young, high and low, rich and poor, &c. Gen.19.11. Esth.1.5. Jer.16.6.] but onely with the King of Israel.
\p
\v 32 . It came to pass then, when the Commanders of the Charets saw Josaphat, that they said, Surely that man is the King of Israel: and they turned themselves toward him, [To wit, so dividing themselves one from another, and spreading themselves abroad, that they compassed King Josaphat round about: see 2 Chron.18.31.] to fight: but Josaphat came out. [to wit, unto the Lord, praying for his present assistance, the which he also obtained: see 2 Chron.18.31.]
\p
\v 33 . And it came to pass when the Commanders of the Charets saw that he was not the King of Israel, that they turned away from after him. [i.e. From pursuing him.]
\p
\v 34 . Then a (certain) man bent a bow [Heb. drew with the bow] in his simplicity, [i.e. Without having any with the bow] in his simplicity, [i.e. Without having any intent or thought, to hit King Achab with his shot. The Hebrew word is likewise so taken, 2 Sam.15.11. 2 Chron.18.33.] and shot [Heb. smote: see Gen.18.on v.21.] between the bucklers of his Coat of Mail: then he [namely King Achab] said unto his Charet-diver; Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the Camp, for I am sore wounded. [Heb. grown sick, or, weakened.]
\p
\v 35 . And the battle increased that day, and the King [Namely of Israel, 2 Chron.18.34.] was stayed up with the charet, [or, in the charet] over against the Syrians: [to wit, to keep the camp together by means of his presence, which seemed to be inclined to run away, and to hinder the discomfiture thereof, compare 2 Chron.18.34.] but he died at even, and the blood of the wound ran into the Charet-box. [Heb. into the box, or, bosom of the charets.]
\p
\v 36 . And there went a proclamation [or, (the voice) of a Proclamation, or, (the man) of a Proclamation, that is, man that made Proclamation, who was wont to be called the Herauld] throughout the host, when the Sun went down, saying; Every man (turn) to his city, and every man to his (own) land.
\p
\v 37 . SO the King died, and was carried [Hebr. came: to wit, being carried dead in his charet] to Samaria.
\p
\v 38 . Now when they washed the charet in the pool of Samaria, the dogs licked his blood, where the harlots washed; [oth. when they washed the armour, or, and they washed the armour,] according to the word of the LORD which he had spoken. [see above 1 Kings 21.19.]
\p
\v 39 . Now the rest of the acts of Achab, and all that he did, and the Ivory house [Heb. the house of the tooth, that is, of Elephants teeth, see above ch.10.on v.18.] that he built, and all the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the King of Israel? [see above chap.14.on v.19. Item, compare chap.16. the annotate. on v.20.]
\p
\v 40 . So Achab fell asleep with his father; and Ahazia his son became King in his stead.
\p
\v 41 . Now Josaphat the son of Asa became King over Juda, in the fourth year of Achab King of Israel. [See 2 Chron.20.31.]
\p
\v 42 . Josaphat was five and thirty years old [Heb. a son of five and thirty years,] when he became King, and reigned five and twenty years at Jerusalem. [The years in which Joram his son had some government of the Kingdom being herein comprised, beginning in the seventh year of his Fathers reign: when his Father joined with Achab in the war against the Syrians. For the Kings going in danger, are wont to secure the stare of the land, by declaring who should be their Successour. Compare 2 Kings 1.17. & 8.16. and the annotations] and his mothers name was Azaba, the daughter of Silchi.
\p
\v 43 . And he walked in all the way of Asa his father, [See above chap.15.on v.26.] he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD.
\p
\v 44 . Nevertheless the high places [See Lev.26.on verse 30.] were not taken away: the people offered, and burnt incense yet on the high places.
\p
\v 45 . And Josaphat made peace with the King of Israel. [Namely with Achab, and his son, above ver.4. and 2 King.3.7. for which he is reproved by the Prophet Je, 2 Chron.19.2.]
\p
\v 46 . Now the rest of the acts of Josaphat, and his might, that he shewed, and how hw warred, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Juda? [See above chap.14.on v.29.]
\p
\v 47 . Also the remnant of the buggerers, [Compare above chap.15.12. and the annotate. thereon] that remained in the days of his father Asa, he removed out of the land.
\p
\v 48 . There was then no King in Edom, [Which had been so from Davids time. Compare 2 Sam.8.14.] (but) a Kings Deputy. [or, Commissioner. Understand one appointed by the King of Juda, to govern in his name.]
\p
\v 49 . (And) Josaphat made ships [Or, had ten ships] of Teriffs, [see above chap.10.on ver.22. oth. ships (to go to) Tariffs. See 2 Chron.20.36,37.] to go to Ophir, [see above chap.9. on.ver.28.] for gold; but they went not: for the ships were broken at Ezim Geber. [see above chap.9.on v.26.]
\p
\v 50 . Then said Ahazia, the son of Achab, was Josaphat; Let my servants sail with thy servants in the ships; but Josaphat would not. [To wit, after that he was reproved by the Prophet, and had suffered damage. See 2 Chron.20.35,36,37.]
\p
\v 51 . And Josaphat fell asleep with his Fathers, and was buried by his Fathers in the city of David his Father, and Joram his son became King in his stead.
\p
\v 52 . Aharzia the son of Achab became King over Israel at Samaria, in the seventh year of Josaphat the King of Juda, and reigned two years over Israel. [But not compleat: for the first year he reigned jointly with his Father Achab, and the second with his son Joram.]
\p
\v 53 . And did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD; for he walked in the way of his Father, [See above chap.15on v.26.] and in the way of his Mother, and in the way of Jerobeam the son of Nebat, that made Israel to sin.
\p
\v 54 . And he served Baal, [See Judg.2.on ver.11.] and bowed himself before him, and provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger, according to all that his father had done.
